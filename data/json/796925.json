We have to buy it at the convenience store. Never seen that before. (Just the Platinum had facial tissues) Also we encountered a real problem with the reservation at the different restaurants... Since we were a party of 26 people, they could take only 6 or 8 or 12 ... and never the evening we wanted... even if we had reserved in advance. We were there for a wedding. Everything went smooth for this event but the bride and groom had a different story about that. (the whole complicated never ending preparation) We had also a Maya wedding in a secret place that had nothing to do with the hotel. This was wonderful. Conclusion: this hotel is too big. The distance between the lobby and the beach is 15 minutes. The bottom of the sea is almost unwalkable because of the coral. Just in front of the hotel, there is a sewage smell very unpleasant. And the beach is full of no swimmers...of course. The pools are crowded. I agree with Lutoliv (a reviewer) completely. Fortunately for us, since we were a nice group of friends altogether, we could have a great time, but many hotels less expensive could have provide us the same thing.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cHuge but immaculate resort, spoiled by poor beach\u201d", "Author": "luvtoliv", "ReviewID": "UR126239152", "Content": "We stayed in the Grand Riviera Princess Platinum suites in January 2012. The hotel and grounds were immaculate, certainly the cleanest resort we have every stayed in. I have never seen so many staff busy cleaning and maintaining a hotel and the maids kept our room spotless. Our Platinum room was adequate, nothing special. We had two maintenance issues, both of which were dealt with immediately with a phone call to the excellent Platinum concierge: one was the musty air conditioning smell that many other people have complained about in this forum - this was promptly dealt with by the maintenance staff but I question why, as they are obviously aware of the problem and how to deal with it, they don't have a routine maintenance schedule to prevent it arising. We found the Platinum concierge to be extremely helpful and efficient, though were disappointed that the promised Platinum Lounge services like the DVD library consisted of a couple of very old Disney movies for kids and that the \"International Newspapers daily\" were a single copy of USA Today: the \"Pillow Menu\" did not exist. We were surprised that there was no check on who was using the Platinum Lounge and it was sometimes impossible to use the toilets due to long line-ups of non-Platinum guests from the beach using the Platinum facilites - this was also very evident when there was bad weather when lounge was packed out with non-Platinum people leaving no room for legitimate users. This hotel is huge, the Riviera and Sunset halves essentially make up one enormous hotel with the main entertainment and reception areas situated 10 minutes walk from the Platinum suites, which are close to the beach: there is a shuttle that runs from the Platinum Building every 15 minutes or so and we didn't find this a great problem, though I can see how it might be for those people with rooms \"en route\" as the shuttle was often full from the terminus at busy times. Because of its size, we found the hotel very impersonal, we seldom saw the same staff or people we met twice due to the enormity of the site. We liked all the speciality restaurants, which were efficently booked for us by the Platinum concierge on our arrival. Buffets were adequate, though it is best to arrive early in the service as we found a lot of food somewhat sad and dried up later . We were impressed by the serving staff in the Platinum buffet who were pleasant and efficient, less so by the staff in the two buffets at the front of the resort. Nightly entertainment was mediocre and disappointing, after the first couple of nights we decided it was not for us. The Platinum Pool area was very small and it was impossible to to get sunbeds there unless you got up at the crack of dawn to reserve them: this was also the case on the front lines of the beach, where we talked to one lady who was travelling alone and came down to the beach each morning and reserved 5 loungers in the prime beachfront line as \"she didn't like people around her\": this kind of problem really should be addressed by the hotel management. We didn't use the main pool areas as we prefered the beach and swimming in the sea, which was our biggest disappointment. The beach itself was OK, though we found the areas closest to the resort and the Platinum reserved areas very crowded and noisy, which was no great problem as the areas to the north of the resort were a lot quieter. There are no toilets anywhere on the beach and a lengthy walk to either the pool areas or the Platinum Lounge was necessary - in the latter event my wife often went back to our room rather than stand in a long line up: very poor organisation and disappointing. The main problem was that the sea itself was marginally accessible: for the most part the bottom of the sea was very rocky with lots of sharp protrusions and, except in a small area in the centre of the resort's beach, very weedy which made the water brown and uninviting. I never saw anyone in the water on the north side of the beach all the time we were there, despite a lifeguard station being positioned there: even in the main \"clean\" area, my lasting memory is of people gingerly and painfully trying to pick their way out to where the water was deep enough to swim, which was a good 75-100 metres out from the beach: even with beach/swimming shoes, I found it a major problem to access the water - not good and a major disappointment. Speaking with people staying at other hotels in the area, we understood that this was a problem all along the Mayan Riviera, with only Cancun itself having decent beaches and bathing. January weather was a bit \"iffy\" with a couple of torrential downpours and accompanying high winds. We enjoyed our holiday but certainly won't return to this hotel or area again.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Truro, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMexican treasure\u201d", "Author": "JDM54", "ReviewID": "UR126230322", "Content": "My wife and I arrived March 7 for a week. We were totally impressed. The grounds are immaculate, and the service excellent. Random observations: No clocks in the room; we called and a clock-radio was delivered right away. No one should have the right to complain about the food: the buffets always had something different to offer, but you may have had to look for it. I never fail to wonder at the long lines for the burgers and fries! It's Mexico people! Live a little and try something different! The red wine was occasionally chilled, and the white wine occasionally less so, but the quality of the wine was vastly superior to the wine we were served in Cozumel last year. We ordered a nice bottle of wine for two meals at the a la care restaurants, at an average cost of $15: not hard to manage. A lot of walking from our room to the beach or the lobby but the exercise is a good thing. The beach is gorgeous: rocky in parts in the water (this IS the ocean) but lots of room to find a lounging chair. There are NO rental fees for these. The variety of pools throughout the resort attract different crowds, and it's always great to meet people from different countries. Probably 80% of vacationers are Canadian, which is fun too.

I did plenty of research prior and the Grand Riviera Princess served all of our needs. Originally booked into a junior suite, at check in we upgraded to Platinum. If you are a couple and into being a little pampered, upgrade. Our room was located by the beach. No problems with the room, everything we expected. 2 jacuzzi tubs, well stocked (2 Modelo's, pepsi, 7-up and 4 waters) fridge and a clean room. We never ran the air in the room and kept just the shears closed at night. Upgrading to platinum comes with a little more than the jr. suite. More restaurant options, special seating area with menus at the buffet dining rooms, private pool with wait staff, roped off area on the beach and a complimentary spa visit. We dined in a different restaurant each night and were quite satisfied. The buffet has lots of choices and plenty of pepper sauces to spice things up. The grounds are kept immaculate and never a dull moment with all the birds, iguanas and the coaties. The beach is kept pretty clean. Conditions were weedy and choppy when we were there because of a strong wind blowing in from sea. I tried snorkeling but the visibility was poor. By the way, the Sea Pro guys on the beach offer snorkeling gear, just leave your room key with them as a deposit. There is also food and a couple of bars on the beach as well as an area for \"Adults Only\". Keep in mind this place is huge. a little less than a half mile from the beach to the front desk. The entertainment was fun. They have a different live band which perform at the front of the resort in a commons area. Also where most of the restaurants are located. Restaurants only take reservations and they book up quick so I would suggest talking with your concierge. Also the disco is worth checking out. All in all we had a great time and I would definitely go back. My wife said it was the best 40th birthday she ever had! Oh yeah...don't forget to tip.

Bring rubber flip flops if you like to swim at the beach. Also, bring an alarm clock as none is provided and their wake up call service is pretty much nonexistent. We stayed here the second week of March and loved it. Upon arrival, we found they had fulfilled all our requests we emailed prior to coming, and they offered us a free upgrade to a junior deluxe suit close to the beach. The grounds are superb: clean, relaxed, and beautiful. It\u2019s a large resort, but smaller than some we have been, so while there is a lot of walking (which I personally enjoy), there is also a lot to do. The pools were wonderful, with several different bars nearby, and (unlike many resorts I\u2019ve visited) we never had difficulty finding a lounge chair by the pool. Just to note, because they meticulously clean the sidewalks and patios multiple times a day, it\u2019s worn down to the point that it\u2019s VERY slippery when you have wet bare feet. Grab flip flops if you are walking around and you won\u2019t have any issues. Nonetheless, even with the gorgeous pools, we still spent most of our lounge time at the beach. The beach is gorgeous: white, sandy, littered with lovely palm trees, and spacious. The rocks (actually dead coral) begin once you enter the water. We stayed in the adult only beach area, and found the water to be very rocky, but nothing a pair of flip flops couldn\u2019t cure. The designated swimming areas are much clearer. Even if you can\u2019t find lounge chairs open on the beach, a worker is willing to grab a couple if you just ask (they have them stacked up behind the beach). The bar service was wonderful and the grill was exactly what we needed. Meanwhile venders occasionally walk past, but a simple \u201cNo, gracias,\u201d is all they need to move on. However, we often stopped to see what they were selling as they often offered something free in order to capture your interest. It worked out for them: we couldn\u2019t help but purchase an hour long massage on the beach (we got ours for $40 each with a facial and scalp treatment, but we didn\u2019t bother haggling, so you could probably get it cheaper). The rooms were large and really comfortable. The maid service was better than most all inclusives I\u2019ve been to. You could tell they swept up the sand in the room and washed down the bathroom every day. Some commented on the sheets not being changed. They aren\u2019t, because the resort makes an effort to be water conscious. If you request it, they are willing to, however. Our last day, our maid left us flowers. The big drawback was that there was no clock in the room and no way to wake yourself up in the morning (we tried doing a wakeup call a couple of times before we gave up, and asked friends who brought an alarm to call us to wake us instead). We spent some time off the of the resort. We went to Akumal and swam with the sea turtles and had beers up in a tree house at the restaurant La Buena Vida. You will save money if you haggle prices with a taxi to bring you there and back and rent your equipment at the beach rather than doing an excursion. Also head to Tulum on your own rather than with an excursion to save money, but bring a bathing suit and plenty of water. Keep in mind that the taxis are competing with the Collectivos so if the price they give you sounds hefty, explain you would rather just head to Playa Del Carmen and arrange transportation there. We also went to Xplor for a day and had a blast. We booked through the hotel, but again, haggled the price to keep it affordable. Food was standard for an All Inclusive, and I actually wish it wasn\u2019t as good as it was so I could have avoided the weight gain. We always found something delicious at the buffets. We went to their restaurants every night having no difficulty getting into the places we wanted. They were all different and pretty good. The Sports Bar was great for a snack.

The villas also have their own private pool with excellent loungers and butler service. The private pool is quiet and has very good service. The Laguna Villa guests also have access to all platinum service (the reverse is not true - platinum cannot access laguna pool). We checked both out, and in our view, Laguna is FAR superior over platinum - platinum is very similar but the private pool is way smaller and way more people have access. This means it is much more crowded. Choose laguna over platinum if you have the choice. The beach at this hotel is less than desirable, but gets a bit better if you walk further away from the hotel.

I hope that my review will be helpful to all who read it. I stayed in the Grand Riviera section room 8014. First off I have to say that this property is colossal! and I do mean colossal! from what I read about this property I would say there are close to 1,500 rooms on it. most large hotels are 400-500. this is essentially three properties in one. The Grand Yucatan, The Grand Riviera Princess and The Grand Sunset Princess. If one were to walk from the lobby on the second floor all the way to the beach nonstop I would take you at least 10 minutes if not a little more. If you like to walk, or don't mind walking, A LOT. you may like this property. check in went well. I got to my room and needed to change it and they were able to do it right away. I stayed in a junior suite which had a jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom. the bath also had two sinks, a hair dryer, two sided make-up mirror, shampoo, conditioner and two rounds of soap. the shower is spacious with a very large shower head and a hand held shower wand which I found very useful for washing my feet after walking about shoeless. I have to mention this one for the ladies. they have a make-up mirror in the bath with a magnified side, very nice. the problem is that the ceiling lights shine right down onto your face making it difficult to use the mirrors for make-up application. something one might want to consider if they are going to get married. you may want to bring your own mirror. lighting in the room for make-up application is not the best overall. the bed was comfortable but the pillows were quite firm, I had 5 of them. there is a t.v., coffee maker with regular coffee, refrigerator-stocked with two (bad tasting) beers-1 small btl each of 7-up, pepsi, diet pepsi and orange soda-3 large btls of water, couch, two chairs and a coffee table in the room. every room has a balcony or closed in patio with two chairs, a table and a long bar to hang wet items on. you may want to bring an eye mask & earplugs to sleep with as there is a smoke alarm over the bed on which a light strobes every 6 seconds (I counted), not a problem during the day but problematic at night. after it woke me three times the first night I put my mask on & my earplugs in and used them religiously each night thereafter. earplugs are nice because of the golf carts that are running all hours of the day and night shuttling guests and hotel supplies, and the people walking and talking at night going back to their rooms. noise and sounds echo badly between the Riviera and Yucatan buildings, which are right across from each other in the 700 & 800 buildings (4 large buildings in all) the food was exactly what I expected in Mexico, not fancy and very average. this was my 4th trip to Mexico and I knew what to expect. the multiple different dinning rooms on the property are nothing to write home about. I ate at the steak restaurant and was totally unimpressed. I had the salmon and could tell the minute it was placed on my table that it wasn't hot, and it wasn't. it was barely luke warm. I ate quickly and left. not one person I spoke with was impressed with any of the restaurants, which is what I saw in my pre trip reviews as well. I found the buffet style dinning room to be perfectly fine and I have MANY food allergies and sensitivities. I was able to find plenty to eat, even gained weight. there are many pools on this property 10-12 I think. the only people who can utilize the Yucatan pool area are the Yucatan guests, I was kicked out of the pool for having the wrong wrist band on. mind you, there is no signage stating the pool is for Yucatan guests only. the sunset rooms however do have signs and a locked gate, stating the area is for platinum guests only. mid property, there are a series of pools that all guest can use with lounge chairs a plenty and shaded areas as well. there is a DJ that plays all afternoon at the mid property pool, except on sunday-thank god. some reviews gave negative feedback on the beach itself and I thought the beach was just fine. they have maintained some foliage on the beach, which I think helps to break it up into areas better, much like one would experience at a restaurant. they have an adults only area well off to the left which is where I spent my time, and it was very quiet. they also have roped off areas for the platinum guests. if one looks closely they will see sandbags on the beach but these are used to create a stepped up area from the water for guests to have a more level lounging area. there was a lot of sea weed and there are many large rocks close to shore but I found none of this troublesome or problematic. there are ample lounge chairs for all, and they also have large, fixed, grass top umbrellas with a shelf to keep your drinks and personal items on. the umbrellas are big enough that they provide a large enough shade spot to fit your entire lounge chair in so that you can enjoy the pleasures of the beach and surf with much less exposure to the sun. I found this quite nice. as did my skin :) two other things that happens at this property is that they power wash the sidewalks in the evening from about 4p to 10p. the washer can easily be heard across the property, it is very loud and gets on ones nerves, especially when they are outside your building. the other thing is the grounds keepers that must work everyday to maintain this beautiful property. you also get to hear their power tools all day long as they do their work. As I said, over all, my trip was a good one. I made my choices about how much I was going to let the noise bother me and did a good job of blocking it out most of the time. but I found this property way too large & way too noisy. the staff is very friendly, the grounds beautiful but this place is not for me. If you don't mind a ton of walking and noise, love the idea of a DJ every afternoon pumpin out music, then this may be the place for you.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic resort-great vacation!\u201d", "Author": "c p", "ReviewID": "UR125747966", "Content": "I have been there 2 weeks ago - absolutly fantastic!

The trip included 3 adults and was a University graduation gift for our daughter as she is history major. We had booked the trip with Air Canada Vacations through Sears Travel with the professional help of Margo Cormier \u2013 great service. The trip was booked in early fall 2010 and you can imagine our shock when along with the rest of the world heard about the tragic event which occurred in November 2010 at the Resort. We were not booked into the Platinum section so we did not let the event discourage us from making the trip. We arrived in Cancun on Friday February 18th 2011 and travelled by shuttle van to the Riviera Maya arriving at the Grand Riviera Princess in just under an hour. Imagine our surprise when we checked in that we were upgraded to the Platinum section. The incredible work done by the Resort staff masked any of the signs of the tragic event. I work in the field of life safety and emergency planning and from what I seen I had no concerns for our personal safety. It did not take long for my family to question what the naysayers had to say about this Resort. Could this be the same Resort that some people complained about? From the registration and check-in, meals, entertainment, the abundance of one\u2019s favourite beverages, the caring nature of the staff; we had nothing but praise for this Resort. We stayed on the Riviera side however you get access to both the Riviera and Sunset Resorts. They are pretty much the same, with different restaurants and bars. On Saturday morning we attended the briefing by our Air Canada representative. This session was very helpful as we decided on three excursions to satisfy my Mayan history buff which we chose to book through our Air Canada Rep. We took the day long tour to Chichen Itza, also the day long Coba - Mayan encounter expedition, and the half day Tulum Express. We never regretted taking these tours, fantastic and knowledgeable tour guides \u2013 and worth every peso. For your information I decided to charge the 3 tours to my credit card and found that I got a better exchange rate. Hint, hint. We spread the trips out with a day off in between to rest as there is a lot of walking, but oh so worth it. Here is a bit of information on the tours: Chichen Itza No visitor to the Yucatan Peninsula should leave without visiting Chichen Itza. Over 25 square kilometers, Chichen Itza is one of the most studied and visited ruins of the Mayan world. You will learn about the most impressive building, the Castle of Kukulcan (Pyramid), which rises to over 30 meters. However it is no longer possible to climb the pyramid. You will also see the war-like symbols of the Ball Court and discover the Platform of Eagles and Jaguars, and much more. Chichen Itza was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. On the way you will also stop at a Cenote which is a deep natural pit or sinkhole, resulting from the collapse of limestone bedrock that exposes groundwater underneath. Especially associated with the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, cenotes were sometimes used by the ancient Maya for sacrificial offerings. Coba - Mayan encounter expedition The tour will have you exploring Coba in the midst of the Mayan jungle. Cob\u00e1 is one of the most important archaeological sites in the area. It was at one time a very large city spread over 80 square kilometres. The main pyramid, Nohoch Mul meaning 'large hill', is 42 meters tall (138 feet) and is the highest in the Yucatan peninsula \u2013 this one you can actually climb and the view from the top will take your breath away. You will also visit an authentic Mayan village where you will enjoy an authentic Mayan meal. Then you can canoe on a lake and if you are lucky you may get a glimpse of numerous monkeys then soar on a zip-line through the Mayan jungle \u2013 watch out for the crocodiles, take part in a Mayan purification ceremony before making a thrilling rappel descent to submerge yourself in an ancient cenote all while hiking through the jungle. Tulum Express We took the half-day tour to discover Tulum, the last city built by the Maya and once a busy port. Discover one of the most beautiful Mayan cities and the only one overlooking the Caribbean Sea. Tulum is thought to have been a major Mayan port. You can explore the temple of Frescoes, the Temple of the Descending God, and \"El Castillo\" in its grandeur on the top of the sea cliffs. Then you can take a quick dip at one of the most spectacular beaches on the Riviera Maya. The room in the Platinum Section at the Grand Riviera Princess was very nice and spacious - well decorated. You get a large marble shower, a Jacuzzi in the bathroom and one on the balcony which we didn't use. The Platinum building is absolutely gorgeous, and just about a 2 minute walk to the beach where there is a private area for guests in the Platinum and Villa sections. The Platinum section was located at the end of the resort but you get there in 5 minutes or less from the principal lobby with the shuttle which we only used on arrival as we needed to walk after the fantastic meals we enjoyed during our stay. The grounds are absolutely beautiful! We had the opportunity to try almost all of the a la carte restaurants, with our favourites being Swiss Restaurant \u201cLa Fondue\u201d (where the waiters entertain you the whole evening), and the Asiatic Restaurant \u201cMiso\u201d. Excellent service and the meals were delicious. There is always something happening day and night at the resort so you can do as much or as little as you wish. Take the time to get to know the resort staff, they are absolutely wonderful people who will go out of their way to make you stay as pleasant as possible; but remember we are guests in their country and a little respect goes a long way. We truly enjoyed our stay and will be back for sure.

I have been to the Mayan about 10 times, this was by far my worse resort. We are not whiners or hard to satisfy. I read reviews before going and discounted the negative reviews because I know there are some people you just can't satisfy. I should have listened. We stayed in the Platinum section. The resort is huge, clean and esthetically appealing. The staff are very nice and you should never worry about your personal safety there. The La Fleur resturaunt is good. The entertainment is good. The disco is fun. The pools are okay. The down sides are; the beach is awful. It's covered in seaweed, small and very rocky and washed out. The food is awful in the buffets. The mosquitoes are wicked and the welts they leave are huge. Make no wonder since you're surrounded by bogs and slews. Even between the resort and beach. Money; It's not $13.00 in taxi to town it's $20 one way. Dental floss on the resort is $6.00 and potato chips are $13.00 !!!! If you think for one second that leaving a $20 tip on the first day will get you more water or beer in your room, it won't. I left a note requesting same in Spanish, nothing. The mini bar is stocked with two beer every second day. There's a roped off beach section that you can lay on that will only cost you $22 per day per couple even if you are Platinum !!!! It's ridiculous. We did not get any champagne or cold towels upon arrival nor were we given any direction on room, buffets or anything. The private pool is small with not enough chairs for your Platinum section. The pool butler service is good, tip or no tip. The room service available 24 hrs is $6.00 not including the tip so I don't know where the all inclusive came from but the food we ordered was disgusting so paying $16 for that nasty stuff at a 5 star is gross.

If you are looking for sweeping views of Caribbean turquoise ocean, go elsewhere. If you love being surrounded by lush tropical green, you'll love the long winding pathways with \"Mayan\" statues and the flora and fauna. It is BIG! Actually two resorts on one property, the Grand Riviera Princess and the Grand Sunset Princess. So that 670 rooms you see when shopping, is actually only half the actual size of the resort. The two resorts share all amenities... restaurants, pools, bars, etc. That being said, we never had trouble getting pool chairs or dinner reservations. The biggest issue with the property's size is that the layout is all length instead of width. The lobby is very far from the ocean, a fifteen minute walk. The only complaint we had with our room was the bed (and pillows) were hard and there was no clock. We asked the concierge and we were awarded with a clock that was never set to the correct time, but the beds improved a little. Needing a card key to turn on the lights was a little inconvenient, but that was remedied when a friend gave me an expired gift card of the same size. Our rooms were generally quiet at night. You could hear the disco from the balcony but not inside the room. Service was another hit or miss. We discovered the service was better at the Sunset buffet than at the Princess...just a short walk across a court yard. A traveling companion was told that they could not make her a mimosa at breakfast because they \"were out\" when there was a bar in the courtyard. I walked outside and got it instead of the server making the extra effort. We did meet some wonderful servers in the lobby, enough so, that one friend went the extra effort to seek out management. Thanks to Guadalupe, Jose and Ruth. Food, I think, was the biggest hit or miss. The buffets are the only choice for breakfast or lunch. Food often appeared old and almost universally cold, unless you elect to stand in line for one of the cooking stations, omelet or pasta. We were disappointed that the tapas restaurant was closed while we were there. The Japanese restaurant was a huge disappointment. On the other hand, we were all pleasantly surprised by the fondue restaurant. The Mexican and Italian were average. The \"grill\" restaurant, Las Hacienda, I think, was the hit of the week. There was an abundance a food; dinner included appetizers, soup or salad, entree and dessert...we never left hungry. The pools are large, but again a significant walk if your room is near the lobby (counter to that, if your room is near the ocean/pools, it is a long walk to most of the restaurants). The only bars we discovered near the pools were limited to sitting on concrete bar stools. They really could benefit from an outdoor area with comfortable seating near the pools with bar and maybe even food service. We would occasionally see a server circulating near the pools but it was unreliable. One issue we discovered day one, was how slick the walk ways are when one friend slipped and fell. The entertainment was a pleasant surprise. This is something often missing from other resorts. There is live music in the courtyard nightly. There is also another show in the open area near the buffets nightly. The fire show was one of the best I have ever seen. The shows in the auditorium are lip sync and maybe a little cheesy, but we enjoyed several of them. The entertainment staff makes up for a lot with their enthusiasm and sheer energy. Several of our friends visited the disco and were happy with it. There is also a sports bar with a variety of game tables...an area that I thought should have been adults only, especially after a certain time. Overall, it was a good week spent with great friends, but there is too much competition for me to return.

My husband and I stayed for 5 nights and 6 days. This was our 15th anniversary and honeymoon we never had. So yes we really researched and read up on this place. It seemed the only complaint was the seaweed and all the marble! So we went for it... we even bought the best... the platinum suite! Here is what we found we got for all that money... The Grounds: they really do have a beautiful set up. As to the marble everyone keeps heckleing I'm at a loss. There was a balance of wood and concrete and marble. Who knows. The grounds were being nurtured lovingly through out our stay. The only noise as a result was a chain saw for a few hours but otherwise most all was cut by machete. The Beach: was beautiful. There were sales people but thenot y did not harass. The seaweed kicked up after about 4pm as did the wind so it makes sense to move your butts to the pool if it bothers. And the rocks people complain about are very minor if have ever been to any other beach other than in your imagination. The Food: was a reason to go elsewhere. If this is a reason for picking between two choose another. I personally got food poisoning. I found that the food was left out to warm not hot or cold temps for overly long periods. Also the \"beef\" was very questionable. None of the restaurants made an impact except on my g.I. system. The service is about the same for all paying levels. No extra for extra $$$. So don't expect to be spoiled if you are platinum. The Entertainment: great bands and not so great bands. Wish I could tell you all the names! Super floor shows... fire walkers etc. The best band was on Tuesday. They repeat every week. The Room: we asked each night starting with check-in to be moved to a king sized bed instead of the 2 rock hard double beds pushed together we had. However even after checking daily and asking the manager the concierge and reception we NEVER got it. We were just told we were on the list. The hotel was only at 80% occupancy. We asked daily for certain drinks not alcohol to be stocked in our room however even after trying to tip daily it never happened until I found the drink guy and asked him... on our last day! the Concierge: very helpful! Would go out of their way to help but can only do so much with management... hooked us up once or twice... can't discuss cuz he may get into trouble but thanks Paco and Alex!

It\u00b4s a huge hotel (there are actually 2 hotels, the Riviera and the Sunset) so take this into account as you need to walk a lot to move from one place to another. It has lots of swimming pools, but the most fun is the central one - with a great bar on it! (ask for the chocolate cocktail - can\u00b4t remember its name - ). I took a Suite Vila so I had access to premium stuff such as spa, concierge, VIP pool and some other things. The upgrade really worths; the Vila room is amazing - includes an out-door mayan shower, jacuzzi, a huge & comfortable bed, and is very well located within the building (away from the beach, though near the central pool, the lobby and most of the restaurants and bars). RESTAURANTS AND BARS The thematic restaurants are good, but not outstanding. The Chinese one is the best. The buffets are more than fine: variety and quality. If you are up for a snack and a beer, go to the Sports Bar!! You can have hamburgers, hot dogs, nachos, sandwichs or pop corn (yes, pop corn) and all the drink(s) you wish! The disco is fun too, if you like to have a drink listeting to (loud) modern music. THEATRE They perform good shows at the hotel theatre - which is huge as well -. You can also have a drink while you enjoy the show. STAFF I noticed a lot of negative reviews regarding the hotel staff. Well... seems like all the rude guys and ladies were fired by the time I got there... Everyone was kind and nice! Do not pay attention to those bad reviews. Also, you\u00b4re not forced to tip everyone to receive a good service. BEACH It\u00b4s nice, but... not the best. There are rocks in the beach and some sea plants, but don\u00b4t consider this as an issue. If you see rocks, just move 30 fts away and youl find a spot rock-less :). If you stay at the Vilas, you have a specific sector at the beach.Then, at the right side of the beach, there\u00b4s an exclusive sector for adults. It\u00b4s really quiet. LOCATION The GRP is one of the few hotels that it\u00b4s not on the edfge of the main route. You have to head over 1km to the beachside to get to the hotel. OTHERS - Taxi to downtown US$20 (visit the downtown... it\u00b4s absolutely nice, and the beach is beautiful) - Go to Xcaret (~US$100 including transportation and buffet lunch). \u00b415 away from the hotel, it\u00b4s a paradise!! - If you\u00b4re staying on a Vila, talk to the concierge in order to make sure you know everything you have access to (i.e. I was noticed by the concierge that I had 1 hour kayak free on the beach, and I didn\u00b4t know that).

We paid an extra $400 for the platinum suite upgrade and should have saved our money!! I called the hotel to confirm that we would still receive ALL the amenities listed under the Platinum package because i had heard that there was construction happening on the Princess side. They said YES. I called FunJet tours and they said YES. If the Princess wasn't fully operational they should have let it be known when booking!! Here were our issues: 1. Our room was not in the building closest to the beach like stated in the description. No ocean view. In fact we were in the building FURTHEST from the beach. And it is a LONG trek as many reviewers have said. 2. Because the Platinum building was closed on the Princess side, there was NO private pool with cabana beds like in the pictures 3. There was no hot tub on the balcony as stated in the description. 4. They had a platinum only line at the front desk, but no one was ever there! 5. They refused to put us on the Sunset side in the Platinum bldg even though we PAID for it! 6. The platinum beach area had NO servers so we always had to walk to over to the other side anyways 7. The kids club was closed on the Princess side and most of the time the other one was closed too (weird?) 8. The buffet was closed on the Princess side 9. After it rained, part of our ceiling caved in on the balcony. no joke - there was a HUGE pile of plaster when we came back to our room. 10. The spa was ok, but during the massage they had you lay on a really scratchy beach towel. Not really comfortable or relaxing... But here's the thing - if I hadn't paid for the Platinum upgrade I would have been satisfied with the resort. I was so excited about this exclusive room, pool, beach area and service that it was a real let-down when none of it was available. ROOMS- The rooms are all 'suites' and VERY nice for the price you pay. Much nicer than say an Allegro or Iberostar. Fridges are well stocked w/ water, soda, juice and they will give you more if you ask for it when the maid comes. GROUNDS - The grounds are wonderfully maintained and very lush and beautiful. lots of places to sit and relax. Its a HUGE resort and they do a good job of keeping it nice. I can attest to the slippery floors - Be careful! I read the prior reviews and put some of those non-slip stickers on the bottoms of my sandals and it did help! STAFF- The bartenders and wait staff didn't go out of their way, but they were all friendly so no complaints there. Waiter at the Italian restaurant offered to bring me another dish when he saw that i didn't eat much. it did have a weird taste, but I declined. I went to the buffet and grabbed some fresh fruit instead. POOLS - \"Party\" pool was fun with music that wasn't too loud or obnoxious. My 6 yr old son actually preferred this area to the quiet sections! Ice cream machine was a hit with him as well as the 'virgin' strawberry daiquiris they made. Pools meandered throughout the resort so there was always somewhere new to explore. clean and good temp. BEACH- was nice and clean, lots of available chairs and trees/palapas for shade. A la carte restaurants had great ambiance/decor. FOOD - was average to good. The hibachi was definitely good although they served everyone the exact same dish - no choices (weird?)! There was nothing special about the 'platinum' restaurants - the seafood and La Fleur were just okay. I have had better fish at Red Lobster to be honest. Buffet had a pretty good selection. I could always find something to eat, but nothing was outstanding. So, overall I think if you are looking for a good value for your money this resort is worth considering.

Separate lobbys, but everything else is mostly shared. Lots of people with the 2 resorts but you don't feel crowded since the many pools keep everyone happy. Rooms are clean & spacious with a balcony. Go for the cheapest room & spend the extra cash to stay an extra day. Chances are they will upgrade your room anyway. The pools are salt water & very clean. There are smaller pools for the little kids & bigger pools for the everyone else. The center of the resort is where the music & pool party activities are right near one of the pool bars. The young adults (18 - 30yrs) hang there & its never out of control. Since both resorts have rooms that lead right into the pool, you never have to go far to be in one.

Bring water shoes because there are rocks (coral) as you enter the water for the first 20 feet or so, then every now & then you'll find one further out. I guess the waves bring in the seaweeds & sea garbage because the 4th & 5th day the whole coast was covered & smell was rather strong. A couple days later all was clean again along the resort area.

We booked the Sunset but got upgraded to a room at the Riviera (both resorts are on the same grounds, but have 2 different lobbies). The resort has beautiful grounds and nice rooms, but other than that we were not impressed. The food and drinks were below average and service was spotty. I'm happy we only went for a few days, I don't think I'd want to stay here a week. It was okay for the price, but I can't say we would go back... See below for a more detailed review. ARRIVAL: First off, it took 2 hours to get through immigration and customs at the airport... It was so disorganized. When I got to the resort at 1:30pm, I was told I couldn't get my room until 3pm. It wasn't ready until 4; but they at least gave us an upgrade to a room with platinum privileges. (We used Best Day for transportation to/from the airport, which I also reviewed - I don\u2019t recommend them, you are better off taking a taxi). ROOMS: The rooms are nice. We were upgraded to a Yucatan room on the 3rd floor. It\u2019s an adults only building and had a quiet pool area. We noticed leaving a tip didn't change the level of housekeeping we received (no extra towels or stocked fridge like other reviewers; we actually received less towels...). The beds are a little firm. I wish they had given us a little more detail about the extras platinum members receive. To be honest, I didn\u2019t care for the segregation at this resort. I feel like service was based on your wrist-band color. FOOD: The buffet is a hit or miss (mostly a miss). We usually were able to find something okay to eat, but it was never much. Breakfast was the best meal, since they had an omelette station. My lunches usually consisted of chips and salsa (and I\u2019m not really that picky of an eater). Usually everything was just mediocre at best. We went to 2 of the al-la-cartes (make sure to book early, reservations go fast); the Mexican (which was okay, better than the buffet, but you're local tex-mex restaurant is probably better) and the Italian (didn't like at all, my raviolis tasted like Chef Boyardee....). DRINKS: I was a little worried the first day; the white wine wasn\u2019t great, the rum punch had a metal-y aftertaste, my daiquiri tasted like dish soap, etc.... Apparently if you are platinum you have to make sure to request the better alcohol, which made a huge difference in the quality of drinks (the rum punch was so much better with Bacardi!). Also, I found some bartenders played favorites with guests and were lazy with blended drinks (I received drinks that weren't even really blended - just had huge chunks of ice). Once we found a good bartender, we\u2019d try to stick with them. The best drinks were from the coffee stations at night. SERVICE: Some people were very attentive and friendly; others didn't seem to care much. So we tipped accordingly. Service at check-in wasn\u2019t great, for a few minutes I thought he forgot about me since he went off to do other things\u2026 but the gentleman who helped me once my room was ready was very nice and check-out went a lot smoother. The pool-side service was okay, it usually took a while to get your drink. Waiter service was also sporadic - some were great, others we hardly saw. GROUNDS: The resort is large and well maintained; there are always employees cleaning. The pools were alright and the beach would be so much nicer without all the vendors (it also seemed more crowded). People reserve chairs early; and sometimes it felt like there wasn\u2019t enough for everyone (the Yukatan pool usually had open chairs though, and it\u2019s pretty quiet over there). I also don\u2019t remember seeing any umbrellas around, but they do have some covered areas. Overall we had a good time, my husband and I always try to make the best of things.

We've been to Barcelo & Bahia Principe in the Mayan several years ago & this resort was comparable, with some better, some worse aspects. To spare you reading through my lengthy review, in short: service here was what stood out as superior - never sat long anywhere (beach, pool, entertainment, bar...) & someone came to ask if you wanted a drink or anything, great friendly people! (Whether our Platinum wristbands & towels made a difference in this, I have no idea). Food was as good or better than others. Room was better. Beach was the downside (see below if desired). This was the first time I've travelled since being diagnosed with Celiac disease so I was rather worried, but the food was great here & the staff took good care of me! Being in the Platinum section may have helped, not sure, but after checking in I chatted with our private concierge & he gave me a letter (in Spanish) to take to every restaurant, just carried it around & at the beach snack bar or wherever, handed it over & they let me know what I could eat there. Personalized service, it was awesome & put my mind at ease, which really helps! The beach bar had paella & fajitas that I could eat, which looked much better than the hot dogs & hamburgers that were also there. I love Mexican food, so the fajitas were awesome & the chips & guac, tacos, etc. were all gluten free everywhere. I stuck to omelettes & fruit mostly at the breakfast buffet, but did try other things too, just asked first to make sure it was ok for me. With the platinum package we got to eat at as many a la cartes as we liked which we did every night, preferring that to buffet style. It's a Mexican all inclusive, so as long as you're not expecting gourmet Canadian level dining, it's very good & the service was great, hardly waited anywhere to get in or for our food! We ate twice at Le Fleur (French) & La Vacqueria (Grill - great waiter Daniel - the only place I had dessert (too full most of the time), our last night, delicious crustless cheesecake, not like ours, but sooo good!), being a meat eater, those were my favourite, although if we weren't eating so much Mexican food during the day we would have returned to La Hacienda (Mexican) because it was delicious - but way too much food, order slowly!! Also had sombreros for a photo op & (corn of course) tortillas being hand made, awesome (Carlos - great waiter)! Had a great time at Las Olas (down by the beach, same location as Fondue which I couldn't eat at), with delicious seafood & Emmanuel our awesome waiter! I couldn't eat at Miso either because of the worry that the soy sauce had wheat - & practically everything had soy sauce, not a sushi eater or maybe that would've worked. But they got us into Le Fleur after I showed my letter at Miso & we realized I shouldn't eat there (maitre d' walked us right over) - again great service!! Mamma Mia was good, quite a varied menu, couple of meat options for me (no pasta of course), nicely decorated & beautiful window seat. If you go to the buffets near the beach instead of the lobby, platinum guests can order off the menu for breakfast or lunch also, which is a nice feature. And the mini buffet by the pools at the platinum riviera/sunset sections was nice for a quick, light snack (mini sandwiches my husband adored & cheese/fruit for me). Never did go stay at their platinum pools, although the lounges, etc. were very nice looking, since they were pretty crowded & kids are allowed at those platinum sections - we came without ours so didn't really care to be around others' too much. :) The beach here, as reported by others is not as good as any of the resorts we've been to, not being huge beach swimming people, it wasn't a big deal. But yes, vendors come around selling things & block the middle section of the beach. Yes, there's sometimes a smell in areas (noticed this at various times throughout the resort). Yes, lots of seaweed. Generally quite crowded as it's not a very 'deep' beach, although the adult section to the north is much better & if you walk north to the next resort(s), there's great swimming areas & completely deserted when we were there, gorgeous open sand, highly recommended. Have to mention the drinks - I was thrilled when I asked for a Mojito & they made it up from scratch with fresh mint & lime! Good quality drinks all over with my only complaint being they were too sweet (& sometimes too strong) most of the time (for me) - exception being mojitos - always good & margaritas from Emmanuel at the swim up bar closest to the beach (Sunset side). I don't know what kind of Tequila he put in - but he put in a lot & they tasted amazing - shaken on the rocks of course, not the slushy stuff. He kept bringing us those without asking as long as we sat there, which we wisely didn't too long! :) Have to mention the mudslides too - meal replacement if you want - aka 'moe's light'. :) They had basically any drink you'd want - our Platinum (adult only) lounge bar was nice to sit & have a martini before dinner, again wonderful service! And free internet there, but we also had free wi-fi in our room. Delicious & fun before or after dinner flaming coffees being made near the main a la cartes every night - pick your alcohol to add. Sports bar was also a nice feature of this resort with it's 24 hour snacks & drinks, pool tables, numerous tvs, etc. Fun for after dinner before the disco - which I have to also mention as being a great time, good music, drinks & the hardest working cleaner - that dance floor was spotless as was the bathroom floors - he often followed close behind anyone who went in to clean immediately! :) We never did order room service which was included with our package, menu looked good though. Heard from some people there, that this was too small of a resort & some thought it was too big, so I guess it's relative - we thought it was a good size, lots to do & lots of people, but not too big to see or do everything. Depends on what you want, but this seemed to have all the bases covered, some quieter adult areas, some party areas. I don't think I'd bring my kids here though, unless maybe with a large group. Highly recommended resort - if you don't mind the beach issues. We only went on 1 excursion - Aventuras Mayas - Mayan Extreme - very good if you want a sampler of fun activities in a small group with no waiting & only half a day (back by 2) - I'll review it separately.

Very disappointing trip. We were at this same resort in February 2011 and had a wonderful time, great food, etc. HOWEVER, that is no longer the case. The food was terrible, not much variety, including the buffets, never hot. With a 9 day stay we were only able to book restaurants for four of these days. Everytime we went to make a reservation they were all booked up, however the restaurants were never full. They started only letting you book 2 days in advance, then changed it to 3 days but failed to inform you. Bookings had to be done at 2:00 PM sharp to even get a change at one. As for the staff, very unfriendly. They did not wait on you at the bars, buffets, or restaurants. The entertainment was very low quality, many people leaving during the shows. The bands were so loud you could not have a conversation in the outdoor bar/entertainment area. The Fantasy Bar pool (where the entertainment was) was not working properly all week, the whirlpool section did not work the entire trip. A large amount of maintenance was being done every day throughout the resort. You were always hearing power tools running, divers in the pool doing tile repair, etc. As for the rooms, they visually look nice until you take a closer look. Signs of mold in the bathrooms, we were not given adaquate towels and linens each day, and the air quality was qquestionable. There were 8 of us traveling together and we all left coughing and not feeling to well. Other travels were spoke to at the resort were also complaining and just as unhappy as we were.

Seven hour delays there and seven hour delay back with not explanation or compensation is unacceptable. With that being said.....on with the review of the resort. Once we finally arrived at the resort at Midnight, we were met by very friendly staff and due to booking Platinum, our check in was very quick. We did book at the Sunset Princess but were relocated to the Riviera Princess but it is all the same. The hotel itself is amazingly beautiful. The grounds are kept very clean and they take great pride in the appearance of the resort. It is a very big resort but due to this, you never feel like you are crowded. We never had a problem catching the shuttle if we chose to, even the last night when it was pouring rain. The room was by far the nicest we have ever had. The sound of the ocean, the jacuzzi on the balcony and the comfy beds made this room complete. We had towel art everyday and our room was always cleaned early (by noon). The beach was not one of our favorites. Their was an occasional odour infront of the resort. Not sure why, but it was offensive. The pools were beautiful. Always able to get loungers for the four of us, even without playing the towel game. The drinks were delicious, especially with the premium drinks in the platinum lounge. We strongly recommend the mudslides and mojitos. Please be advised to avoid the Mexican Iceburgs...woooo.....crazy drink. Due to the mudslides and mojitos, listed above, we did not see too much of the nightlife, but the shows we did see were your typical resort shows. The fire show was our favorite. Food at the resort is average. There is always something to eat but nothing was outstanding. We booked all the a la cartes but think that the buffet might have been the way to go for dinner because we heard great stories about the lobster and prawns that were severed there. One bit of advice, it is difficult to get a drink late at night at the front of the resort. The sports bar is very busy and the bartenders are overwhelmed. They need more areas to get drinks after 11pm. Overall, we loved this resort.

This all inclusive was well worth the money. FOOD: The buffet was very good and they changed it up everyday. By the end of the week, you did start to see repeats but if you couldn't find something that you liked there is something wrong with you. The salad bar alone could hold your interest. Vegetables were very fresh and the lettuce was always fresh and clean. The salsa and guacamole were excellent and the chips that went with it were fresh and home made everyday. The breads were always fresh and delicious. Every morning there is a omelet bar with fresh omelets or eggs any way you want. Desserts are not my thing so can't comment but the fresh fruit was great. ALA CARTE: We really liked the Grill Restaurant: \u201c La Vaqueria it had great roasted chicken and interesting soup and salads. The swiss place, La Fondue was only OK, would not waste my evening there. Asian Miso was quite good as well. DRINK: try the bahama mama's they are great slushy drinks and don't forget to bring you insulated go cups so your drinks don't melt too fast in the hot sun. ROOMS and SERVICE we upgraded to the platinum suite and at the Riviera Princess it was worth it. We had a separate lounge where there were computers, a bar, a concierge, mini buffet and pool with service. There is also free wireless (sketchy) internet and by sketchy I mean unreliable and slow at times but nice to have. Rooms were located near the beach, just had to walk around the corner of our building. Liked being on the second floor. The balcony's in the platinum section have Jacuzzi tubs on them. There is a shuttle for platinum rooms to the main part of the resort with the restaurants and entertainment. Swim up bars are always fun and there are a number of them to choose from. ENTERTAINMENT: ok (the bar at the theater always had Bailys for that after supper coffee and Bailys. BEACH: Sand is beautiful and white, there are some small mammals that patrol the beach (Coaties) that are really cute to watch for. They will steal fruit right out of your bag. Water was nice but it was windy when we were there, so did not spend alot of time in the ocean. Would recommend this resort, I have been to Ocean Blue in Punta Cana and this is comparable with way better food. SERVICE was generally good, they did seem to appreciate american dollars for tips. Room service was great, towel art and special treats for us most days. Fresh water and whatever we seemed to be drinking was left in the fridge. Dont loose your room key or you towel cards, they will charge you and leave your ID and most valuables in your safe in your room (standard rule when traveling). Safe is big enough to hold you ipad so dont worry you can bring it.

First off, the review of this hotel's grounds being impecable are absolutely true! We've been traveling to all inclusives for about 15 years. This place would rate near the top. Not at the top, but near it. It's very similar to Palladium in the Riviera Maya. Grounds: Size- It's a large hotel, but easily accessible from any walk no more than 5-7 minutes from end to end. We're in our late 30's/early 40's and the walking was not a big...at all! (we didn't take the kids with us on this trip, that DOES make it an easier walk) The Hotel is divided into two. The right side is called Sunset, the left is Princess. Same hotel, it's just a different designation when identifying the property. The Ala Carte's are directly under the main lobbyies on the ground floor, as are two of the 4 buffet restaurants and the gift shops, the sports bar, and the gym/spa. The main courtyard (where some of the night time entertainment is held is immediately behind the lobbyies. Hotels are arranged on the sides and Ocean end of the resort. Shuttles run every 15 minutes from multiple stops. The grounds are some of the nicest/cleanest grounds we've ever seen. Faux Mayan statues line the forest filled main walk of the hotel to give it an extra feel for the area. Multiple pools to choose from depending upon if you want to relax in relative quietness, party it up like you're on spring break, or just hang out and occasionally use the swim up bar. There are two more buffet restaurants near the pools close to the beach. Also the buffet restaurant on the Sunset side near the pool by the beach doubles at night as the Fondu Restaurant---this is the only Ala Carte not located near the lobby. Ala Cartes: one nice perk is that you can reserve up to 4 nights of dinners at a time. It's not a daily fight like at some resorts. We ate at the Japanese, the Fondu, the Steakhouse (grill). They were all good, as were the buffets, but all in all very typical of what you normally get at every all inclusive that you go to. I've had worse, but this food was what you would expect. I don't quite understand people who say the food was terrible or that it was the best ever. The steakhouse, to me, is comparable to a Ponderosa. It'll do for the time being but I wouldn't pick it to go to back home. The Fondu was my least favorite because it wasn't like a normal Melting Pot type of place. The Fondu is used more of a dip than a method of actually cooking your food. Rooms: We stayed in a Junior Deluxe with a king sized bed. Typically, the mattress and pillows were hard but after a night, we were use to them. The rooms themselves are very large and well kept. The safe worked fine and I had no problem with anyone taking anything. If you're traveling with kids and use a TV program to help chill them out every once in a while, you better bring a portable DVD player. There are 3 english speaking stations. CNN, FOX, and a movie channel that only shows action packed R rated movies. Bathrooms and showers were spacious and well kept. Beach: This is where the hotel needs to do something. The beach can be divided up into 3 segments. as you walk out on the beach, the adult only quite area is to the left. The problem with this area is that there is so much seaweed, its unusable. Seaweed is knee deep and about 4' wide all along this stretch. Seaweed is infested in the entire ocean in this area so you can't even get into the water---at all. The middle section of the beach is where they have the designated, roped off swim area. no seaweed here, but they've allowed 11 beach vendors to set up permanent shop. Jewelry huts, tattoo huts, massage huts, braiding huts, etc. are located right near water's edge and block the entire view and you are constantly hastled by the workers. To the right area is another Chill Out zone that you have to pay extra for. The problem is that this area is so rocky, you'll need water shoes. I really like to snorkel but this resort it completely un-snorkable. If I had to choose, I'd stay at the Palladium even thought that's a larger resort with a lot more walking.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huntley, Illinois", "Title": "\u201coutstanding resort\u201d", "Author": "mjs1965", "ReviewID": "UR124450294", "Content": "just came back after a 5 day stay here - just outstanding - grounds were beautiful, pools sparkling, food was great - lot's of variety at buffets - make sure to do request cooking show teppanyaki at the asian - also dined at the mexican ala carte -both really good as well - we had a regular junior suite - really nice - the whole resort was kept up - super clean - the staff if great - know that only 1 place available for limited food from 2 til 6 is on the beach - beach area has some rocky areas but the ocean is supposed to have rocks - walk down the beach a bit for a really plain sandy area - anyone who is complaining about this place is obviously a cry baby - lots of walking - the place is huge - wish we were still there", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBang for your buck\u201d", "Author": "Felicity C", "ReviewID": "UR124397323", "Content": "Hubs and I went here for a long weekend over Easter.

We had no problem with the buffets they offered, there was always tons of food and different combinations for variety, we found all the alacarte restaurants quite good, They had shows every night with different themes we found the shows to be quite good also, we booked our tours through Best Day at the Hotel and they used Go Natural tours we went to Telum, Cenote swimming, and Chichen Itza the tours guides we had were awsome, knowledgable and hilarious at times. Rooms: No complaints at all cleaned every day air conditioning always working. About day 5, I left the safe open by mistake when we returned that evening I couldnt get it opened, turns out when they came to clean the room they noticed the safe open called security, they took inventory and put their own lock on until we got back, Passports, credit cards, cash ALL THERE.

I have stayed in many all inclusives and this resort has many positives and a few negatives. The positives: Some of the best food Ive had in an all inclusive. The restaurants with reservations had the best, especially the Japanese food that is prepared by a Chef infront of you as he performs a funny 'show'. Many guests didn't know this resort had this as a reservation option, you specifically have to ask for it. The beach area was wonderful. There was lots of space, and shopping vendors from tatoos, massage, beaded hair, the typical. But they didn't bother you. I really appreciated that we had paid for the upgrade to the Platinum area as we had our own reserved area on the beach with a waitor that was fantastic. The platinum area has its own pool, lounge area, and a bit fancier rooms but not much different from regular rooms. The toileries were nice, and the liquor (tequila and rum) bottles were a nice gift upon arrival. The negatives: Housekeeping was horrible. We also brings lots of Canadian gifts and extra tips for housekeeping, but I found myself finding anyone BUT housekeeping to give these too. We had room service one night and a chicken nugget had fallen on the floor by our table. 3 DAYS LATER it was still there. Yes I could easily picked it up, we I did on the third day MYSELF. We only had enough towels 2 of the 6 nights, so i was always calling concierge to send up more. The private platinum club is great, a bit small of a pool area but still great. However the set back is that the regular busy pool area and platinum area pool area are only divided by a row of trees and foliage. So even though you are in the exclusive area you get the same loud noises of kids and intoxicated adults with no buffer. My last negative is we had met some guests and were having a drink in the platinum lounge and all of a sudden the lights were turned out. The lounge had closed at 11, the staff didn't even come and ask if we wanted something for last call or let us know they were closing. All of us just sat kinda shocked in the dim light looking at the staff as they picked up their personak belongings and walked out. They didn't even say good night or anything. Some platinum service. Our concierge Alex Vera though He made us feel appreciated. Otherwise the enterainment was good, the grounds are immaculate and beautiful.

Obviously going back to Mexico a year later you tend to compare everything. The really good things about the resort are the rooms - our standard junior suite was really nice & modern with enough storage space with everything you need. Our only grumble would be that we found ants in our coffee machine and they let us run out of toilet roll. They quickly put all this right though once brought to their attention. Whilst talking about the rooms, bring mosquito spray!!! We don't normally get bitten but they seem particularly thirsty at this resort. The resort is a mixture of young, loud drunks or more reserved like ourselves. If you don't like the beach and you like peace & quiet then you won't like this resort. The beach is beautiful, white powder and very clean. If you turn left and walk past the roped off platinum area you come to an adults only section of the beach which is lovely & peaceful but a bit of a walk to the nearest toilet. There is also waitress service for drinks on this section of the beach. I have read a previous comment about a section of the beach smelling. This is true but its only a very small section if you walk further on in either direction the beach is like paradise. Can I just add there is also plenty of beds so no need to get up at 6 a.m. with your towel. With regards to food & drink, this is why I make comparisons to El Dorado, we picked the Riviera Princess as it stated gourmet food, (same as El Dorado) but there is no comparison. El Dorado is a dining experience at every meal! Whereas Riviera Princess tries but doesn't quite get there. I ordered a fillet beef meal in the Oriental restaurant Miso and what turned up I could only describe as stewing steak. We enjoyed Mamma Mia and The Grill was also quite nice although I had a dodgy tummy the day after, however I do have a sensitive tummy to spicy food. At lunch time you have a choice of getting something on the beach i.e. burger, hot dog or there are two lovely restaurants nearby with lovely salads and pasta's etc. which we opted for. The staff are fabulous, really happy and helpful. Service is very good, apart from maybe breakfast time. Unless you get there at 7 a.m. you sometimes wait a while for tea & coffee. The welcome we received at reception was wonderful, a big smile and a cold glass of bubbly which we really appreciated after such a long flight. Please don't let any bad reviews put you off this resort, but if you like fine dining try El Dorado, however you will have a fabulous time at either.

Here are my thoughts: Room We had a \"basic\" room and found it plenty large enough. It was kept spotlessly clean. As others have said, the bathroom lacks a bit in that there is not a lot of privacy but I think that this is pretty typical of resorts. We were in Building 6 at the top floor (there is only a ground level and then two other floors) and thought it was great. We took the stairs all the time but if you need to use an elevator, you might want a lower floor as there were remarkably few elevators in the buildings (all are connected). A few reviews have mentioned how great the swim out rooms were. Honestly, I only saw a couple of people use that accessibility and you lost so much privacy by being right on the pool that I would have hated that. The beds and pillows are hard. I love that and slept great but if you like a soft mattress, you are not going to be happy. The Food We did about half of our nights in the buffet and the other in the al le carte restaurants. The food was good in both - not really amazing but very good. While a couple of the restaurants are supposed to be limited to platinum guests only, we booked them without any trouble. Not sure why that was, but just ask. Book the restaurants early though. Any complaints here about a lack of variety in the buffet are misguided. Drinks It is Mexican beer. The taps say Corona but I doubt it. It is watered down but is OK. The beer is the room fridges is not even that good. Perhaps the least flavourful beer I have ever tasted. There is house red and white wine available everywhere and at all meals. It was not very good but we ordered modestly priced reds a few nights for dinner and it was actually worse in every instance. Either drink the house wine or spend some over $40 on a bottle. The alcohol was all brand name and very good. No complaints there. The Pools We spend very little time at the pools but there are a huge number of pools and are generally very sparsely used. In the middle of the afternoon you might have a 50/50 chance of finding at least one pool with only a few people in it. There seemed to be enough chairs even in the shade but I did see some people \"reserve\" chairs so you may wish to that too. The Beach As other's have said, the beach is busy and somewhat crowded. If you want shade, go down there BEFORE breakfast and stake out your chairs. The beach itself is very nice but there are quite a few rocks in the water. Water shoes are worth bringing. The water is clean and generally not too rough although has limited snorkeling opportunities. Activities We sailed a couple of times. It was free and fun with only a little instruction. The staff were always doing something so, if one wanted, there was something to do. We rented a sea-do for half an hour but at $65 was a little expensive. Nightlife They do a great job at this if you are not twenty something looking to !!!PARTY!!! (which I am not). The bands/atmosphere is suited to an older (40ish) crowd. Service Generally the service everywhere was great aside from the room cleaning. The rooms themselves were always spotless but on three days we either were not left with towels or our bar was not stocked. And lest you think this was because we did not tip the staff, we did everyday. The restaurant staff were generally good if not particularly attentive. There were a number of very great staff members though. Walking This deserves it's own heading given the number of complaints previously. It was not bad at all. We rarely walked from the beach to the lobby at at once but even so, it might be a 10-12 minutes \"resort saunter\". And it was really a very nice walk. I could see during extremely hot weather that it would not be that fun, but that was not our experience. Another word about the food for vegetarians I am a vegetarian and was disappointed by the lack of variety for me generally. There was variety but very little hot food. And, so much of the food was inaccurately labeled. (i.e. Some dish would be labeled as eggplant but also, I would find out, had ground beef.) In all but the seafood restaurant (of those we tried at least), there was an option for me though and it was very good. In a couple of instances, I had to order off menu but the staff were good about it. Overall The place is great and, if there were not a hundred other great resorts to go to, I would happily go back. It was not so great though that I am anxious to go back.

( I will get into travelling with our son below) I'll start by saying the hotel and hotel grounds are PERFECT! Not a blade of grass out of place or a dust bunny to be found anywhere. I would honestly say in this regard, the hotel is 5+ star. THE BAD: For us, it was the food and bar service that were sub par. We have been to the Mayan Riviera 4 times and we are used to a better variety and higher quality food and drinks. We are anything but picky eaters, but some of the food reminded me of a truck stop. The buffet restaurants are tiny compared to any other buffet I've seen which lead to lineups for everything. Also, unless you strategically place yourself during the day, you will likely have a long walk to get a drink because the bars are few and far between on the beach and by the pools (unless you are going for a swim; there are lots of swim up bars). There are people that go around taking drink orders but it took a while to get your drink and then for them to come back. THE GOOD! We emailed the resort ahead of time to request a room set up. We were traveling with our 18 month old son and Grandma. We requested adjoining rooms in a quiet area of the resort with a possible pool and ocean view. We also requested a crib. When we checked in, we were told we got exactly what we asked for, and they didn't lie. I could not have hand picked the rooms better myself. The rooms were very clean and very nice. We paid the extra for the deluxe junior suites which was well worth it for some extra room and a bath tub for the baby. We had both pool and ocean view. Very nice. Although the beach area isn't huge, we didn't have an issue finding three loungers together ever. The beach is similar to every other resort we have been to in the Mayan Riviera. There is the odd rock in the water, but you can manage without shoes. We brought a bucket and shovel and water toys down for the baby to play in the sand and pool/ocean, but you can buy them at the resort to. Some of the pools actually provided toys for the little ones to play with. TRAVELING WITH BABY We flew down with Air Canada which was great. We didn't pay for an extra seat so he just sat on our laps. It was a long flight but not a big deal. After much research, we decided to leave the car seat at home. This was a decision we didn't regret. It was fine on the bus to the resort, and we even took a taxi into Playa And he just sat on our laps. We figured that even if we brought the car seat, we wouldnt be lugging it around Playa all day shopping anyway, so it had no use. Many of the busses and taxi are not set up to take a car seat. We brought our big valco stroller which was great on the beach and around the bumpy streets and paths. It is a big stroller, so we just checked it and used a baby carrier in the airport. The hotel was very child friendly. The crib was waiting in our room when we arrived just as we had requested. High chairs were readily available in every restaurant we ate at, and they were very accommodating even in the a la carte restaurants. Some of the a la cartes are adult only which is nice if you want a romantic dinner out. There are shallow kids pools in several spots around the resort which were great. Lots of cabanas for shade. We never had an issue with finding a shady spot. The restaurant staff were very friendly and always trying to make the little one laugh. They love the kiddies.

We avoided much of the rocky bottom by heading into the water on the south side of the beach, yet there was an obnoxious sewer-like odor, until you got about 100 meters into the ocean.

We only saw one cockroach in the sunset side buffet - which we didn't think too bad considering the climate. In fact we only saw six cockroaches during our entire trip - which was nice. A couple of days into our vacation our wallet was stolen (from our locked room) containing both of our credit cards and ID and a small amount of cash. I was determined this would not ruin our trip - we were staying at an all inclusive and we could cancel our cards. Except it did. Nobody at front desk would allow us to make the calls to cancel out cards. Staff said they would have to pay out of their own money if we wanted to call to cancel the cards. So we used the phone in our room to cancel the cards - and just hoped they could forward the bill to us in Canada after we left. The phone bill for two phone calls (total of 8 minutes) cost $1045 pesos. That's $80 US. When it came time to check out concierge got aggressive. We could not leave until the bill was paid.

The beach was very nice, and even though we are more \"pool people\" than beach people, we did spend time down on the beach enjoying the atmosphere.

This was our 3rd trip to Mexico and our 1st with family so it had to be better than any we had been on before as we had raved on so much about Mexico. Well we were not let down. Hotel... was fantastic, at first we thought it was huge and we would never find our way around. There are shuttle buses to take you around so the size of the place is no problem.Reception Lobby, staff very helpful and friendly . As a wedding party we expected just the bride and groom to get a room upgrade, but to our delight are whole party was upgraded, also we were all in the same corridor which was fantastic. Room... upgraded to a jaccuzi suite, room was a good size with a balcony..cleaned every day as were our towels and as a bridal couple we had turn down service with a little treat every evening.Even though we had not asked for this. We were also given 2 bottles of Tequilla,which pleased my partener no end. Frdge stocked daily, but if you need more water you can get it at the ice machine in the hall way' Pools... Plenty of room at the spotless pools although to be honest we preferred the beach as we had small children. Pool towels in the plentyful, we kept ours and changed them in the morning before breakfast. Beach....Lovely soft sand, loads of room, bare in mind we needed it as there was 10 adults, 1 4yr old, 1 18mth old and a 5week old baby with pushchair and uv tent. Beach bar (WITH coffee) and a supply of fresh bottle water.Tip, you can fill your empty water bottle up here. BBQ daily all day on the beach, burgers, hotdogs, salad and a freshly cooked fish dish.The one thing missing here and around the pools is NO ICE CREAM. You can get it in the buffet resturant, but have to eat it there. Food.... We ate everywhere, Buffet for breakie, if not on the beach at the bbq then lunch too. Loads to choose from, one of our party is a vegetarian, she was stuffed at every meal. Worst resturant for us was the mexican, the best the Steak house, the most interesting the Fondue..that is a must. Those who are worried about the food....dont...there is something for every one, well cooked and presented beautifully. Entertainment...by the main outside bar something different each night repeated on a weekly rota. Shows upstairs, excellent the best I have seen yet on my travels. The only one we had a problem with was the horror show, it scared the kids and we had to leave. If you just want to chill out the is the bar up by the lobby, if youve teenagers or like a game of pool there is the games room. Also my girls enjoyed the Nightclub even with the \"chatup lines\" from the locals.They never felt threatened or harrased. Security were very good at showing them the way back to their rooms,lol. Wedding Package..... I cannot say enougth about my wedding it was brilliant, the gazebo was decorated beautifully,the flowers just amazing, service was not too long, just 25 mins,we took our own music on a cd to play at the ceromony and took our own photos. We had our meal in the steak resturant, certinly the best choice, it was amazing thanks to our coordinator Emma. Also the Vanilla wedding cake was the best I have ever tasted. Trips... we only did one and that was to Coba, because there was a lot of us we wanted a trip that offered a lot and was value for money. If thats what you are after then go to Coba...1st you are taken to a mayan villiage...then to the pryamid which is awsome, I did not climb it as I cant stand Heights, but apparently the view is stunning.

Even though it was nov/dec we still took bug killerspray, wipes and plug ins...we still got bites, so slaver it on well, I missed my feet out one night and was bitten by mossies, mind you they like me anyway even in the uk.

There was an accident there and the resort closed there and we were left scrambling at the last minute for another resort in which it was difficult as there wasn't much available by then,!!!! We booked at Iberostar Lindo and absolutely loved it.So we thought we would book for this past 2011 New Year's.WE paid extra and booked a swim out suite on the Riviera side.Upon arriving there we were told that the hotel was full and that they would upgrade us to the platinum side. We thought .WOW that's great.Well.... Upon arriving to our suite !!!!! It was not an upgrade it was more of a down grade.The room stunk of mildew,all bedding was wet,no chairs on balcony or table ( All other rooms and suites on the normal side had table and chairs...)And our view was a bush and an empty section. If we wanted to be on a secluded bush we would have booked it that way.Oh and lets not forget we had booked a room with a king bed and got 2 double beds in which my husband had to sleep in seperate beds. We complained in the morning and had to wait all day for another room. It went from bad to worse .They moved us to the sunset side which it is an older property. Now still that side is not as nice and is cheaper and we paId for the Riviera and not sunset. again 2 beds , no sun no welcoming gifts . So back to the front desk again. we were not the only ones not being accomodated, Alot of people were complaining.Third day there and we were still not unpacked,we had to call our travel agent to move us to another property.Just then did they accomodate us and gave us the room that we paid for. We wasted 3 days. The food is very limited ,Service and entertainment were terrible.Water in the pool dirty and water level very low and the paint at in the bottom of the pool all coming off .No repairs are being done.New Year's feast was your everyday normal buffet.New years party... Well there was none !!The guest made their own party.No where to dance so everyone just jumped in the lobby fountains with water and danced in there.We do not know what happened to that resort it went from great to terrible.We spent allot of money going out to eat since the food at the resort was awfull. The list of bad is just too long to list. So please think twice about booking there if that is where you are thinking of going.

We had a really fabulous vacation, however, when we go back to this area i think we would choose a different resort. A couple of reasons for that.... we found the resort just a little too large. Of course the explosion here has shut down a number of the amenities until the building is repaired.... so we found that it was a little inconvenient with only half of the resorts breakfast restaurants on the one end closed. We stayed close to the beach, so any time we wanted to go to dinner or lunch or a show or our excursions it was quite the trip up to the front of the resort. we would have to leave ourselves a lot of extra time just to navigate up to the front. Also we didn't find the food overly enjoyable. The fruit and veggies were spectacular! However, we found most of the meats extremely dry in the buffet. We also really started to get bored with some of the things offered in the buffets. We really like to travel to new places and indulge in local specialties that we don't usually see at home. At this resort there were a lot of hot dogs and hamburgers and not much authentic mexican food. Also, it was a shame that the bars closed so early in the day! After 4:30 if you wanted a drink you had to go all the way up to the front of the resort. The biggest enjoyment on this trip was our room! It was fabulous! We opted for the swim out room and enjoyed it immensely! It was so convenient to be able to get in the water right outside our door. we definitely loved that! The room itself was also great. Huge shower! Nice jetted tub! The snorkelling and swimming off the beach was also amazing! A lot of little fish around. However, paying 5 bucks to rent a beach chair is a joke!!

The rooms are stylish and spacious (and ours was a standard room/suite), marble bathrooms, flat TV, all mod cons. The grounds are lovely, perfectly manicured and well looked after. Yes, one has to walk a bit from the rooms or buffet restaurants to the beach, but it is a very nice walk. Yes, the floor is slippery when wet, but there are plenty of signs reminding you to be careful when walking on wet surfaces. The pools are very nice, swim-up bar staff lovely, and the activities fun. And the best thing is that you can take it or leave it: there are plenty of quieter spots if you just want to read a book and sunbathe, or plenty of activity if that is your thing. The beach is a bit stoney, so I'd recommend water shoes if you like swimming in the sea. The sea is wonderfully clear, and full of life. Food is good, both at the buffet and a la carte restaurants. We were there for 2 weeks, and didn't get bored! Service is also good. Staff seemed to be happy working there, and I always find that makes a big difference. The evening \"acts\" before dinner are quite good. We only seen 2 of the daily evening show organised by the entertainment team, which were also good. We had an 11 year old girl in our party (my friend's daughter), and it was good as something to do with her after dinner. Otherwise I'd probably wouldn't have gone. We went to the disco twice, and had a good time, but thought they should mix the music up a bit - too \"electronic\" for my taste (I'm an 80's & 90's kinda girl). Anyway, all in all a great holiday.

Please don't believe the bad reviews...expectations can be difficult to meet for some people. We stayed in the Platinum Yucatan, junior deluxe suites, which is separate from the 2 main resorts/builiding - Sunset and Riviera. It is a large resort, but good for a walk after the meals and buffets! Our room was cleaned every day and restocked every day. The first day we forgot to leave a tip and recieved the bare minimum, but the rest of the week was well stocked/cleaned as we left a tip every morning. Our room was musty smelling, so we lit the incense provided in the room, every afternoon after we came back from the beach. Ask for matches at the conceirge if you don't have a lighter. We could never seem to get the room cool at night because we left for the beach in the morning and when the staff came in to clean, the took the room key out of the \"on\" switch for the room. We were all the way at the other end of the resort from the beach, so we never walked back to put the key back in and turn the A.C. on. Laziness and cervesas on the beach got the best of us. Sleeping with the balcony door open and ceiling fan on was ok and we were able to get a night's rest that way. Perhaps you could elect a runner each day to go and put the key back in the switch to make your room cool? Mexican restaurant was great! Not sure why the bad reviews? You're not getting what you think of for Mexican (tacos, enchilladas, burritos) but instead some upscale cuisine - chicken mole, fajitas, shmanshy salads. Again, great meal! All the staff was great, especially Ruth and Filiberto at the Platinum Yucatan pool bar! Ask for the \"Ticket to Ride\" from Filiberto... yummy frozen drink! The beach is lovely - white sand that never gets hot! The water was rough during our stay, which is typical for winter, so I heard.

Having been in Mexico 3 times before (total about 3 months time) and travelled to various parts of mexico, I was disappointed that the Riviera Princess did not incorporate more authentic 'Mexicanness' into the ambience of the resort. (ie - food, decor, music, entertainment etc.) We stayed in the platinum area by the beach. This includes private pool, own bar, free room service, able to order from menu at buffets, enclosed platinum area at beach. Platinum suite: nice, full of marble - jacuzzi in bathroom and 1 on balcony as well. about 25 channels. Aircon. never really worked during our time there; wi-fi was sporadic as well. Main problem was the pungent mould smell that we couldn't get rid of. Concierge said they would 'look at the filters and give them a cleaning (?), but the situation didn't improve. Beach & Pools The beach would have been better without so many vendors. If you want to rent: a hoby -$40/half hour jetski -$60/half hour get a picture taken with an iguana, monket, toucan - $12-36 per photo Beach drinks are heavily watered down. Beach food is nothing special - burgers, hotdogs, mediocre ceviche - one day they had paella which was good. Pools - Platinum area -put a towel down there before 8 - people mark their territory early and then lounge all day! Other pool areas - all shallow. pools only open 8am-8pm(what? no night swimming?) Service Only ordered room service once - took 45 minutes. This was early in morn. good for convenience, food lukewarm. Concierge - booked us a bunch of a la carte restaurants but had some hassle in that they don't do reservations bigger than groups of 5 - so on christmas day (also a birthday in family) they refused to seat us all together even though there were many tables free. We had to make a fuss in order to push the tables together. What was the big deal? Generally all the waitstaff and barstaff are very friendly and kind especially if you speak spanish and tip. some were better at joking around than others. Food & Drink This would have to be the weakest point of this place. If you like the quality of buffet restaurants like Mandarin, you will be okay with the food here. This goes for both the buffet and the a la carte restaurants ( we tried fondue, teppanyaki, seafood, and the steakhouse). If you do not like buffet/cafeteria quality, than you will be dissapointed. For drinks - is it too much to ask for real fruit juice? not Tang or powdered juice? Or powdered milk(coffeemate), or hotsauces not made out of the can? or a little higher quality liquor and drink mixes? the Pina coladas were... sweet... little alcohol content.. Any mixes that come in neon blue, bright pink is just downright gross! If you can serve fresh pineapple, why can't we get some of that in juice form??!!! I think quality is better than quantity, so instead of offering a crazy variety of food, they should concentrate on getting a number of dishes right - if you can eat better at a roadside stand for like 30 pesos, than why can't they achieve that here with all the money the vacationers are paying? If the resort wants to be five-star, they have to train chefs better or hire better chefs, and if something is ordered from the menu, it should be hot, and cooked then and there. Premade does not cut it. Ambience The grounds are immaculate, but lots of 'don't slip' pylons everywhere. The rooms and buildings are clean and well-kept (except for that mould smell problem ). I think they should have spent less money on marble-clad everything, and more on the food - ie. hire better chefs, train them better) All in all, I was glad to have gone in that I got to swim in the ocean and have micheladas and eat crazy amounts of tortilla chips and guacamole, and not have to wash dishes or cook and catch some sun and hang out with family - but If you are more into experiencing the culture of a country, staying at this resort re-affirmed my preference for solo travelling dislike for all-inclusive vacations Hope this review helps.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cOverall Great Holiday, DON'T LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS ABOUT THE BEACH!!\u201d", "Author": "C1areEngland", "ReviewID": "UR122419908", "Content": "Firstly the hotel, country and weather were beautiful.

We are a dinner party group that enjoy our cocktails and needed to RELAX! We booked our trip through American Express and got a great deal, each couple booking Platinum Suites. We booked before the explosion and traveled after, so even though I spoke to American Express AND called the resort directly we were NOT in Platinum Suites (that's where the explosion was, see other reviews for details), we were put in the rooms above the swim outs. (NOTE: we were continuously put off when asking about being moved to Platinum on the Sunset side or to swim outs, not told no, just 'maybe later' and 'check back' , resort really just needs to be honest and communicate!) After exploring the resort we decided the rooms we had were actually better. The Platinum area is nice but TINY compared to the # of platinum rooms, so the pool area never had a free bed. However, we just had to walk down a level and behind our building to the swim outs and we had a private area with a bar (and a server that usually delivered your drinks, tips were appreciated but never asked for), ice cream machine and the choice of sun or covered lounge chairs, as well as using the swim out loungers in the water for the rooms that weren't occupied! Perfect! Rooms were large and clean. Lovely large bathroom with double sinks, plenty of room. Small sofa and table suitable for breakfast, and a great balcony that overlooks the pool we occupied most often. We did venture out to the 'main' pool for a couple of days, much more active, of course, & large swim up bar that was very busy. My favorite part of this pool and the reason I returned a couple of times were the circular in-pool seating areas, so you could get in and out of the water, put your feet up, have a place for your drink, read your kindle and relax! It was hot enough that you really wanted to be in the water while you were sunning and this was perfect! The only problem in this area was a child that while supervised (his adults right next to him chatting in a foreign language) was still allowed to climb up on the cement edge and JUMP into the seating area, making the largest splash possible right next to you, totally dousing you, your kindle or book and your drink! I finaly looked right at him and told him to cut it out! HE DID speak english and said \"what, I'm alllowed!\" and did it a few more times for spite. When we didn't move he got bored and went away but REALLY! My husband and I are the only couple with kids in our group but we didn't travel with them this time and so didn't check out any of the kid related areas or activities. Beach was beautiful, plenty of loungers with thatched roof palapas, small bar for drinks, that was always very busy! No problem getting restaurant reservations, but we didn't mind being flexible with the time that we ate. We ate one night each at the seafood, grill, tempanyaki and fondue restaurants, and twice at the Mexican restaurant. The grill was decent, had a lovely veal chop, but the room was incredibly hot! We were a large party, they were only able to accommodate us right near the grill, and they didn't seem to be able to control the air conditioning. Teppan-Yaki was lovely and fun, too much food! The fried rice was excellent, but then I was so full I couldn't finish the rest of the meal! Fondue was one of our favorites, something for everyone and great fun to pass food around the table! Our experiences at the Mexican restaurant were perfect examples of how service can make or break a meal. The first evening we ate there we had so much fun that the next morning we changed one of our reservations so that we could eat at the Mexican restaurant one more time. The second time we ate there it wasn't nearly as good! Not so much a problem with the food, as it was of course, the same, but our server the first evening was wonderful! Joking and kidding, passing out shots, generally encouraging fun. Second visit, waiter much more quiet and laid-back, and we didn't have nearly as much fun! By the way, they infuse their own tequilas at the Mexican restaurant, ask about them, definitely try the hot pepper tequila, wonderful! For reference, we have also stayed at the Melia in PV, the Iberostar Tucan and the Grand Mayan. I would the Mayan was the nicest but due to not 'really' being all inclusive was much more expensive. Once I'm on vacation I don't want to count my money! I would also rate the Melia and the Tucan above the Princess, as the overall quality of the resort was better. Platinum was worth it, even without the correct rooms, just for the included room service (just about every morning and late afternoon! The club sandwich was GREAT!) and for the towels\u2026if you are Platinum they have beach towels stacked up in the Platinum lounge for you, and you just leave them in your room or on your lounger, as they don't make you trade them in or keep track - SO worth not freaking out about forgetting your towel or someone taking it! Service was above average, smiling people everywhere, but no one really stood out except our bartender in the Platinum lounge - knew our names by the 2nd day and made a GREAT mojito - a REAL one, with actual FRESH MINT! (rare at resorts in Mexico in my experience). All in all, we had a wonderful time, but will probably not return soon as we are on a quest for the \"perfect all inclusive\" and so will continute to try new resorts! If we do go back, we will do the Platinum Villas though, Platinum service (you can't get that with the swim outs I guess) and the villas were beautiful, separate pool, nicer than the regular platinum pool and a much better ratio, so the pool was never crowded, it always looked peaceful and beautiful when we walked by!)

It\u2019s fairly long, I hope it is useful to some of you. Resort Huge and beautiful resort with plenty of bars where you can eat, drink or just have a seat and chill out. There is a theatre with shows every night at 9.30 pm. In addition to this, you can see a show at 8.30pm at the central plaza of the resort. If you want to buy souvenirs and stuff like that, you have a souvenir shop, a jewelry store and even a photography studio. However, they are very expensive and most of the things they sell you can buy in Playa del Carmen at half of the price, so in our opinion they are not worth it, don't waste your money in there. There is a kids club which we did not use, but we saw how they take the kids to the buffet and pools and it seemed they were having fun. Areito is the name of the night club. We never went there, so there's not too much I can tell about it. The hotel is far from the main road, so if you want to go to Playa del Carmen you need to take a taxi, which are $195 MXN each way. Pools As you can see in the photos, there is this huge pool all over the buildings. The good thing about this is that you never feel the place is overcrowded, you can perfectly swim and you can always find a free lounge chair. The pools are very clean, every time we went there were are least two employees cleaning the pool and testing the water. Beach It's narrow, but long enough for everybody. The water is clean; there were some seaweeds, but maybe it was because of the season. We didn\u2019t notice any funny smells or weird water colour as some reviews report. If you get hungry or thirsty, there are several beach bars where you can order a drink and in one of them, food (such as tacos, nachos, carnitas, shrimps, hot dogs, burgers, etc.). This is part of the all inclusive program, so they don't charge you extra for this. Overall, we liked the beach. Don't worry if you see some coatis in the surrounding area, they are very friendly and tame. Food and drinks Now, I will talk about the food. I know that this is a very subjective aspect of the resort, so opinions may vary a lot about it. In general, the food is good and the buffet is pretty well organized. As soon as you enter, there is this staff member that puts you in a table and the waiter brings whatever you want to drink. It is not like in other resorts where you seat wherever you want and feel that kind of \"disorganized and people fighting for the food\" atmosphere. I won't talk about the variety because it's pretty much like in every buffet. There's also a chef that cooks you pasta, meat or fish in the way you ask him to. I asked him for spaghetti bolognese and they were nice. The quality is good, I mean, we never felt the food was bad or anything. Dinner buffet is themed every night; American, Chinese, Spanish, Italian, Mexican, etc. night. The food is good and the food choices are reasonably authentic. My S.O. is from Spain and his opinion about the food on \u201cSpanish night\u201d is that is was good, varied and reasonably authentic. About the thematic restaurants, we recommend \"La Fondue\", and \"La Vaqueria\"; both restaurants were outstanding. We have read \"Mamma Mia\" is great too. We tried \"Las Olas\" which is the fish and seafood restaurant. This one is not part of the all inclusive program unless you are in a deluxe suite or higher, and if you want to eat there, you will have to pay about 350 pesos each. Honestly, it's not worth it, so save your money. Room Our room was amazing! There was a shower and a jacuzzi, bed was kingsize and we had a lovely view of the resort from our balcony. Another good point, and this is something you don't find in many hotels, is that the security box is big, and when I say big I mean you have enough space to put there a laptop and the rest of your belongings. Staff Very friendly, professional and organized. We broke the key of our room by accident and they gave us another one for free. It was a surprise, we were not charged for this and told there was not a problem at all. It's funny. We read right before going to this resort that staff doesn't work properly if you don't tip. We never tipped, and the service was just perfect! We even left about 15 pesos on the table of our room, and the maid never touched them. I mean, she could have assumed that it was a tip, but she didn't. That made us feel very safe about our belongings in the room and we never heard about people being robbed. There are several things we have read in other reviews, such as that they don\u2019t spray the gardens for bugs, which is not true, since we saw them spraying at least once a week. The golf carts that move you from the resort to the beach are always on time. By the way, it is only about 10 minutes from the lobby to the beach at ta leisurely pace. The staff never once came into the room without knocking first and waiting for us to open the door. Our room was always kept clean, and when we left the sign to make up our room on the door, the maid came usually withing the hour to do it. Our suitcases were taken to and from the room by the bellboys without any problem, and they showed up to pick our luggage at the time requested. Overall, we are very satisfied with our experience at the Grand Riviera Princess, and it is probably the best resort we have stayed in, as compared to RIU, Meli\u00e1, etc. We definitely would be back and not hesitate to recommend to our friends.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWARNING PASSPORTS STOLEN\u201d", "Author": "Ken f", "ReviewID": "UR122242787", "Content": "Both my sons had thier passports stolen from their in room safe , apparently 5 others in the resort had theirs stolen same day, inside job I say, did not touch cell phones our wallets, just passports, Canadian consulate says hotel is well know for this kind of theft", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201c5 stars.....\u201d", "Author": "Richy_Bobby", "ReviewID": "UR122184689", "Content": "Top notch resort, with superb service, great food and beautiful facilities.

You can get within 10' of water and I never felt a need to be closer. There are a few chairs you can rent, that will get you a foot and a half closer, but whats the point.... The beach is rocky in places, but move over 5' and it's sand. Warm water, that you can walk out a long way and still be shallow. Mostly families and couples, which means lots of screaming kids..probably not ideal for singles...

The Yucatan rooms are part of the Riviera/Sunset resort but are in a separate 18+ area of the resort and are allowed all of the same privileges given to Platinum resort guests. Our room featured swim-up pool access directly from our patio area. This is the second time we have stayed in a Princess Resort and gone with the Platinum option - Again, it was totally worth it! Our room was a nice size with tasteful decor. Beds were comfortable and our linens were clean. The bathroom had a whirlpool tub and his and her sinks. My only complaint was that the marble floors in the rooms/patio could get really slick and if your feet were wet, it wouldn't be hard to fall. We left $1 to $2 everyday for the mini-bar guy (with a note listing how many beers/pops/waters etc we wanted) in fridge so that he would fill it up as full as possible. Some days he even left extras sitting out on our dresser b/c there wasn't any more room in the fridge. We also left a $1 or $2 for housekeeping. The maids did a fantastic job. Everyday our room looked like we had never even been there. They also left all new towels every morning. Most days, we would wake up early, hit the Sunset or Riviera breakfast buffet (loads of different choices: omlet bar, scrambled eggs, frittatas, 2 and 3 types of sausage or bacon, homefries/hashbrowns, pancakes, french toast, waffles,fresh bread, bagels, pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit, cheese, cereal etc). (Our neighbours ordered room service in most mornings for breakfast and they said it was great.) Then we would spend the morning swimming in the pool. Ruth (the butler for the Yucatan bar) and Adolfo (the bartender) were awesome. Ruth was attentive and friendly and would always take a few minutes to chat with us to ensure that we were enjoying our stay and that we didn't have any questions or problems. Usually by noon or so, the sun was on the far side of our building and that meant the pool wasn't getting any direct sun so we'd head to the beach. The Grand Riviera/Sunset resort is massive! We were there a week and I'm positive that we didn't see it all. Luckily, there are electric golf-carts driven by the staff that will shuttle you from the lobby area down to the beach and back. We found this very helpful. The Princess beach area was HUGE. Seriously, you could always find a beach chair, but you may have to walk further down the beach to get to it. My only complaint about the ocean is that it is very rocky anywhere other than in front of the main beach by the vendors. It can be a bit of a trek if you are further down on the beach and have to walk back to the main beach in order to go swimming. If I had taken other reviewers advice, I would've packed water shoes... There are beach bars with awesome service and a BBQ booth where you can get freshly cooked, hamburgers, hotdogs and nachos. Everything we tried was tasty. After spending the afternoon at the beach, we'd head back to our room and get showered and ready for dinner. We opted out of eating at the a la carte restaurants...it took us a couple days to remember that we had this option and by then most of the early times were booked, so we stuck with the buffet. Each night there was plenty of variety. Some nights were better than others (steak and lobster night were delish. Spanish night with rabbit and other weird stuff,,,not so much) but there were always lots of foods to choose from and there was always a station that had tasty familiar food if you weren't digging the choices from the theme night. There's also a 24 hr sports bar called 5th Ave over in the Sunset resort near the lobby that had hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries, nachos and cheese etc. all day and night if you got hungry. The staff at the Princess were always busy cleaning, gardening, painting, helping guests etc. All staff were super helpful and friendly regardless if you tipped or not. They make a concious effort to make your stay perfect. The resort is beautiful and even though there are a lot of people at the resort, it's so big that you never feel like you're being crowded. We had a great stay! Feel free to email if you have any questions.

I must say that the first thing that comes to mind when i think of the GRP is the word \"Pristine\". This place is kept immaculate. The grounds are really spotless. You will see people all day long working on the upkeep. It seemed to us that you could not even find a blade of grass out of place. This resort is huge. But not as big as many of these reviews make it seem. The walk from the lobby to the beach is about 10 minutes. The walk winds through this beautiful place lined with Mayan Statues and perfect landscaping so it makes the walk a pleasant one. There are lots of pools so that what ever mood your in you have a choice. If you want to party and listen to loud music you can. if you want to just chill and relax you will find a pool for that also. We stayed in a swim up suite and we loved it. If you are getting hot you just take 3 steps off your balcony and you will be in the pool. A 2 minute swim to the pool bar for a cocktail and then back to relax on your water lounger right in front of your room. We took our Bubba mugs and the bartenders had no problem filling them up. They will keep your drink cold and they are much bigger than the cups from the bar. This makes for less trips. Food at the buffets was pretty good. There is a huge variety so we never had a problem finding something we liked. We loved breakfast. Nothing like having a fresh omelet made right in front of you. We ate dinner at the steak house twice because we loved it. The seafood restaurant and Miso Japanese were also very good. We loved hanging outside every night up by the lobby. They had a live band playing every night. For the price you really can't beat this place. The employees were all so friendly. The grounds are beautiful. There is plenty of food and drink and you are only a 10-20 minute taxi ride to Playa del Carmen. I found the overall experience to be great. I don't understand why people have too nit pik about the little things when they are on vacation.This place is not 5 stars but i give it a solid 4 stars. I've learned through my travels that if you want the best you have to pay for the best.

They all have there own personality with pro's and con's with each. First let me say that anyone that says the walk from the main lobby to the beach is more then 20 mins must have physical limits because I did it in 7 mins several times a day. Its really not that big of deal. We stayed in a Villa Suite. The perks included with the suite were great and spoiled us. We had free Wi-Fi in our suite and a special pool with a bar a Pool Concierge. The Villa was the quietest room I have ever stayed in. Room service was included and we had breakfast on our veranda every morning. The server set the table so lovely every-morning. We spent a lot of time at the Villa pool. Even on beach days, we would end the day with the quiet at the Villa pool. They had a snack table set up with small sandwiches and chips and salsa everyday. People that complain about the Beach must not be willing to \"walk\" (again) to the north end. There were plenty of lounges and no vendors. There signs that state adult only. Its so peaceful and you can put your lounge right up to the waters front. You get an ocean breeze which is also delightful. This area also has another beach bar that is not so busy. The waiters took great care to keep us with a drink at all times. A special shout out to Paty! The center area of the beach is the area you hit first when you cross the center bridge of the property. It is crowded. The air is not moving. No breeze. Alot of children and yes, vendors. This is also where the daily barbecue lunch is set up. The far south end of the beach is the Chillout area. Its $10.00 per person a day. The lounges are padded and the music is spa music. Its nice. Has a bar and very nice rest rooms. We spent the last day there. However, the service was lacking. We had to go get out own drinks several times. The liquor is better quality and you can definitely taste the difference. Also pretty glass cocktail glasses, but still, not worth the price. Had the service been excellent, I would say it was worth it. The swimming from the beach was more difficult at this resort. As long as we had on our water shoes we were fine, but there are rocks as you walk out in the water. We walked by the party pool everyday and they were having fun. There are definitely some swimout rooms that I would watch out for if you dont want the noise of the party pool. Actually back to the subject of accommodations.... I think that the accommodations you choose at this resort definitely will have an impact on your stay. There is something for everyone here. You need to choose your accommodations wisely. I am a stickler about this. Its part of being a travel agent. Its kind of like there are several different types of resorts all at the same place here. Party, Family, and Adult spa type atmosphere's all at one resort.. It really does work, and I have to say this is the first place I have seen this work so well on one property. The newest block of rooms are the Yucatan swimout suites. This area is also adult only, as are the Villa suites. The Yucatan block is at the far north of the Riviera lobby. I agree with most of the reviews when it comes to the food. Its is by all means not bad at all. Just nothing to rave about. Honestly, the best food we had was at the Buffet dinners. The seared Tuna steak was to die for and the sushi with small lobster tails were also great. The \"A la Carte Restaurants\" were hit and miss. IF I were to stay there again, I wouldnt bother with them. They all lacked atmosphere and 2 of the 3 we did had VERY slow service. One thing I want to point out about Restaurant atmosphere. They are all in the same building which has windows and commercial \"store front\" doors which really is kinda odd for what they are trying to accomplish with having A la Carte Restaurants. Picture a strip mall. Men must wear long pants and closed toe shoes at the A la Carte's and they are strict about it. Entertainment. The court yard is the place to be in the evenings and I have to say this is one of the nicest area's for evening entertainment that I have seen at an A.I. resort. There is a Band Stand and Bar and it was fun every night. There is a theater with some kind of a production every night, but I must say, a bit corny. I am used to the production shows on cruise ships. These are more like the Jr. High School productions. We saw two weddings take place while we were there. One in the beach gazebo and one at the chillout. The Gazebo wedding was the nicest. Everyone was very pleasant. Our room stewards, room service, mini bar service, EVERYONE was very nice and aimed to please. The chillout was the only poor service which really is ironic considering what you are paying for in this area. Grounds. The grounds are spectacular. Absolutely gorgeous. They even stencil in the Princess crown in the sand of the ash trays. Very nice. I want to mention Value. When I originally booked this week in Cancun, I was booked at an adult only resort. A few weeks later I noticed that the Grand Riviera had a rate that was more then half less then I was paying and it also offers an adult only experience. I was NOT disappointed. I notice the rates do very, but the particular week we stayed, 12/7 - 12/14 the rate could NOT be beat.

The grounds are beautiful but very large. BE PREPARED TO WALK ALOT AND BRING COMFY SHOES!! Best place in my opinion to be is in the 7 block our rooms were 7010, 7012 and 7013 great location second floor and large balconys over looking the pool. The swim out suites are for 13 yrs and up I believe. 7010 has a walk in closet and 2 beds with a couch and coffee table but I loved my room 7013 and has 2 beds if you are looking for just a king bed its room 7012. These are Deluxe suites..... The kids club was closed on our side and had to go to the sunset side. We did take a tour to Xel-ha (we booked at the hotel) 99.00 adults and 1/2 for children over 4 under 4 is free. It was great. We saw a sting ray snokelling and kids swam with the dolphins for 99.00 extra. We also went to Playa de Carmen but be prepared the hotel is 2 km from the road so the cabs are a preset price. 1-4 is about $20.00 per way 195 pesos, 4-8 passengers 395 pesos about $30 dollars each way and 9 or more is 510 pesos, about a 15 min drive. Shopping is on 5th ave! The X-caret tour is amazing and is about 6 min away driving. I've been there 3x on past vacations. ****** Attention and heads up****** The beer there is Corona on tap and the resort says the fridge is stocked daily in your room just so you know if you are a beer drinker and only drink beer in cans, you only get 2 a day..... each extra one is $4.00 through room service. Unless you are in a platinum room you would get four canned beer a day. The market is at the hotel on Thursdays with a bunch of vendors.....very cool but definately barter. The entertainment at the grand riveria princess I found was very very good. Everynight at 9:30pm and prior to that is the kid show. They also have some shows in the court yard. The fire show was great! I have travelling alot and found the hotel and the grounds are well looked after but we found the staff not so friendly. Disappointment in the bartenders and we always tipped! 1-2 dollars. Depending how many drinks we ordered. The restaurants had great food, I think my favorite was the fondue, my husabnd went to the suishi and said it was very good as well. The Italian had great reviews. Make sure you book your restaurants when you get there, as they fill up fast. You do that on the level of check in opposite side behind the bar, last desk and booking tours is the 1st desk. The beach is nice! You can walk out for along ways and its shallow. My best part was the massages on the beach. My first was under the big massage hut and was $40 from Claudia it was very relaxing and the morning probably would be best as its so quite and all you hear is the water waves.......... my second was through the hotel. A fellow named Hosa walked around the pool with a special. Couples massage for $80 and it was on the beach as well but in the first hut closest to the volleyball. Only 2 tables in that hut and was given by registered therapists. This massage was more deep tissue, I felt like a million bucks after. The bonus was you get to go to the spa for one whole day of your choice in and out all day. Very warm water and beautiful!! Horseshoe tournament is on the beach at 10 am and 4 pm and was great fun. I do have to mention the chairs around the pool are not very comfortable. The pool below our room is salt water! Others are not...... We had a great time, the food was good as well. Unsure if we would go back to this resort due to the size and not alot for the kids to do. The kids club was so so, our kids only went 1x in 9 days. I have seen a lot better, such at the Great Parnassus in Cancun. **** ATTENTION***** Huge warning if you do have little ones make sure you put a shoe in the door if people are going in and out when your balcony door is open as the door slams shut and hard. Some rooms are worse than others, we upgraded and our new rooms seemed really good but the prior rooms 7024 7025 and 7027 had a crappy view and a very harsh draft through the room when the door and balcony were both opened. I hope this helped you if you are going there. Overall is was a great vacation, weather was good. Have fun! Again bring comfy shoes, there is a trolly that goes up and down the outside pathway.

Be prepared to walk a lot...we stayed in the 3000's on the Sunset side which is close to the pool and beach and the morning buffets but everything else is a 1/2 mile walk. Also, if you want to actually use the swim up pool in the cooler months, book the Riviera side as the sun beats on the pool all day. We had very limited use of our pool due to the cold water.

There were some broken tiles and it could be noisy in the hallways but it's because there are all marble floors so it echos, it wasn't too disturbing. The room was very clean and the bed was comfy. There was no issue with any bugs except mosquitos (I forgot the bug spray so I got pretty chewed up.) I did notice a damp/mildew-ish scent but it was not overpowering....I would say maybe bring your own pillow cases, because they were slightly smelly. The only issues we had in the room were that the tv volume did not work, they had not re-stocked the mini fridge and the fridge was warm. We noticed all of these very soon after we checked in and all were fixed. Also, the 2nd night, our A/C unit was making alot of noise but my boyfriend was able to fix it. The reviews are true, if you tip you get better service; in the rooms, I left a tip each day but one and that one day, we got up very early for our excursion and I forgot to leave it out and our bed wasn't made as nicely and we didn't have as many drinks as they usually left. As for food, we ate at the buffet most of our meals (We slept through 2 of our dinner reservations!!..Guess we really needed a vacation!!) The Buffet was good, there were some strange foods but I was able to eat around the stuff I didn't like. I loved the yogurt bar in the mornings and the fruit was always super super sweet and delish and all I had to do was ask a server walking past if I wanted a Mimosa and they'd bring it right over! The Asian restaurant was the best, this was the first meal we had, so it kind of spoiled us for the rest of the trip...we did the food show and it was the best I've ever had. We also went to the steak place and the waiter there was so nice and really went out of his way to make us feel welcome (T-Bone steak was huge and perfect!!) If we returned, I would skip the Mexican place...I had the Fajitas and they were not good, also our server seemed very grumpy but others said the Pablano Pepper was amazing. We had not been feeling well that day so we left soon after our food came. We did not see any of the shows, as the dinner reservations we were able to get were later in the evening, but we did go to the Disco one night and that was really fun and we met some nice people. Also, the Sports Bar was a good time and while the hot dogs and nachos they leave out weren't good, they do have food you can order and their burgers and fries are really good. As for the pools, they are beautifully kept. The party pool was a good time, we were there 2 days, it gets noisy but the staff encourages that and there were some not family friendly games so I might steer clear of there if I was with my kids. The water in the pools was really cold to me, so I didn't really swim in them, but it was fun to just lay out and people watch. The beach was great, we were there 2 days. We did rent the chairs in the front of the beach one day because there weren't any good spaces available, but it was $15 for the whole day, can't beat that! The BBQ food was good, the servers aren't great, but there's a lot of people so it's expected they would be hard to get ahold of. One day the server came around for drink orders but the other day we just got our own stuff, it was no big deal. The vendors aren't too bad, but the massage vendors would NOT leave us alone! We got pictures with the monkey and that was really cute and inexpensive to buy a picture. Side note - I'm very fair skinned and was happy that there was lots of shade! I didn't get burned once all week! The Coaties and blue/black birds were a pain on the beach though...but not enough to be too disturbing. The shops in the resort are all very nice and the souveniers we got were not over pricey, although I thought some of their clothing/hats were a little over priced. We went to the Spa and had a couples massage. My boyfriend says it was the best massage he ever had...I did not really enjoy mine, but I should have spoken to my massage person to adjust the pressure, so that's my own doing. It was nice being able to use the Spa pool and sauna for a little while. We booked a trip to Coco Bongo through the resort and it was SOOO worth it! We had a blast, the place is insane and super crowded but it was really fun. However, you can't sit unless you pay alot more, but we were fine with that! The only drawback was that about 10 of us from the resort lost track of time and missed the bus back so we had to take a cab! (I would bring $20 in cash just in case!!) Checkout took a little bit but it was fine, and we had no surprise charges or anything. This was a great place for our first trip, I would like to continue visiting Mexico but I'd like to stay at other resorts. I would definately stay here again though!!", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful place & wonderful people.\u201d", "Author": "karenhudson29", "ReviewID": "UR121052454", "Content": "It was my best vacation ever had an incre\u00edble time the people were amazing very friendly the best service and wonderful food i have found my new vacation spot!!", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice but hit and miss\u201d", "Author": "ziplockgal", "ReviewID": "UR121006446", "Content": "Visited Princess Riviera Sunrise 2nd week of November 2011. Overall the holiday was very nice. However, it was hit and miss in many areas. This was our second visit, previous was two years prior. Generally we've been resort-vacationing since 2004. This visit is tough to rate because the 1st visit was fantastic and this one was less so. The resort has cut back on food bigtime and the room we were assigned to at check-in had a bunch of basic problems (broken stuff, missing bed). Fortunately we were sent to a different room right away which was good. If you are a first-time-ever resort vacationer, you'll probably like the Princess. If you're an experienced resort vacationer though it may be a tough call depending where you've been and what your expectations are. Our expectations are reasonably decent food, clean facilities, nice beach, stress-free stay. So, to return or not to return? For this visit, I didn't feel the love in terms of too many things were indifferent or neutral. We will go somewhere else next time and will return when the resort decides whether they want to stay amazing (raise the price a bit if you have to) or whether it's going to let itself slide. I've written a longer review below if you want to read on. Have fun wherever you decide to go! RESORT: It is very nice. Immaculate grounds. Very clean. Yes definitely some walking but manageable as it is well laid out with a central path in the middle from lobby to beach and then branches off into the room buildings. Pools are alongside the main path. It's true the main pool, in the middle, is wildly noisy because there is an entertainment team and loud music there most of the day for the party'ers. If you want a quiet room, ask for one near'ish the front or near the beachside and facing away from the pools, ie. stay away from the middle unless you are facing away from the pool. A lot of the staff is nice - depends who you get. Front desk staff Ricardo is very nice but other front desk indifferent. Rest of staff mainly nice. The resort truly shines at night - very prettily lit up. The entertainment at night is a wonderful large gathering place, probably the best I've seen,where everyone mills around. There is usually a band playing and, during the band's break, they have one 20-min specialty show such as Aztec fire display etc. There are also 9.30pm show in the huge theatre upstairs such as Grease and Disco night; I didn't go to any of these but they're available. Note there is a sister hotel, the Riviera Sunset physically joined but with it's own lobby. I like the Sunrise better. ROOMS: Very nice bathrooms, nice patio, good and roomy. Housekeeping was good but spotty. Some days enough towels etc, some days none. Some days no fridge refills, some days none. We have found this with other hotels too in different countries so it's not isolated to the Princess. We tipped daily but probably less than we might have had it been more consistent. The safe worked fine. FOOD: You can always find something to eat. Theme nights and displays of different meats, fish, lots of salads. It was fine but not nearly as good as 2 years ago. It got better as the week progressed. However, one morning there was no butter and no yogurts. Other days virtually no cheese. It's like they weren't prepared or something. Only 3 of the 4 buffet restaurants were open. Overall, it was fine, tasty enough if you're not a real foodie. Went to a few of the speciality restaurants - Mexican was just OK, definitely not great (2 yrs ago it was amazing, it's been way reduced in terms of menu), Miso was excellent, and Mama Mia was also very good. Need to book well in advance if you hope to get a spot. BEACH: Water wonderfully warm. Sand nice. Beach shallower than I remembered but very swimmable. Does have rocks 50%. Totally fine if you wear water shoes. Beach chairs - not enough of them! Resort needs to recognize that having a chair on the beach is part of the vacation. That goes for poolside too. Have to be up at 8 to grab the chair for the day - not OK. Two bad things about the beach: There is a murky brown section in part of the water. Smelly, a little dirty. Brown every single day. Almost like something is leaking into it. Can avoid that section but what the heck is it? Also, sea-doos in the water run right in front of the swimming section. Back and forth. So you're in the water feeling fantastic but having to smell diesel fumes the whole time as well as hear the noise. Why do I need to feel like I'm on a busy street corner with these machines flying by? Not OK. TRIPS We did Rio Secreto. It was great (underground caves with water). QUIET OR NOISY: As one writer wrote, there are loud and boisterous people. I think everywhere you go there are people who are so important or insecure they have to make everyone listen to their cell conversations, their laughter has to be louder than everyone else's, one person made everyone else listen to her country&western radio all day (and the resort staff didn't make her turn it off). Don't know if there is a cure for this because it is a basic lack of respect, courtesy and manners and a fear of being alone with one's thoughts or quiet time. That's my philosophical rant for today. Overall, other than the obvious party zone, it was reasonably quiet. SMALL THINGS YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW: > bring water shoes, you won't regret it > internet is $20/hour however you have to swipe your Visa to use it so we used Internet in Playa Del Carmen for $2/hour pay via cash > there are free shuttles daily to Playa, pickup at the sister hotel (Sunrise) at 10am and noon with return at 5pm. Must book with BestDay travel reps (onsite) 24 hours in advance. Playa is only 15 minutes away - very accessible. All the resorts are on their own large grounds. The shopkeepers there are very aggressive but can be funny and charming - just say no firmly and you'll be fine with them. > bring lots of $1 bills - the workers work hard for little pay and tips will help them That's it for now.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ball Ground, GA", "Title": "\u201cAgain fantastic!\u201d", "Author": "dandBallGround_GA", "ReviewID": "UR120873614", "Content": "We were there in May and enjoyed it so much we went back in late August for another fabulous week!

The only one thing I can complain about is the noise from the entertainment pool side - the loud music and even more extremly loud Canadian/Amaerican who I felt that they were trying to shout the loudest.

We booked 7 nights in the Junior Room from Sept 4th - Sept 11th and read pretty much every review (just thought I would give back and share my experience). First off, the check-in process was quick and easy. They upgraded us to the junior deluxe room without asking (as the resort was only half full), and we opted to not go with the platinum suite. Room Located in the 8000 block (closest to the lobby on the Riviera side), we liked the location as it was removed from the loud noise of the pools, and close to the lobby bar and most restaurants. The room itself was incredible. Exceptionally clean. The only thing that could've been improved was the bed. A bit hard for my liking, as well as the pillows. But otherwise no complaints. The maid and fridge stocking service was excellent. We left between $2-$4 CAN per day for each and it helped. Our fridge was always stocked with what we asked for (a bottle of tequilla, 4-6 beers, water, pop, etc) and our room cleaned to perfection. Couldn't have asked for better service. Restaurants We were able to book an a la carte restaurant every night. Since the resort was only about half full we got into all 5 that were open, and opted for a 2nd round at the Sushi place. Have to say the best place was the Italian restaurant. Service was first class, food was exceptional, would highly recommend it. The steak house was underwhelming, and the french restaurant was so-so. Go for the teppanyaki experience at Miso, very entertaining and service was top notch. Buffet was OK, it got tiring after 7 days, but there is a lot of selection and you shouldbe able to find something satisfactory. Beach/Pool Loved the beach. The walk from the lobby took about 10-15 minutes (at a slow pace), but we loved it as the grounds were immaculate. Overheard some larger individuals complaining about this walk (and read it in some reviews), don't be scared off by this. Seemed to be the majority of complaints were coming from Americans, just my observation. The beach vendors were annoying at times, but if you say 'no' or ignore them they don't bother you. The buffet on the beach was delicious. Food was better than the main lobby buffet, and convenient location on the beach. Read a review that drink service was slow, well that was true for us as well, but we didn't mind getting up for ours. The woman that came around was nice though, but even when we tipped a couple dollars it didn't speed her up. Bring a large insulated mug and they will gladly fill it up. Drank a few mojito's which were excellent. Entertainment Checked out a few of the nightly performances, not my favourite but the wife enjoyed. Considering they put on a different show every night, it was pretty good. I enjoyed the live music in the main square, performers were quite good. Service Hit and miss, but we expected that going in. Saw some reviews that said the staff was rude, and refused to speak English. That's completely untrue. Some spoke little English and would begin a conversation in Spanish (we were in Mexico, that was expected), but would understand any instruction in English and some had a great grasp of the language. We experienced a few slooow servers in the lobby, but we weren't in a rush and didn't really care. A few dollars here and there goes a long way to decent service. Particularly enjoyed Aylmer, in the main lobby bar, great server and very friendly. Safety/Security Was really concerned about the in-room safe, after reading the reviews on here. We had no issue whatsoever. Do not leave your spare key card in the room, if you need to have the lights or fan on when you're out bring an old credit card or gift card. We found the room to be really cold (which was great considering the 40+C heat) and didn't need to do this. Security around the resort was good, never felt unsafe. Went into Playa Del Carmen and would not recommend it or return. The locals were really annoying and would pester any 'tourist' they saw. The beach was beautiful and if you do go i recommend checking it out. SKip the town unless you want to see the same thing you can find in any American/Canadian city (starbucks, burger king, etc). All in all we had an unbelievable time. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for a relaxing vacation at a decent price. In the down seasons, no need to opt for platinum, plenty of room on the beach and able to book a la cartes every night. During the busy season i would imagine it would be a gong show, might be best to splurge on platinum then. It's not a 5-star resort in service or food quality, more like a 4-4.5, but the grounds and facilities were definitely 5 star. We would personally check out different places before returning, but have no hesitations going back at some point in the future.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel\u201d", "Author": "LondonDooley", "ReviewID": "UR120227559", "Content": "I went for two weeks with my husband and three children aged 7, 5 and 1 and had the most brilliant time ever. The hotel is beautiful and always spotless. People previously complained about it being too big but we were near the beach so furthest away from the main buildings and restaurants and it took 10 min walk at most to get there and never felt a problem. There is a free shuttle bus around the resort if you feel it is too much to manage. Our room was lovely with two double beds and a cot although other familes felt a bit squashed if they had older children but fine for us. We loved the fact that there was a jacuzzi big enough for the five of us! Also when we checked in we asked if there were any free upgrades and they gave us one so worth asking. The buffet food was great, amazing choice and loads of it. Definately better service the earlier you go as it gets busy but loved it all. Being pregnant and having young kids I was careful to avoid salad and friut peel but after 5 days it all seemed fine so started eating it and none of us got any problems at all. Ice is fine too as made from bottled water. Just brush teeth with bottled water in room. The staff are really lovely and work so hard. They loved the fact that we had learnt a bit of Spanish and were happy to teach us more - the kids spoke loads by the end. Some of the a la carte restaurants were hit and miss. Mexican and grill not great but liked Fondue and favourite was Miso which has 3 different types of eating: Tennpenyaki, where they cook the food in front of you, sushi and one where you pick from menu. Pools were all great. We picked one next to fondue restaurant and used it all the time as not as loud as main pool and great for kids. Beach beautiful too and although a few rocks you don't need beach shoes - we took them but never used them. Also it is shallow really far out so good for kids but not great if you want a really good swim (use pool) and not many fish to see. Entertainment is something I usually avoid on holiday but they had some really good stuff on like acrobatics and ancient Mexican show, even the lip synced Aladin we saw was funny and kids loved it. My son and husband loved the volleyball, archery and American football and my daughter loved the kids disco. Trips - we did all the trips ourselves and saved a fortune. We hired a car for two days which felt fine and safe apart from they only had a baby seat for our 1 year old but no booster seats for the other two so we had to make makeshift ones! Also the main problem was police. We got stopped twice in one day and both for illegitimate reasons the 1st was solved quickly but 2nd time we had 4 police with machine guns threatening to lock up my husband for the night unless he paid $100 all because me and the kids didn't have our passports on us which our rep later told us wasnt needed. We had hidden our money and had a small amount in our wallet and kept arguing with them until they relented so both times got away without paying anything but was annoying and a bit stressful. Another day we hired a mini-bus for under \u00a3100 for 14 of us (we'd made friends with 2 other familes) and drive to tulum and gran cenote then meal in playa del carmen and got no hassle from police. Chitchen-itza was amazing and because of car we got there early before it was too hot or busy and kids got a bit bored but were fine. Akumel was amazing, beautiful beach and went snorkelling (we took our own stuff but you can hire it there) and we got to swim with giant turtles. So incredible. Cozumel - the ferry was very rough but island beautiful. We went to Chen rio which was great for kids to swim as shallow lagoon but not many fish. As we were leaving the cafe owner told us to go with him and took us to a hut with newly hatched turtles which we got to release into sea, incredible experience. Tulum - not as impressive as chitchen-itza but well worth visit and beautiful setting. Lots of iguanas. Gran cenote - stunning. Good for kids as shallow bits but also deeper bits with amazing stalagtights and lots of little fish and turtles. So beautiful. Playa del carmen - had a lovely meal and got some shopping done. Touristy but nice. Valladolid - seems more like genuine Mexican town. Not very touristy. Beautiful colonial but unfortunately we didn't get to stay for long. All in all we had a great time even with the adventure with the police and a hurricane at the end. I would definately recommend the hotel And the area and try and learn a bit of Spanish and you will have an amazing time.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, United States", "Title": "\u201cHad a wonderful time!\u201d", "Author": "Jennifer S", "ReviewID": "UR120084097", "Content": "My husband and I stayed there from Oct 22nd to the 29th. We were immediately offered a drink when we checked in, and were driven to our room. Our room was closer to the beach, so when we wanted to go to the lobby and most bars and restaurants we had to walk. We were totally ok with that. The grounds are amazing and you can see how well they take care of them. We actually loved the walk (and we walked back and forth like 10 times a day!) It's crazy that people complain about the walk. When you booked it didn't you realize how big of a resort it is? I just can't believe people can be so lazy! They also have shuttles that take you to your room if you don't feel like walking. We did that when it was raining a couple times. The room was perfect and the maids always kept it clean. We did not have a problem with anything being taken from our safe. We left things out in the open and nothing was touched. The employees are all very friendly and make it a point to say hi to you when you walk past them. One employee stood out. His name was Alberto and we met him at the sports bar. He took the time to get to know us and was very friendly. The pool that we mostly stayed by was the party pool. They have music, games and a swim up bar. The employees that are in charge of the games are extremely outgoing. The bartenders were hilarious. If you prefer a pool that is more quiet they have a few of those as well. The beach was beautiful. When you get there later in the morning it is hard to get a lounge chair, but we didn't really care. We plopped our towels down on the sand under a palm tree :) The food and drinks are amazing. They have two buffets (one on the sunset and one on the riviera side) for breakfast and lunch everyday. There was so much to choose from and we never got sick of it. At night you could do the buffett or pick an a la carte restaurant. We had the buffett twice. They have a different theme each night. One night was mexican and they greeted you with different flavors of tequila, margaritas and mexican desserts. So yummy! We went to 4 restaurants. El miso twice (once for sushi and the other for the cooking show) La Hacienda (Mexican), La Fondue (Swiss) and La Vaqueria (Grill). Our favorites were El Miso and La Fondue. Amazing! They have nightly shows which are fun. We were able to catch \"Grease\" and \"Aladdin\" To the people who talk about the slippery walkways. I do have to agree with that, but there are signs all over warning you about this. I just walked carefully and had no problems, and we were there during Tropical storm Rina so it was SUPER slippery! Speaking of the storm, the hotel was very good about keeping us updated about the storm. It started out as a hurricane and then ended up being a tropical storm. That hit us on the 27th (the day we were supposed to leave but our flight was cancelled) and the hotel made sure to keep the walkways as dry as they could. Even though it was impossible since the hotel is so open. They worked so hard though! Since we couldnt get a flight for 2 more days they gave us a very reasonable rate for the other two nights. The next two days were gorgeous out so we werent mad that we had to stay longer! All I have to say is that I can't believe people don't tip the employees. Yes I know that tips are included in your package but come on! They work SO hard and deserve it! We made sure to tip our maid, waiters, bartenders and the shuttle drivers. Also, I read alot of reviews about mosquitos. We brought bug spray just in case but we never had a problem. Maybe Oct isnt the peak for those little pests.

The resort was what we expected, but disappointed for 1 thing. The 5th Ave Sports Bar was not opening til the day after we left.The grounds were amazingly well maintained. We arrived at the resort by check in time. We had swim up and we requested our rooms beside 1 another and was no problem. Good Piece of advice: Book your restaurants asap right after u get settled in. There was nightly scheduled entertainment every night. The entertaining staff were wonderful. There was resort shuttle stops for those who wished not to walk, .but I found the grounds nice to walk about sometimes.. Our room was well kept and was greeted with towel art work by the cleaning lady. Our room location with swim up was ok but too quiet. If u like swim up with some entertainment, ask for swim up near the swim up pool bar. Much more fun and lively. If u book for excursions from the beach area, be sure to get all in writing and be specific on what is all included. We had to insist on what we were going to have. The shops on the resort r a little pricy for certain items. Better off goin into playa del carmen for great prices. If you r looking for fun and music after 11pm, the disco is open from 10:30 pm - 2am. Tip: Be sure to bring a rain poncho and water shoes for the rocks in the ocean. This resort is about 45 to 50 min away from the airport, but worth it when playa del carmen is only 10 min away. The travel time flys by just as much as the driver does lol!! 1 very good observing tip from me, hang your clothes in the closet for they seemed less damp.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful resort\u201d", "Author": "Canadianrider", "ReviewID": "UR120025212", "Content": "Just returned from a week at the Princess and couldn't have asked for better if I tried. This resort is fantastic. The staff is very accommodating and eager to please. Never did we walk pass a staff member, including groundskeepers without a friendly smile and \"hola\".

The entree of fajitas never reached my mouth. We were upgraded to Platinum when we checked in which was a nice surprise as we had a very private swim up suite with king And platinum provides 5 star service all over the resort, including bars and restaurants. Hurricane Rina was bearing down on us while we there and the hotel did everything to ensure safety of everyone. Everything was tied down, palm leaves were cut down, anything that could fly was taken away. Fortunately the hurricane turned into a tropical storm which actually was quite pleasant. The colors of the sky was incredible and I have never seen rain like that. The hotel is very well protected so we hardly felt any wind at all. There is an evacuation area if the need requires. One drawback is its proximity to Playa del Carmen. $20 cab ride each way. I'm a scuba diver so I had to go into town a few times and it was costly. The only shuttle into town runs at noon and returns at 5:00 p.m. So it wasn't very convenient for my purposes anyway.

First impressions were really good, check-in was quite quick after you signed the forms agreeing to pay surcharges for lost wrist bands ($100!!!), towel cards and room cards. We had requested adjoining rooms and we were given these along with a map and details of how to get to the room. Our rooms were a 2 minute walk from reception and the bags were delivered within 15 minutes. We had deluxe suites and they were nice, plenty of space, king sized bed for us adults and 2 doubles in the kids room. The bathroom was large with 2 sinks, toilet and shower cubicle however there was no lock on the main bathroom door which i thought was strange. Rooms were cleaned daily and bedding and towels replaced each day too. As others have said the mini fridge has beer, water & soft drinks. In room safe was easy to use and we had no problems. TV had mostly spanish channels but some American channels with spanish subtitles too. The resort itself is big but I have seen bigger, it is exceptionally clean and the staff work tirelessly to keep it that way. The groundsmen are continually cutting back and replanting. I'm a bit surprised that people think that the walk to the beach is excessive, takes less than 10 minutes to get there from reception and that's just a pleasant stroll. If you think that may be too much for you then stop at a bar on the way down and pick up a cold drink to sip on the way. There are shuttles but we never used them. The restaurants are plentiful with choices of buffet or specialist restaurants, the steakhouse being our favourite. Some people will say that the food was bad or the choice not good but we didn't find this to be so - wouldnt do if we all liked the same thing! Waiting staff couldn't do enough for you and very much appreciated your tips. Plenty of bars around, up by the restuarnats & lobby and down at the pools and beach. the sports bar was closed in our first week due to refurnishment but was a nice place to sit once it reopened. Find one you like and have a mango margarita - delicious! I'm not a beach person so only ventured down on the first day for a look and it seemed to be pretty but busy. The pools were plentiful and you could choose between a quiet pool or a busy pool without any problems as there were always plenty of available sunloungers. A word of warning about the main pool, it is very busy and by early afternoon a lot of people in the vicinity are really drunk, my kids are older and often had headphones on so they weren't offended by the language and behaviour but some days it really got a bit much. However, it was my choice to sit there because i liked the music and I could have chosen to move. If you have younger kids you may want to pick a different area. I must also say that I was surprised that the badly behaved were mostly Canadians & not just the young ones - shame on the couple in their mid 30's who were more than over amourous in the pool. We had very bad weather for 5 days in the middle of this holiday and there really wasn't enough to do while watching the rain pour down unless you wanted to play tequila drinking games. The staff worked very hard to keep the water out of the public areas but there were a number of rooms which had water flowing in. Our big surprise was when we came to check out and we were hit with a $50 surcharge because our daughter had a nose bleed while sleeping. Apparently this was to cover the extra cleaning that was required. I'm sorry but feel that the perils of running an hotel include having accidents occassionally which require extra cleaning just as restaurants have to replace broken plates and bars replace broken glasses. This in my opinion brought down the quality of the hotel as it made me feel that guests are unimportant to them as long as they get extra money. When you've had wonderful service from the hard working staff for 2 weeks to meet a surly concierge in the last hour is rubbish.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cNeutral Review\u201d", "Author": "stuartyorkston", "ReviewID": "UR119946460", "Content": "Ok a real proper review here. This is a nice hotel but it was sold to us as a 5 star \"premier\" and it is definatley not. it is a extremley good 4 star. The hotel is fine no major issues it is large and takes some getting used to at the start. The grounds with regards to walking distance is not a problem you can walk anywhere within 10-15 minutes no problem. Forget the 8 seater shuttle that takes you from the lobby to the beech its tiny and is always full so walk it isnt a problem to walk. The beech is nice enough a couple of small rocky bits again man up and get over it as that also isnt a problem. There is a chill out area with nice beds which they charge you $10 each for the use off which is a shame as AI should mean AI. Beware of the ability for non english speaking guests to shout everytime they just want to talk why they can not talk normaly without shouting is beyond me. The food at the hotel ok it is decent at the night restaurant and the buffet is average the major downside is the food at the buffet was always cool/luke warm hardly anything was ever kept hot enough and that was annoying for us a little. The rooms smelled of mould and we have never had that before either in any hotel we have stayed in and it seemed to be the norm however after 10 minutes in your room you adjusted to it, apart from the pillows when you went to sleep but we covered them up. Its a very nice hotel and depending on what you pay for it will determine if it is value for money we paid \u00a33000 for the 2 of us for 2 weeks and going by past experiances this isnt value for money. But if you got it for \u00a32000 then yes it would be excellent value and everything would be fine. All depends on what your paying for it.

We upgraded to Platinum. Would have been better to book at the Sunset, as the Platinum area is much more accessible. Our WestJet Rep was very helpful in showing us what our \"Platinum\" actually included. The front desk staff was not very helpful with this. We were somewhat disappointed as we were thinking that 'Platinum\" meant swim - up room! The swim up rooms it seems are listed as \"Junior Suites\" (Swim-up rooms look pretty fun!) I guess an advantage to the \"Platinum\" on the Riviera side it it's proximity to the main building, and all of the restaurants. (Especially if you are in heels!) This resort is HUGE. Would not recommend it to anyone that has any mobility issues as there is a lot of walking. There is a shuttle service that runs continously, but there is still a lot of walking. The resort grounds are beautiful! Very lush and scenic! The beach is quite busy - but we did find the \"Chill Out\" area which was an extra $10.00 for the day - but there was no one there, and the loungers come with a sun pad. The service there was great and the staff was very friendly! The drinks in this area are in pretty glass cups, with pretty decorations - not just a plastic cup! The beach area is nice and well maintained. We had a massage on the beach which was really inexpensive and really great! We also spent a day at the Sunset Platinum pool - which was awesome - no kids screaming! Pools are all a good temperature. If you are looking for some party times the party pool gets going in the afternoon. Good for a laugh - nothing to crazy. We had buffet one night, which was just OK. We had a la cartes the rest of the nights. (Platinum guests - there is a separate concierge desk inside the temporary Riviera Platinum lounge) The a la cartes were pretty good. Actually the place we were least excited to eat at \"La Fleur\" turned out to be one of the best! The Fondue place was tasty and fun. The Tapanyaki was fun and tasty. The Italian was still better than the buffet. After dinner the place to go is the outdoor lounge area in between the two resorts. Live band was great and just a great place to enjoy an after dinner beverage and chill out. Disco was fun - a little stinky, but fun for a spin around the dance floor! We ordered room service for breakfast, it was ok - but it showed up on time with friendly service - so no complaints! Our room was bright and clean - housekeeping staff was all very friendly and did a great job --- never had any issues with anything going missing. (Just keep your valuables in the safe people! Common sense!) Finally - Yes, this was the resort that had the explosion. They are not trying to hide or cover any of this up. The staff will talk about it. I never had any worries or feelings of danger. If anything they are going to extra measures to ensure your safety. I doubt I will return to this property - I just think there is a lot better out there. Unless for a wedding or something. (Oh and on that note --- the day we arrived it was raining. And they had a couple getting married in the lobby--- it just seemed so impersonal, as the rest of the hotel guests were just dangling around in the background. If you are looking at this resort for a wedding - I would definetly look into what other options they have for a rainy day ceremony!)

We arrived to a nice cold flannel to freshen up with and a nice cold drink. We even got a free upgrade to a Junior Delux room!! Grounds, rooms,lobby and restaurants all very very clean!

Tapas wasnt open when we were there which was abit disappointing. With the buffet restaurant lunch and breakfasts are really nice, and lots of choice only thing for evening meal would be to make sure to go around 7.30 -8.00 if not the buffet tends to be cold and have been sat there a while. Amimation team - day entertainment was really good-loved the crazy games each day!! but entertainment at night for young people wasnt so good- fire show was really good The only downside we had to the holiday was the 4 days of non stop rain- which cant be helped but would be advised to check and check again for the rain fall for each month before you book. Throughout this time everytime we tried to ask staff when the weather was due to pick up they said they didnt know which was a bit strange. - In the end ended up going to find my thompson rep who told me when it would pick up.

The 11 hour flight was a bit of a a drag but well worth it on a arrival to the Riviera Princess. The resort is made up of the Riviera side & the Sunset side that mirror each other, which was a bit confusing at first but you get to use all facilities at both anyway so once you get your bearings it was great. It is a very big resort but we loved the fact that there was lots of walking & you didn't feel hemmed in. The place is surrounded by amazing landscaped gardens & lots of vegetation areas but beware of Mosquitos when the sun goes down. The kids club was more for the under 7 but we wanted to spend time with ours anyway so didn't bother with it for our 11 yr old Daughter. The teenage club is just activities, like Archery, air rifle shooting & Volley Ball which was perfect for our 13 yr old Son to go off & do when he felt like it. The resort was perfectly safe & secure to let them have the freedom to walk to breakfast, or the pools or bars & back to the room if they wanted to without any worries. The beach was beautiful & you never struggled to get a sun bed even if you headed down in the afternoon or had a late breakfast. There was loads of shade under thatched umbrellas or Palm trees. Waiters would bring drinks but it was best to give a very small tip on your first drinks to get them to return or just go to the beach bar yourself. The sea was quite rough & not very clear but that may have been the time of year we went & it was still very warm. The food was provided by 4 main buffets only 3 of which were open but I guess it was because we went out of season. There was always plenty on offer & as always things weren't exactly as at home but we were in Mexico so what do you expect! There was always loads to chose from even it there were some weird combinations but we didn't get bored. We don't eat meat so found that there wasn't a huge selection of Fish which was disappointing but not a problem. For breakfast you had Omelette stations where you just chose your contents & they cooked it there & then & then at Lunch they had the same but with Pasta. The A La Carte Restaurants were great, our favourites were the Oriental Tepinyake service & the Italian but obviously we didn't try the Grill. The Fondue was OK but a bit of a cheese overload. You could always get a BBQ lunch down the beach with a burger, hot dog, Nachos & salad with chillies & stuff if you didn't fancy going back up to the buffets, believe me sometimes you just couldn't bear eating yet more food it was never ending. The staff were all fantastic, everybody form the gardeners to the head Waiters were always, friendly & smily & greated you with an Ola or Buenos Dias when you caught there eye. They do not stop working & all work extremely hard serving everyone & keeping the whole resort in immaculate condition. They were continually clearing water from around the pools & every where else when it rained, painting vehicles, cutting bushes, cleaning windows & the buffet / bar staff were always fun & again flat out getting you everything you need. None of them earn well either. Some helpful hints: Tipping - we tipped at the restaurants & every few days at the bars & buffets to the people that were really helpful. The Waiters around the pool got you a better service with tips but it wasn't expected. Of a night in the busy bars it was worth tipping the bar men for the same reason. We left some money for the maid at the end of the holiday. Entertainment was far better than we expected. There was a huge Theatre that had a different show every night. We saw Grease, a Horror themed one & Aladin, all of which were brilliant. Then there were bands in the main bar that again were absolutely great. I would say the mix of people staying here was 70% Canadian (all friendly & chatty), 10% Mexican, 10% USA & then 10% UK but all mainly English speaking & great people. the whole resort had a welcoming & friendly feel about it & we didn't ever feel uncomfortable or need to avoid anyone. Wi-Fi: You have to pay for it but we found that if you went around the Villas in the centre of the resort or the Platinum lounges you could sign on to the free Platinum Wi-Fi to get a few emails, update apps & get your friends jealous with some Facebook posts. Excursions: We didn't do any!! We hired a car & paid to get in at the sites, not only did this save us a fortune it also gave us a far better view of the local area & the flexibility of coming & going when we wanted. You must swim in a Cenote & visit one of the Mayan sites. Beware of the Police they target tourists & demand cash fines. We hid our money & always said that they could follow us to the Bank for the cash but they declined, funny that. Make sure the driver carries their license & passport. Coffe & Tea: Take your own, there's wasn't good. Learn some Spanish: It will get you a long way in the resort with the Waiters & outside in the real Mexico. You only need the basics but it will make a difference. Mosquitos: Take spray, we all suffered & some bites can be huge & very itchy. If you kept the doors & nets shut as much as possible we hardly got bitten in the room more walking back through the resort after dark. In particular around the gardens & the pools where they obviously breed but if you aware you can avoid those areas. Don't go swimming after dark you'll get eaten alive, we did it once & regretted it. Complaints: If we were really looking for any, it would be to have greater Fish selection at the Buffets, slightly larger rooms or a section off from the kids (you literally share a room, although it's quite large), more information on the resort & what was going on in the rooms and some snacks in the fridge.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort but Crappy Buffet\u201d", "Author": "BlondieNYC", "ReviewID": "UR119752783", "Content": "The Resort was big and beautiful the grounds are so pretty clean & well kept.

Miso is excellent \u2013 especially the Tepanyaki, La Vaqueria which is an Argentinian steak house was very good, La Fondue \u2013 very good but very long in duration, Mama Mia \u2013 Italian \u2013 don\u2019t bother unless you are desperate for pasta (not cooked that well). We flew with WestJet \u2013 and we never saw the rep once in 2 weeks \u2013 so don\u2019t expect anything from them!! Westjet use \u201cBest Day\u201d as their booking and service agent in the hotel. They are ok, nothing special, more like salesmen/women really. Be warned, on your first morning after arrival you have to attend the Best Day presentation about the tours and what they can do for you. If you don\u2019t you won\u2019t get your \u2018return ticket\u2019 for the coach to get you back to the airport!!! One warning \u2013 the hallways in the buildings are marble, which when mixed with wet feet are very slippery and very dangerous. Also, many of the exterior walkways are really smooth concrete and as with the walkways, when they are wet they are slippery, we saw many people slip and fall, me included, so be careful. One tip at Cancun airport when you return \u2013 after you check in and go thru security, ignore the duty free that is right in front of you, head to the \u201cA\u201d gate and there is a lovely quiet duty free store up there. Another tip for the airport is go to Johnny Rockets restaurant in the final departure lounge and have a cheeseburger and vanilla milkshake \u2013 pure heaven after 2 weeks of hotel food!!! Overall, good value for money, swim-out suite made the holiday, but we wouldn\u2019t go back to the same resort.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cSeptember 3rd 2011\u201d", "Author": "kerihill10", "ReviewID": "UR119152776", "Content": "We went in september for 10 days.

We agree with many of the comments on here but want to share some of our other experiences. Upon arrival at reception, you are asked to sign an upgrade agreement confirming we would not be sharing any negative remarks about the hotel. Which felt like a gagging order - luckily my partner signed it...not me! As a whole, the staff are very friendly, however, the resort is very rules driven with staff showing very little flexibility. For example, when trying to book a restaurant for two days' time at 11am, we were told we must return to make the booking at 2pm. Others we spoke to were not allowed to board the half-empty shuttle bus to Playa del Carmen because they had not booked the night before. Rules are rules at this place. And don't loose your 'booking ticket' because you'll be greeted with frowns when you show-up at the restaurant. The scale of fines is laid-out in the room: 1000 pesos (\u00a350) for losing your wristband and USD 20 for losing your towel card. We lost our room key but dodged a fine by saying we were simply locked out of our room. There are two large canteens in the resort - and we use that phrase deliberately. Two vast open plan buffet restaurants - busy, noisy and well... canteen-like. Not having the ambience you'd expect from a 5 star resort. The buffet offered a very wide selection every night, but the buffet itself tended to be crowded so it was difficult to browse the selection before making your choices (and we were there during low season). With such large canteens, we felt it would have been better to have two buffets in each, one at each end, to divide the crowds. The biggest disappointment was the restaurants. They are \"specialised\" but beyond some superficial differences in decor, they're pretty much the same thing. For sheer disappointment, book the Mexican (Hacienda). My partner eats anything, but even he was appalled at the food. We have better fajitas in England. Unfortunately the other restaurants weren't much better. In the end we decided the best was Miso, which is divided into three: Oriental, Tepanyaki, Sushi. We didn't try the Sushi, but the other two were good. We visited between 13th and 28th September. In week 1, almost everything was open. In week 2, four of the restaurants were closed due to 'low season'. In the second half of week 2, they closed the main Lobby Bar in the Riviera! Nice first impression of the foyer for newly-arriving guests - all the lights turned off!! We were told to walk to the Lobby bar of the Sunset Princess instead. And in week two one of the pool bars closed. Having said all this, we preferred the resort being half-full - we realised that when properly full, the resort would have been crowded, the buffet a no-go and the sunbed reservation brigade setting their alarms for 4am. During the second week of our holiday the maintenance work around the resort was extended. On most days a section of beach was taped-off so they could repair the parasols, and the same around the pools within the restort itself. All good resorts require maintenance and we don't object to it, but we sometimes found ourselves squeezed between different maintenance activities happening at the same time (eg. both ends of beach simultaneously). The maintenance team should be more mindful of this. In our opinion from what we saw, and from what we've read here, the Platinum upgrade really isn't all it's cracked up to be. It's all very superficial - for instance, the Platinum and standard toileteries are identical apart from the colour of the label. The diners in the Platinum section of the lunch buffet looked somewhat lonely and didn't get many passing waiters, but they DID get a tablecloth. If that's important to you, go for the upgrade. Actually, we saw more Platinum wristbands in the normal sections of the beach than in their roped-off 'enclosure'. As for the cleanliness of the resort - it is exceptional. For such a large resort, it is spotlessly manicured by staff who really did seem to take pride in their work. No cigarette ends, gardens in trim and paths swept. And when it rains, they're out in droves squeegying the puddles from the footpaths which ARE perilously slippy when wet !! If you like the odd drink whilst on holiday, you'll be spoiled here. For all guests (Platinum or not), the drinks are branded - Corona, Bacardi, Smirnoff - no \"local\" rubbish (OK, Corona is local, but it's also sold internationally). Throughout the beach and resort there are waiters happy to bring your drinks to you, and when you tip them 20 pesos or a dollar, you're usually not without an empty glass for the rest of the day. Again - no advantage to the Platinums. We agree with another review here which says that the beach isn't stoney enough for shoes. In fact, there's a long swathe of beach that enjoys soft sand throughout - hardly a stone underfoot. And it's the section right in front of the resort. Taking a walk along the beach for a mile or so in either direction, we have to say that the Princess resort has the best section of beach in the area. As for the organised trips by Thomson/First Choice - don't be fooled in to booking with them, there is a hut on the beach and an area in the hotel where you can book these at a better price. You all end up on the same coach anyway, it's just that some are there brandishing their Thomson booking slips, having paid quite a bit more than those who booked through the hotel. As for 5th Avenue.....don't bother! Overall, this holiday was for us to relax, and relax we did. It's just a shame that the restaurants were not what you would class as 5 star.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunderland, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c\"paradise\"\u201d", "Author": "coatsy_10", "ReviewID": "UR118842751", "Content": "Me, my husband And our 3 year old daughter Lily have just got home last night!

See I'm white/canadian & my husband is mexican, you would think they would treat him with respect & kindess seeing as he was nothing but nice & polite to all the staff there, he was proud of his country & people, it was his first time visiting his homeland in years, & the way he was treated was just devastating. there were numerous incidents where we were both mistreated, but the worst was when we were going to the spanish a la carte restaurant & we stopped at the mexican restaurant in the resort to ask for directions, now my husband was dressed impeccably well with a white collar shirt, a pair of beige designer cargos, and white lacoste shoes, his whole outfit was very appropriate & expensive let alone... the host upon us walking in to ask for directions looks him up and down points at him n tells him in mexican \"u think they will let u in dressed like that?u need to be wearing full length pants\", we ignored his snotty comment & just asked for directions, upon us leaving & arriving to the spanish restaurant that stupid host had already called the other host in the restaurant to warn him not to let us in! the funny thing is everyone in the restaurant was dressed in swim shorts, sporty clothes, n they were telling us there is a dress code, needless to say i flipped n made a huge scene, how dare they?? if u cared about the image of your restaurant n were really following a dress code then how come u let all those other people in that are not even dressed half appropriately? their excuse? that those people were under 18 so dress code doesn't apply. first of all they clearly weren't minors, and second of all dress codes apply to everyone because its the image of the restaurant that they are supposedly caring about, regardless of age, inappropriate attire is inappropriate attire & it will affect the image of the restaurant. there was no getting through to them because they were not sensible people we all knew it was bullcrap as they were just being haters. it gets better. we go to the concierge to complain, & I've never been more scared when the guy asked for our room number, i asked my husband not to give it to him, I had a feeling they weren't going to be helping us more like harassing us. since that day for nights after we had only in our section security guards like 5 of them walking around our floor outside our room it was very concerning...i spent the rest of my holiday in fear & hurt, I can't believe they would treat their own people so bad, all I can do is tell my story, & karma will take care of them.

The food at the buffets is ok.... you will not go hungry ever....but it is not 5 star cuisine. It's decent enough and there are tons of choices for each meal at the buffet dining rooms. We never had to wait any for a seat. Same with the specialty restaurants. We dined at La Fondue, Miso, La Hacienda, Mama Mia, Le Fleur and La Vaqueria. All were good- some better than others. I'd say La Fleur was our fav and La Vaqueria was the one we liked the least - surprisingly tough t-bones. The liquor flows very freely here too. You can get most any alcoholic drink you desire....and Pepsi:) They have lots of juices, 7Up, orange sodas, virgin drinks.....

Plush greens, beautiful statues, gorgeously kept grounds. And HUGE. It's very big, but if you don't like walking, there is a shuttle that goes around every 15 minutes/24 hours a day. The room - DON'T SKIMP - get a Platinum Suite. We had a swim up suite, and it was awesome having a pool right outside our door. Being a Platinum guest - A LOT of advantages. You have free wifi in your room & 2 exclusive internet bars. In the internet bars you can always trade in your towels for fresh ones and not have to worry about going to the towel huts. There's always fresh snacks & waiters ready to serve you, 24 hours a day. You also get your own private area on the beach. Your waiters bring your drinks immediately after ordering. No waiting. Platinum members also enjoy a beautiful private pool w/ plush seating & covered beds. It's gorgeous! Again, no waiting on drinks. There are Platinum stops for the shuttle. Less walking from your room. Plus having a silver wristband on automatically tells the staff that you're a platinum guest, thus getting better service. The pools - AMAZING. All 12 of them!

As it was our honeymoon (which we had to prove by presenting our marriage certificates) we were upgraded to a larger, pool view room on the 1st floor on the Sunset side. Once we had checked in and found our room there was a bottle of Tequilla and some fresh fruit waiting for us on the table. We also had a turning down service every night where our room was tidied and fresh towells provided, i think this was part of the upgrade as other guests in the resort didnt get this. Pros:- *Extremely clean hotel, Staff are working 24/7 to keep the hotel tidy. I was amazed that every time we had lunch in the Fondue restaurant by the pool there was a young guy cleaning the large windows to perfection every day. They didnt even need cleaning. *The staff are very efficient and are very friendly. They loved our 15 month old daughter and by the end of our 2 weeks she was saying \"Hola\" to the staff as they walked by. *Check-In was straight forward. We stood 3rd in line and we stood waiting for about 10 mins until we were dealt with. We were given some fresh lemonade as we waited. *Once we found our room, our cases arrived about 10 mins after. *The room was very clean and tidy, Bathroom was spotless. No complaints at all. The Aircon was a welcome treat after a long day in the sun, Remember to leave it on during the day to keep the room cool. *There are many swimming pools at this hotel, guests tend to find a spot and stick with it for the duration of their stay. There was a lively pool with loud music and pool games that seemed to be for younger people and couples. Suprisingly the loud music was well contained and didnt seem to travel far so it wasnt an annoying problem for guests wanting peace and quiet. *The pool bars were great, but didnt open until 10am. Not a major problem but if youre down at the pool early you will have to wait a while for a drink. No big deal though. *There are plenty of branded spirits to choose from including Smirnoff Vodka. The beer is good too. *The food was also very good. The buffet is good, plenty of choice but dont expect anything amazing as it is a buffet at the end of the day. A good choice if you want a quick and easy dinner though. There is a different themed buffet every night. We found ourselves booking a restaurant most nights as we preferred the atmosphere and being waited on. *Restaurants - I suggest booking these as soon as you can, you can only book 3 days in advance but you can book an unlimited amount of times, so it just means going back to book your restaurants every 3 days. Our personal favourites were the Italian \"Mamma Mia\" and the Tapanyaki \"Miso\" restaurant. I wouldnt recommend the mexican as it wasnt any different to what you can get in the buffet every night. *The buffet breakfast at the lobby was good but could get busy depending on what time you got there. The busiest time was around 8-8:30am. We found that breakfast was much more relaxed at the Fondue restaurant by the pool. The sun shines through and it is more relaxed and quieter however there isnt as much variety of food on offer than the main lobby breakfast. *The beach was great, There are vendors on the front of the beach that ask you if you want a massage everytime you walk past but this isnt a problem. If it does get on your nerves you can just walk up the beach and settle down where there arnt any vendors. Getting into the sea isnt a problem, there arnt any rocks to contend with and any seaweed that is washed up is removed early morning. The sea is cordoned off and is actually very shallow within the cordonedd off area. You can walk way out into the sea and still touch the floor. Only a few Cons:- *There are a fair few birds that are very brave when you are lazing around the swimming pool during the day. They like to come scavenging for any food that maybe about and they sit on the back of the sun beds and do their business on them. The sun beds are cleaned daily though. *We were situated on the first floor and as we had a stoller/pram it was quite difficult to get to ground floor as there are very few elevators. We had to walk quite a way to reach the nearest elevator. We mostly carried the stoller down the stairs because of this. But hey, if we had a room next to the elevator there wouldnt be a problem. *The floors are VERY slippery when wet. You just need to be careful. *We found the lobby bars extremely hot to sit in at night when we were having a drink. There isnt too much that could be done though as its all open plan so Air-Con wouldnt be very useful. Anyway thats my little input. Overall this is a great hotel and i would definatley recommend it and would go back.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cAn honest review from two 30 somethings and a baby\u201d", "Author": "travlinandyjr", "ReviewID": "UR118360875", "Content": "Let me start off by telling you that we are a couple in our 30's with an 8 month old daughter. We are very honest about what we encounter on the multitude of trips we have made around the world. This was our first vacation traveling with the little one.....here we go. The Grand Riviera and Grand Sunset Princess are one in the same hotel. I tell you this because the price to stay at the Riviera was less on many of the travel sites we checked prior to booking. Save yourself some money. **THIS REVIEW WILL COVER THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE MOST IMPORTANT ON A TRIP AND HAVE BEEN COMMENTED BY OTHERS ON TRIP ADVISOR. WE FEEL THAT OUR REVIEW WILL GIVE YOU A CLEAR AND HONEST IDEA OF WHAT TO EXPECT HERE. Check-in / Rooms: This was a yearly anniversary trip that I take my beautiful wife on each year. We got married at the Moon Palace and have stayed at several properties in the area, including the most amazing, Excellence Riviera Maya (highly recommended for adults only). Prior to arrival, I contacted concierge by phone to ask about upgrades to a platinum suite. I was told this would not be a problem at all because the hotel was only at 50% capacity and this was the low tourist season. I was told that upgrade costs would be 30 dollars per person per night. Upon arrival, I requested the upgrade. The young man checking us in said no platinum upgrades were available. We requested he check with a manager which he did and insisted that nothing was available. We were shown to our room, a standard junior sutie #7234. Upon arrival, we saw that the room was no more desireable than a standard room at a Holiday Inn. We do not nit pick but in this case, the furniture was in poor shape and shades and lamps (white) were visibly dirty. The room was not inviting at all and had a great view of the building behind it. We ran to the internet and checked to see if platinum rooms were available. We checked several sites including the Princess site and saw that there were Platinum rooms available. I went back to check in and spoke to a platinum desk person. I basically told them that I could pay them directly to upgrade or go re-book my reservation and demand my room, which I knew was available. We were quickly given our upgraded room, #31233. Riviera Platinum rooms are in the front of the resort. Ours had a view of the jungle to the north and of the Platinum swim out pool below. We were just above a Platinum private bar as well. The room itself was far better than a standard junior suite, beginning with being very clean. The amenities were very nice, sheets clean, furniture nice and comfortable. Bed was nice. Nothing to complain about in the Platiunum suite. Platinum suite comes with access to all hotel restaurants except the Chill Out which costs everyone extra. I will cover this further down. The Platinum Lounge for the riviera side is located at the front of the property north of the main lobby. It has a private bar, free internet and snacks throughout the day. After 3 PM you will meet Eder the bartender who will fix you up some pretty amazing cocktails based on what type of alcohol you like. There is another platinum lounge near the chill out bar on the opposite end of the property. RESTAURANTS: Las Olas - This was the first A la Carte dinner we had. Lets get right to the point here. The service was horrible but the food was great. It seemed as though the only person in the building that cared was the maitre'd. We had to ask for water, silverware and drinks several times before actually getting them. Let's put it this way, my wife had to get up to get a spoon so we could feed the baby. By the way, if you order the fried snapper, please keep in mind that it is the whole fish that has been fried and will be served on a plate. This is a mexican traditional dish and I saw several people making faces when it arrived at their table. La Vaqueria - This restaurant was great. The service was amazing and the food perfect. Make sure you ask for a shot of their infused tequila after you are done with dinner. These are the bottles you see when you first walk into the restaurant. La Hacienda - Again, awesome service and food was excellent. ROMANTIC DINNER ON THE BEACH - EXTRA COST BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY! For our anniversary, I booked the romantic dinner on the beach. This is done at one of three palapas at the Chill Out Lounge. There are two dinner menus available and can be reviewed prior to making your reservation. Our 5 course dinner was huge. It started with a ceviche salad in a pineapple which was amazing. It was followed up by shrimp which was cooked in what appeared to be tempura style with some amazing sauces. These were five large prawns, not your typical red lobster bay shrimp. Next was a bisque soup that was served in a very large bowl and consisted of two different varieties that you could mix together or eat seperately. The main course was a steak that was cooked to perfection and the dinner ended with a great dessert. The service is great and personal. The view is amazing. You can see Cozumel in the distance and the area was quiet and peaceful. On our night, there was a massive lightening storm in the distance that lit up the night while we dined under the stars and the moon. Unforgettable experience and again, worth every penny. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner Buffets - Whoever said there is not any food at these buffets must have had their eyes closed or been in the wrong building. The food selection is plentiful. There is something to please everyones tastes. This includes a wide variety of hot and cold food to include fruits and salads. Here is the deal with comments made about food being old and cold. If you go to any buffett when they first open up, the food is hot, fresh and delicious. If you wait till it is about to close, food tends to be cold and may get a little rough. This was the case with the buffets at the Princess. Overall, we were very please with the buffets and never had a problem finding something good to eat. Beach Restaurant for Lunch- Great Great Great!!! It is simple lunch. It consists of hot dogs, hamburgers and Paella. I tried all three and the food was great. Burgers were well cooked and all the condiments were kept cool. I saw many people eating here and did not see anyone complaining. It was common to see the same people going back each day and taking their food in the to go containers back to the pool to have lunch. **WORD OF ADVICE - don't leave any food laying around anywhere. Eat it or throw it away. If the coaties (raccoon type animals) don't get to it, the blackbirds will. Beach - We walked to the beach on two occasions (its that far!!). Once to check it out and another time to take pictures. It was very clean. The comments about the beach view being blocked by venders is a little exagerated. You can see the water and nobody really seemed to be walking around bothering the guests. If you area platinum guest, you have a private area to the north side that is roped off and offers completely unobstructed views of the water. Sand was clean and water was clear. Pools - All seemed to be pretty clean. We spent all of our pool time in the so called Party Pool. We liked it because of the music and activities being conducted by the Princess Animation Team. Hats off to these guys and gals. They can really entertain and it is not annoying at all. If anyone is annoying, its the guy with the funky accent that is selling tickets to Coco Bongo. Pool bar was good. Service was fairly quick. Drinks were good. Photographs - You will see photographers walking the grounds most of the day. They offer pictures with a monkey, iguana, macaws and other animals. Additionally, you can set up a photo shoot at the location of your choice for 20 minutes with no obligation to buy. Just stop by the photo shop in the lower level of the lobby and set up the time. You then go back, view the photos and pick what you want or dont pick any at all. We took some great family pictures with the baby and ended up buying alot. When you compare it to what it costs back home to hire a photographer and get the same if not better quality pictures, we saved ourself a ton of money.Big thanks to our photographer Angel who did an outstanding job. Bars - We only hit the pool bar, main lobby bar and the Riviera Platinum bar. Service at all three was great. Tips are what get you excellent service here. Most of the servers work other areas of the resort and if you tip them, they will invite you to the other areas (usually restaurants) they work at to provide you excellent service there too. Keep in mind that if you area platinum guest, you can get any alcohol they serve. In some cases, higher end liquors may cost you extra if you are not a platinum guest. For example, if you wanted a shot of Tradicional tequila at the lobby bar, you had to pay. If you are a platinum guest, you sign a slip that says you are platinum and the drink is free. If I had to complain about the bar it would be that they were lacking in the tequila department. We are tequila aficionados and know what good tequila is. This resort did not have any. Their idea of high end was Tradicional and Hornitos. This is not good tequila. Even places like the Grand Oasis in Cancun serve high end stuff such as Don Julio and Tres Generaciones Anejo. Shows - We saw the International Show and the Mexican Show. Both were very good. The performers put alot of time and effort into their performances. You will be quite impressed by the drumming act in the International show. There is a bar in the theatre. Ladies may want to bring a wrap to keep warm as the air conditioning in this place works a little too well. There was music nightly in the center plaza area. The music sounded great and people seemed to be having alot of fun. We did not partake due to the little ones bedtime. Thursday Market - The hotel has vendors that set up a market on Thursday nights. You can by typical mexican souveniers and crafts. Prices are comparible to outside vendors in Playa. You can bargain with these vendors and bring the price down from what they originally tell you the price is. Remember, if the item has no price and there is no sign telling you what the price is, YOU CAN NEGOTIATE THE PRICE DOWNWARD. Bugs- This is a humid and jungle type area. There are lots of mosquitos and other insects. Are you going to get bit....maybe. My wife got attacked. Our little one and I did not get touched. I told me wife it was because she was sweeter than my daughter and I. Take the bug spray just in case. PROPERTY SIZE - The resort is very big. You will do alot of walking. Unfortunately, walking in the hot sun will tire you out and really take it out of you. The other down side for us is that although the property itself is very clean and well kept, you cannot see or hear the ocean unless you are at or very near the beach. Every hotel we have ever stayed at in Cancun/Playa has always had an ocean view and we would wake up to the sound of the water. Not so at this property. There are very few rooms that face the water at this location. In our case, pushing around the little one in her stroller was fairly easy because most areas are flat. There are elevators in the main lobby area that allowed us to get up to the third floor room without having to carry the stroller up the stairs. If you were coming from the pool or beach area however, we preferred to carry the stroller up the three flights of stairs and not have to walk all the way to the lobby and then all the way back to our room. TIPS - I know that they say tips are included and not required but c'mon people. A few dollars here and there will get you a lot of extras. The buffet servers will remember you and make sure you always have water, coffee, juice, etc. Your maid will leave you extra towels and other amenities. By the way, we got a fruite platter and a bottle of tequila in our room on day two. Your a la carte restaurant staff (except for Las Olas) will be well deserving of the extra bucks. Bartenders will definately take care of you if you drop some singles here and there. SECURITY - We felt very safe at this resort. There was only one time where we saw a male on the property that obviosly did not belong. Being in law enforcement, I wondered why nobody was stopping the guy and questioning him. This guy was filthy, sweaty, looked like he was on something and did not have a wristband like all the other people on the property. As for the rooms, the safe deposit box in your room seems to work pretty well. It is a standard box that fits a laptop computer and allows you to enter your own digital code. OVERALL - First impressions mean alot to us. There was no welcome drink or cool towel upon arrival as we have expreienced at every single hotel we have ever stayed at in this area. As previously mentioned, we did not believe we had to go out of our way to get an upgraded room and this just added to the horrible first impression. Our first dinner at Las Olas added even more to the horrible service and first impression. The Grand Riviera/Sunset Princess was saved by \"the little people.\" I am talking about the maids, groundcrews, bartenders, restaurant personnel, animation crew, etc. These individuals made our stay enjoyable and made up somewhat for that horrible first impression. MESSAGE FOR THE MANAGEMENT - My wife and I came from the Public Relations field earlier in our careers. At one point, each member of the management staff was introduced at the Party Pool and guests were told that they could speak to them if they had any questions or concerns they wanted to share. I give you credit for taking the initiative but respectfully inform you that you have failed on your goal or trying to make yourself available to your guests. As soon as you were introduced, all but two of you walked away and were never to be seen again. The two persons that remained were the head of security and the head chef. These were not the people that we wanted to speak with. Take the time to walk around the pool and say hello. Take in any comments you can get and don't just try to make yourself look good by distributing free drinks (which are already free anyway) and free sandwiches and fingerfoods. You will never get better if you don't take in the feedback. CONCLUSION: Although this property ended up being what we consider to be 4 stars, we respectfully would NOT recommend this location to any of our friends. Cancun/Playa del Carmen, are about the beach and relaxing. You will not get the beach at this location without a hike. Yes, you can relax at the pool, but you can also do this back home. We have stayed at several properties in this area and have always had a flawless experience. It is our belief that this place is simply too big for the staff to handle. Although the staff really seem to go out of their way to do their best for you, sometimes they are just overwhelmed. We saw this at the buffet almost daily. The front staff, based on prior comments and personal experience, has seemed to take on a robotic approach of just checking people in and not listening to their requests and trying to accomodate them, especially when it can be done. Again, we believe this is the case due to the large amount of people checking in at any given time. The property is beautiful but Cancun and Playa del Carmen have a multitude of properties that are both less expensive and more expensive that have alot more to offer, especially the beach/ocean views that one comes to expect in this area.

Here's our response to Kittinameow! Please read their review below - it's 100% inaccurate. 34. The buffet has a massive choice of food, with a different theme each night. Who expects a gourmet meal when they've probably paid less than \u00a3100 for two weeks worth of food? Breakfast has a huge choice of cereals, hot foods prepared in front of you, and pastries etc. 33. We witnessed the cleaner's clean our room and it's safe to say you won't get ringworm! 32. This place is rated as 5 Stars, and fully deserves it. 31. The staff couldnt do more for you if you asked, remember that polite tourists get a polite response. 30. 45 min ride away from the Cancun Int'l Airport and it's really not an issue, plenty of entertainment and info from the tour guides. 29. Book at Grand Riviera Princess and you get a room in Grand Riviera Princess. If by any chance you do end up in the Sunset, it's a mirror image and both sides are immaculate! (unless perhaps they put the grumpy americans in some secret shabby rooms as a wind up!) 28. Sunset side is just as nice, enough said! 27. At the Resort they are mosquitos galore, you will wear insect repellant 24/7 and sleep in it. There's a few mosquito's, may I suggest you use lime shower gel? It seemed to keep them away. We never once got bitten in the room. 26. Rumour has it that the mosquito's are vicious....although we never bumped into one that threatened us during our trip! 25. The food here is what you expect from an all inclusive buffet, the restaurants are slightly better standard. We suggest you try the chill out bar on an evening for a particularly special meal. (you pay for this as it's not included among the 5 other restaurants that are but well worth it) 24. The buffet is what you expect in another country, I find they are mostly the same wherever you go. We are particularly fussy but never went hungry, a massive variety and very fresh. 23. The salad bar is huge, along with a massive choice of bread, pastries, desserts, drinks, and good hot food. You can't expect a huge variety of italian meats at a mexican buffet! 22. You have to make reservations for restaurants 3 days ahead.. never had any problems booking in and even got a last minute cancellation when we asked. 21. In the heat of Mexico, nobody wants to wear tuxedo's! Men must wear trousers to the restaurants but that's the only requirement. 20. Never went to the fondue restaurant, but had I done, I wouldn't expect anything other than melted swiss cheese as I thought that was the main ingredient of fondue! 19. In fondue restaurant, remember that they can only serve seafood the size of whatever they catch in the sea! 18. All guests are treated equally and very well, but for some reason the americans and canadians feel they deserve a superior service! The staff smile if you say 'Hola' in the morning :) 17. We didn't have a swim-up room. I have heard that eyeballs are a delicacy for mosquito's! We had a walk-up room that we used everyday, the gecko's are much friendlier. 16. Meal times are well spaced out with a large window for those late risers giving you ample time to get food. If you don't want to waste time walking all the way to the main buffet at lunch, there is a smaller one half way down or grab a hotdog at the beach bbq. 15. If you miss meal times, you're a slow walker. 14. We never witnessed people fighting with hot dogs in the sports bar, only people eating them quite happily! 13. Grumpy American's who are rude deserve bad attitude from the staff. Service was always polite and staff always willing to help. 12. Bell boy delivered our luggage approximately 2 minutes after we got in the room. Appreciate the number of cases and the size of the hotel. This was pretty quick! 11. The resort is big, but there is a little shuttle on the paths at the side of the hotel which you can just hop on. Restaurants are placed at both ends of the hotel so it's not really a problem. 10. It's probably not the best hotel for disabled people, but then again most resorts in Mexico are very big. 9. Maybe you haven't noticed but it's dark by 8pm in August, you really wouldn't want to still be in the pool. There was plenty of time to walk to the pool, spend the day sunbathing and swimming and fit lunch and dinner in! May I suggest you try to enjoy your holiday instead of finding everything to moan about. 8. How on earth did it take all day for somebody to get to the pool and eat lunch?? 7. The hotel is 10 minutes from the main strip in Playa Del Carmen. The shuttle bus is available to everybody, just remember to book one day before. Alternatively, take a taxi, it's not expensive. 6. You cannot miss dinner, there's food everywhere. And how much do you expect when you're eating dinner after 11pm? 5. No problems with air-con, it worked a wonder and stopped those mossies trying to bite my eyes. We only saw 3 cockroaches and they were all dead and outside. 4. There is a fridge included, and what a shocker, it's not as big as the one we have at home! It's plenty big enough for a nice selection of cold drinks which were refilled every single day. 3. The rooms are very clean, when we forgot our safe code they had someone waiting outside our room to sort it before we even got back from asking. 2.. Staff at restaurant reservations had a booking sheet out on the desk of availability, so there's no way they can pick their favourite guests. Once again, be polite to the staff and they'll be polite back. 1. There was one pool which had music in the day which was a bit livlier than the many others, but there was definitely no pool parties at night. All in all, this hotel deserves far more credit than the americans and canadians give it. Bare in mind that this is one of the cheaper hotels, and you're getting yourself a damn good holiday. Definitely somewhere we would go back to and recommend to everybody looking for the most perfect holiday in Mexico.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "west sussex", "Title": "\u201cCANT WAIT TO GO BACK!!!!!!!! 2012!!!

The BBQ on the each was great and the burgers were lush!

We looked at most of the recent reviews before we booked, despite there being 1 or 2 negative reviews we decided on this place. The hotel overall was very good, if not excellent. I wouldnt go as far as a 5 Star but i'd say its definitely a good 4 Star. The place was immacuately clean thoughout and the staff were all very very friendly, and couldnt do enough to for you. Our room in block 7 was very comfortable and the air con fantastic, if anything sometimes too cold (which we were very easily able to sort out). We ate at the buffet most of the time and the quality and choice was fantastic. The only real negative for the food, and its only a very slight neagtive, was that we thought the 2 a la carte restaurants we went too werent up to much. For people travelling from Scotland, the teppanyaki place Miso isnt a patch on Sapporo in Glasgow or Koi in Edinburgh, its not bad, its just not as good as those places. Drinks were good, Corona in the main beer, and you could get brand name whiskey and vodka etc just by asking for them. The only thing i'd say is dont expect real single malts or real top end brandies etc. But your standard Jim Beam, or Grey Goose or Absolut were all available on the standard all inclusive deal. There are 3 main pool areas, with 4 main pools, 3 of which have swim up bars. The middle pool which my girlfriend immediately dubbed the Lady Gaga pool was far and away the busiest and nosiest. We tended to go there later in the afternoon to have a couple of drinks and laugh at people who'd had a couple too many struggle getting out the pool. The other pools were quieter and you could generally get a sun lounger at those with no problem at all anytime of the day. The beach was very good, clean, not too much sea weed (which was cleared most days) and the water was crystal clear. The non motorised water sports were easy to book etc. We had a go at the kayak's which were good fun and very easy. Cant comment on the jet ski's etc as we didnt have a go on those. If you dont get down to the beach reasonably early in the morning then you may struggle to get a sun lounger. On the days when we werent going to make it down in the morning we just went to the pool close to the beach till early afternoon and then went down to the beach. We did a went snorkelling with Whale Sharks which was easily the best activity we did, its difficult to describe just how good this is. If you're even a moderately confident swimmer of any age you should do this. On our boat we had kids of 8-10 and they were able to do it no problem. The only thing i'd say is that there are 2 main companies that do this, the company that Best Day in the hotel will book is definitley the best. We also went to Xplor and Xel Ha, both of those were really good fun. If you like zip lining i'd definitely recommend Xplor, which also has small amphibious buggy's which my girlfriend loved. Xel Ha is also really good with a load of very very easy snorkelling where you'll be surrounded by lots of tropical fish, they've also got dolphins and manatees. They've also got a couple of small cliff jumps which were really good, like a couple of medium sized jumps you'd do canyoning at the Bruar gorge (but the water is far far warmer). Overall a great couple of weeks, far more to do outside the resorts than we thought (but in fairness we didnt do a lot of reseach), a load more natural park type stuff that we didnt get to this trip.

The entertainment team were superb in every way and the shows they performed in the evening were first class no matter what your age. The pools were fantastic especially the pool bar Maya where Rolando the bar man made fantastic cocktails, made you feel welcome and played a big part in making our Honeymoon special.

This was the first time either of us had been to an all-inclusive resort. GROUNDS: Immaculate. I swear the staff worked on it 24/7. HOTEL SIZE: Pretty big! Not good for people who don't like to walk a lot. ROOM: Very nice, big room. I believe our room was a junior deluxe, whatever it was called it was the 2nd from the bottom room class and it was still fine. The air conditioning was refreshing and cooled you down quickly. CLEANLINESS: We found the rooms were pretty clean, nothing crazy to complain about. The shower was a little moldy but it wasn't that big a deal. Saw one or two bugs in the sink - I HATE bugs so this bothered me but obviously not a deal-breaker! FOOD: I can't sugarcoat it, the food was bad - not inedible, but don't worry about overeating on vacay if you choose this resort. I'm not a picky eater and I really didn't care for it. It didn't bother me that much at first but I never felt like I had a full or satisfying meal, which cut in to my alcohol consumption LOL! Don't let this scare you off, though. If you're a picky eater, you might actually do well here. My fianc\u00e9 is a picky eater (hates vegetables, basically eats like a 6 year old) and he liked the food more than I did. Which is kind of messed up... DRINKS: As weak or strong as you like, OFTEN. The bartenders are great here! Tip them and they'll treat you very well. POOLS/POOL BARS: Clean enough, but could use a bit of updating. There are TONS of pools on this property! Great selection. Three pool bars, one is the central \"party bar\". Fun atmosphere - you could find a pool for any mood you were in. SERVICE: Amazing!! We tipped to show our gratitude - whether it made a difference or not, I don't know. The bartenders, waiters, and maids are all very friendly! Not one bad thing to say here. SUMMARY: If you can get a good deal on your trip, you'd have a good time at this hotel. I'd recommend it more to people travelling with friends, or families with smaller children. It is a very kid-friendly resort. **I would not recommend this resort to couples trying to get away on a romantic vacation. I also wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like a lot of walking. Also, leave your taste buds at home...**", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExtremely Satisfied - Would Recommend this Hotel\u201d", "Author": "snuggles23", "ReviewID": "UR117728289", "Content": "Spent two (2) weeks Aug 19-Sep 02 2011 with my sister. After reading both positive & negative reviews, we decided to try this resort. We can agree and understand both the positive & negative reviews, but overall it was an amazing experience & were impressed. We loved our time there & had a very POSITIVE EXPERIENCE! We booked with Westjet & stayed on the Riviera side in a swimout room. (The Sunset side is the mirror image & share all amenities- it is all one resort but sold as two). Deluxe Junior Suite rooms entitle you to almost all a la cartes except for restaurants & areas in which Platinium guests have paid for. LOCATION AIRPORT/HOTEL TRANSFERS: We flew into Cancun & Westjet employs \"Best Day Travel\" for their Airport/Hotel Transfers. Best Day is also located in the hotel lobby & books tours etc. The hotel is approximately 35-40 min from the Airport. CHECK-IN: We were greeted in the lobby with a welcome drink & check in was very prompt & easy. You are given 2 room cards & towel cards as well as our wristbands/ bracelets. We were advised that lost room cards would cost, so would towels & wristbands. We never had a problem as we never lost any of them. Check in is at 3pm. Our room wasn't ready yet but we went directly behind the lobby bar to book our a la carte reservations (booked 3 nights worth) & by the time we were done our room was ready. With hotel map in hand, we made our way through the splendid grounds & traded our towel cards for beach towels on our way. GROUNDS & CLEANLINESS; The hotel layout is long, running away from the beach...versus wide along the beach. So, from the beach to the lobby is approx. a 5-10 minute walk. There is a shuttle that runs every 10 min but we never took it, the grounds are so exquisite & well manicured that we enjoyed the walk & would look for reasons to walk to the front. We had a room very close to the beach so it was the opposite end of the lobby. Near the lobby are 2 of the breakfast & lunch buffets, a la carte restaurants & evening shows but looked forward to our strolls. Where ever you look, every minute of the day, they are cleaning everywhere, and manicuring the grounds. Every evening, they bleach the walkways for goodness sake! The pools are salt water pools & we noticed the cleaning crew every morning. There are some signs of wear and tear, missing tiles, but nothing to complain about. We had no problems with mosquitos, only one or two bites in the evening but noticed that they spray the vegetation every few days. HOTEL ROOM, IN-ROOM SAFE & DELUXE JUNIOR SWIM-OUT: The Hotel Room was beautifully decorated & very clean. We had 2 double beds with one night stand w/ 2 drawers between the beds. The room has a bench which holds two regular luggage comfortabley on it but the room lacks drawers, so we lived out of our luggage for two weeks which I personally don't like to do & were only able hang some things in the closet. The closet has the safe, an iron & ironing board & two shelves. We read scary reviews about the in room safe but we never had a problem. We placed everything in there & it was never tampered with. The bathroom has a hair dryer, a magnify mirror, an assortment of complimentary shower caps, comb, kleenex, hand soap & body soap. Our room had a seperate shower, toilet area & jacuzzi tub (we didn't use, water was a bit brown) Note: We realized that we got very severe stomach cramps after we brushed our teeth with tap water. Use the bottled water (3 per day provided in the minifridge) and the cramps disappeared. Mini-fridge everyday consisted of 1 club soda, 2 beers, 1 diet pepsi, 1 pepsi, 1 7-up, 1-fanta orange, 3 bottles of water. What we didn't use up, we would take out of the fridge & store the water we didn't use & they would replenish. We always had an extra water or two or soda if we emptied the fridge. The swim-out room was a delightful treat. Out the sliding door was a covered patio with 2 loungers & then stairs down into the pool. It is a nice option but it is NOT private or only for swim-out room guests. People from all over the resort find refuge in your \"private\" area & so you do have to close drapes, be carefull with the sliding door being vulnerable whilst you are swimming about if you venture further than the 10-15 feet outside your room & people do use the path beyond your swimout to get to different areas of the resort. SERVICE: I give the service two thumbs up! Everyone is so kind & helpful. We requested a clock radio, they brought immediately. We requested extra towels, they were brought promptly. A pot-lite was burnt out in the bathroom, we didn't even have to call, the maid must have noticed & when we returned, it was changed up & working. The beds & pillows are a little harder than I like, the maid brought extra padding & softer pillows. The hotel staff at all levels is pleasant & kind & willing to help every which way they can. They work long & hard. We found that $USD is the currency of choice everywhere & Pesos. Do NOT give CDN Loonies or Twonnies the banks will not accept them for exchange & so they are useless to the staff. We tipped the maid $3-5 USD everyday. Breakfast $1-2, Lunch $1-2 and at A-LA-Carte $3-5 (for 2 people) We never saw a drink butler at the swimout. There was some service at the beach but we mostly went to get our own drinks. FOOD & WINE & DRINKS: The food was incredible~! The wine, not so much, it's on tap. (buy a bottle or take a cab to wal-mart & buy bottled wine) Every drink imaginable & premium brands. I can't understand some of the negative reviews about the food. We booked our A-LA-CARTES every few days. You are allowed to book 2-3 in advance and the booking girls are located behind the bar in the main lobbies. There are 4 buffets. Two at the front of the hotel near the lobby areas & two just before the beach. All 4 serve breakfast & lunch. The two up front are dinner buffets & the two near the beach turn into a la carte for dinner. The buffet buildings closer to the beach turn into Tapas, La Fondue, Las Olas. A couple of days after we arrived we found out was considered \"low season\" so they closed Tapas & La Fondue was only open Tuesdays, Wednesday & Thursdays. So if you travel between the end of August to April, they've closed some restaurants and limited the days on others. The buffets offer a different theme night and a huge selection. It was fresh & tasty & all the stations were very clean. They always had beautifully carved fruits & veggies for display, very impressive & lovely. My favourite A-LA-CARTES in the following order: LA FLEUR: French. Excellent food & presentation. MISO: Asian. Offers 3 eating experiences & you have to book as such: Teppanyaki,Chinese (chinese seems more tai than chinese) & Sushi LA FONDUE: Swiss fondue - amazing & delicious. Meet pre-cooked & sooo tastey. MAMMA MIA: Italian - perhaps it was what I ordered, but my sister had very good pasta. LA HACIENDA: Mexican - Authentic mexican, very interesting, tastey. LA VAQUERIA: The steakhouse that is always booked solid & the most popular. Gave it two tries & truly had better filet mignon & steak at the buffets. LAS OLAS: Seafood - did not dine there. TAPAS: was closed for low season so did not dine there. BEACH & BEACH BAR & BBQ: It is paradise! It is a fantastic beach. The sand is fine & powdery & doesn't get hot. You can walk on it at high noon~! During our 14 day stay, we had our share of all sorts of weather but on the most part, it was 37-40 degrees, hot, humid & wonderful. We had some overcast days & rain storms & noticed that the ocean would get a little rough, murky & the seaweed would be plentiful. Beach workers were out at 7am cleaning seawood from the beach every morning & raking & cleaning any garbage from the sand everywher. There are few rocks when you first enter but not everywhere. We didn't need water shoes. You can walk out 30 feet and the water is at your waste~! We always found beach chairs between 7-10am or in the later afternoon. There are vendors obstructing the ocean view but they don't bother you & you don't have to get chairs at that part of the beach either. The resort has a lot of beach front. We would go for early morning walks on the beach & swims & felt safe, there were always the early morning beach joggers. There is one (1) beach bar and a beach BBQ in the afternoon serving fantastic burgers, hot dogs & nachos. Buffets close at 3pm so between 3pm-6pm you can only get food at the Sportsbar or the beach BBQ. There are no washrooms directly on the beach but are located close enough, near the bridge leading to the beach. CONCIERGE & FREE SHUTTLE TO PLAYA DEL CARMEN & TAXIS: The concierge desk is located in the lobby near the front desk. Our concierge was Alex. He is truly an exceptional person. Always smiling & helpful & very kind. He was a wealth of knowledge & helped us with everything from a clock radio delivered to our room to navigating our way to Cozumel. Everyday between 8-11am you have the opportunity to book a seat on the free shuttle to Playa del Carmen for the FOLLOWING DAY. We never had any problem booking seats. There are two buses going to Playa del Carmen at 10am & 12:30 and return at 1:30 & 5:00. PLAYA DEL CARMEN: 5th Avenue = an endless pedestrian only street lined with stores & restaurants, coffee shops including Starbucks & ice-cream shops. A nice day out. CAB FARES: One way to/from Hotel/Playa del Carmen $19 USD One way to/from Hotel/Plaza Las Americas $20 USD (Shopping Mall) One way to WAL-MART from where the free hotel shuttle drops you off $3 USD One way to/from WAL-MART/Hotel $19 USD FERRY TO COZUMEL FROM PLAYA DEL CARMEN PORT: We took the free shuttle bus from the hotel to Playa del Carmen & walked about 10 min to the port. We took the red & black ferry $26 USD return - approx 35-40 min. ON THE DOWNSIDE BUT WOULD NOT HINDER US FROM RETURNING: On both weekends that we were there, an influx of Mexican tourists. Because they speak the language, they do seem to overtake the hotel for 3 days and do seem to push their way but such is life. We took it in stride & smiled, we're on vacation & chose to be happy & thankful. The hotel was going into low season so some restaurants were closed & we didn't experience full amenities. The hotel shows some signs of wear and tear but they are always fixing & cleaning. Overall, we're extremely glad we didn't let the negative comments scare us away from this hotel. We have travelled extensively and would highly recommend this hotel.

First impressions, fantastic! The lobby is well done out, there's a bar, plenty of seats and even shops downstairs. However the person on the desk was not helpful. It took about 25 minutes to check in. They told us that there wasn't two rooms available together. We ended up getting one platinum room and one junior delxue suite (orginally book two junior deluxe suites). It is worth paying the little extra for at least the junior delxue, the rooms are much nicer and they are closer to the pool and beach. I didn't understand why they have the princess riviera and the sunset. We had orginally booked for the sunset but we stayed on riviera side. Everythings share but however the riviera was more expensive online. If you stay in the junior delxue or platinum you get access to a lot more resturants. The food is excellent. They cater for everyones food type. We stayed for two weeks and I got a bit sick of the lunch by the end but on an even they have different themed nights at the buffet restaurants. There's two buffet restaunts near the pool/beach and two at the lobby. The a la carte restaurants are fantastic, especially for the price you pay, i'd recommend the japanese cooking show. You have to book these and they fill up fast. You can book two days in advance you have to go the reception area after 2pm. This is not a resort for adults wanting to get away from everything to a nice quite resort. It has lots of families but there is plenty of seating area. There are many pools with jacuzzis in the middle of them and also pool bars at the top ones. Serivce at the bar is sometimes fast and sometimes slow, it just depends. The drink are very nice! On a hot day the pool is like a hot bath. We normally went to the beach in the afternoon because there's a breeze. The beach bar is great, theres an area when you can get food in containers to go like burgers, hot dogs, chicken wings and nachos. The beach is very busy but theres a quite section at the left side. The watersports hut (right side of the beach) is fantastic. Most things are free. We did sailing everyday (had to pay for a induction) but you have to book this. You have to pay for the jet ski but it's worth it. You can also do parasailing (looks awsome!),scuba diving, kayaking and snorkelling. The sea is lovely and cleaer and the water is warm however i'd bring beach shoes because there are rocks when entering the water. The only downside I found was that since we were staying at the top (near the beach) it was a very long walk to lobby for our meals and for the bar. There is a schuttle which runs to the lobby but is often busy. It would be good if there was a bar nearer the top end. If you didn't know there was an explosion in November 2011 in the platinum lounge on the riviera side(where we were staying). You can see it has been sealed off but it would benefit the platinum guests on the rivera side if this were rebuilt. The mexican people are very nice and very hard working. We give the maid a good tip and she made our rooms extra special. The mini bar in the room is free and is restocked daily which is good. Wifi isn't free which i can understand due to the number of guests however the prices are shocking: $10 for 30 minutes. There's an area at the lobby to book trips; we went on the chitzenitza (pyramid) trip which was worth seeing. I would deffinitely recommend the xel-ha outdoor aquarium, fantastic - check out their website. There is an indoor pool and spa as well as gym however we didn't go. The shops are handy for gifts, suncream, lilos, food etc. We went into town twice; taxi is expensive so make the most of your trip. It's nice going on the evening or a colder day, if you don't mind paying, go to the bars or restaurants there, they are excellent. There are plenty of shops as well for gifts.

The buffets were vast in food quality and selection, and the a la carte restaurants were an superb fine dining experience .

What? Huh? Are they sure they were at this resort?! I do not know what people are expecting here. If you can't walk around the resort, lay off the buffets and ease up and the dacquiris.

If you drink all the beer in your in-room fridge or need more bottled water, just ask and they'll bring it. Tipping is important-- the staff on the resort make just a few dollars per day (members of our group asked the staff), and the cost of living in that area of Mexico is rather high, so they really do rely on the tips. And the service is so great, they really do deserve your tips! Our wedding day was tons of fun and our wedding coordinator, Mara, and the rest of the Princess staff worked made sure everything ran smoothly and were very accomodating. They decorated the beach area for our ceremony (even adding additional details, such as flowers, that we didn't expect!), then moved the chair covers and bows we'd rented to the restaurant for our dinner, and had everything ready by the time we took some photos and walked over. They also played the music we provided on CD, while the guests walked in, then switched to the songs we'd chosen for walking down the aisle. Then, they even put our other CD of songs back on, without being asked, while we took photos after the ceremony. We had a swim-up suite, which we HIGHLY recommend. It was nice to be able to swim and relax and have a few drinks in our own area, which is alot quieter and more private than the main pools. It is also good if you're a couple- if one person is sleeping in, the other one can slip out the screen door and go for a swim first thing in the morning. The resort is IMMACULATE- everything is so clean and shiny and perfect. You can't walk across the resort without seeing shrubs being pruned and windows and floors being washed- the staff are constantly hard at work! Just watch out for the marble walkways- they get slippery! :) The food is delicious, and with the multiple a la cartes and 2 buffets for supper and 3 buffets for breakfast, we never got bored of the food. We went off of the resort several days (rented a car from the resort), so we didn't even manage to try all of the a la cartes! The Princess also has activities, and you can hang out at the main pool or relax in the quieter areas. It is really good for making the trip what you want it to be. There are Princess staff by the pool getting groups involved in different contests, etc. and there are shows in the evening (Flamenco dancing, acrobatics, \"Grease\", etc.) We didn't getting involved in the activities or see many evening shows, as we stayed busy doing our own thing and doing activities off the resort.

The resort is fabulous. Big, yes but not dauntingly so. The lobby is at the top, the beach at the bottom with all pools, bars and restaurants in between. It isnt loads of walking, it takes no more than 5 mins to get from lobby to beach. Just fall into one of the many pool bars on the way if 5 mins is too much in one go! There are in the region of 8 pools and they are cleaned everyday. There were one or two tiles missing in the large salt pool if you want to be picky but we used 5 of the 8 pools and never found a problem with any of them. Some do become dirty towards the end of the day but is that surprising with all the drinking and sun cream? We had a junior suite, 3rd floor as we only booked 6 wks before we travelled and it was all the had left. It was a fabulous room, really large with a great bathroom. There was no problem with it being on the 3rd floor ( prob less bugs which is a major +). It was very clean and well maintained. The safes were fine, don't get the issue with the safes at all. The food in the buffet was excellent. The waiters and waitresses are so helpful and genuinely seem to enjoy serving you. The a la cartes tended to be hit n miss. The Japanese, italian, the grill and the Swiss were the best ones. If you have a platinum room there are an additional 2 a la cartes you could choose from but without these, there was plenty of food choice. The Swiss is an absolute must. The food was excellent. The beach is gorgeous and the sea so clear you can see the fish swimming around your legs. We loved the beach and never struggled to get a bed. The beach BBQ was great too. The paella was divine. The evening entertainment wasn't too hot (the shows) however different live bands played in the plaza bar each night and some of them were really quite good. Each evening there were two tables serving liquor coffees by the plaza and they were fab to watch and the coffee was great. The resort is in a really good location, about 15minutes from Playa del Carmen. There is a shuttle bus each day, but you have to book it the day before you want to go. It's only a small bus and the places were filled very quickly. Twice we tried and failed to get a place. We ended up getting a taxi which cost 200 pesos (roughly \u00a310) each way which wasnt too bad. We had a great holiday in this resort and I would not hesitate to recommend it. I would definitely stay there again should I choose to go back to Mexico. I love the country and I love the people but the 700 pesos per person (or $59) to leave the country really puts me off wanting to return. Incidentally, before the hols we were confused about the best currency to take as they apparently dont accept dollars. Everywhere we went, the price was in dollars. We took mostly pesos and this did work out the cheaper option but we constantly had to ask for a price in pesos.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatchewan", "Title": "\u201cNice - but not perfect - (lots of little issues)\u201d", "Author": "WestJet_fan", "ReviewID": "UR117569513", "Content": "This is a very big resort, with LOTS of walking required. The Good: Excellent food, helpful staff everywhere except for front desk - who are \"fair\" at best. Very nice grounds, pools and beach area. Now for the BAD: Upstairs toilet leaked into our room for 2 weeks, not fixed? Front desk staff refused to accommodate any of our group of 18 requests to change rooms, correct problems, etc. An older couple had third floor rooms, not the promised ground level rooms as reserved. Newly weds had twin beds and front desk staff would not change this. Several buildings separated our family members, and front desk would not accommodate any request for a closer room during our entire 14-day stay stating they were 100% full! (Yet people were constantly checking in)? They locked us out of our room after one week here, insisting that this was all we had paid for. When I showed them all my receipts for two weeks, it still took almost a full day to correct this issue, as they stated the travel agent (Thomas Cook) only paid them for one week. They refused to let me use their telephone to straighten this out. When I complained to the front desk manager, he summoned over two security guards who then demanded that I put my shirt on (instead of carrying it). The fact that two-dozen other people were in the lobby dressed only in their bathing suits didn't seem to matter? They then stood beside me trying to intimidate me during my disagreement with the front desk manager. The resort had no record of our daughter's wedding being booked and paid in advance and told us that they were booked solid and her wedding could not occur here. Lots of loud complaining had to be done to correct this. However the next wedding planner was excellent! There are several private restaurants to eat in, instead of using the main dining rooms, but be prepared to line up days in advance and for 1 to 2 hours earlier each the morning, to get into some of the nicer ones. Unless you spoke Spanish, the staff making these supper reservations was quite rude. It seemed that if you spoke Spanish there were always available space in the restaurants, but if you didn't, the restaurants were always full for the next three days, (which is the maximum time you could book ahead). The hotel states that they offer a free shuttle into Playa. True, but try to use it. It took us three days to learn all the rules surrounding using this and consisted of only small bus that left early each morning, which again you needed reservations 24 hours in advance, but you weren't allowed to reserve it two or three days in advance. It had to be exactly 24 hours in advance! Instead, we ended up walking the 10-15 minutes to the highway and catching the local bus into Playa, which was much easier to do. No negotiating price with the cab drivers. There is only ONE rate to and from the resort. ($20.00 US). However the cabs are clean and new and the hotel staff checks you in and out with the cab number when you leave (in case you go missing). BTW the fitness center is a joke, broken equipment repaired with rusty wires and duct tape...not safe at all. Your local Motel 6 will have a nicer fitness center. Most equipment did not work. If this is important, book elsewhere. Yet, all in all, a real nice resort and we had a nice holiday/wedding. They need a new front desk manager and staff which is by far, the weakest link in the entire complex, but unfortunately the place you needed to go to correct any issue.

Overall we had a wonderful vacation. The resort is HUGE as everyone says. Lots of walking! After checking in we were given the best room on the property I believe. We had a third floor ocean front room. Here is the deal with this place..they only have TWO buildings that have ocean views. The resort is built in such a way that very few rooms are ocean front. Waking up each morning to the sign of the ocean made the trip. If we had one of the many other rooms with pool or garden views I might not have enjoyed it that much. But that is all a matter of preference. The pools are a bit run down but we are more beach people and actually only went in the pool once. The beach is fabulous..VERY clean and clear and excellent. If you move down the beach a bit..you will not even notice the vendors. Actually I got a massage on the beach one day for $40 and it was WELL worth the money and very good. The food on the beach is pretty good also. The food in the resort is ok..I mean they are fixing food everyday for well over 1000 people. It isnt going to be excellent. My children were always able to find something they liked. We also went to the new XPLOR park and it was AMAZING!!! I would truly reccommend it! The zip lining is fabulous.

The cons in the reviews I read were: Big Resort Bad Food Poor Customer Service Unsafe Safes Crowded beach Here's the thing. This place is Huge. Like 700 rooms huge. So when it's near capacity, there can be well over a thousand people there. Given the size and volume of this place, it's understandable that some things are missed or not what you were hoping for. If you go with a great attitude and are happy to be there, you should have a great time. If you go looking to find faults and expect special attention, you are not going to be pleased. But it is also beautiful. It will take about 8-10 minutes to walk from the lobby to the beach unless you get lost or you have difficulty walking. Look at a map of the resort before you go and you should not get lost- there are also little markers everywhere telling you what room numbers you are near- I don't understand how people get lost here. The Grand Riviera is on the North Side (left side looking at the beach) and the Grand Sunset is on the South Side (right side looking at the beach). FOOD The buffet food was poor. I ate breakfast each morning at the buffet, and you can always find something to eat, but you are never really excited about anything you get. Which is ok, because you probably will not over-eat. Breakfast: There are scrambled eggs, fried eggs and a made-to-order omelet area. Be careful with the scrambled and fried eggs, if they've been there too long under the heat lamp, they start to harden. Wait until they bring the fresh ones out. My gf and I both got a fried egg one day and when you started to cut it, it was like one of those plastic toy eggs- you could played Frisbee with it. There is usually a line for the omelets and I waited for one on one occasion and it was fine, edible, but just grabbing some scrambled eggs and getting it over with to get outside in the sun was the better alternative. The bacon when they had it (every other day) was also ok- a little fatty and salty and over cooked. The sausage was hit or miss. I tried one piece of every different style they had over the week. Most of them were pretty bad- tasted like warm slim-jims, but there was one that was decent. I don't remember the style and never saw it again though. Otherwise there are Mexican style foods: Taquitos, empanadas, Chips and salsas and guacamole. All of these were fine. Not the best you've had, but nothing to turn your nose up at. Lunch: was the same sort of thing- usually one or two things you eat while moving the other stuff around on your plate. The chicken wings were decent, the onion rings were terrible. I never tried the pasta station, where it looked like they were basically frying your cooked pasta for you with some veggies. For me, I was in and out- eat whatever you can, and get back out in the sun, pool or beach. Dinner: The a-la Cartes were decent. Again- if you have the mindset that you are there for a good time, and enjoy a few drinks, the food will not matter as much. We did Vaqueria, Miso, La Fleur and La Hacienda. And our favorites were in that order. You can sign up for as many as you like, up to 3 or 4 days in advance (can't remember) but you have to wait in line. It's worth it though since it is so much better than the dinner buffet. We ate out two nights in Playa- one night we were going to get an appetizer and drink at Senor Frogs before dinner, but the Nachos were huge, and that's all we could eat. The other night, we skipped the app, and went to Los Rancheros which has a pretty cool roof-top. It had decent food, but I wish we had ventured off the beaten path a little more to find something more local. SERVICE The service was decent. I have to agree that the check-in people were a bit brusque and seemed to want me to just leave. I imagine that they deal with the same complaints over and over and they do not have a lot of managerial back-up which means they are left to answer questions they may be unsure of, so in order to avoid those, they try to move you along quickly (even if no one else is around). The bar-tenders are nice and if you speak to them and smile at them and leave a tip, they will remember you and joke with you. The same with your waiters. I left $3 each day in our room for the maid and $3 each day in the fridge for the drink guy with a note asking for agua and cerveza. We never ran out of either. The last few days, the drink guy was giving us a bottle of tequila each day. SAFES We used our in-room safe and never had a problem. The lady at the desk did say not to leave our key card in the light switch slot as it can get stolen when the maids are working in the room. I think the broken-into safes are a function of people having their room cards stolen from the light switch while the maid is working in the room, and that person coming back later when no one is there and prying open the safes. I also heard that this was happening more when the construction crews were around after the explosion in November. I would feel comfortable leaving your valuables in the safe, just make sure to use an old gift card or something else in your light switch that keeps the lights on so your room key is not stolen. BEACH The beach is big and the water is crystal clear- very beautiful. The beach can get crowded and people definitely get up early and save seats with towels. My GF and I went out one morning around 11 after lounging around the pool, and there were almost no seats to be found. However- if you turn right (south) and go down around the water-sports and beach soccer area, there are usually seats on either side of that water-sports hut that are unclaimed. It's further from the bar, but it's also further from the crowd. Bring water shoes if you have them- it makes the first few feet of ocean easier on the feet- it's not bad if you don't have them though. A few feet of small pebbles and then sand and crystal clear water. Head south on the beach for a great long walk- plenty to see and it's secluded and you'll get away from the crowds at GRP. Extra Tips: The Riviera Side Platinum Rooms on the beach are not ready yet (as of July) after the explosion- that area still looks boarded up and inaccessible and the Riviera Platinum Lounge is where the Piano Bar near the lobby used to be. I followed the signs to the piano bar one night and found the Platinum Lounge. I asked the bar tender who at first explained that the piano bar was near the center of the resort. When I asked him to explain exactly where, he sheepishly told me he meant the A La Carte restaurant La Fleur, where they have moved the piano, but the piano is in the Restaurant. Not a big deal, but it's not a piano bar. I would definitely recommend the swim-up room- you always have a place in the shade on your balcony and you feel like you have your own private pool. If you book a swim-up room on the Riviera side (and parts of the Sunset side) you will not be able to swim to the swim-up bar. You will need to get out of the pool you are in and hop into the pool bar pool, or just walk to one of the less crowded pool bars. It's only 5 feet of walking, but if you've booked the room, you might want to know that. Technically, that main pool area where you have swim-up rooms, is made up of about 3 or 4 different pools- they've just concreted off some of the swim under bridges. They've probably done this to be able to clean each pool effectively, and frankly, I was glad our swim-up room pool wasn't connected to the pool bar pool- it felt cleaner. The cab to Playa Del Carmen costs $19. If you ask for a cheaper price, they look at you crazy and say \"that's what it costs.\" However, like with all things in Mexico, you can haggle them down. (You could haggle the cost of dinner down at the restaurants if you start to walk away after looking at the menu- just tell them someone down the street gave you a %10 discount off the bill \"la cuenta\"- which they will give you or I would not have known to ask). Anyway- it's more difficult to haggle the cab guy at the resort on the way to playa, but the cabs on the way back will come down if you start to walk away. On that note, nothing is worth what the price tag says in Mexico. If the price is listed at $10, it's worth $3. Bubba cups or insulated mugs. I think these were definitely a good idea and so did everyone who did not have one. The bartenders are happy to put whatever you like in them. They save plastic cups, they keep your drink cool, and they're bigger than the cups they give you so you can go longer without having to get back in line at the bar. I saw two girls who brought the Bubba keg cups. I doubt they had to go to the bar more than once. The bartenders will also make your drink however you ask them just be friendly and definitely ask about whatever special drinks they can make. Tipping always helps. Floats. We bought $4 inflatable floats at Marshalls before we left and they were worth it. The floats they sell there were exactly the same and cost $12. In the pool they are so-so, but floating around in the ocean waves is pretty nice. We gave these away to family's with kids before leaving and they were happy to have them. We did an excursion at Xel-ha and enjoyed it. TONS of snorkeling and decent food and drink. I would say give it a try if you like snorkeling. Not too much cave snokeling though, so if that's what you're looking for, try somewhere else. Overall, it was a good trip and we had fun. I would not go back because there are so many other places in the world to see and this place did not stand out in any way that would make you want to come back.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bologna", "Title": "\u201cTop Room and resort size!

I have been to Mexico about 10 times at various resorts, and this was definitely not my favorite! However its all in perspective, because if you have been to a 5 star resort before like the Dreams or the Royal then this is a down grade but if you haven't then I'm sure it could still be enjoyable! We just went in with higher expectations. I will try to keep this short but skip to the very bottom for the most important piece of information! We booked platinum and were expecting to be greeted with drinks - never happened. We had a bunch of struggles with our room and were put into a Junior Swim-Up suite, which we were not too fussy about because they ensured us we would still get all of the platinum amenities (plus I liked the idea of swim up). We get to the room and it has two double beds instead of the king we had requested (super romantic), and there was no mini-bar. Ran back to the front desk to change that and were told all kings were booked unless we downgraded to an even lesser room but we could try again tomorrow. Were told that someone was going to bring us our mini bar and put a note on our file. Later we tried to order room service and were told we would be charged since we were in a Junior Suite (even though we payed platinum) and they don't get free room service so we had to go through about 10 different people to get that sorted. We went the entire week with people telling us that they were sending us our mini bar and that it would come later that day and it never did, and we also never got the king. The room was nice enough, pretty standard. We were excited for the jacuzzi tub but it was so stinking hot out that we only used it on the very last night and I got grossed out cause bits of skin pumped out of the nozzle. We didn't have a visible bug problem like others did, but I did wake up with mysterious itchy bites. Only two beer in the mini fridge with pop and water which was always restocked daily. Pretty standard. My favorite part was having the swim-up room, which was the only saving grace of having to put up with the Junior-Suite stuff. Every night we would go for some drinks, go sit on the beach and then go for a late night swim and since our pool was kind of hidden (and pools close at 8) we were only asked to get out once. In regards to the food, I have read many reviews with people saying \"I am not a picky eater but the food was bad\", and I have to agree. The buffets were pretty standard and yes there were things I could find to eat, but a lot of the time it was super oily or old and hard from sitting under the heat lamp. Luckily the breakfast is pretty decent, hard to go wrong there, and if you really don't like the buffet it is easy enough to avoid for lunch and supper if you book at one of the other restaurants and there is a BBQ hut on the beach for lunch with burgers, chips and guac etc.. As for the other restaurants- you have to book 2 days in advance, and all the ones we went to were empty half the time. Food was mediocre. EXCEPT the sushi and fondu restaurants were great! Miso has three different menus- sushi, chinese and show cooking (I was excited for the show cooking but it was the most bland meal I ate the entire week so i suggest skipping that). They have two shows every night and those are great- better than others I have seen at different resorts. Bars were good- plenty of booze. Corona on tap. If you want premium liquors they have them but you gotta pay, but they have a pretty good selection of free booze. If you order something that takes a bit more effort- avoid ordering it at the disco, because we like to have gin and tonic and they dont have either of those on their pop or liquor guns so over the course of the week I think I probably had 10 tequila and sodas that they tried to pass as g & t (this was kind of funny though). As for sun beds, I think this was the only benefit of having the platinum bracelet. On the beach they have a roped off area with huts and beds and there are always spots available and there is also a towel shack in the middle so your don't have to treck through the resort to return your towel. We liked to get to the beach around 11am and would never have a problem getting a spot, but everywhere outside the area was always taken. Beach was beautiful, pools were like bath water so we avoided those, but what can you do about that in 30 degree heat. One last thing that I think we under estimated was that this resort is HUGE and thats fine for us, we didn't mind the walk (our room was by the lobby which is on the opposite side of the hotel from the beach). The only problem with the size was that we could never find anything and the maps are not updated and our building wasnt even on the map. We only found the platinum lounge 2 days before we left (and would ask for directions but they were not useful). We didnt know were the platinum pool was (because since the explosion in November we had been told the platinum stuff had been temporarily moved, but now everything is opened again), and even now I don't know where that was, but we think it might have been our very own swim up pool! AND on the very last day after we checked out we found a hidden pool bar with ice cream that was just down from our room that we didnt even know was there! (our fault for not exploring I guess, but they need to re-new their maps). Final comments! While you might be wowed by the number of pools, restaurants and bars this place has, don't mistake quantity for quality, because there are too many restaurants for you to visit and they are mediocre at best. How many bars and pools do you really need? More pools just mean a bigger hotel with more people to fill them. In all the times I have been to mexico, I'd have to say the dreams resorts are my fav- best food, no reservations required, and excellent beaches and service.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAmazingggggggggggggg!!!!\u201d", "Author": "emilen05", "ReviewID": "UR117161278", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 4thJuly week end.

When we arrived there was absolute chaos in the reception there were hundreds of people queing to book in there was no welcome drink no one even noticed we had walked through the entrance. I asked where we had to go to sign in and was told get to the end of the queue it wasn't until I complained that I was not fighting my way through a crowd of people after 11 hours of travelling that they took us to a side room and checked us in. I asked what was going on and was told that every weekend from Friday through to Sunday/Monday all mexican families come to the hotel to stay and that after a couple of hours it would all be back to normal. Sure enough this was the case every weekend. Although Thomson states 24 hour room service, you have to pay for it (other 5 star hotels I have stayed in this is provided as part of the package), the buffet is not good food often cold and I struggled to find something decent to eat and I am the least fussy person you can meet. If your kids enjoy ice cream, forget it you have to be a platinum guest to have the luxury of ice cream! You are served your drinks in plastic or polystyrene cups and this is in the lounge bar where you would assume you would at the very least get a drink in a glass. Apparently after 11pm everything is in plastic to save the clearing up, although we were still given our drinks in plastic cups etc during the day so it made no difference. By the way even if you upgrade the only difference is you get to eat in two additional restaurants the rest is exactly the same therefore little point in an upgrade if you ask me. Getting a sunbed was a nightmare especially from Saturday through to Monday as this is when many mexican families descended on the hotel and took over the pools and bars one family went to get some lunch and came back to find that their beds were being used they hadn't even bothered to remove their towels or belongings and Security had to be called. Absolute nightmare it was like being at some run down holiday camp not the 5 star luxury the brochures claim the Princess provides.

The food was excellent at all the a la cartes, we particularly loved the Spanish Italian and Argentinian steakhouse. The portions were huge and we couldn't finish our servings. The staff were all very courteous and spoke English very well. I don't know why so many bad reviews from American guests, but I know that the Canadians are treated very well in Mexico. We will definitely return. The only negative is that the beach front was a bit rocky going in, but the ocean was crystal clear so you could see where to step, and then soft sandy beach and you could walk out pretty far with only getting wet up to your waist.

I will be splitting this review into several topics to make it easier. Arrival and check-in: The transfer from Cancun airport to the resort we were told was 45 minutes, but it was barely that, so I was very pleased! When we got off the transfer coach- we were greeted by smiling bellboys who quickly placed our bags out of the way until we were told our room number so they could bring up our luggage, so they were well organised. The check-in desk was busy-ish but it took a while for the line to die down- I think this was due to dithering guests as our check in was fairly hasty. Rooms: I seriously cannot fault the rooms, they were lovely and cool, clean, large and the bathroom was brilliant! And we only stayed in a junior suit- the lowest class of rooms. The mini-bar was free, so we took advantage of that! It was silent during the night therefore plenty of good sleep! The bed was hard but hey, is there a hotel without a hard bed? Food: I've read reviews on how poor the buffet was and I must say that the buffet was probably one of the best holiday buffets i've ever been to! There was a huge variety of food including fresh salad, soup, bread, cereals, smoothies, fresh juice, and all sorts of hot local dishes. The waiting service was brilliant, they'd always ask us for anymore drinks or even give you one without even asking. Drinks: Probably the best all inclusive drink service there is for me, the many bars mean that there is no need to trek for a drink, theres always one around. The cups are large unlike some resorts and they are not stingy on ice at all! There are also endless choices of alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktails that are seriously tasty! Pools: WOW! There are so many pools at this resort, we ended up just sticking to one, it was a quiet one that connected to the villa swim up pools and there was always a bar man coming round for you to order some drinks even the bar was barely a 1 minute walk. It wasn't hard to reserve sunbeds in the morning, just put some towels down before you go to breakfast, no one will steal your towels or move them! Beach: This was the best beach I'd ever been to. As you step into the sand, it seeps through your toes and its pure heaven! The water was as clear as a crystal and you could see groups of fish without putting your head in the water if you look carefully. As you walking the water, there is a strip of gravelly sand but after that, the sand is as soft as it was on the beach and there are a few rocks but you'll be able to see them before you feel them! As you walk inwards, the water reaches around hip-level then as you walk further in it becomes knee-level, so its great for kids! You can even swim near to the ropes and still be able to touch the sea bed. Entertainment: We didn't really get a change to go to many shows, but by speaking to other guests, they seemed to really enjoy them! Outside the hotel: We took a tour to Chichen Itza, one of the new wonders of the world, its well worth the money as the trip includes a swim in the near by cenote which was an amazing experience! Seeing the great pyramid at Chichen Itza was breathtaking and the little stalls around the area were brilliant for haggling! We also took an evening out to 5th avenue at Playa del Carmen, this is also a great place for haggling. We went to the McDonalds (as we have a thing about going to a McDonalds in every country) but the service was horrendous! It took around half an hour for us to actual get any food! But the local restaurants looked wonderful and I wish we had time to try one out! Other: If you are in need of internet, it is not free and there is a charge but personally, there is no time for internet as you will be too busy relaxing!

At the end of the trip, if you don't have a key to turn in because someone stole your towel and were unable to get your key back, that will cost you $40. So make sure you watch your towels. It's a huge resort, you will do lots of walking so wear comfortable shoes.

I want to say that overall, we had a great time, the resort was very nice, the rooms icy cold, and the staff very hospitable! We flew into Cancun and didn't rent a car in advance! Big mistake! Make sure you do in advance online. It's very easy to get around there, only one highway so you can't get lost. It was way cheaper in a car than taking a cab or shuttle. Make sure you can drive a stick! The Princess Riviera and the Sunset are identical. The hotel main lobby is outdoors and very hot in August! Humidity was extremely high! Mosquito's bad! Don't forget the sunscreen, aloe vera when you burn, and mosquito repellent! Make sure that you book your restaurant reservations the minute you get there! The hotel has a scam to get everyone herded to the buffets. They say that the restaurants are booked and you must have a reservation...but the restaurants were never full..Friday I was trying to book reservations for Sunday and there was only one restaurant available. The later in the evening the busier the restaurants were. So book your restaurants when you first get there whether you use it or not. We were able to get into Miso without reservation. Very lucky. Miso was like a Shogun. The food was just so so- but entertaining. We also ate at La Hacienda, which was good. The buffet was ok, we were always able to find something to eat there. It just got old after awhile. Thank goodness for the room service! I think this resort caters to families and europeans. None of the families or kids were a bother to us though. We got the platnium package. Apparently all the rooms are the same. I would rather have had a swim up suite; however, I was told you couldn't do swim up suite and the platnium package. The platnium package allowed you to order room service for free, had a private lounge area with computers, free wi-fi in rooms, and private beach area w/ butler. We never got to enjoy the butler at the beach, I never found the private pool for platnium, and the wi-fi stopped working in the room and only in the bathroom. It was worth it for the room service, even though it took awhile to figure out that the room service food wasn't that great either...but we enjoyed breakfast every morning! So, I would have to recommend the platnium package. The room was icy cold, thank goodness! It smelled of mildew pretty bad, the showers leaked, the fridge didn't work..the curtain was torn, but they fixed most everything. Definitely bring your own shampoo and soap. I'm glad I read alot of those reviews. The beach waters are very rocky. When you walked into the ocean it was very painful all of the rocks. Downtown Playa beach was much nicer. I would not stay again here only because i want to try other places..The food was just ok...the drinks were super...loved the service..I loved the idea of not having to pay for anything (except for red bull it was $5).it was our first time..will try cancun next..i hear they cater to Americans more and their beaches are nicer. Also, take lots of SMALL BILLS!! I started tipping alot -I kept looking around and no one else seemed to be tipping...towards the end of the trip I ran out of small bills anyways. Take small bills to town if you shop. We took ferry to Cozymel, that was nice! Shop at the places that have posted prices. Trying to haggle didn't get us anywhere. They start their prices soo high anyway. I ended up buying a bunch of stuff at the cancun airport anyways...they had a ton of great stuff there. Next time I think we will go with a group of people.

Upon our arrival, the Best Day shuttle driver actually dropped us off on the wrong side (the Sunset lobby), but the Sunset concierge checked us in anyway and had our luggage brought over to the Princess side. My friends and I booked the platinum suite (for ~$100 more...there was a promo going on) and we were incredibly glad that we did. There are a couple of extra perks platinum guests get including the platinum lounge that includes internet, snacks and towel change (Enrique and Elmer from the platinum lounge were incredibly friendly!! They seriously made our trip that much better), free in-room wireless internet, private area on the beach (AWAY from the vendors), hassle-free a la carte reservations (they pre-reserve 3 restaurants for you prior to your arrival), and private entrance to private pool (costs extra) among other things. The staff were incredibly friendly and even friendlier when tipped a little extra =). I've read complaints about how a lot of walking is required and gave bad reviews b/c of it. These people are just angry b/c they're lazy. Given that you're at an all-inclusive with unlimited food and unlimited alcohol...think of the 10 min walk as your daily exercise. If you're in the platinum suites, you will be right by the lobby (suites moved b/c of explosion last year*). However, the walk isn't that long and there's always a shuttle that makes several drop-offs in the resort. Also, being by the lobby has its perks - you're close to most of the bars/lounges, entertainment, restaurants and the main entrance (very very convenient). *Yes, there was an explosion that occurred last year, but the resort now has never felt safer. If it weren't for the area that has been blatantly sectioned off, you wouldn't have even known something so tragic had happened. Our room was incredibly clean. It wasn't ready when we arrived (no biggy)...the bar was open so we happily waited =). The room was huge as was the bathroom, seating area, and terrace. We stayed in room 31215. We didn't get the private pool entrace but our balcony was really spacious and sunny. The balconies below ours were always shaded. Some reviews have complained about the safes being broken into. I can't say that it would never happen, but ours was never tampered with. We left everything from our cash, passports, iphones and blackberries in there and everything was accounted for when we left. Bring your own toiletries b/c the shampoo and soap they provide will not last you 7 days..and i personally did not like the scent. The beach is gorgeous but very rocky. Platinum guests have an area to the left of the beach that is sectioned off with a \"butler\"...basically just a guy/girl that takes your drink orders. This area is free from the vendor stalls and gives you an amazingly clear view of the ocean. If you aren't platinum or villa guest member and want to sit in that area, go later in the afternoon. There is always a towel boy in the morning/early afternoon that kicks people out but leaves after 2 or 3pm. If you enter the water from the platinum side, there are alot of rocks in the water. I found that by entering the water further away from the platinum area was much more sandy and safer. The main pool areas can get very crowded during the day. There are private pool areas by the platinum and villa suites that are open to anyone. If you're looking for a more quiet spot to relax and tan (or read in the shade), I highly recommend those pools. The more private pool area also had a bar, ice cream machine, and person to take drink orders for you and slightly more comfortable deck chairs. I was slightly disappointed with the food. But resort food is never that great anyway. We did the seafood, fondue, mama mia, miso a la carte dinners. I actually preferred the buffet food over the a la cart food. The restaurants (except buffets) require men to wear long pants (they will not make ANY exceptions...as we had found out during our first dinner). That was probably the most annoying part of our trip since our dinner was at a restaurant by the beach and our room was by the lobby and the fact that they weren't very flexible about that rule. All the restaurants we went to were never full so they will most likely be able to accommodate you without a reservation. Overall, i would definitely recommend this resort to people. It's absolutely stunning, caters to all ages, and is close to Playa (for shopping and a typical meeting place if booking private tours) and only 40 minutes from Cancun airport.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wolverhampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant holiday - fantastic hotel & staff - Its Mexico for us in 2012\u201d", "Author": "Marsh300711", "ReviewID": "UR116011073", "Content": "After reading the negative reports written mainly by our cousins in the US, we wondered had we 'done the right thing' in booking the Grand Riviera Princess.

We stayed in the Junior Suites x2 they are extremely spacious and comfortable with amazing ensuites containing 'his-n-her' sinks with separate compartments for the toilet and 'wet room' shower. Block 7 is an ideal location within a three minute walk to the lobby bar and restaurant area, three minutes from the nearest pool, four to the swim up bar, and seven minutes to the beach. The hotel staff are great! So friendly and helpful, nothing was a problem for them. Buffet food was plentiful and very good quality, the A la Carte themed restaurants where excellent and very popular - bookings required at least two days ahead, sometimes three. The drinks where strong and some international brands available in the all inclusive package. One slight issue - the hotel entertainment was lacking, but that is the case in many Mexician Resorts - this being our third trip. The hotel is addressing the issue of entertainment for the 15 to 17 age group, as they cannot use the on-site disco 18+ only.

Yes it's big, but it doesn't take long to get to know your way around. Most of the restaurants, bars and theatre etc are up by the reception end, pools and accomodation in the middle, beach at the bottom. Simples. We never caught the trolleys from reception to beach end, it was a 10 minute pleasant stroll in landscaped grounds, and unless you have health reasons I can't see why you'd need to - but they seemed to be constantly going back and forth if needed. Yes the floors are marble and slippery - and there are hundreds of signs warning you of this, so walk carefully - not hard for anyone that has encountered marble floors before. Buffets were fine and had a very wide choice of foods available, with new choices daily, some were better than others, but I never had any problem finding something I liked. You need to book for the themed restaurants, up to 3 days ahead with the 3rd day opening up at 2.00 pm - we had no problems with this and got to all the ones we wanted to. Meso (asian food) was my favourite, and the steaks in Vaquera were superb. Rooms were wonderful, well laid out and luxurious and the maid service was excellent - different design on the bed covers every day, room bar topped up daily, great service. Can't comment on theatre musicals as we didn't go - not my thing, but the nightly bands in the Plaza were good at least, and great in one instance - Pink floyd, Zeppelin and Guns n Roses made a pleasant change from La Bamba! Drinks were fine at all bars - you get what you ask for so if you want a strong drink say so. The beer was Corona and spirits were all named brands so quality was never an issue. There is both a table / beach service and a bar service if you can't wait - you seldom had to, except at peak times and even then not long. Sunbeds under the umbrellas on the beach can be mainly \"reserved\" by 10.00 odd, but either get their early and do that or later you can normally find spare beds and take them into the dappled shade of the bushes at the back of the beach - we actually preferred this as you still get some sun, but not full on, and you get added entertainment fro the wildlife that uses the strip of mangrove at the back - Coati's, Racoons, Grackles, Green and Tricoloured herons, Snowy egrets, and even a Rufous-necked rail. Tips - if you are a tea drinker take some teabags - or ask at the lobby bar. Limited selection of cigarettes in the shop, and they are pricey - bring your own or get into Playa and find a supermarket. We stocked up on a trip to Isla Mujeres.

After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit skeptical. Of course some of the things other people said were true, but overall this resort was great. RESORT: It was beautiful. The entrance was grand and all the furnishings were modern. ROOM: Our room was awesome. We did NOT splurge for a swim up or platinum room and after staying in the basic junior deluxe suite, we decided we didn't need too. We had a king bed, small sitting area, large bathroom with jacuzzi tub, private toilet, double sinks, & separate stand up shower. The marble was beautiful. BUT as others noted, it does get VERY SLICK! GROUNDS: Outside of the room, the grounds were very well kept. There were always workers outside making sure all of the plants were perfect. The walkways were large and there was even an outside path were I ran almost every morning. It went from the hotel all the way to the beach and was pretty quiet & serene. The walkways are SLIPPERY WHEN WET and I would advise wearing flip flops to walk throughout the resort. The ground are very large and you will do plenty of walking. There are little golf carts to give you a ride but we figured it was worth the walk to see the whole place. POOLS: There were plenty of pools. If you wanted a party pool with swim up bar you got it. If you wanted something quieter or appropriate for kids, there were plenty of those pools too. There were quite a few young kids in the party pool. I didn't mind them because they were not mine but some people may not appreciate this. BEACH: GORGEOUS! I often went to the beach by myself early in the morning because it was so serene. The ocean was so clear that you could see to the bottom. When I paid attention I often saw small fish, such as angel fish, swimming right around me. The one drawback to the beach is that there are rocks in the ocean and sometimes it was not so pleasant to walk through. Wear swim shoes and you will be fine. The other issue at the beach is that people wake up as early as 5am (even heard them talking about it) to put out towels to SAVE their chairs. When I got there at 8am most, if not all of the chairs were taken. If you got there later in the day, forget finding a chair. But I have had this same problem at other resorts as well. FOOD: As for the food, it was pretty good. The buffets were just okay but unless you are super picky, you will not starve. But we have been to plenty of other resorts in the Riviera Maya area such as the RIU, Iberostar, & Palace chains and I think the buffets are basically all the same. Some are better than others but if you are not a buffet fan then you may not like them no matter what. Make reservations for the restaurants as soon as you arrive and you will be fine. We ate at Miso & I highly recommend the cooking show. The fried rice was delicious. We also ate at the steak house & I had an awesome, very tender steak. DRINKS: The drinks were good and NOT watered down. I advise you to bring bigger cups because the little plastic ones they provide do not give you much to drink once they put in all the ice. We bought some cheap 24oz tumblers from the dollar store and the bartenders had no problem filling them. We also got high quality liquor WITHOUT doing the room upgrade. I had heard that you could only get the good liquor if you booked a platinum room but we never had a problem. STAFF: All of the staff were very friendly. They were not over the top friendly but everyone we encountered was pleasant. We don't speak Spanish well but my husband understands it much better and we did hear some of the bartenders talking smack about some of the guests. Once he tipped them off that he could understand what they were saying they stopped talking crap. Also, the bartenders seemed to switch bars often. I think they must have moved around every day. At other resorts we got to know the staff well since we saw them at the same bar everyday. And if we tipped the bartender or waitress they were very eager to wait on us the whole trip. We didn't have that experience here but that could be because we didn't see the same people over & over again. We tipped a few people whom we felt did a great job. ENTERTAINMENT: Like most places we have been to in Mexico, the resort entertainment is LACKING. There was one night that an awesome band played. They did mostly covers of American songs. Everyone was up dancing and cheering for more. The other nights there was a Latin band, an Aztec dance show, and some we didn't stay to watch. The disco was fun but it didn't open until 11pm (after the nightly entertainment). We only went to the disco for 1 night because after drinking in the sun all day we were wiped out by 11pm. There were also a lot of teens there. BEDS: There are very hard. I am not a fan of a hard bed since I have an expensive soft mattress at home. BUT we have hard beds at EVERY resort we have ever visited in Mexico. Ask for an extra mattress to out on top. This helps a little. Also, ask the maids to change the sheets daily. Our bed was just made up and there were some days we still had sand in our bed. OVERALL: We had a great time. There are always a few little things we would change on every vacation but there are not any big things I can complain about. I would absolutely go back!

We stayed in the Junior Deluxe pool access, which made it great anytime we wanted to go swimming in the pool. The second day we were there, the cleaning crew arrived to clean our room, so we went onto the balcony while they cleaned. Immediately after they left, our camera was missing from the table. (We had just used it to take pictures on the balcony before they came to clean) We filed a report with security (they made us come to them in the lobby), then had to go back to meet the \"head of security\" in our room so he could search it inside and out to make sure we weren't hiding the camera. He went through purses, suitcases, bathroom stuff, he even looked behind the picture frame. He proceeded to tell us (IN VERY VERY BROKEN ENGLISH) they would be in contact with us about the camera that day or the next, and we NEVER heard back from anyone at the hotel even after WE FOLLOWED up with them. While he was searching our room we noticed a stack on his clipboard about an inch thick containing other theft reports from that day! So, that part of the trip was HORRIBLE! It was very dissapointing and put a huge damper on the rest of the stay. We ended up having to buy two disposable cameras for $40!!!! (Valued at 5 dollars each) Now, let me get to the room... the balcony and pool part were AMAZING.. a little moldy and rusty, however, that is to be expected with pool access. When we arrived that day, the drinks in the mini-bar were not stocked... half empty drinks were in there from the previous people that had stayed in the room. The tub had HAIRS GALORE in it, and they NEVER cleaned it... even after we made the request. The fridge did not work in the room and we had to drink warm drinks most of the stay, as the ice maker on the second floor was out of service. If we wanted ice, we had to go to the buffet by our room to get them to fill our bucket. (Which they did without a problem) We asked our neighbors on boths sides if their fridges worked, and they all said they DID NOT WORK. Otherwise, the rest of the room was okay... the beds were VERY HARD, however the sheets were clean! The food was not up to par. We could tell they used food from previous days and many things we tasted were bad. (This is at the different buffets) The desserts were tasty and breakfast was the best meal they had to offer. (Even though the milk was sour two different days) The beach was nice and very pretty, however it was very crowded and they chairs are packed in like sardines. You do get asked every day by different vendors to try/buy things which did get annoying, and we saw that these vendors were not set up beyond the hotel at the other resorts.

They were very precise in the jobs they did to keep the hotel clean. Although, throughout the hotel in different places there is a VERY strong stench of sewer smell.

When we went to make dinner reservations with the concierge for one of the MANY restaurants we were told all the restaurants were booked for the entire evening. However, after walking around the resort and looking at the restaurants, they were not filled to capacity and many tables were empty. We spent some time talking with the concierge; checking to see if possible cancelations allowed us to dine at any of the visually available restaurants. She informed me it was not her job to check restaurant availability and that I could walk restaurant to restaurant and ask. Our room was clean however the air conditioner did not cool the room to satisfaction - we had to sleep above the covers with the fan on high each night. After speaking with the front desk about the numerous concerns they listened to us and informed us there was a complaint book we could list our complaints. However, nothing was attempted to improve our stay or make us feel more pampered. With the numerous resorts available I would not recommend this resort to anyone nor would I stay there again.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Bend, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cThe Princess Shines\u201d", "Author": "DetailsByBill", "ReviewID": "UR115444841", "Content": "The Princess has to be one of the cleanest and well kept resorts I have experienced. It's beautiful! As soon as we arrived our luggage was tagged and taken by the bell staff. We stood in line at check in for a few moments before noticing the separate check in area for \"Platinum Suites\" and moved to that line and was serviced in a few minutes. Check in was quick and efficient but the champagne we were given was poor quality. We advised the bell staff of our room number and started for the room. It was raining so instead of walking we looked on the map for the shuttle service and walked through several buildings to reach the shuttle. After waiting a few minutes or so the shuttle arrived and we were on the way to the room. After 5 minutes we arrived at the Platinum Lounge area and were directed to our room. Our luggage was sitting in front of the room and as we approached a Bellman saw us and carried the luggage into the room and explained how the lights and cooling system worked. The room was comfortable and had quality amenities and a good selection of bottled liquor such as whiskey, rum, vodka and tequila. The mini fridge had plenty of water and soft drinks. The safe in the closet is large enough for a laptop plus more. There is a nice size patio with hot tub, two chairs and a table facing the jungle. This became the smoking area for my son. The Platinum lounge was a good spot for a quick drink, light snack or coffee. It was comfortable and offered wireless Internet access as well as four desktop PC's. Internet speed was very slow but usable for email. The Concierge had a desk in the Platinum lounge. To eat at a ala carte restaurant you need a reservation which needs to be made by 3 PM the day before. We arrived at the resort at 3:30 PM and stood in line for 50 minutes before it was our turn to talk with the concierge. We wanted reservations for three nights including our day of arrival and we had a preference for two restaurants. We quickly found out that everything was already booked except for the Steak House at 9:40 PM two days from today. We took the Steak House and headed off to the buffet for lunch. The pools are well used and spacious. We noticed a great deal of chairs being saved early in the morning that seemed to go unused for much of the day. The beach area is clean and equipped with plenty of chairs many in shady areas. Beach area is very rocky for the first 30 feet into the water. The Platinum guests have a roped of area on the beach with many more shaded area. The beach has waiter service for drinks. The Platinum area service didn't seem to be any quicker than the rest of the beach area. Food in the buffet restaurants was typical. Lot's of variety. Some selections tasted good. Some selections had little taste. I was not impressed with the quality of the pastries which all seem to taste the same. The \"Steak House\" selection was limited but generally good. I had a Argentinean steak which had a good taste but needed to be sent back for further cookings as it was nearly raw. My son had the veal ribs which were cut horizontally across the ribs. There was little meat on the ribs which was difficult to remove but the taste was good. I tried the white and red wine which was nothing special and could be skipped. We had breakfast at the buffet restaurant two mornings and were very pleased with the variety and quality of food. We ordered breakfast from room service for a 6:30 AM delivery the next morning. It arrived at 6:35 AM. The scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and even the coffee was ice cold. Overall we enjoyed the stay and will return. The staff was friendly and hard working. The system for dining reservations needs work. Based on the quality of food at the \"Steak House\", rumored to be the \"Best\" food at the resort, I'm not sure waiting in line for reservations is worth the effort. I'm also left wondering if the Platinum upgrade is worth the additional cost.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201c\"There is a spot in the pool bar for you\"\u201d", "Author": "chinoxi", "ReviewID": "UR115433944", "Content": "This Princess hotel is together with Sunset Princess as well both adjacent and mirror image each other. The very first thing I have to stress is book reservation for la carte dinner right away ( if you are interested to get one usually after 2pm) but buffet dinner is great as well. The first day I went in I wanted to try the GRILL but was told that it was too late for booking tonite. I made reservation for the next three nights that is as far reservation you can make you will have to make the fourth day the very next day. This is also the same for shuttle service to Playa which must be made by 8am the day before going if not hotel will charge you $4 per person. So, make your itinerary early and set those reservation. Food was great !!!! I'm from Chicago and have a good sense of different cuisine so for the a la carte restaurant (La Fluer, Miso, Grill) all three were great although Miso could use some better service which was lacking compared to the other two. The Grill was most exceptional I cannot stress that you wanna save space for this extravaganza. I also was dissappointed that Miso was not the asain restaurant where the chef was cooking in front of you, so make sure you have the right one this place had three asian cuisine there: suishi, moto and the bennihanna chef in front of you. Read some review so stayed clear of mexican i figure we get that in our visit to playa which we did. The buffet was excellent and service was very nice something you really cant complain and they also have a snack place by beach consisting of hotdogs and burgers. Lets just say i had to swim alot to lose the calories. Its true about floors being slippery but if your careful you should be alright. This could be because place was so squeeky clean. One bad thing about this place is the people putting there stuff reserving all the prime cabana to bath in the sun. Its frustrating and to tell you the truth I was tempted to just move stuff away. Pools were great and the bartenders delivered the perfect concoctions. Shows were okay and for family fun you really cant complain. BEACH have to say yes it is rocky but once you get past the first 12 feet away it is all clear and it doesnt go deeper than 4 feet, so make sure to go further out. Oh do try the free demo scuba diving for kids 10yrs and older was a great experience. So, most important RESERVE restaurant and shuttle, try to find cabana early and other then that relax, enjoy, get a tan, have a drink, no have several and most important have a great experience.

We slept with a towel on top of the pillows every night. Mosquitoes were a huge problem outside and in the room although we came prepared with mosquitoe repellent candles to light in the room and within 3 people we used up 2 bottles of body mosquitoe spray and came home with many swollen mosquitoe bites. Hotel The train is a big issue, it only holds about 10 people and theres only 1 on the riviera side. There is over 1500 people in the hotel and it id not accomodate so we ended up walking most of the time over long distances and we had 2 elderly people in our group that booked seperately and coul not walk these large distances. The train on the sunset side is larger and faster. The grounds,sculptures and fountains are beautiful. the hotel is very clean and the gardens are well maintained. The floors when they're wet become very slippery indoors and outdoors, we saw a few people fall including my mom getting out of the elevator. Pools and beach The beach has beautiful clear water and white sand but upon entering into the water there are some rocky areas. The water is very shallow also, the deepest we could find is only about waist height but great if you're travelling with kids but not for adults. Its almost impossible to find any chairs on the beach, many people reserve their seat with towels and shoes and all sorts of other items befor 8:00 a.m. . The pools are clean snd beautiful. There are quiet pools and there are loud pools some with pool bars. Once again it's impossible to find empty chairs by the pools, we even had one towel stolen while we were in the pool. The pool and beach bar service was very good. The vendors on the beach did not bother us at all. Food There are 4 buffets for breakfast negresco,la tortuga,riviera and sunset. 2 near the pools and 2 near the lobby. The breakfast at all 4 were excellent but the juice was very watery. The lunch was the worst, if you don't enter the buffet right when it opens all the good food is gone and is replaced by vegtables or rice. Their hamburgers and hot dogs were bad. One day they had tandoori chicken which was excellent and the fried fish was also quite good. If you're a vegetarian, you will enjoy the food as there are only about 4 to 5 dishes with meat and the rest are veggies,rice,pasta etc... The pasta which you let the chef make in fron of you to your preference was pretty good. The dinner buffet was nice on the chinese night and the spanish night. The worst was the mexican buffet where the food was all spicy and not a good variety. The spanish night was the best, the only night with shrimp and thick juicy steak. If you're used to eating in Mandarin,Kelseys or Applebees, you know what food should taste like. We have been to Riu Caribe and Sandos Playacar which ended up being only 2 hotels down and i must say they both had much better food not as many places to eat but the taste and quality was better as well having shrimp everyday not one night. The service in the buffets are very bad and they will not work unless they see a tip on the table. The Fondue restaurant which was swiss was the best on out of the 4 we tried. The natural shrimp and the beef were the best and the cheese fondue with all the sides were delicious. The gourmet salad appetizer was also delicious. The crepes desert was the best. The grill restaurant was also good but the steaks were not well done but we told them and they fixed this immediately. The oriental section of the Miso is bad after the appetizer which was delicious, it was all down hill. The vermicelli salad wasnt even salad it was noodles in mystery sauce but the other one was ok. The entrees were disgusting and we left before the desert menu even came. The new spanish restaurant Tapas had a very nice flamenco show and they came with many appetizers before we ordered off the menu but they were only mediocre. The food was ok and i reccomend the chicken. Overall the service was probably the worst, if you don't tip don't expect anything. When your room is cleaned and you don't leave a tip don't expect more than 2 towels and 1 roll of toilet paper and your room probably wont be cleaned before 3;00 p.m.. They try their best to repel mosquitoes but something else needs to be implemented other than the spray car. The 2 nightly entertainment shows are nice but if you don't get a seat up front don't expect to see anything. We reccomend the broadway show and the mexican show. They usually have 1 show at 8:00 in the courtyard at the bar and one at 9:30 in the air conditioned theater. The fire show is one of the best outdoor shows.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat time, inconsistent quality, but still worth it\u201d", "Author": "TarekJak", "ReviewID": "UR115372257", "Content": "Would I recommend this Hotel? Yes. Travelled there from the 17th -24th of June. I read lots of reviews on this Hotel so I thought I knew everything there was to expect. That\u2019s impossible. I just read someone\u2019s review saying how they didn\u2019t know where or when the nightly entertainment was because it was never posted. Well, not to denounce them or their experience, but there are two bulletin boards which state the activities for the day with a separate board which says what shows are playing at night. And to be frank, even if you do somehow miss those bulletin boards, just follow the sound of the live music which is playing in the main courtyard. So again, take heed when reading these reviews; it's all about your personal experience. And here was mine. SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES Like many potential vacationers to this resort, I was hesitant about the safety boxes here as there are numerous accounts of them being compromised. I never had a problem with the safe, but I did not enjoy the anxiousness of leaving my money and identifications in the hands of this resort. It will take a long history of good reviews in terms of these safes going uncompromised for this resort to be clear from that reputation. That said, I had absolutely no problem with our valuables. THE ROOM I stayed there from June 17-24 with my gf, and we were immediately enamoured with the look and feel of the resort and our room. We booked the Deluxe Junior Suite because we wanted the Jacuzzi in the room (which we never ended up using). The room is nicely decorated and looks like a 5 star Hotel room; it\u2019s spacious, has marble tiling and floors, and has good quality sheets and bed covers. We got a coffee/coffee maker and drinks in the fridge daily, a nice LCD TV (ours had awful audio, lots of static), and ceiling fan which made the nights bearable in our warmer room (AC comments below). All in all, an aesthetically pleasing room. There were some bad aspects to the room though, which slightly lessened our initial impression. For starters, the AC averaged a 23 degrees Celsius everyday even though I had set it to 20 degrees, and later, 18 degrees. Having a 23 degree room doesn\u2019t provide the AHH factor when entering into your room after hours of humidity. That\u2019s a fail. Thankfully there is a ceiling fan above the bed, and this sufficed for us just fine. At least sleeping was comfortable. On our first morning we found little ant-like bugs all over our sink and counter. Bugs are bugs, and as long as they are not bed bugs or termites, then small bugs shouldn\u2019t be enough to ruin a trip. You\u2019re in the Caribbean; expect it. So we called Guest Services and said they would send someone. But no one came. One hour later I call again, and this time the staff member asks me \u201chow big?\u201d, at which point I told her they looked like very small ants. She said she was sending someone right away to spray them. No one came. Not to waste any time, I had bug repellent spray made for skin so I killed all the bugs and then sprayed the surrounding area with that spray. I told my TMR rep about it the next day and she said she would get someone to spray. We don\u2019t know if that was accomplished but it didn\u2019t matter; we ended up finding bugs scattered in the bathroom, Jacuzzi, and closet throughout the week, though much less in quantity than our first day. Lucky us. On our terrace, we had a wasps nest just above us. They never bothered us and always stayed in their nest. However, these little things in the room (bugs, stained Jacuzzi, wasps nest, AC temp) eventually hindered our impression of the resort. It\u2019s a complete lack of attention to very obvious details. THE BUFFET FOOD I cannot stress enough how impressed I was. Such a variety! I kind of feel a little angry at all the reviewers who are telling potential travellers that the food was horrible. It\u2019s not horrible, it\u2019s the exact opposite. If you couldn\u2019t find something to eat, it was because you chose to let the first flavour that didn\u2019t appease your palate ruin the rest of your meal. There\u2019s tons of choices to choose from, and almost impossible to try everything. I ate well. Hats off to the kitchen! The only time I didn\u2019t enjoy the buffet was on Thursday when they do Mexican buffet. It was not the best so here\u2019s a TIP: do an a la carte on Thursday! My gf actually got sick for the first and only time (I was totally fine) after the Thursday buffet, so heads up. THE A LA CARTES Again, pretty impressive. Couldn\u2019t believe how good the menus were. We tried Miso, La fleur, Mamma Mia, and the Grill, and all were worthy to my taste. I never had issues with food here, except for one thing. I got sick immediately after all the restaurants for a good one to two hours. This happened to me though; it\u2019s how my body reacted. My gf was fine. Everyone else seemed fine. And truthfully, I would have done it all over again because the food was that enjoyable. No joking. I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with the quality of the food but the change in the ingredients being used. The impression I hope to give about the Food is that there are many choices, and that they\u2019re all well prepared. I recommend The Grillhouse for sure. What a great steak! I would also recommend to stay away from the Mexican restaurant, even though I didn\u2019t try it, I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a lot like the Mexican buffet food, which was just below par compared to the other nights. SERVICE It was okay. Sometimes quick, sometimes slow, and sometimes non-existent. Maid service was lacking in that the Jacuzzi had brown stains. Probably a testament to its age rather than its cleanliness, but the bottom line is that we wouldn\u2019t touch it. Other than that, maid service was satisfactory. Bar service depends on how many people are waiting and not on the amount of cash you flash. I tipped the maid about $20 throughout the week but we only had our room cleaned 4 or 5 times , by choice. I tipped everyone else when the service was good. Bring lots of $1's. American Money is accepted everywhere. Another TIP: Do not bother with Deluxe Junior Suites for the Jacuzzi. It\u2019s a gamble as to whether or not their condition will be acceptable. However, take note that the regular junior suites can only book certain a la cartes whereas Deluxe and Platinum and Villas have 2 more options in their restaurant choice. I think the hierarchy set up here is also ridiculous and confusing, because areas have to sectioned off for only certain guests. You basically have to pay the most expensive rate to get the most out of the resort. I don't agree with that. I think: the higher the rate, the more amenities you should have available in your room, and not your resort. BUFFET SERVICE You will be served by at least 3 different people during one sitting. We stopped tipping because the waiter who would most probably clean our table will have spent 0 time actually serving us. It was bizarre and very disorganized. We went through an entire breakfast one morning with no service at all. I think the buffet service management needs a good reworking because all the workers seemed to be doing everything all at once. I don\u2019t even think anyone had a set task or area to take care of, and it showed. Badly managed. THE BEACH There are huts along the beach that create a gap between you and the ocean, but you can escape that by walking a short distance to a clearer area. There are always, always, beach chairs available. Don\u2019t wake up early to do the towel thing. There is a very clear section of the beach that is free of rocks and seaweed so water shoes aren\u2019t necessary. If you venture to other parts, it\u2019s very rocky so do bring the shoes. What I absolutely disagree with about the beach is not the huts selling their services or wares, but the beach chairs that are available for RENT in front of the huts where you can sit feet away from the ocean. Ridiculous. The resort is supposed to be \u2018all-inclusive\u2019, and not an \u2018almost all-inclusive\u2019. If you really want to see a gorgeous beach, go and spend the day at Playa Del Carmen (really close to 5th Ave, the touristy shopping district). The water is pristine and it\u2019s sandy no matter where you enter. Most hotels along that beach will let you use their beach chairs. Don\u2019t even bother with the Free Shuttle the Hotel offers; it\u2019s always \u201cFull\u201d. We asked the Concierge so often that both me and girlfriend had to wonder if one actually existed at all. Taxis are always available at the lobby for a flat rate of $20 (each way) to 5th Avenue. Much more convenient. IN CONCLUSION I would not return here because I like discovering new places, but I would recommend it. I slept well and I ate well and I was impressed by the exterior of the resorts. If I did return, I would be smarter about the rooms next time and not let it slide off my shoulder so easily, because when I really think about it, my room was not 5 star (or even a 3, for that matter). I think the only reason we didn\u2019t complain was because we were ignored when calling about the bugs, so we kind of just had to tell ourselves not to get riled up over little details. That, and the fact that we\u2019d have to pack up after having already unpacked was not in our interest. My room was 6250, so if the hotel management reads this, I really recommend going over Quality Control in the rooms, because a guest should have to ask for a room change at all. My girlfriend and I had a great vacation and even though the resort had its faults, it wasn\u2019t enough to make our stay anything less than fantastic. For that, we both thank everyone at the Princess who did make our stay enjoyable. I think if our room didn't have as many problems, we probably would have come home with nothing to complain about, and vacation just isn't vacation without the criticism ain? As for my final TIP: Diarrhea and the South walk hand and hand, so definitely don\u2019t forget to bring some Imodium and a sense of humor with you.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nueva York, Nueva York", "Title": "\u201cThieves in Grand Riviera Princess\u201d", "Author": "kihaku", "ReviewID": "UR115367183", "Content": "I was in Grand Riviera Princess last May 2011 and everything seems great and very comfortable!!

They will try to scam you and make you buy excursions for money in YOUR pocket. this is a scam...do NOT fall for it. Once you get into the airport and past couples go straight outside to catch a cab or to meet the company that is supposed to be picking you up. We booked with www.funjetvacations.com and they arranged for someone to pick us up and they were waiting for us at the airport with a sign with our names on it, so it was easy. * check in-we had a very easy check-in even though we arrived at the resort late. We were even upgraded since it was our anniversary. *The hotel- the hotel is gorgeous and very clean. we never saw a bug the whole time we were there...and we stayed for 8 days. We did however see iguanas and coaties. Whcih we were happy to see. All of the staff was very nice and everyone made it a point to say hello each time we passed. Be aware that the resort is HUGE and there are two sides. It took us about 15 minutes to walk from our room to the main lobby, restaurants, and beach. I did not enjoy this. i feel like i spent most of my vacation walking . *The room- Our room was gorgeous. I have no complaints. We left everything in our safe in the room and nothing came up missing. We also left some cash in my suitcase(which locked) just in case something happened. we also left a couple of dollars under a pillow for the maids. *the pool- the party pool was AWESOME and sooooo much fun! If you dont like to party there are a million other pools. something for everyone. *The food- i was NOT impressed with the food at this resort. I thought i was going to starve. My husband is not a picky eater at all but he wasnt impressed with the food either.

You have to pay for the chairs past the vendors to sit next to the ocean. Total rip off. everytime you wanted to go to the ocean you would have to walk through vendors trying to sell you something. annoying. *Entertainment-you never know what is going on at night or where to go because it isnt posted anywhere. you just kind of have to find your way around to find something to do. The disco was soooo fun but played the same music over and over. *The drinks- all oft he drinks were good. make sure to bring A LOT of one dollar bills with you. If you give the bartenders a dollar or two they will make your drinks stronger. ***all in all the resort was just ok. i wouldnt go back to this resort when we go back to Mexico.

The evening entertainment was great with some great bands playing in the hotel square, the only down side, and I'm being picky! is the beach is not the best in the area, although it is nice the ambiance has been spoiled by the many vendors which set up on the beach to sell their wares, we were told that this is the fault of the Mexican government but you only had to walk down the beach to the next hotel, to see they had not been persuaded to allow the same thing to take place. All in all a great holiday and a special mention to the Thomson Holidays flight staff from East Midlands, who were brilliant outbound and inbound. We upgraded to premium seating both ways at the airport and I highly recommend this service, although I wouldn't have paid full price for it.... This service restored my faith in the 'holiday flight' charter experience which I had definately lost interest in over previous years, congratulations Thomson and as for some of the other british tour operators, you could definately learn something from them.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cTHE TRUTH\u201d", "Author": "crisnas", "ReviewID": "UR115130957", "Content": "i just returned from the princess....it is definitly a huge place and the grounds are beautiful.

ISSUES: the toilet clogged once and we had to call for them to unclog it. the pressure in it was not that great. another issue was the safe in room would not recognize your code every now and then and had to call security to open it. ( nothing was ever stolen) FOOD: It was good but repetitive. Lots of nachos for breakfast lunch and dinner...the ala carte s were okay...the steak house was the best. then the Olas seafood place by the beach. the issue with the food was that when i went to one of the ala cartes there was a green worm in my icecream moving around!!!! it was terrifying cuz i almost put it in my mouth when someone said something is moving in your food! the manager there was apologetic. another traceller said that there were ants in her soup. then they brought her another one and there was ants at the bottom of the plate. be careful i guess with what you eat. I ate alot of papayas and nachos. the tamales are good too and the empanadas. not real mexican food there. Beach: real nice...the best i been to(. i been to DR punta cana, el salvador beaches, jamaica ) do the tulum excursion, you can go in the beach there and it is so soft, the sand is like a carpet. resort beach is real nice but it is true, there are vendors there but you can quietly sit still under your hut. relax drink. hotel club: okay party goers the hot spots are in playa del carmen, coco bongos, brama, coco maya are just some of the clubs that you may wanna hit while down there. pool was good, and i think that was it. oyea the most crowds i saw was couples and lots of families with kids. would i go back? Nope. maybe when i have kids or something. kinda wished i booked somethiing cheaper and then hit the night spots away from the resort. alcohol was not the greatest too. strong and not really good brands. although if you are platinum like i was you can get good ones at the platinum bar. had couivossier there. okay...have a good time, it s what you make of it in the end! the swim out rooms are great because the bar is soooo close too. drink and swim right by your room, sunbathe too if you want piece and quiet . youre practically the only one there.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely brilliant, back again in a couple of months!!!\u201d", "Author": "sammymc1", "ReviewID": "UR115129577", "Content": "Ok, so writing this review is well overdue! We (3 Adults) stayed at the beginning of Sept 10 and I have stayed other places in Mexico and this place was beautiful. I normally avoid reading reviews as it only takes a couple of bad ones to deter you from going but I made an exception for the Grand Riviera Princess as I really think that this place should be considered by anyone going to Mexico. Firstly the staff are extremely helpful and welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. The facilities are second to none, always enough sunbeds and the pools were perfectly heated. The restaurants were lovely; buffet changes theme most nights and we tried some of the Al a Carte restaurants including the American grill, Swiss Fondue, Chinese and the Italian. My one and only criticism of my holiday was the Italian restaurant and that was partly my fault from not looking at the menu properly as the food was not to my taste but not to fear the buffet was open till late so I didn't go without!!!!!

We had a platinum suite, so I can not comment about some of the other users' feedback I had seen about other areas. The platinum pool area was great - a bar staff person right there next to you to get you or your kids anything you could think of. The nice thing about the platinum area was that we saw the same group of great vacationers almost every day - I doubt you would have that experience elsewhere in the resort. The platinum area at the beach was also very nice - no problem finding chairs with an umbrella almost every day (couldn't say that about non-platinum areas), and there was a bartender taking orders pretty regularly. The platinum rooms all have wifi internet access, but it seemed to me that it was running from the platinum lounge, as the further from the lounge you got, the lower the signal. The platinum lounge also had 4 computers with high-speed internet access, and a full-time concierge for just the platinum folks. The beach was very nice - rocky in places, but not too hard to find areas in the water without rocks. The restaurants were pretty good - not what I would consider 5 star, but at a minimum 3 star. The Chill Out Lounge atmosphere was great - sitting outside under a thatched roof with family and friends on a nice breezy night could not be beat. My kids got room service pretty much every day, breakfast, lunch or dinner, and they always had something good. We had breakfast from room service one morning when we had an early excursion (too early for the breakfast buffet) and that worked out very well The resort is large - it takes 5-10 minutes to walk front to back if you don't feel like waiting for the trolley. The floors in the resort are VERY slippery when wet, and we had breezy wet evenings so they were wet at times most days. The staff for the most part was very friendly (of course there are always exceptions). A couple of tips. 1 - take $100 USD in 1s to tip the various staff regularly. The bartenders remember and treat you (and your kids if applicable) well. We tipped our housekeeping staff $5 apiece the first day, and they gave us the extra towels, pillows, water (and much more) we asked for with no problem. 2 - bring an insulated mug if you want to drink on the beach. They will fill it up for you with whatever you want, and believe me it's hot so the regular cups warm up fast, so the mug keeps things cold longer and will give you a larger serving. All-in-all a very enjoyable vacation - I'd go back again.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southport", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Resort\u201d", "Author": "ashute", "ReviewID": "UR115055949", "Content": "Booked this resort following excellent reviews on tripadvisor.

There is different entertainment and shows on most nights and a number of activities. The staff are very friendly and keep the resort spotless. The basic rooms are large and well equipped but only have a shower. The complex is very large and there is a small trolley bus running every 15 minutes.

If you don't want well drinks you have to specify(ex. captain and coke as opposed to rum and coke). Ask the bartender to make his favorite drink. I tried so many new ones. Entertainment - We loved the entertainment staff. I don't know how they had so much energy. They had beach volleyball, rifle shooting, Texas Hold Em, Tequila Water Volleyball, and some funny games in the afternoon. You can also rent a kayak and snorkel gear from Sea Pro Divers on the beach. They have two shows every night (8pm and 9:30pm) Both of them were entertaining. Make sure you ask the concierge what is available, they don't have a pamphlet or anything and we didn't realize kayaks were included until the last few days of the trip. Rooms - We had a Junior Deluxe swim up room. You can't lock it if you use the swim up part. We put our valuables in the safe and left the room unlocked while we were swimming. We didn't have any problems.No one we talked to had any problems either. Also swim up rooms were kind of damp. Some people had problems with the Jacuzzi, but ours were very clean. We were in building six, which I found to be perfect. It was a little further to walk for food, but it was far enough away from the party pool that is was relatively quiet (very few children in this part of the pool too). It's also a short walk to the beach. Restaurants - Food was so-so. There were plenty of options, but most of the prepared stuff was fried. I liked the salad bar and the fresh fruit the best. At dinner, you can pick fish or meat to grill. Definitely make a reservation at La Vaqueria (the grill). We also liked La Hacienda and the fondue place.

We remind ourselves that we are NOT paying 8 grand for a week so go with the flow. We reserved a Laguna Villa with a very strong request for 1st floor as we both have bad knees.

The only problem we had was getting coffee........after 4 calls we had more than enough coffee for the rest of our stay. Room was immaculate and our room (as requested) was done before noon everyday. It is the ONLY room we have ever had that we needed an extra blanket as it was very chilly at night. We were afraid to mess with the A/C in case it wouldn't get cold again! Food ranged from ok to good, but it met our needs. Villa pool is where we stayed everyday and the service was awesome. Shows at night were OK and very crowded. Only went by the beach once on our way to dinner. It looked very nice with a view of Cozumel in the distance.

We are experienced all-inclusive travelers, Dominican, Jamaica, and the Riviera Maya, and are easy-going and non-critical Tennesseans. Overall a good vacation with some rather minor unpleasantries. Beautiful, large, perfectly manicured resort. Junior suites were large and very clean, with large bathrooms. Beds not very comfortable mainly because of some plastic-feeling mattress pad that made us feel clammy all night, even though the room was pleasantly cool and we had a fan going. Hard pillows, though we didn't ask for different ones. Up-graded to a swim-up, but had to pay for it even though the resort was obviously about 2/3 full. Beware!! 24-hour room service is NOT included in the \"all-inclusive\" as it has been in ALL other all-inclusives we have stayed in. Also, you had to rent the prime beach chairs that fronted the ocean. Evening shows were good (2 each night except for on-site 'shopping night' with the usual pushy crafts vendors). Food was typical of all-inclusives. Not gourmet, but could always find good food. Very good buffet selections, especially fruits, salads, breads, and pasta dishes. Meats were---average, but you don't go to all-inclusives and expect top-cut filets do you? Overall, this was a good value for the price. It is big and sprawling enough that you could always find either a beach chair or pool chairs, and if you wanted to get away from the smaller children, there were places to do that at some of the more peripheral and smaller pools, but forget it at the beach unless you were in a villa or platinum room and had access the the restricted beach area. Even then, it was right up against the regular beach, which had plenty of----hot, tired, and fussy pre-schoolers. On beach massages were great--don't waste money up in the spa for same thing at over twice the price! This is not nearly as crowded as some family resorts we have seen, as the resort is very large and there are many winding pools and several other large pools. Service was very average. Most calls to guest services went unanswered. Long waits for maid service, if needed. Minibar was very minimal and was hardly ever re-stocked. We are very friendly and usually speak first to staff, workers, gardeners; but unlike other places where ALL the staff seem to go out of their way with a \"hola\" or \"buenos dias\", we almost always had to initiate that little courtesy with all but the bartenders and desk workers. Maybe they are told not to bother the guests, but we have always enjoyed feeling welcomed and recognized by the \"common\" workers at other resorts. Would only return if our teens wanted to return.

As I said, we were upgraded. Jacuzzi in bathroom - great. No complaints about the cleanliness, or size of the room, everything was excellent. I dont understand people that complain about the room - you are on holiday and spend most of your time by the beach, pool etc. Grounds - Beautiful and always being maintained. Pools are great - you always find a quiet spot. Not too overcrowded (only by the party pool which is full up almost every day). Again this didnt bother us, we preferred a quiet spot round the corner. Beach is amazing. Lovely clear warm waters and yeah there are a few rocks - so what? Its not as bad as people make out - it's not the hotels fault is it? Staff - Very helpful and friendly. If you tip say 50 pesos/$3 then you will get even better service. Just treat people how you would want to treated! Remember they work long hours in the heat! They will serve you by the pool, and on the beach, you dont even have to move from your chair! Food/Drinks - Buffet always had a massive selection. We ALWAYS found something we liked. If you cant then you shouldnt be at an All Inclusive hotel, or you are just overly picky. Breakfast was great - fresh omlettes cooked for you every day. Lunch is great also - buffet or beach BBQ! Burgers are great at the beach. Dinner was always very good. Selections of salads, meats, pasta etc. Different themed nights - spanish was really good as we loved the paella. The only very MINOR criticism we had was that alot of the food was fried - but that is really not that big of a problem. We ate in the steak house and the mexican al a cartes - Steak house was fantastic - the steaks were HUGE and so tender, you didnt even need a steak knife to cut it! Mexican was ok. You can find most of the food here at the buffet on the Mexican themed nights. But. what do you expect when a hotel is catering for that many people. Drinks are great - branded alcohol is included - not something which you usually get at an all inclusive (bacardi, smirnoff, jim bean etc). Also, Corona on tap! Cocktails are best at the lobby bar. Overall good standard of catering and not ill once! Other comments - Hotel has great shops where you can get all types of presents to take home.

Don't believe any reports that criticise the food or facilities in this hotel as these are untrue & some people obviously have no culture or appreciate the finer things in life. We ate in the buffet restraunts to start the holiday & found we were spoilt for choice, sometimes too much to chose from. The Mexican had several amazing dishes to choose from and the service was amazing. The Italian again had loads of choice but the portions were extremely large so when you go please make sure you are hungry. The Steak house had T bone steaks the size of your lagre plate & the rib eye steaks were out of this world. Our favourite was the oriental which had 3 styles to choose from, firstly the Tapanyaki show cooking was entertaining & the taste & freshness was amazing, the chinese oriental would not have been out of place in a top London venue as the service & food quality was of the highest standard.(The waiters were so humble) We did not use the French restraunt but spoke to other guests that said the standard was of the highest standard. The hotel is spotless and the rooms are cleaned daily to a high standard. The bars are plentifull and never have to wait for a drink. The beach is amazing although there are rocks in some areas when you first go out. We did the jet skiing which was around \u00a340 for half an hour which is pretty good value.

We'll really miss Angel! The entertainment on the night was good for hotel entertainment. We went to Coco Bongo one night which was expensive overcrowded and crap. It felt like we were at a kids party, loads balloons and clowns about we went after an hour. The bar staff were so rude a couple of people almost got into a fight with them. For stuff to do theres loads of trips and activities. We went on a Jungle Maya trip and Chichen Itza which included a visit to the cenotes. In the Jungle Maya trip we had to absail into a underwater cave which was loads fun then you go snorkelling through this cave full of fish, then zip lining over the jungle and a ride in a 4x4 over loads rocks and trees. It wasnt really a jungle though which was what i was expecting. The wonder of the world Chichen Itza was worth the visit. It takes about 3 hours to get there from the hotel and they break up the trip with a visit to the cenotes which is this beautiful cave you can go swimming and diving into. You have to do a few trips while your there we wish w did more theres so much more to choose from as well. We went to Playa del Carmen for a shop around but that wasnt great, you get hounded by people selling tha same crap and its the same shop after shop which sells the same stuff as in the hotel so id give that a miss. The food is the only thing that let this place down and its such a shame because we loved everything else. The breakfast and lunch were good at the buffet but when it came to tea time we were expecting a bit more. Im sure they just mixed and reheated some of the stuff left over from lunch and put it out for tea. It wasnt good and to be honest im not even a fussy eater. They do have the restaurants though which you book a few days in advance. We tried the Mexican because one of the whole reasons i wanted to go to Mexico is because i love Mexican food and they didnt have much at the buffet. But that place was so bad me and my husband laughed the whole way through, it was funny it was that bad! I think its one of the worst restaurants ove ever been to in my life. We even saw another couple leave half way throught their meal so ive this place a miss!!! After that we just stuck to the buffet which was a shame because a lot of people said the other restaurants were really good so wish i had tried them. The oriental looked like fun they cook your food in front of you and you can even help out. This hotel is ideal for young couples. Overall it was a great holiday and a great hotel this place was loads fun but like i said the food wasnt the best! Saying that we didnt try all the restaurants which were meant to be good. I would recommend this place but i dont think its worth revisiting im glad i went but next time i visit Mexico i'll try another hotel.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northants", "Title": "\u201cSPOTLESS BUT BE CAREFUL...VERY SLIPPERY\u201d", "Author": "lovmehols", "ReviewID": "UR112384428", "Content": "Just returned from Riviera Princess this morning 9 june11.

The rooms are spotless, but another tip if you like a cup of tea (my man has to have one as soon as he wakes up!) take tea bags as you only get coffee in the room, but the waiters at the buffet were brill, as when we ran out they would give us a few each day fr the room. The food was ok at the buffet, we always found something what we liked, i also loved the oriental and the grill, but was not so keen on the mexican restaraunt. All the staff are lovely and they all say hello to you. We was not to keen on the beach as they have stalls and just try to sell you stuff as soon as you walk on to it, but that was not a problem as we love being by the pool anyway, which again are very clean. The staff even disinfect the walkways every night! The shows are ok but be wary of the fire show, although this was very good please do not stand at the sides as when we watched from above one of the fire people lost control of his lighted stick thing and it flew straight into the audience, you get a much better view from above anyway.

My husband and I stayed here for 2 weeks for our honeymoon. We had a swim-up pool to our room, which was phenomenal! It was at the end of the row, but it connected to the main pool. The only negative thing about the swim-up pool is that, you cannot lock the patio door from the outside. So if you are in the pool, in front of your room, then you can watch it. But if you decide to go to the main pool and leave, then you have to go back into your room, lock the door from inside and go out the lobby way. But the room card is water proof so my husband would keep it in his swim shorts pocket. The buffets and a-la carte restaurants are great! If you don't like a restaurant, you can get up and leave, and go to a buffet. The resort is huge! A lot of walking, but there is a shuttle on both sides of the resort. I read reviews about people complaining that the walk from the lobby, to the rooms and beach, is very far. It is about 10 minutes walking distance. But you are on vacation, so relax and enjoy! If you are lazy, then take the shuttle! The grounds are kept very clean! The staffs are very friendly and say \u201cola\u201d every time you encounter them. The entertainment staff is AMAZING! Ivan, who organizes Coco Bonco, is the best guy you will party with! Silvia, who is always by the main pool, is really nice and knows how to get the party started! There is always something going on in the main pool, from 10am to 6pm. Eddie the bartender is great! By the time you are halfway done your drink, he is already making you another one! Even if you have left the swim-up bar and are in the middle of the pool, he will call out to you! Great service! If you want to swim with the dolphins, go to Wet'N'Wild. It is a water park, so you get to enjoy both! Don't listen to the reviews about the staff stealing and going into your safe. We locked up everything and nothing was stolen. I asked the maid if she wanted clothes, and she said no. We didn't leave a tip every day, but our room was always cleaned to perfection. We left a tip the last day, and went around the resort to tip other staff members as well. Water would leak out of the shower, and onto the floor where the sinks are, as well as the toilet area. But they would always clean it up. While you are in bed, you can operate the light or fan with a switch on the head board. Shopping at Playa de Carmen...don't be afraid to say \u201cno\u201d and walk away. The further you walk into the strip, the better deals you get. Be careful with what they tell you. Do your own calculations. The resort will tell you how to convert. For example, one guy told me that 500 pesos was $11 US. However, it was really $50 US. So if I had given him 500 pesos, then I would have lost $50. Therefore, NEVER pay in pesos. They have prices in both US and pesos. Just use your US currency. When I knew he was lying, I just said that I changed my mind and I walked away. We went 3 times shopping and they remembered me every time. But I just said \u201cno\u201d and kept walking. They are pushy but just ignore them. Don't go off the strip! They tried to lure my husband off onto a side street and I got scared. So we didn't leave the strip. The beach was beautiful. Yes, there are rocks in the ocean...but it's an ocean people! I would love to stay here again, but because it was our first all-inclusive, we would like to experience other places. I haven't found any other resorts yet, with a swim-up pool to your room, like here. But I have a feeling that we will most likely be back at this resort in the near future. Have a great time everyone and remember you are on vacation so relax! Don't let the small stuff bother you!

Excellent service\u201d", "Author": "AussieEdmonton", "ReviewID": "UR110748195", "Content": "What a great choice we made! From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Service was A-1, the staff was genuine. The only problem was the language barrier, but everyone tried to speak English as well as they could and if they could not, they would get someone else to attend to you. We stayed at the Villas Laguna area, and the private pool and the goodies laid out there was a real treat (little dainty sandwiches, stuffed croisants, pico de gayo, nacho chips etc). And the 4 poster beach beds in addition to the well covered regular beach chairs! The areas were well shaded with umbrellas galore, and very very clean. There was always someone cleaning up. The little food and drink bar also had ice cream cones - itty bitty ones - yum! The pool concierge was very helpful (Jonathan). He helped make reservations for a la carte restaurants, massages, etc. The villa and platinum service includes a massage and a facial. I traded mine in for a pedicure. The toiletries in the room were great, and the two person jacuzzi was super nice too. The room was a little hot the first few days, but they fixed the Air conditioning so it was comfortable. The fridge was a little warm.... The bar was well stocked - and it was a shame that we do not drink, otherwise we would have been so drunk :) For people who like their alchohol, (on the desk/counter where the Television and paper supplies and pens were - vodka, tequila, rum, whiskey) plus beer, sodas and water in the fridge, choose the villa laguna or platinum suites. The bar is a \"premium\" bar - aka - you could order up to 5 bottles a day of hard liquour and the bar fridge is restocked every second day, (although if you order from room service, your pop or water or canned coronas will arrive in 5 mins!) There is also supposed to be a weighing scale in each suite. We did not know, but when we asked for one on the Friday (day before we were leaving) one was promptly delivered. The beach was clean and super nice. - Secluded area for villa laguna and platinum guests - and the server would be around every so often asking for drink orders. The food was available from the food stall - nachos, salsa, burgers, hotdogs, fixings etc. There was a little bit of shopping at the beach - silver jewellery, handbags, etc., massage service, tour bookings, sunglasses, and hair braiding. A little on the pricey side, but its a resort, so that is to be expected. The buffets had lots of food - not as bad as some reviewers have said - most of it was well arranged, and the temperatures well maintained. In addition there are 8 a la carte restaurants to choose from. The villa and platinum guest are invited on Thursdays to a \"gala dinner with entertainment\" at one of the a la carte restaurants. For that night, they turn the restaurant into a buffet and have a guy play the trumpet or something. A good experience, and the waiters were wonderful. We were in Villa 9122 which is the top floor or the two story villa. It was very soundproof, and private. I would recommend that suite to anyone, as it was not overlooking the pool area, but the laguna area - so for us that served as quiet and private times on the balcony. I saw people having a great time from the rooms with swim outs too! Imagine your own private pool and your suite is your changing room. Internet was free from our room area only. You get to connect to the Princess Platinum WiFi. Incoming calls are free, so if anyone from home wants to call, they can call the front desk, and they are put through to the room. There are also a few phone booths behind the reception area where you can use calling cards to make calls, or use 3 pesos for a local call. The hotel only had 5 pesos, so if you make a call, the machine gulps down the 5 and does not make change. There is also a train service (one on each side - the riviera side and the sunset side) taking people from the beach to the main lobby and food area. Just be careful you get onto the right train, otherwise they will miss your spot and when you ask them, they will say - sorry we dont stop there... Happened to us once, but it was ok - as we got off at another stop and walked to our suite. I noticed that there was a sign for an American Crocodile over one of the rivers, but never got down to see it.... There were iguanas galore, and some other small animals running around. So cute! One thing please - PLEASE, PLEASE tip the staff. They provide service from their hearts and souls, and I don't think wages are too high in Mexico. The waiters, the cleaners, the bellboys, the concierge people, the reception staff, the people serving at the bars - all great people. We changed a whole bunch of US dollars into dollar bills and handed them out, or 200 pesos is $2.00. I found generosity on our part to be very rewarding for our own souls too. (I did hear a few people complaining about this and that, but noticed that they were the first people in line for everything anyway - so......) There is nightly entertainment - 2 shows - one around 8 and the other around 9:30pm. They post the names of the shows on a little notice board just before the buffet area. There is also a little market on Thursday night - with lots of stuff - silver, paintings, clothes, etc. I could write lots more about this fabulous resort, but I will end now!

(plus diving)\u201d", "Author": "Al_Viki", "ReviewID": "UR109837230", "Content": "We have just returned home from a glorious two week holiday at the Grand Riviera Princess and we found the hotel to be absolute paradise. Never have I been on a holiday and wanted to do absolutely nothing. The whole vibe of the hotel is of relaxation and calm. We were part of a group of ten people who have varying ideas of the perfect holiday and none of us were disappointed. The men in the group came for a diving holiday and they spent four days of the holiday on diving trips and, of course, one day fishing. All the trips were booked from the hut at the hotel beach and each of them thought it was fabulous. The dive trips finished around lunchtime so it was straight to the buffet or the fantastic bbq on the beach and then into the pool for beer and cocktails. I would like to make a special mention of the bar tender at the Riviera pool bar, Renee. He was very quick and made great cocktails and was always friendly. As for the girls, my friend and I spent almost every day either lying on the beach or by the pool side. We found a lovely quiet area where very few people went so we had our pick of the sunbeds and almost sole use of the bar! The beach was also fabulous with a constant breeze off the sea to stop you overheating. We even treated ourselves to the front row of the sunbeds one day. This does cost you $10USD each but it was worth it for one day to get a comfier bed and an uninhibited view. The sea is a bit stony at first but not at all impassable. For those that are struggling, the little shop next to the beach sells water shoes to protect your feet. I also thought our rooms were beautiful. We had the lowest rate standard room and it came with a king size bed, sofa and two chairs, Jacuzzi bath, double sink and roomy shower. The room was certainly bigger than I expected it to be. The downfall of the room was that I didn\u2019t have a view. The balcony just overlooked the back gardens and there were palm trees blocking it anyway. However, this is because I didn\u2019t pay for it but a room upgrade would have moved us to over the pool where it was noisier so I was very happy where I was. Having not been to an all inclusive before I have nothing to compare it to but I was blown away by this hotel. The buffets were always well presented with plenty of choice with slight changes every night of the week. The a la carte restaurants we tried in the main were good. The best was the steak house. The steak was cooked to perfection however you wanted it. The Italian was also very good. We visited each of these restaurants twice. The only qualm I have about this hotel is the doctor. I was unlucky enough to hurt my back and had to see the on call doctor. For a consultation this was USD$106 and for each prescription it was USD$33. Although this is expensive, my insurance will cover the cost and I\u2019m sure all hotels abroad are the same. This is first time I have ever had to see a doctor on holiday. However, my complaint is that the doctor, knowing I didn\u2019t speak Spanish, wrote me a prescription for two items and told me one was for pain killers and the other anti-inflammatories. What she had actually given me was a multivitamin tablet which was neither use nor ornament and did nothing for my pain. After a couple of days of not getting better I spent about 6 hours in hospital getting some proper medication. This was the only aspect of the holiday that let me down. I would certainly go back to this hotel in the future, but just hope I\u2019m not ill! We found the service at the hotel excellent. The waiters and waitresses were very friendly and accommodating and this was with or without tipping them. Good service certainly didn\u2019t depend on a tip. If you are friendly to them they will be friendly to you. I want to make a mention of Coco Bongo which is a club in Playa Del Carmen. If you get change to go I would definitely recommend it. Tickets are $70 but this included a limo bus there and back, express entry to the club which skipped the large queue and an open bar all night with waiter service. Tickets are available from the hotel poolside. For anybody who is interested in diving the hut on the beach will do a good deal for multidives. Pickup is at 9 on the beach and you will be back for lunch. Diving from Cozumel is a must although you do have to arrange your own transport there but the ferry from Playa del Carmen goes every one or two hours. They saw turtles, spiny lobsters, lion fish, conga eels, stingrays, jellyfish, sea horses and lots more. It was well worth it! On the fishing trip which was also booked on the beach, they caught 4 large dorados in a four hour trip. The dive company on the beach was ProSea.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cA very quick overview\u201d", "Author": "CalM86", "ReviewID": "UR109242148", "Content": "I would just like to say that myself and my partner travelled here in June 2010 and had an absolutely amazing time.

We didn't go to any others but assume they were probably ok too. The grounds of the resort are kept with pride. You always see people out making sure they bushes and trees are maintained and the pools were also well kept.

It's incredible seeing that not even a tiny bit of pasture hasn't been taken care of, everything looks just perfect, with a great taste for the flower arrangement and ornamenting. The pools run throughout most of the hotel, and some rooms have direct access to them which is pretty good (ours didn't).

And then you have your choice of about 7 restaurants. Every one of them with great food. Even the buffet ones are very nice and have a great selection. If I am going to be picky and find faults, those would be the following: - pools are not heated. Would be nice to have, though I don't know if possible with all that water running everywhere. - restaurants are quite pretty, but could use a little more thematic decoration. - I think the spa pool should be included in the standard fee, not an extra option. And that's about it. This place is beyond excellent and I enjoyed my stay there a lot.

I have to admit that we got exactly what we asked for. We have stayed in another five star hotel further down the road from this one, and the Riviera Princess paled in comparison. Here are some reasons why... 1 - Customer service. The staff in the lobby, reception, bell boys, concierge, were possibly the least helpful I have ever come across. There was very little warmth in their welcome, and the suitcases were taking so long to be brought to the room that I went and got them myself. Thirty minutes is not an acceptable length of time to bring peoples cases when they have been on an 11 hour flight. When checking out there was no \"How was your stay\", no \"Thanks for coming\" nothing, he just handed us something written on paper and said \"You will need this for the bus\". The concierge was unable to remind me the amount of the \"departure tax\", luckily I took more cash out than he told me to, otherwise there would have been difficulty at the airport. It was not what I have come to expect from a 5 star hotel. 2 - There is a two/three tier system here. There are \"Laguna Villas\", Platinum areas and then the general hotel areas. This was not clear in the brochure. I'm all for people having a choice of room to stay in with differing luxury levels. But as a \"general\" holidaymaker I felt like a second class citizen, not being able to go in \"platinum\" areas hidden behind walls and palm trees... When spending a lot of money on a holiday you do not want to be made to feel like you didn't spend enough. 3 - The walkways are very slippery. I saw quite a few people take a slip, one who nearly shattered his kneecap... thank goodness he didn't otherwise that would have been the end of his holiday. 4 - The beach is horrible. You have to pay extra to sit on the front row of the beach, but you can't even sit behind them as there are beach huts full of businesses such as Trips, a photo booth, jewellery, souvenirs. About eight huts in all. All in front of the part of the beach you are able to lounge in without paying extra. I wanted a view of the sea, not of mexican wresting masks dangling in front of me. The picture in the Thomson brochure is very misleading. 5 - There are a lot of weddings at this hotel, one day there were SIX! Which is lovely. Not so lovely are the gangs of Bachelors and Bachelorettes partying hard at the pools with little consideration for the other guests around them. The amount of drinking and partying was excessive, especially around the pool areas, where they also brought their own music to play at loud levels for the whole pool to hear. One party animal was observed exposing himself and banging his genitals upon another person's head. One night we were woken up at 530 am by drunk people several room blocks away singing at the tops of their voices. Security is not strong enough at this hotel and life guards also were few in number. ON THE FLIP SIDE!!!! 1 - The system for booking restaurants was very efficient and the restaurants served nice food. 2 - The rooms were lovely. Very clean, very well kept. The surroundings were beautiful and I will really miss the birdsong - it was so exquisite I wondered whether it was recorded and played on a loop!! 3 - The drinks were great and the service at the bar and around the pools was very friendly and efficient. 4 - The beds were very comfortable and we slept well. There were blackout curtains too, which helped us get through the jetlag. 5 - There were some lovely people on the holiday and it was great to meet such a variety of folk. 6 - The massage on the beach was outstanding. Highly recommended. On the whole it was a very good holiday, but niggly little things which are easily remedied would have made it wonderful... it wasn't.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGood Time with Family, but I Don't Enjoy Being Treated Like a Criminal\u201d", "Author": "Synchrogal", "ReviewID": "UR107678175", "Content": "I was tentative about staying at this hotel because of the explosion and just overall news coming out of Mexico, but was relieved upon arrival. Playa del Carmen is perfectly safe and the resort makes a very good first impression. I vacationed with my husband and his family, nine in total, and we stayed in 3 junior deluxe suites. The room's decor was modern and esthetically pleasing. The balcony off of the room was nice sized and had a railing inside the balcony to hang things to dry which was convenient. Our rooms were located in the middle of the resort. It was a pretty decent walk to the beach and to the front restaurants which was difficult for my in-laws, however there is a tram that takes you to different parts of the resort. We didn't waste any time in experiencing the pools, beach and restaurants. The beach can get really crowded. The lounge chairs are right on top of each other so there really isn't any privacy. You have to reserve your chair first thing in the morning to even try and get a spot. Some chairs are located under huts which do provide great shade if needed, but like I said get there early for prime realestate (7:30 am?). The water is a beautiful crystal blue and with waves, very fun to swim in. You do have to watch out for rocks in sections, but they can easily be avoided. There are a few vendors around but you are not hounded like in some places. Becareful with your personal belongings, my camera was stolen from the beach. The beach did have one bar that had decent service and a lunch time buffet of hot dogs, hamburgers and nachos. Pools and swim-up bars were decent. There is the party pool if that is your thing or there are pools that are more laid back and family friendly. Some days for bar service were better than others. The walk areas are extremely slippery and saw one man slip and crack his head open. You absolutely cannot wear flip flops without any traction. (Do not bother to pack those cheapie flops that you can buy to color coordinate with every outfit) Restaurants were good. My favorites were the Habachi Grill and French Restaurant. The Mexican Restaurant I heard was not authentic and could be skipped. I was also not very impressed with the seafood restaurant. The buffets did offer a wide variety. Now here is what left me feeling disgruntled! The resort has these light fixtures that look like moons at night and boulders during the day. Well I had the pleasure of purchasing one for $250 against my will. In an incident where my husband was playing with a ball with his nephews he cracked the fixture. Break it, you buy it, fine! But what ensued from security, was ridiculous!!!!!!!!! It started with one asking him to wait to figure out what to do with the light to about 4 harassing us. My family proceeded to the beach while I waiting with my husband, they behaved in a humiliating matter keeping by the pool and not letting him leave a causing a huge commotion. 15-20 minutes go by and we are starting to get angry because they are not telling us why they were keeping us there and what was going and if we were waiting for anything. At this point I grab my husband and start heading to the front to try to get this resolved and continue on with my vacation. They follow us and continue harassing us. They told my husband to \"Shut up\" which I realize can be lost in translation, but I speak Spanish and these men were being completely disrespectful. Needless to say we were getting extremely upset and very unhappy. We make it to the concierge and they take us to this back room, which I later learned is like the principle's office you get sent here if you do something bad. This is perhaps 30 -40 minutes after the incident. I explain the story to some lady because at this point I am much calmer than my husband..I'm crying etc just trying to get out what actually happened. Then they let a security guard tell the story. They of course are speaking Spanish and well lucky for me I full understand what they were saying. It was 100% exaggerated and falsified. Basically all they want us to do is pay for the light. At this point my husband is so heated by being treated like a criminal that he says that he will dispute the charge on the credit card etc. This of coursed made them extremely angry. Then the marketing manager comes in and basically tells us that we need to keep our voices down, meanwhile we are just trying to be heard and listened to, we were 100% ganged up on. She then threatens to call the police to arrest my husband over this, picks up the phone and starts to dial. I honestly was terrified and scared and keep in mind this was over a cracked fiberglass light. Ultimately we paid for the light but the experience was scary, humiliating and ruined a good two days of our vacation and missed our dinner reservation that night. We considered leaving right then, but stayed for the family. Actually recounting this moment again has brought chills to my spine, I don't ever want to be treated or threatened like that again. Because of this I suggest keeping a cell phone with you at all times, just in case. The front desk staff and guards do not know what customer service is. The majority of bartenders and restaurant staff are pleasant and very helpful.

We did have a fantastic time in mexico and at the resort although there were some definate problems with the resort. Firstley I would like to say that this resort is immaculate, the staff never stop cleaning and the gardens are beautiful. However, the rooms are not great. When we arrived at the hotel we were upgraded to a junior suite delux, which we were thrilled about after a 15 hour flight from the uk!. However, when we walked into our room we were hit by a terible, over powering musty smell. We were on the ground floor and looked out staight onto a wall. The rooms are set in blockes and in the centre of each block is a water fall with plants around it. Your room walks directley out onto the water fall which looks beautiful. However, it is this water fall which creates the terrible musty smell which lingers in the rooms. The water fall, as well as the many plants outside the terrace, creates a very bad problem with mosquitoes. Dont get me wrong I realise that we were in mexico and should expect this but one night we counted 15 above the bed and they were landing on our face in bed. With a 4 year old this was really bad and affecting our enjoyment. The hot tub in the room was also unusable as the water was brown and left a dark brown rim around the bath. After seeing my inlaws room which was on the upper floor we asked to move rooms as there's had no smell, or problem with biting creatures and had a much nicer view of the surrounding land. Our request was granted with no fuss from the front desk at all which we were thankful of. The upper floor rooms were much better and i would recommend if you go to this resort request this at check in. Our second room was much better but only had one bed which means we had to sleep with our 4 year old all holiday, not what i was expecting but did not have the energy to complain or move rooms again! The hot tub in the second room was no better so dont book a room only for the hot tub, you wont be able to use it! I could not complain at all about the food in the hotel it was beautiful. All of the restaurants were very good, especially the Tapas. They all have a childrens menue too which was great! The buffets were very good too, although we sometimes struggled to find something for our 4 year old on an evening. The buffet close to the bottom pools and beach were much better for breakfast and lunch. All the drinks and cocktails were fantastic too!. Some reviews saying the beach was bad are wrong it is beautiful! The water is crystal clear and warm. You can walk for miles in each direction! It is a little pebbley walking into the sea but not rocky I could walk in with no shoes with no problems. The hotel does have a small problem with RATS. We never saw any around the restaurants or lobby but seen a few around the pools we had one under our sun bed which was a big shock. I have never seen Rats in a hotel before especially not a 5* hotel, but i suppose it is in the middle of the jungle? We had no theft from our room at all but did have a man enter our room in the afternoon and still not sure what he wanted he left when he seen us! The resort is huge which was a little problem on a night getting back to our room with a sleepy 4 year old! The golf carts don't come very often so there was often a big cue on a night meaning not every one waiting could get on. We did have a fantastic time at the resort and in mexico. The resort was beautiful but not every thing I was expecting. We overlooked and ignored things while we were there to enjoy our holiday (I would just like to note I have never wrote a review before, have never complained in a hotel before). We will definatley be returning to mexico but probabley not to his resort. This is not really a resort for families with small children! P.S British people who are told not to take American Dollars to mexico ignore this advise! every thing is priced in Dollars the mexicans often did not know what the price was in pessos! We would pay in pessos in resort and get our change in dollars it was confusing! Thomsons airlines, who told us not to take Dollars, Only accept dollars or sterling on the flight back! Not great when all you have is pessos due to their advise! So if you do choose to take pessos make sure you have plenty of sterling for your return flight!", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Williamsburg, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cTheft at Grand Riviera Princess\u201d", "Author": "dawnking4", "ReviewID": "UR106040555", "Content": "The safes at this hotel ARE a huge problem!!

Only issue of the week and one to take note of: The Platinum suites on the Riviera side of the resort are up front and not by the beach. Although I was not real happy at first, I actually preferred to be closer to the bars and restaurants anyway. The platinum suites on the Sunset side are by the beach, but are limited to those booking with two travel agencies (can't remember which ones). The only thing we missed out on was the Jacuzzi tub on the balcony, but I don't know if I would have used it anyway. As stated on this site numerous times, this is a large resort and it can take several minutes to walk from one end to the other. I did not think it was a big deal, and there are people in golf carts driving back and forth continuously if you don't want to walk. The views are great and everything is clean and tidy. I personally enjoyed the walk on occasion and took the car when I didn\u2019t want to walk. The beach is very nice. There are some rocky areas, but not too many. The water was crystal clear for the entire week we were there. Since we had upgraded to platinum we did use the area roped off just for us. Not very crowded and had a great view. My wife and I spent most of our days at the beach and enjoyed the grilled burgers and guacamole. The food was great for the most part. If you are going to eat at a buffet, well...that's what you are going to get. Didn\u2019t think the buffet at night was great, but we only had to eat there once. Breakfast was fine, but I would eat at the buffets located closer to the beach for lunch as they were better. We ate in the restaurants most nights and enjoyed all of them. Tapas was especially good. Great service and enjoyed the show. On Thursday night they had a special buffet for Platinum guests. It was very good as well with made to order pastas and steaks. The nighttime entertainment was OK, we went to see one show in the theater and I wasn't very impressed. There was live music every night and there were some great bands out in the main square. We went to the disco one night and it was OK, but not my thing. As I mentioned before the room was not where I expected it, but I actually was glad to be a little closer to dinner and the entertainment every night. The room itself was very nice, although you have to use your room key to turn on the lights in the room. Not a big deal, just know that you can't leave items plugged in to charge up if you are not there. When you leave with your key it cuts power to the outlets as well. The room was clean and they did a great job cleaning every day. No problems with musty smells either. I would recommend going to this resort. We really enjoyed it. I would also highly recommend upgrading to Platinum as well. Better service, a full time concierge and no towel cards to worry about.

We did not want to leave even after spending 10 nights here. It was unbelievably amazing. We had a private transfer from the airport to the resort which took about 30 minutes. We arrived to a friendly greeting and the taking of our bags until we checked in. The lobby was huge and gorgeous - marble everywhere! We stayed in the Laguna Villa Suite and I would recommend this upgrade to each and every one of you. I went back and forth so much when booking this trip as to if we wanted to spend the extra money for it or not - but it was worth every single penny and we were so glad we did it. Since we were Laguna Villa guests, we got to go to a special check-in line that had no one in it (while the other lines were a bit longer) and were poured a nice cold glass of champagne to sip on while we were checked in. Check in was quick and our room was ready even though it was only 11 am so we were able to go right to our room. Our bags arrived just a few minutes after we did. Our villa was amazing. We had a bottom floor villa. It was a huge room with a large comfortable bed, a nice flat screen tv, sitting area, his and hers sinks, a hairdryer, lighted magnified mirror, a jetted jacuzzi tub, a bathroom and a beautiful mayan outdoor shower. I wasn't sure how I would feel about technically showering outside --- but it was so cool. The shower was beautiful and it was amazing to be able to look up while in the shower and see beautiful blue skies and hear birds chirping. And the shower head in the maya shower was great - great water pressure and had a removable hand held shower head as well. Our balcony was quite large and was right on the man-made lagoon. So we could sit out on our balcony and look out at the laguna and hear the calming spray of the couple of mini water falls throughout the lagoon. We had a welcome gift of fruit and chocolate waiting for us in the room. There were also several bottles of liquor - I believe there were two different kinds of tequila, a rum and something else. And our mini refrigerator was stocked with pop, water and beer. Our mini fridge was refilled every day and our room was cleaned wonderfully. Nothing ever went missing and everything was always right where we left it. I had read several reviews before going that people said mosquitos and bugs would get into their room from the crack in the doors leading outside to the mayan shower and suggested to take tape. So - being overly cautious -- I took a big roll of clear tape and each night after we showered before dinner - we taped the cracks between the doors and never had any problems with bugs coming in. I'm not sure if we needed to do so - but we did - and thus didn't have any problems. By far the best perk of being a laguna villa guest was the laguna villa pool area. It is only for laguna villa guests. We spent much of our time here. There are beautiful and comfortable cabana beds all around the pool. They serve a nice little breakfast buffet at the pool - just danishes and fruit. There is a designated bar there too and a concierge desk where you can book all of your dinners/spa reservations/etc. The bartender Colle (pronounced - Co-We) was awesome. Ask him to make you a Riviera Maya - he made the best ones!!! Then at lunch time they would set up another little buffet with snack foods - olives, salsa and chips, sandwiches, etc. The pool area was always so wonderful and very quiet compared to the other pools. It was never packed or crowded. And the part that I really liked is that since it is only for the laguna villa guests - it is adults only because no children can stay in the villas and you need to have a special villa room card to be able to get in the gate leading to the laguna pool area. The food was great. By far the best restaurant was the sushi/japanese restaurant. You can choose to just do the sushi side of the restaurant or the japanese steakhouse side where they use the big grill and do tricks and cook right in front of you. Both were absolutely delicious. We went to the actual reservation restaurants for dinner each night and went to the buffets for breakfast and lunch. I would highly recommend the buffets for breakfast and lunch - large varieties. For breakfast - made to order eggs, lots of breakfast meats, fresh fruits, cereals, etc. For lunch - lots of different salads, fresh fruit, vegetables, hamburgers, hot dogs, tacos, quesadillas, chips, salsa, etc. We honestly didn't stay out too late at night because we were exhausted after being out in the sun and the water all day. So we did not catch a lot of the shows or nightly entertainment. We did go one night when they were serving flaming coffees - which was fun to watch and my husband really liked them and we saw the flamenco dancers one night and they were very good. The beach was very night - soft sand and beautiful. The ocean was so incredibly warm - it was the perfect temperature! It was like bath water - warmer than the pools even! There was a roped off area of the beach with waiter service for the laguna villa and platinum guests which was nice - always able to find a spot in that section of the beach. The pools were wonderful - always clean. We had 2 free massages as part of our laguna villa package - and then I paid to have another one. It was fabulous - highly recommend their spa! I am not exaggerating when I tell you that I read hundreds and hundreds of reviews before we went on this trip. I would get excited when I read good ones and incredibly nervous when I read bad ones. I have to tell you - I really have no complaints about this resort whatsoever. The resort is quite large - but people greatly exaggerate when they go on and on in their reviews about how long of a walk and how it's too big, etc. It is a beautiful resort and I never felt like the walk was too much or too far. The only even remotely negative things I can say about the resort is that I do agree with a couple of the reviews that when the walkways get wet - they are slippery. There were a couple of times I sort of slipped on the walkway, so I would suggest being careful when walking in shoes around the pool areas. And the second being -- But other than that - absolutely positively no complaints. The grounds were meticulously maintained, the food fabulous, the pools and beach were incredibly clean, spa was relaxing, housekeeping honest and thorough and the people working there really helped to make our experience even more perfect by their helpfulness and kindness. I would recommend this resort to any and everyone. Singles, couples, families, vacations, reunions, girls getaway, etc. I would suggest that if you are going for a nice romantic, relaxing and quiet get-away or honeymoon - definitely go for the laguna villa - it's so worth it.

We had booked my 18 year old daughter with her 17 year old friend in the swim up and we were in the platinum. Upon arrival (the entrance is beautiful) we were upgraded from the platinum to the Villas and the other two were upgraded to the Platinum. The Platinum they received however did not have the outdoor whirlpool tub that was advertised but other than that it was great. The Villas were even better with the outdoor shower and huge king size bed. The service at the personal pool at the Villas by Colli (pronounced Coee) was above and beyond. It helped that we met a ton of fun new friends there. We had no problem with our safe so that was good. The seafood restaurant was just ok and the Fondue restaurant was not what I was expecting, they cooked the meat for you and then brought you a pot of cheese that you could fondue something with but not sure what because I don't like sticking meat in cheese. The hibachi grill was everyone's favorite as was the sushi - we were only there for 6 days so unfortunately did not get a chance to get to the Italian or the Mexican restaurants. I would say that the resort is unaffected by the blast last November so not sure what some of these other people are saying. The Platinum area on the beach isn't the best with the service and the chairs and I would highly recommend walking further down to the Cill Out Bar - it is worth it for $10 for the day to have a Johnny on the Spot butler and it comes with sandwiches and nice comfy chairs and a front view in front of the ocean. Hey, it's only $10. I would definitely sign up to do the Coco Bongo Nightclub - absolutely fabulous show which is very similar to Cirque de Solei. Spend the extra $10 and bypass the line, I'm glad we did, we went on a Monday night and it was over 2 blocks long. Service there was outstanding as well. Other friends we met said the bar crawl was great too! One hint if you get into the Platinum or the Villas, you can order room service 24/7 but what we didn't know is during the Restaurant hours of operation you can order directly from the restaurants. I would have ordered Sushi while I was getting ready for the night for sure.

Stuff is super nice all over, waiters coming after you even poolside and on the beach to serve you (if you are jerk and don't tip ..don't expect to to walk 1km with your beer every 5 min. ..) Had a swim in room ,enjoyed it so much. Pools are with salt not chlor so pleasure to stay in! You have your own terrace with chair you don't have to go and look for shade or chairs. On the beach is nice BUT if you wanna stay at the entrance and oceanfront only option to pay for it. If you are ABLE to walk .. at the side you can find oceanview chairs for free. It is a huge resort ,but don't worry plenty of pools, poolside bars and restaurants. Bring your watershoes because rocks in the water, nice places to snorkel! Personally tried the diving offered at the reef nearby and was beautiful, fishes,corals blue water, rare possibility to try just with a small course no certification needed ! Shallow diving (40feet) but gorgeous, worth the money ! So alltogether beautiful place ,good services ,have fun !

We were 2 guys (25 & 26) not excepting much from this vacation and got the world handed to us by the entire staff. The best part of the vacation must have been the animation staff that always had fun games to play to either get you drunk or just in a great mood. Tequila volleyball, water polo, dance lessons, drinking games. Where to start we arrived on April 12th by Air transit the flight was a bit rough the plan was a little small. The bus ride was a blast we met 2 great new friends from our hometown in Montreal. Check in was a breeze right off the bat we went to the bar before our room because it was not ready yet, it was still only 12in the afternoon. Jose at the main bar is great. Our room was beautiful & clean from the moment we walked in. We are very sociable people and try to make friends with everyone so we can just have one big party ( which we did ). Right away we hit the pool area in the middle of the resort met the animation staff which introduced us to everyone and made us feel at home. There are waitresses by the pool always walking around so there\u2019s no need to move and go to the bar. Make sure to tip well we usually gave about $5 - $10 per day and she would come see us every 20 mins or so. Every day you do need to wake up early to reserve some chairs to make sure you have a nice spot by the pool. By 9am almost all the spots are taken so we would take a nice jog / walk and pass by around 8. As I noted before we are very sociable people so we made many new great friends which we ung out with every night. This made the experience more fun. There are many cool things that happen at the hotel during the night there is a disco that opens at 11. In the middle of the 2 lobby\u2019s there are shows on stage which are performed by the animator\u2019s by the pool. I was surprised no one offered us any time share's or any other types of products. My special note for this review is: I spent my birthday at the world famous club COCO BONGO. If you want to leave the resort this is a place you must go. It is a mix of a club and a cirque de sole show. It is a bit expensive to get in but if you go with the resort you will pay 10$ more then if you dont go with the resort. But you will get VIP passes and will not wait in line and get a bus ride to go and come back from the resort. The only draw backs I see from the hotel were: The resort is huge so if you don\u2019t like to walk stay away ( I myself loved the size there were many people to meet & a good walk after eating makes you feel great ! ) The buffet food at points was not that good. The water at the beach has rocks and seaweed ( but you will find this at any hotel in Mexico ) All in all I will be going back in 6months to get my party & tan on ! Attached is an idea of what a good tip is and what worked well for us to always have the best service. Hotel cleaning staff for your room - $5 / day Waitress around the pool - $5 - $10 / day Bartenders around the resort $5 per visit Bartenders at the disco $10 / $15 But make sure you hand it to them in their hands Buffet Staff $5 if your about 4 people A la carte resto ( tip as you would at a normal resto ) Keep in mind if your 2 people you can always go half half also keep in mind the staff works 6 days and works 10/hors per day.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201c2nd Visit NEVER AGAIN!!\u201d", "Author": "Matthieu25", "ReviewID": "UR104086520", "Content": "As I start all reviews, please take a look and see how many hotels I've reviewed, I'm not a jaded one time traveler. I travel often and feel I have a good base to write a good overall review. With that said this also was not the first time at this resort. We were guests in 2010 If you take a moment to read that review you'll see that the grounds are beautiful. They are constantly cleaning the sidewalks, sweeping the tile, washing the glass. But as I said in the past review if I were to return I would upgrade to Platinum. As stated I booked a platinum suite, upon checkin we were given a basic room on the second floor the faced a fence and dirt field that they claim is platinum because they added a few bottom shelf bottles of liquor plus the closest pool was not private nor did we have a poolside butler. The pseudo \"platinum lounge\" is now housed in a dark old converted piano bar. May I also mention that the room location was at the very front of this mega resort not near the beach. The location of the room and the room itself coupled with the amenities that we did not get that are advertised are as follows; Jacuzzi in Terrace, DVD Library available in Platinum Lounge, In room Premium bar (the bar provided was in no shape or form premium) , Pillow Menu in Platinum Lounge, Private pool with butler service, Nightly turn down service, Use of bathrobes during entire stay, 2 pairs of slippers per room, Private Check-in with cold towel on arrival and Welcome Drink, Domestic, International & Premium brand Drinks, 1 Special Dinner New, Gift in room upon arrival, Discount on Spa Treatments. If you are unaware of this resort, its two resorts in one \"Sunset & Riviera\" after seeing that the room and accommodations were grossly misrepresented we went to the front desk and spoke with a manager. We explained that we were very sorry for the tragedy (7 people killed when the real platinum building blew up) that occurred there but if they don't have the rooms to sell, they shouldn't sell them. We asked to be moved to the \"sunset\" side of the resort where the platinum level was unaffected by what occurred on the \"rivera\" side. The manager out and out refused to move us claiming that he was at 100% occupancy and if I had issues that I needed to contact the company that we booked through because they sold me the room. He also said we were the only people that have complained about this issue. We asked if it was possible for him to move us to the room below ours so at the very least our room would be \"swimout\" and he said he wouldn't move us unless expedia (who we booked through) changed the reservation. At this point there was very little for us to do. We decided since this wasn't a very long trip (5 days) we would just keep the room we had and try to work with our booking company when we got home. But since our room was basic, honestly the only thing that benefited us was the \"free tote bag\" , wireless internet (mega slow) and someone that made our dinner reservations (but since our room was at the front of the hotel making dinner reservations via the normal booking lady wouldn't have been any harder. Please keep in mind that we paid a premium to upgrade to platinum. We didn't use the platinum beach because we found \"Chill out\" its on the sunset side it costs $10 per person per day but its a private beach with padded chairs, real priemum drinks (in glasses) excellent service! everything the platinum should be. And honestly $10 is so worth it. Again we saw many people not tipping or tipping very poorly. As I stated in the last review as an American I understand that better tips get you better service and this year was no exception. Waiters remembered us in every bar, checked on us often and at bars took our order in front of others who were standing there. Should it be this way? no but it is what it is. If you're not from a country use to doing this, we spent $100 US in ones. It will make your time in Mexico much more enjoyable. The food was good. I'm very picky and never had an issue finding something to eat. We would do the buffet for breakfast which really has something for everyone. Some things were hit or miss. The bacon would sometimes be just a ball of bacon fat and the eggs at times were like an egg soup. We did lunch at chill out, and that was small finger sandwiches and the dinners were very good in all the restaurants. The house wine was by far the nastiest wine out there. We would just buy wine from the wine list. In conclusion will I return to this hotel.... NO not even if I won a trip there. The beyond poor service not to mention the fact that we were lied to about what kind of room we were given after we paid for it I'd gladly take my money where they put their customers first.

I was brought up blue-collar and can appreciate the simple things in life. As long as I have a clean place to stay, decent food and sufficient booze I\u2019m a happy camper as far as vacations are concerned. However, I am a firm believer of you should get what is advertised when you pay. If you spend the money on a \u201cPlatinum\u201d experience, you should at least get the minimum of what was listed as included in your package. To everyone out there, please do not discount the negative reviews, there is some merit. Had I looked a little more closely I would have not taken this vacation. If you booked through Travelocity, Expedia, Orbitz or any other discount travel site, the hotel treats you like second or third class citizens. The hotel does NOT have what it advertises on the website and completely oversells the services. Even if you went last year, please note that it has severely gone downhill. Apparently there was an explosion at the hotel due to shoddy construction and a natural gas line blew up the platinum portion on the Rivera side killing 7 people. At any rate here is a recounting of our experience: First of all when you check in you were supposed to receive a cold towel and welcome drink. We didn\u2019t receive anything just a notification where our rooms were at. We went to our room and essentially nothing was \u201cPlatinum\u201d about this room, except a few bottles of no-name-bottom-shelf liquor, if you call that platinum. Last year we paid less and got a swim out room and had better accommodations. Additionally lacking in the rooms were: robes, slippers, gift or Jacuzzi, which were all advertised as part of the platinum package. Essentially we paid for the \u201cplatinum service\u201d but received a regular room, so far from the beach and pools. Also if you want whatever they call a \u201cspecial dinner\u201d it\u2019s only available one day a week so make sure you book way in advance and if you are and if you are on a short vacation, forget it. At any rate, due to the explosions they stuck us up way in the front of the hotel. Normally I don\u2019t mind walking but when you have to drag all of your beach stuff with you and aren\u2019t prepared to bring footwear for miles and miles of walking, it\u2019s not a very fun hike. So either you have to hike it to the beach or wait forever for a shuttle to only take you about \u00bd way when it does come. When you finally did make it up to the beach, there is supposed to be a platinum beach section roped off, which there was that, however they packed in row after row of highly uncomfortable chairs. If you like highly cramped spaces, no visibility to the beach and a \u201cbutler\u201d (advertised as part of the package) that comes maybe 1 time every 2 hours, then this is place for you! After being completely horrified at this we decided to continue exploring. There is a place called \u201cChill Out\u201d which is down the beach a ways. It is affiliated with the hotel. You do get nice fluffy comfy chairs, and space to sprawl out, but with everything else you have to pay extra for it. It was way better then hanging out at the \u201cPlatinum Pool\u201d, which by the way did have decent service, IF you could get a spot. It was so crowded with screaming children and a bunch of Jersey-Shore wannabes, that if you wanted any relaxation this was not the place for you. The dinners and food are OK. There are a lot of indication management has cut several corners due to low attendance 1) The buffets have less selection and poorer quality than last year 2) the restaurants are severely understaffed and 3) good luck if you want any decent wine. We went last year and the wine was fine, just a regular table red and white, which is fine when you have that many people. This year it was \u00bd water and almost undrinkable. Granted, I\u2019m no wine expert, however I\u2019m pretty sure wine should not have foam at the top. It was disgusting and we ended up spending a lot of additional cash, (which is not the point at an all-inclusive!!) to have some passable wine with our meals. Additionally, we were looking forward to discounts on SPA treatments, the only thing available, was a Sauna, really??? Why would you want a Sauna when it\u2019s 90 degrees outside? We were hoping for something soothing like a massage or wrap treatment, but not only a Sauna. I know this may seem that I am being overly picky, however it is extremely irritating to pay for perks in your package and then once you get there, not get them at all. I am positive there are better resorts out there for cheaper prices.

A big plus for us was management was visable and out and about daily. We saw the resort manager numerous times. The pools were large and we always found a place to sit without any problems, feel free to use the side areas. The beach was beautiful but crowded, though we always found chairs. The buffets were good, nothing special, but that should be expected at buffets. sometimes they had some problems keeping some foods hot (lukewarm at times). The A La Carte resturants were very good, specifically the steakhouse, Tapas (with a show) and Mizo (which has show service and meal service). Reserve ahead of time after 3 pm and you can get usually 2-3 days done. Though gratuities are inlcuded, a little extra tip goes a long way. We do it up front and let the staff know, remember most of the staff make less than $10 a day (USD) without extra tips, so a little extra is really appreciated. Shows in evening were OK, specifically the courtyard shows. One night has many venders, use your bargining skills. Please note we live in the US and it seems that a majority of the guests are from other countries, which for us, adds to the experiance.

We are female and wanted an rnr, beach and not too interested in off site ventures. Our main concern was the previous accident a few months ago we did not clue in to and our travel agent did not tell us when we were booking. We arrived at the Grand Princess Riviera around 5:30 pm and the check in was quick. The resort is very large and when we got there, we were told the accident area was small and now closed. We also read great things about the upgrade and tried booking before we left at $80 each and we were told they were sold out and try on arrival. When we arrived, the cost went up to $250 each so we declined. They offered an upgrade \u2018free\u2019 to a junior suite half way closer to the beach with a large balcony over the gardens and a jet tub. We were fine with that but if you are a couple I would recommend the upgrade still and maybe if you book far enough ahead you can get the better price and availability. Some of the bonuses of the upgrade are the lounge chairs are all cushioned and luxurious, room service and internet are free and a few exclusive areas. You could not see the beach from our suite but it was very quiet and the garden view was nice. There was a service road somewhat busy looking down from our large balcony. We had a screen door and the air conditioner stayed on even when our room key was removed. The room had a jet tub in the bathroom and the bar was filled with water, pop and two beers everyday. The safe in the room could fit a laptop with height room left over. The grounds were immaculate, the food fresh and the eggs at the buffet were cooked with spray oil which was way less greasy. We only saw two negatives in our whole stay. 1) The fantasy pool bar was the most popular with all its games and interactive activities but we noticed the youth never left to use the washrooms while drinking steadily and we wondered how that affected the sanitation. I do not think they knew how to reinforce that other than they sprinkled chlorine in the pools at close. Anyway, there are 10 pools and two other swim up bars you could go to that are less rowdy and probably less of that issue. 2) There are signs everywhere to be careful slipping. The wood bridges are the worst. I recommend non-slip shoes for everyone and age. Even though we knew of this, my friend still slipped on a bridge and had quite a bump on her head. She was fine but the same afternoon another woman broke her ankle and was carried off. We took out extra medical before we left and were told it was only useful at the mainland hospital and it would cost $110.00 cdn to have the doctor on the resort to \u2018look\u2019 at the wound. In addition, an hour cab fare to the hospital. We were quite sure she was all right observing there were no symptoms for two days in and all was fine. No pupil or coherency issues, headaches or anything and the bump went down the next day. I must say the staff were at her side immediately when she fell. On the beach, we saw a few topless women. One very heavy older woman just lounging and one younger with silicones, strutted frequently back and forth and would stand endlessly at the front of the lounge chairs on the beach playing patty-cake with her boa. lol As this was a family included resort I thought that was in bad taste but the beach unlike the pool areas was not exclusive to adults so what can you do but move if you are offended. The beach was awesome, just like a community wave pool. Warm water and a very slight undertow. There are rocks scattered on the bottom on entry but you can see to walk around them. If you want a front seat and hut at the beach you have to be there between 7 and 7:30 am. At 7 am the sun rise is worth the effort alone. We brought our own beach towels so as not to loose the hotels (fee for loss) and they were easy to recognize when we returned. We put our towels down and went for breakfast. I think that is acceptable. The greedy ones that would reserve seats and then go somewhere else for hours is selfish I think. There is a bbq at the beach everyday, hamburgers, hot dogs, chips, beer on tap. Another bar with everything you want to drink as well as servers that come around for your drink orders only. Washrooms are close by. There are also non-evasive vendors on the beach and massage services, and all the usual water sport rentals. There is a weekly gift market held on site and a one-night beach party with an amazing buffet and live band. (The band was Jamaican) On our departure, we were allowed to keep our inclusive bracelets and enjoy the services even after check out which was great because we had an hour and a half before our bus was to leave. The kid services were as organized with a kids club and own wade pool. I still would not leave mine unattended just the same. (Parenting ethics 101) lol this location was just lovely and my first time at this one. Sunwing airlines stayed with their reputation of hospitality, friendliness and hot meals each way as well as complementary headphones. They took cash on board and handed out pillows and a current movie was shown. Some things not available or expensive you could bring; binoculars, specialty medicine; i.e. sinus, charcoal pills, floaters for the beach, aloe vera and lots of $1 bills (for tips) as we could not always get change when we wanted it and had to make extra trips to the front desk.

When we checked in however, they neglected to inform us that it might be a good idea to make reservations at the a la carte restaurants for each night. So when we tried to go to the restaurant, they told us that they were totally booked but we could try to make a reservation... Looking at the dining area, however, only half tables were being used. So to make the reservation, we had to go back to the lobby area. When trying to make the reservation, we were told that there was nothing left for the rest of the night but we could try and talk to the manager to see if he could try and seat us. We went back to the restaurant and they made it such a big deal saying they might have to seat us on the terrace, which we said was fine. Finally, we were seated, and they seated us in the restaurant, so we were happy with that, however, we looked around, and for the rest of the dinner, barely half the tables were being used... I don't understand why they were freaking out about seating two more people?!?! The only good part of the buffets were the breakfasts (omlette bar) and the never ending fruit. Lunch and dinner at the buffet was repetitive and was nothing great at all. We ended up eating burgers and fries... Service was poor at the front desk, swim up bars, and some waiters. Unless you tipped, they took their time to serve you. It was very frustrating at times. Also, for the first time, I felt like I was not as respected as others because of my skin color. My husband and I are Indian, and I felt like the Caucasians were receiving a lot more attention and politeness than we were, and this was more than one occasion. One more thing... Internet. $20 for 24hours (time cannot be broken up) on your own computer or $10 for 30min (time can be broken up) in the computer room.... come on! Overall, the experience was very good. We were only there for 4days, and just wanted to relax and enjoy the weather. Management definitely needs improvement. This was our second time in Cancun, and our first experience at another resort was definitely the BEST and lived up to its expectations in every way. Grand Princess Riviera was just OK for a quick getaway... there is definitely room for improvement... specifically on the food and the stupid restaurant reservation thing.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elbow Lake, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNot exactly \"5\" Star!\u201d", "Author": "CSB2010", "ReviewID": "UR101318870", "Content": "The place is absolutely beautiful.

I'd been desperate to go to Mexico for years, and on seizing the Swine-flu induced price slash, I decided on this beautiful resort which I know I could not have afforded otherwise. The hotel and resort is just as lovely in real life as it was in the photos. Being relatively new, everything was clean, light, and spacious. We were upgraded on arrival to a swim-up room which I had already heard from other reviewers is a distinct possibility. I absolutely loved the swim-up facility - being able to wander straight out into the pool for a dip in the morning or evening from your own private terrace was fantastic. The main swimming pool was obscenely big which I loved. It was more a series of interconnected lagoons than one large pool, and enabled you to slip off somewhere quieter - or even have somewhere all to yourself. It did get rather busy around the pool bar (rightly so), and the pumping music around this area was a bit off putting for me, so it was great being able to swim off and find somewhere quieter to float around . The resort was well laid out, easy to navigate and beautifully maintained by landscape gardeners. The beach was only a couple of minutes walk from our room, and anyone who expects to stay in a resort this size without walking to either the restaurants or the beach is naive and lazy. The beach itself was fantastic, white sand and spearmint coloured water which, whilst not as tranquil as some pond-like waters, was very far from choppy and a perfect temperature (warmer than the Mediterranean, yet still cool enough to do the job). Most people tended to stay around the pool complex which meant that the beach itself was wonderfully sparse in comparison with the crowded, overpopulated beaches of Europe. There were only two or three rows of beds, and these were at a good distance from the water, so beach photos are unspoilt! Needless to say the beds and umbrellas were also free (another one up on the extortion of Europe), and bar staff actually waited on you whilst you lay on your bed. The food was great, particularly breakfast! A massive selection of everything you could possible eat before noon, including all English, American, European preferences, and I must admit I quite deserted my usual and had waffles every morning! I actually ate so much at breakfast that I never usually bothered with lunch. The selection of a la carte restaurants was better than I expected. Unfortunately you had to book them in advance, and it often took an hour or so of queuing to put your name down which was a bit of a shame, I wasted a lot of time doing that which could have been spent in the sun, but the difference in standard of food between the buffet and the a la carte's made it worthwhile. We only ate in the buffet a couple of times, and whilst fairly good, for a fussy eater it wasn't really my scene as I would end up with a plate of the most unrelated ingredients. I would say that entertainment was sparse, and the hotel rather isolated. Being used to European hotels and evening culture I was confronted with something very different from wandering out of the hotel to an array of restaurants, shops, stalls, street entertainment etc. However, I had been prepared for this, and so four or five evenings we caught a filthily cheap taxi (10 mins) to Playa del Carmen which provided everything I had been missing: shops, restaurants, cocktail bars with live music. We also went to Playa del Carmen during the day as the beach was possibly more beautiful than the resort's (possibly...) but it was very busy and reminded me a bit too much of San Antonio, Ibiza. But if you're after laying in a cabana (four poster bed), being served awesome cocktails and listening to music on the beach, I would definitely recommend it. If you like to pepper your holiday with excursions like me, this place (though obviously this applies to the entire Riviera Maya) is unbeatable! I could have done an excursion everyday if my spending money could withstand it! We went to the Mayan ruins of Tulum and Coba (both incredible, personally my favourite was Coba as you walked through the rainforest before seeing the giant temple of coba in a jungle clearing, and could climb up to the top with indiana jones-like views over the rainforest for miles). We also went on a trip to a Mayan village, snorkelling in Cenotes (beautiful and absolutely unique to this region), and finally to the Xcaret Ecological and Arcaelogical Park which had cougars, pumas and jaguars lazing around original mayan ruins, its own beach, more underwater cenoes for snorkelling, and a jaw-dropping closing ceremony in the open air theatre which showed Mexico through the ages from ancient aztec to spanish colonialism. FANTASTIC. *I would have to note that the Chitczhen Itza trip is not particularly accessible, being far enough away to warrant either a very VERY early morning coach ride (3.5 hours if I remember corretly) or an expensive flight, so if this is your main reason for choosing Mexico, make sure to take enough money or perhaps consider a hotel nearer Cancun. It has always been a rule of mine never to go to the same place twice, not even the resort let alone the hotel. But after a disappointing holiday last year I find myself on the Grand Riviera Princess website, seriously booking this hotel again for six weeks' time. I would hate to return and be disenchanted, but I don't know how I could.

We had requested pool rooms and rooms next to each other, which we did get. We had a great time and would definitely go back. We didn't know that we were platinum guests (an upgrade well worth it) until we were on the beach and were told by a resort employee that with our silver bracelets, we could go sit in the roped off Platinum/Villa area. We double checked with the concierge and he confirmed that was the case. Platinum guests also have access to two bars (very quiet) with free internet - one down by the beach and one up by the lobby. It would have been nice to have been told that upon check-in but we left check-in to the husbands and maybe they didn't ask the right questions. The buffets were good - much to choose from.

The Plaza Bar has music entertainment every night - the drink service there does need to improve. The beach was beautiful - plenty of lounge chairs and palapas in the Platinum/Villa area every day. You could walk for a very long way on nice beach to get your exercise in. The rooms were cleaned every day while we were at the beach. Fresh towels, bed made and refrigerator restocked. The pool outside the room was not heated so only the guys were brave enough to go in. It was great to have a bar not far from the room, too.

Whether you choose to stay at this resort despite the obvious safety concerns is your choice but before you make this choice, I feel that as someone who has stayed at the resort, you need to know that the Grand Sunset Princess and the Grand Riviera Princess ARE THE SAME RESORT. They are in a U shape with one beach access at the water end, two lobby's at the top of the U and all shared restaurants, pools, bars, etc. in the middle. When searching on web sites, the resorts come up as separate resorts but ultimately YOU COULD BE PLACED IN EITHER ONE UPON ARRIVAL TO THE LOBBY- like me and my bf were. We didn't realize there was a difference so we went with it. So if you think you're avoiding the danger zone by booking at Grand Sunset- you're wrong. The hotels are a mirror image of one another and so the construction of them both is most likely the same as well. From the airport we were the last resort to be dropped off. That sucked as we were excited. What was really weird is that there was no rhyme or reason to the drop offs made. The highway is essentially split up by islands where you can pull u-turns. Our bus would drop off some people at one resort, drive a little, pull a u-turn, drive back up, around and whatever and basically he wasn't dropping people off in order. If he got the call to stall, I would have preferred to wait in a lobby if they weren't ready and not driving around on a bus after a flight. The hotel cleaning and maintenance staff are the friendliest of all the staff. The servers, concierge etc. are not at all. Not helpful, not warm, not friendly- I did not get a good first impression of Mexico. I've been to Cuba and DR and liked the staff of this resort the least. I always tip and do not need to be praised for it but acknowledgement would be welcomed. I say thank you when I get my drink so shouldn't a server say thank you when they get their tip? Or even smile!??? Nod, anything? The food was great but always cold. Use the microwave. The resort is huge and I didn't mind it because we were closer to the beach and the walk to the main lobby was refreshing. However, if you forget something in your room and have to go back, that can be annoying as the trolly that runs on the outskirt of the hotel does not come by as often as needed. At night you can wait for up to 30 minutes for it. The pool was cold, disco empty. The grounds are beautiful but there is no culture. No colours. Everything is clean, simple and marble. I could tell beforehand that it wasn't Caribbean style but didn't realize it was trying to be as elegant as it was. Playa del Carmen is close by but beware of the Mexican street vendors. They're all sweet and complimentary when they want you to buy something but can turn on you at any second. My bf bartered too low with a man who had a whole bunch of alley stores and he got fuming and kicked us out of his alley after insulting us and making disgusted gestures. Ironically, my bf bought the hat for the price he wanted at the big store down the street where you don't barter. We took the city bus from Playa to the ruins. They tried to rip us off but a nice passenger who spoke English saved us from paying too much. Don't pay for a tour- it looked long. We did our own walk and just listened in on random tour guides every once in a while. If you go to Mexico, go to the Coco Bongo's show but don't expect the animation staff from the resort to keep an eye out for you. The young guys who took us were too busy grinding and making out with this group of 4 girls from our resort. My bf and I left the show early and cabbed it home. We told the one responsible looking guy that we were doing so just in case. He didn't take our names or anything though. The place is packed so if you're not good with standing, perhaps it's not the place for you. Great show though. The water in Mexico is just not the same as in DR or Cuba. Not even close.

When checking in, we were advised that we could be upgraded to a junior deluxe room for a \"gratuity\" which we were glad to do until we went to our rooms and the view of our rooms was right in front of the explosion site and the back of one of the dining rooms (loading and unloading of equipment started at 5 a.m.) The next day, we asked to speak to a manager about being asked for a gratuity first of all, the terrible view and the racket that had started at 5 a.m. that day, and he laughed in our face when we told him the amount of \"gratuity\" we gave the reception desk clerk. He informed us that he would \"try\" to change our rooms which of course he didn't. Not only were the rooms facing the explosion site but they reeked of sewer and mustiness. We were close to the beach so we decided to make the best of it. We didn't have coffee in our rooms on most days, we had to beg, borrow and steal to get face cloths. My mini fridge didn't work, I didn't have a hair dryer in my room and either issue was ever rectified. One of my friend's room was facing a non-working fountain that still had swampy water in it so the mosquitoes were horendeous for me and my friend had to use her pump for breathing every day. Another one of my friend came back to her room one night around 11 or so, and the floor of her room was covered with water, after a nasty storm earlier that dat. This was rectified quickly enough and only then did they offer to change her room but after 4 days of being settled in, she declined. Too little too late. The grounds are beautiful and the staff works extremelly hard at keeping it clean. The beach is beautiful but unfortunately is full of rocks so you definitely needed shoes otherwise, it was simply to dangerous of hurting yourself by tripping on a rock and losing your balance anf falling. There was a very good variety of food available in the 2 dining rooms but unfortunately, it was rarely hot. Our return flight was at 11 p.m. so we asked if we could keep one of the 4 rooms we had until 4 p.m. (instead of the regular check-out time of noon) for a small fee ($40 or so) and they would not accomodate us. My 3 friends and I paid $2,500 each for a 10 day stay but we were treated as second class citizens. There were a few other issues but I decided to stick to those mentioned above. It is not, in my opinion, a 5* hotel; maybe at 3.5* but definitely not a 5. If the above issues do not matter to you, then by all means, go to the Grand Riviera Princess but we spoke to a lot of other guests and they were also very disappointed. The complex is HUGE and sometimes it took us a while to get from one place to another. The shuttle was not always on time and we could easily wait 20 to 25 minutes sometimes for one.

Would definately say this is the only way to go if you can, so nice to step off you deck into the water and relax on your personal in water lounge chair. Food: The buffets were good, good variety of fruits and salads as well as hot food. Had no trouble filling my plate each meal. We tried 2 of the al la carte restaurants the first was the La Hacienda thought it would be great to have some authentic Mexican food while in Mexico, wrong, the atmosphere was dull, we were stuck in a back dark corner and the food was not that great, very disappointing. Our 2nd meal was at the Japanese Miso restaurant we sat at one of the cooking tables, it was fabulous the chef put on a great show and the food was awesome. Bars: didn't try out all the bars, the lobby bar was nice and quiet with good service, we spent most of our nights at the bar beside the buffets, they had different live entertainment each night which we found very enjoyable.

Mom and Dad had a second floor platinum oceanview room and the kids had a gardenview on the first floor. Although view of beach was obscured by the palm trees, not worth switching to an upper floor. Rooms were clean and large and well stocked with alcohol and toiletries (no conditioner though - but I think most women prefer their own anyways (sexist comment)). Beds were comfortable and it was nice to turn off the air fall asleep to the ocean at night. The kids had room service most afternoons, but did not have a need having enjoyed a wonderful lunch or beach burger. We at al a carte each evening and found the breakfast/lunch buffets by the beach better than the main buffets, e.g. no more bacon at breakfast, but lots near the beach. Favourite al a cartes in order: Vaquiera Grill, Miso - Tepanyaki Grill, Hacienda, Le Fleur and Mama Mia. We did not go to the Tapas, Seafood nor Fondue restaurants, because we preferred the others. The steaks at Vaquiera were the best I have had in Mexico. Miso has 3 menus: Tepanyaki, Sushi and Oriental - request your preference when booking reservation. The service was exceptional. 3 examples: room ready at check in (noon); upon arrival on my wife's birthday the concierge made restaurants at our favourite restaurante from last time; asked the waiter at Le fondue if they still had the wonderful onion buns from last trip. they did not, but he went to the Italian restaurant (on the Princess side) and got us their version of onion bun! Only service complaint was the length of time it took to get our luggage delivered and waiting in the room looking out at the sunny beach.. No problems getting drinks, but I believe you will get better service on the beach if you tip the waitress due to one experience where I did not tip (engrossed in a great book). There have been complaints about the pool temperature, but it seemed to vary between 80 and 84 (we have a pool) depending on the weather. The ocean was warmer. The beach is great and depending on where you enter, you may encounter rocks upon entry. Enter near the big lifeguard tower. To the south we only walked as far as Sandos and to the north, past the Grand Velas and Mayakoba, but it is possible to walk much further. The sand is better than in Cancun, since the reclamation in Jan 2010 (we were there in September). All in all, we had no complaints about the hotel (excluding the bellhop), nor Sunwing. only complaint was about the weather, but this is not a weather review.

Beautiful place, clean and very well kept! Everyone is soooooooo incredibly nice and friendly. If you are someone who appreciates the beauty of things and the simple things in life, you will quickly notice that this resort is heavenly. I have to say that I laugh at the ones that complain about the size of the resort. Why complain about having to walk 6 minutes to get to the beach?? Seriously... how long does it take you to walk from your house to Cancun? Definitely more than 6 minutes. You're on vacation people.. stop complaining about the walking.. it's good for you. Especially when you eat at a buffet 3 times a day! Relax, breathe through you nose and go for a stroll.. If you're too tired to walk.. stay put and wait for the golf cart that literally drives by every 10 minutes and they will be happy to take you to the beach. Cold buffet.. ya .. sometimes.. however it's sorta difficult to cook for 3000 people and always having it warm! Use the microwave.. certainly won't kill you! Besides.. if it wasn't for the temperature of the food you'd complain about.. it would be about something else! I work in the travel industry and I'd like to warn you about those travellers who complain on purpose to get an extra perk!!!!! TOO MANY OF THOSE AROUND!!!! SHUT UP - SIT BACK - AND HAVE A GOOD TIME!!!!!! Best staff on that resort... Ramiro and Antonio at the Platinum bar!!! Really great guys!! They work hard and have a smile on their faces 24/7. Never had to wait for a drink!!!! As for a Gato Special!!!!! SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOD!!!!!! Good job boys! You know - it's all about the attitude you bring. And that goes for anywhere. If you go there and expect to be treated like a king because you paid to be there... well i have some news for you... those are the ones that complain all the time and have bad experiences. But if you go there with the right attitude expecting that you will have a good time and relax... you will be so incredibly impressed!

If you have any sense of adventure, go somewhere else. The resort is huge and lovely, but it took a half day to figure out what we didn't like about it. We finally figured out that it is a giant cruise ship on land, complete with buffet lines and cheesy entertainment. (I guess the Princess name should have been our first clue). It is NOT 5 minutes from Playa. It is a $20 cab ride each way. It is nearly impossible to venture out of the compound by foot. It is about a 3/4 mile walk along a walled in entrance drive to get to the main thoroughfare, which is the highway between Playa Del Carmen and Cancun. That road is not walkable. We asked about walking the beach to Playa, but were told it would take 3 hours. Not sure I believe this. I think it was a ploy to keep the cab drivers busy. There is no where to go for a run. And generally, exercise is a low priority. There must be a couple thousand people at the resort and the exercise room only has 4 treadmills; three of which were working. But that wasn't a problem because there weren't many people using the exercise facilities because they were busy bellying up to the buffet line. We wanted to go to Isla Mujares. The concierge at the hotel insisted that the only way to do that was to take the Booze Cruise catamaran and spend the day with other cruise ship passengers, I mean hotel guests. After a little detective work, we figured out how to get out to the main road, take public transportation to Cancun bus station, take a cab to the ferry and take the ferry to Isla Mujeres. It cost two of us a total of $50 there and back. The prepackaged booze cruise would have been over $100 each. Isla Mujeres is fun. You can rent a golf cart and cruise around the island. We found a quiet beach and spent the afternoon relaxing with a few Coronas. The staff at the Princess Resorts is exceptional. Consistently courteous and helpful and classy. In spite of some of the obnoxiousness they put up with from some of the resort guests. For example, the two loud drunk men with southern accents arguing and fighting with each other right outside the lobby on Saturday, 1/22. Do you know how loud you were and how stupid you sounded? And that you were ruining everyone else's enjoyment of a beautiful evening? Playa is a fun city, with a lot of browsing/shopping opportunities and good restaurants. So, pry yourself away from the buffet lines at Princess and have dinner in Playa. The beaches are gorgeous and well maintained. The staff at the beach is generous in bringing drinks. Make sure you tip them.

There were two platinum buffets near the beach and the other buffets were in the main areas closer to the lobby. They grilled burgers at a pool near the beach all except one day and allowed you to take them to the beach with you. We booked an excursion which included Tulum, zip lining, rapelling and snorkling. It was great fun and we also went shopping in Playa del Carmen one afternoon. The hotel has a free shuttle but it fills up quickly so we just took a cab from the hotel into town. It was only about 10 or 15 minutes away. My last comment speaks to the entertainment. It was a blast. We watched a dance show which was okay but saw \"Aladdin\" and the \"Horror Show\" which we loved.

If you take banana's down to the sea and put it in the water then loads of fish will come and swim around you whilst eating the banana's, but even if you dont the fish still come up but not as much. Pool:- I LOVED the pools. They were all so clean. There is three pools with swim up bars, one of the pools do activities with loud music playing. I prefered the quiet pools as they werent as crowded and didnt have alot of loud people. Food:- There is a huge variety of food like : steak, stews, curries, chips, salad, soups and loads more great tasting foods. Make sure you go to the steak house, you get a T-BONE steak which is HUGE! The Italian resturant is also great. I did not like the Oriental resturant atall. The food was bland and wasnt hot. The ONLY complaint i have about the food is that none of it in the main buffet is hot. i got a steak off the grill and by the time i got back to my table it was cold. However there is a microwave. Entertainment:- The entertainment staff were very good but they were always miming. They are all very energetic but the shows are repeted each week. There is live bands down by the bar which are good to listen to . What a BRILLIANT holiday we had and will hopefully return in the future.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worsley, Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cBookin again for 2011 \"Bring on Sept\"\u201d", "Author": "cdt1984", "ReviewID": "UR91049633", "Content": "I have travelled to Mexico before and stayed at th Riu Tequila in Playa Car. The Grand Riviera Princess was the best hotel I have stayed in. I have been to Mexico, Dom Rep & Cuba and decided to re-book GRP again on the flight home. There is so much to do in Mexico that I am going to go back again for my third time. The people are so nice and the hotel is amazing. I was extremely upset and shocked about the explosion that happened upon my return to the UK. This however has not stopped me wanting to return to the hotel. The food is great, I love the sports bar. Taught the staff what a \"Chip barm\" was for any mancs out there. Ivan the rep for Coco Bongos is great, we have stayed in contact - he's an ace guy. He's on the complex most days. This is the place to be. If you like Spiderman and Beetlejuice then get down to the club asap - don't put it off till the second week. We loved it that much that we went twice. We were lucky enough to experience the 200th Independence Day there. The celebrations were amazing. Chichen Itza was an excellent trip. We went with a company booked through the hotel. On my first visit to Mexico I didn't do this trip as I did others instead though I always said if I returned I would visit one of the 'new 7 wonders of the world'. Do not let anyone put you off because of the distance - the 3hr drive will fly by on the trip. I will go again in Sept with the people in my group who missed out. A place you should visit is Alux http://www.aluxlounge.net/FTP-ingles/index.html This is a hidden restaurant in a cave in playa del carmen, Ivan told us about the hidden gem. Check out the above website. Order the lobster & also the pancakes as they make them in front of you. Trips to do: Coba - Mayan ruins Dolphin Discovery - Swim with Manatees, Sting Rays, Dolphins Chichen Itza - Mayan ruins Coco Bongos - Club/ acrobat Tulum - Mayan ruins Xceret - Eco water park Xplor - Zip rope Senior Frogs - Bar Also when we went in Sept we were told they did not accept USD though when we arrived this is all that we were asked for! Book this hotel and you will not be disappointed. We were also upgraded to a Deluxe Junior Suite - Pool View.

Check in was super smooth, we got rooms near some of our friends, but not all of them. Rooms were large, clean, modern and really nice. The resort is absolutely gorgeous with beautiful landscaping, lighting and sculptures. Walkways were so clean you could walk barefoot all day on them. The pools were a little on the cool side, so we spent most of the time at the beach which was gorgeous! We occasionally had to hunt for loungers, but would always find some. Yes there are some vendors on the beach but hello, its Mexico. All resorts have some vendors on them, that's just how it is. They are very friendly though. The ocean was so pretty warm and we played in the water a lot. There are some rocks in the entrance to the water in some areas, but then it turns into nice sand after that. The drinks were always really good, and the buffet dining was great - lots of selection every day. The a la carte dinners were all amazing - my only complaint is that it was too much food! And they say you have to make reservations, but many of us would just show up and give them a tip and they would usually slip us in. The nightlife was really fun! A portion of us were in our 20s and we had fun every night in the club, sports bar and lobby bar. The shows were okay, a bit cheesy but it was entertaining. They put a lot of work into them. Our friends got married during our stay as well, and the wedding went very well too. My main complaint would be to heat the pools a bit because on a windy or cloudy day the pools were really cold!

The website describes this area as \"adults only\" but there were about 8 loud children right outside our room. We called and complained and were moved to a different section of the building but they did say that many times, the parents will rent the \"adults only room\" for them and put the kids in a room above them (which are kid friendly). Next time, I would stay in a regular room and enjoy any of the pools. Plus, the swim up pools close at 6pm just as the rest of the pools, so there is really no benefit to pay for this upgrade. The food/restaurants were great. One of the girls in the party was pretty picky and she didn't get tired of the food until the 4th or 5th day. Beautiful resort!

Please read this knowing that my husband and I have traveled to Mexico approximately 30 times over the past fifteen years so we are not new travelers to Mexico. This was definitely a disappointment, probably more of a horrifying experience than imaginable. The federal police shut our resort down last Saturday and we arrived on Sunday. We were not taken to the lobby of the Grand Rivera Princess but our Lomas bus took us to the lobby of the Grand Sunset. Upon Check-in we were told we had too many people in our two rooms and that we could not have 7 people (my husband and I with our five children) in two rooms. I argued with them telling them my travel agent would not have booked it if we could not do so. They told us we would have to take two rooms and eventually that we would be upgraded to a Junior Deluxe Suite due to the error... I asked them if that would include the MISO restaurant and were told yes. However, later that week we were asked to sign a voucher when we ate a MISO charging us an extra $20 per person because we did not have a Junior Suite Deluxe. They put my 19 year old son and two boys 9, 15 in one room and our 2 daughters and us in another. We said fine. We then were told each room card would be a charge of 10 dollars and were asked how many we wanted. They held our luggage and we went to eat at the buffet. We then later went to the pool and found we had armed federal police with machine guns everywhere. They were by the pool. There were 5 or six with guns by the bathroom and by the bridge to the ocean. They were at the restaurants and standing at every walkway. The resort had bright yellow police tape do not enter everywhere...On the pathway we had tape placed with a security guard and armed Federal Office who would not even allow you to look that way(towards the resort we were supposed to be staying at.) My family went walk to the pool and found all the pools on the Grand Rivera side as well as the hot tubs were closed. We stepped into one hot tub when we got there and an armed police man came shouting at us in Spanish and chased us away. We had no idea we should not be there but then found they had small yellow cone markers that are used for \u201cSlippery when wet\u201d place around with closed signs on them. ... SCARY seriously... The Grand Princess side was totally boarded up with plywood and roped off by guards...We could hear bulldozers and men working and had a view of a huge wall they had built out of plywood where seven people had been killed on the Saturday before we arrived due to an explosion at this resort. Twenty five people were also seriously injured in this explosion and the reason for the explosion was still unknown. All we were told was that it happened in the restaurant located directly 300 yards from the one in which my family had to eat breakfast and lunch. It was some type of swamp gas explosion. Upon getting to our room my son Tucker did not have a bed. I called and requested a rollaway bed. I was told it would be taken care of... on the next night he still did not have a bed and I called again to request one and was once again told it would be delivered. I was not until Wednesday that his bed finally came. I called the first night and ask... it took four days to finally get a rollaway bed!! We had no activities for our teenage boys as basketball, tennis and water volleyball were located on the Grand Rivera side and were closed. My boys went up to play basketball and were first told it was thirty dollars (which is crazy) and then when I gave them thirty dollars they went back and were told it was closed for the week. The piano bar was closed as was the Kids club for teenagers. My children who are nine and fourteen and fifteen were given numerous alcoholic drinks. I know my nine year old in no way looks or acts 18 to be served liquor by law in Mexico. I complained to the bar staff numerous times about this and they would laugh and say it ok, no big deal! I had to check every drink that they got to be sure if was alcohol free even when I requested it to be! As far as service, we never got anyone to bring us a drink; it was our job to get them. There was no one around the pool to pick up cups so eventually I would get tired of all the cups around us and pick up all of our trash and others. My daughter got ill one night and vomited all over our room. I called housekeeping that morning to let them know and request the room cleaned. That night at six pm when we to our room there was still vomit all over the floor. I called the desk; they told me they would send someone over. It still took two hours before anyone came and we missed dinner as we had not one clean or dry towel in the room to shower with as I had used them to try to clean up that am. I also tried to purchase medicine at the gift shop and a bottle of children\u2019s cold medicine was $24.00. Our shower drain did not work and when my husband showered it flooded our whole bathroom each time we showered. We went to the front desk and were told it was due to construction going on. Our toilet was backed up every day. We had a terrible time getting into restaurants as they told us our group was too big, even though I would go up the day it became available. They said four fines... seven no any a.... I would argue and finally get a reservation for seven. The Grand Princess Rivera has also sold or rented their beach to a company named Polymer. We could not sit on beachfront as they charge fifteen dollars to rent a beach chair. They have allowed Solymar to construct huts and buildings filled with merchants on the beach and our beach space as hotel guests was located behind these buildings with the vendors...we did not have a beach due to this... we were behind large curtained buildings or trying to find a chair in the narrow area beside it, as most of the rest was for Platinum club guests. The Grand Princess Rivera also concerned me with the fact that they have three large alligators living on the resort which are located next to the Thai Beach Club restaurant. Our children had to walk across a wooden bridge with only a top rail, which was waist high, and could watch the help and tourist throw food to the alligators below. The alligators would quickly devour the food as they would have my child had they fallen below. A towel was 20 dollars if lost one. If you put your towel down someone would take it if you were not careful... Our remote control was $200 if it did not work when you checked out. A misplaced room key was $10. I contacted our Lomas travel agent on Monday night and met with him Tuesday am. I explained to him my concerns, he assured me that they would be taken care of, I am not sure what occurred but he told me he would have to contact his Manager to have him come and try to take care of my concerns. I spent from 6:30 am on Tuesday until 2 pm on Tuesday in the hotel lobby arguing my point and trying to get the hotel manager to refund me so that I could move to another resort. After almost a full day of arguing with myself and the Lomas Travel Manager, named Fredrico, she consented by producing a contract of some type, that I did not understand, and that I had to sign it now and leave the resort immediately. I told my Lomas agent that I did not want to sign until I had another resort to move to\u2026 He agreed and told me not to sign until he found me another resort. He then we and made some contacts and returned to tell me the computer system was down and he could do nothing until the system was back up. He said he would notify that evening, as it was already 2pm of where I was moving to. I was contacted that evening saying that he could not find another resort that was available and that by 8 am he would call and tell me where he could get me into. He also said that my day was already charged but that if I left by noon it would be fine. Also amazingly as the Lomas agent was there, the basketball court become open, for a short period of time only. He called at 8 am to tell me that to move I have to pay $1100, obtain a bus to move my family, or two taxis because of the number of people and that my Lomas travel transportation would be more than I had paid. I told him that I did not have $1100 cash on me nor did I have a credit card to pay with so I had no money to pay to move. Princess offered us any room to stay and since $1100 was out of the question. They would upgrade us to the best room available. As we were stranded, we said fine. That day we had a note under the door to see the front desk. When we went to see what room it was a room, exactly like the one we were already in located in building 2.

The Riveria side was completely closed complete with guards, guns and caution tape. Our sunset side might as well have been closed too. Would I go back, probably not. The place was just too big and the service was not what I would expect from a 5 start resort. Would I use Sunwing again........absolutely NOT!

Upon arrival we were somewhat impressed with the grandeur of the lobby and the neatness of the grounds. We were directed to our room which turned out to be very nice and our bags were brought up shortly thereafter by the bellboy. We began asking ourselves if this was even the place that was affected by the tragic explosion. We decided to walk the grounds and began noticing caution tape in various areas, boarded up windows, and a large ditch being dug. We knew this was the place. We spent a few more days enjoying the beach and some day trips off the resort, the entire time trying to find out what was going on with our hotel. No one on the resort would even acknowledge anything happened but some friendly locals and a cab driver Informed us that rumor was the resort would be closing in the near future. After the third day we get a note slipped under the door at 10:30PM stating that the Riviera Princess resort was closing temporarily for a government inspection and that we should pack our belongings and would be moved over to the adjacent Sunset Princess hotel. They relocated us to a much less desirable room and almost directly across the pool from the site of the explosion. I was not happy. The manger and assistant manger were both \u201cunavailable\u201d to speak to. We regretfully spent the remaining part of our honeymoon worrying what was next. It was quite obvious that a cause of the explosion was not well understood even several days after the event; first it was methane, then swamp gas, then they began digging what seemed to be exploratory holes. Not swamp gas. The fact that hotel management was well aware of all this information that we\u2019ve pieced together since returning exudes absolute negligence on their behalf.

We arrived at the hotel the day of the diaster. Our first impressions were slightly tainted by what we had been reading all over the airport as we left Toronto, and although we were greeted warmly by our Air Canada rep, Edwardo, we were told we could not stay and were going to be transfered to a different hotel. Meanwhile other guests were checking in and getting room keys. We had paid for an upgrade because it was our honeymoon and when we inquired about the new hotel and the upgrade we had booked, we were told that the new hotel would NOT have the same accommodations and that MAYBE we would get a different room tomorrow at a different hotel or maybe back at the GRP. Because we argued, and refused to leave we did suddenly get our orginal room, and were checked in???? We still do not know why we were going to have to leave, but we do know that other guests who left, NEVER did come back to the hotel and never got their upgrades they purchased. Once settled in, we totally enjoyed our stay. Our room was clean, quiet and we had no issues with smell, bugs, or water. We faced the jungle and had the entire swim up pool to ourselves everyday! The bar closest to our room, 411 Bar, had the best barman, who let us create our own drinks daily, remembered how to make them and would have them ready when we ordered! There were snacks here too, and the towel exchange room, so we always had food, drinks, and dry towels! Better than home could ever be. We only traveled to the beach at sunset due to having to rent the best beach chairs, and the fact that everyone puts their cigarettes out into the beautiful white sands despite the 100's of ashtrays. At least at night you couldn't see the disgusting mess the smokers left behind! Considering the bar gives out 1000's of palstic cups daily, no one ever thought to fill one of them up with their garbage and not to leave the beach littered with butts! The buffets were HUGE! I always enjoyed breakfast and lunch. I am not a huge eater and did not go there to gain weight, so I felt the variety was just perfect and the options to eat healthy fantastic! Anyone complaining about the food choices or the taste, is simply being picky! What I enjoyed the most was the ability to eat at a different resturant almost everynight! We tried the mexician resturant, the steak house, the fondue place and the fish resturant, and then went back to the steak house! The staff are wonderful and polite and remember you when they see you twice! We had no issues trying to book into these resturants and were often asked if we had dinner plans for each night to spice things up by the staff. They do a great job, and dressing up for dinner was a great treat. On our second to last day, the hotel closed the GRP and moved us to the GSP, and upgraded us to a platium villa. I LOVED THIS THe room was beautiful, the shower was an experience and the view was breathtaking! I loved out private pool area, and bar service to our little piece of heaven! I felt like Carrie from Sex in the City! Our pillows however were very stinky, and we had trouble sleeping due to their scent, but all things considered, this was a small complaint. The hardest part of the whole vacation was pretending nothing happened there just days before. The poor staff, and guests who were there when it happened, and who had to continue on like all was OK afterwards... There was at no time an interrpution of services despite the great disater. I give my condolences to the friends and family of the Canadians and Mexicans who lost loved ones that day. I think about that other bride almost everyday. To rate this hotel after something like this is difficult. It impacted our impressions of the hotel even before we arrived. It impacted our view throughout our stay, but at no time did we feel like we should leave or that we had gotten anything less than what we paid for. I would return to the Mayan Riveria, but would not stay at the GRP again, only because we saw many other resorts we would like to explore too!

The beach was crammed with sun loungers which is good, but they never had any cushions on them so after 20 mins you start getting a very sore back.

Our group from Waterloo Ontario was staying in the junior suites adjacent to the Platinum building. Many of us witnessed the horror first hand and felt very fortunate to come away unscathed. My heart goes out to the families of those killed and injured. Now on to the review. The beach is lovely - the rocks are not an issue. The beach is clean, the waves were fun and the palapas are plentiful. Tip... Head toward the south end of the beach for more privacy. The grounds are well maintained and the facilities such as the gym are well kept and clean. If you enjoy plenty of cheap, low quality, super sweet drinks then you'll be pleased as punch. If not, you'll be disappointed. Many of us felt that way. The breakfast buffet in the building closest to the platinum building had the best of the buffets.

We slipped the hostess a few dollars and managed to get in on more than one occasion. We did smell the sewage/ gas smell at times down near our building. I guess we weren't imagining this! Finally, and most unfortunately... If you've looked at many reviews on this site about this place you've read about safes being broken in to by staff. Well, I'd purchased a Mylockie ( great product) just in case and I'm thankful I did because you won't believe this... After the initial explosion, there was an alarm that sounded in the buidlings closest to the platinum building. We were ushered out and not able to return to the rooms until late in the day. Upon our return 4 members of our party discovered that their safes had been pilfered. An iPad, passport, credit card and computer cables were stolen. Only hotel staff and security had access to these buildings during that time! That was rather pathetic. After the explosion the staff was not very helpful and seemed I'll equipped to handle any kind of emergency. Until they are certain the problems with the infrastructure have been dealt with, I'd stay away! In summary, I think that if you are 18 to 30 and want a great party resort you'll enjoy this place.

I went on vacation with my boyfriend and some friends. We went to the Grand Riviera Princess for our friend's wedding. If you read the news, then you already know that we were at the resort the day of the explosion. This tragic event and the lack of communication from the resort staff and our travel vacation representative (Air Canada) on safety, details on the explosion or options to leave, left me feeling unsafe and nervous the entire trip. If I had to only judge the resort, I would not recommend it to anyone. The resort is extremely large and narrow. It takes a long time to get from the buffets at the front to the pools or rooms, if you were closer to the beach. The beach was not large and occupied by Mexican \"sales\" people trying to sell you everything. You could not sit on the beach with out having a Mexican come up to you a zillion times asking you the same thing. The Mexican have booths set up right in front of the ocean that blocked the view of the water. After the explosion we moved rooms to be closer to the main lobby. We were told the rooms were made up but when we moved into them, they were not. The couches were missing the fabric, we did not have any pillows and we didn't have hot water for the first few days. The food was also not good. For a four star hotel we expected some what decent food. I have stayed at the Barcelo in the Mayan a few years ago and they had amazing food. However, the Princess resort's food was far from par. The buffets were the exact same everyday. The a la carte restaurants were tasteless. I had to ask a server to serve us at the Mexican restuarant as we were sitting there for 20 minutes and nobody came by.

Having been on many ALL Inclusive holidays I can ASSURE you this place is deffinitly NOT a 5 star. It is a very large resort with two hotels together and is mainly occupied by Canadians, who like to drink all day and make as much noise as possible, this combined with the many infants and children around makes for a very noisy resort. The drinks are ALL WATERED down and although served from named label bottles taste very poor and weak. The Buffets are all the same food day in day out, for all meals, and combined with noisy and badly behaved children the dining experience is terrible. Food in the Buffets really is very average and be prepared to eat the same stuff day in day out. The a la carte restraunts are slightly better and food standard improved but still no way near a 5 star experience. If you like Butlins or similar holiday camps this place will be for you, with cheesy, cheap entertainments,noisy families and drunken louts(not sure how as the drinks are rubbish)screaming and cheering in the pool, also you never see anyone leave the pool to use the toilet block!!! The buildings are large and well maintained with decent accomodation, but this does not make up for the other faults. There is also very bad smell on the beach coming from the nearby swamp, and the beach chairs are all crowded together, and cant be moved to the shoreline unless you pay some locals which is a disgrace.

Our hearts go out to the families and friends of those affected. When we heard the news we were totally gutted, as we have come to enjoy our times there and have fantastic memories of this wonderful resort and the Riviera Platinum lounge and its staff. We spent our final days hanging out in that lounge and I will categorically state that there was no smell in the lounge. None. We did not experience any offending odours anywhere on the resort during our week stay. Ill try to write an upbeat review but I probably wont be able to pull it off given what happened. But I do know that the day we got home we were very relaxed and full of fantastic memories of our most recent trip. Westjet and Transfer We flew with Westjet Vacations and they were very good. Best Day was our included transfer and they were also quite good. A bus load of folks went straight to the GRP which was nice as it meant no stops. So from airport to reception lobby was about 45 minutes. Check In Check in was very quick and the front desk clerk spoke perfect English. Our room, 9119 in the Laguna Villas, was assigned to us. We had emailed the concierge before hand requesting a room location, and 9119 was bang on what we wanted. Second floor, mid Villa area with a beautiful view of the pool and a water fountain directly off our huge patio. I believe that this is the best room location in the Villas (we stayed in 9107 last year on the Sunset side and we both thought that 9119 was better). When we arrived in our room, we found three letters: one from the Manger of PR welcoming us back with reservation slips for each of our restaurants we had requested, and for the times we had requested; one from the pool concierge welcoming us; and one from another concierge welcoming us back and offering up their services for our stay. Our massages had also been pre-booked for the following day. A nice fresh fruit plate of various sliced melons was waiting for us on our coffee table. A nice start! Restaurants It was the end of slow season so unfortunately we did not get into the restaurant we were eager to try\u2026the Tapas restaurant\u2026as it was closed. Le Fleur\u2026fantastic for food and service. Try seafood soup, the incredible fish, and the filet. All very good and well worth the visit. A+ Las Olas\u2026service was quite slow and it seemed as though they were scrambling to get food out. Seemed as if a couple people didn\u2019t show up for work. But the people who were working were busting their humps to get things out. Food was very good, but the entrees were both undercooked. C+ Mamma Mia\u2026we had originally booked into Le Vaqueria with another couple, and we tried to add another couple at the restaurant, but it was full due to a wedding party. So the maitre de rebooked all 6 of us on the spot to Mamma Mia. (If you don\u2019t throw a temper tantrum and degrade them and be obnoxious they are more than willing to help\u2026and we found this to be the case the entire time there. Some of the negative reviews might want to try that sometime). Mamma mia was delicious and the service was again very good. We even got items that were not on the menu\u2026again, by being nice! Who knew!?! A We only went to the dinner buffet once and I was a bit disappointed with it. Service in the buffets was tops though, with being seated very quickly, drink orders taken, water being poured as soon as we sat down, and plates removed when finished. No problems at all with the service. C+ only because I didn\u2019t like what was on offer one night. Buffet service would be B+ though. Room Service B+ This was unfortunately some misses but mostly hits. Not the food quality, but once the food arrived ice cold and once a burger arrived undercooked. Those are the only two instances\u2026the 12 or so other times the food arrived well on time (within 20 minutes) and warm. The room service guys were all great. Recommend the Mexican breakfast with coffee and OJ. Room A++ The room was fantastic and cleaned spotlessly every day. No odour at all, either in the room or from the water in the laguna villa area. The king size bed was great and firm the way I like it. AC was very modern and efficient and could cool the room quite quickly. Large modern ceiling fans are also in the room, and we used those most of the time in place of the AC. If you forgot any toiletries, they provided it in the room. The room was well stocked with towels, robes, slippers, shampoos, bath salts, tooth brush and tooth paste, bug wipes, and an incense burner! Mini bar was also restocked every day with Pepsis, a delicious orange pop, a couple Modelo in cans, 3 large bottles of water, diet Pepsi, 7 up, and I believe a ginger ale. Spirits were Bacardi Anejo, Tequila and Vodka. It was rare that we saw a mosquito, and only once at dusk sitting outside at the Riviera Platinum pool did we feel the need to escape them. Grounds A+ The landscaping is filling in and the grounds are positively gorgeous. Everyone writes about the high quality maintenance of the grounds and it shows. Evening Entertainment We would hang out in either the Plaza bar or the Riviera Lobby bar in the evenings. We all had a great time in those spots. We were told though that they do not carry Havana club in the main bars. But you can get them in the platinum or laguna villa bars. The Plaza bar hosts the merchants on Thursday nights. We bought a bunch of stuff there being our last night. We actually found that the prices, once negotiated, were quite reasonable. A nice mariachi band circulated in the Plaza bar area and played some nice music one night, while on other nights the lounge singer was singing. There was always entertainment going on in the plaza in the evening, but we were always just enjoying our company so we couldn\u2019t say what was going on! So I would encapsulate the evenings there as a \u201clounge\u201d atmosphere. I wouldn\u2019t call it party atmosphere. Other stuff\u2026 We rented a car from Europcar in the lobby area and had no problems at all. Although they accidentally didn\u2019t take a CC deposit or swipe it properly. Guess I could have taken the VW Sportvan 4x4\u2019ing! $85 usd for 24 hours included all extra insurance, taxes etc. Gas is cheap there so we spent about 6 dollars in gas to go to Akumal and back. Driving there is, um, interesting. I highly recommend you do it\u2026kinda akin to a X-Games sport! Trips in PDC were plentiful and lots of exploring was has. A walk into PDC from the resort, along the beach, took us about 2.5 hours, but we did stop several times to chat with folks or take pictures or just take in the scenery. If youre looking to huff it straight in Im sure you could do it in under 2 hours.

First of all I want to give my condolences to the family and friends of the people who lost their lives at this resort on November 14. We were at this resort at the time of the explosions and thankfully none in our group were hurt but this is a day and a trip that none of us will ever forget. This review is based on resort before explosion. The Grand Riviera Princess is a great name for this resort, as it is definately Grand. Yes, there is a lot of walking but wow, what a beautiful walk. The rooms are large, bathrooms beautiful, marble everywhere. I did notice a sewer smell the whole time but it was like they were trying to \"kill it with Lysol\" I told my husband it smells like pee and lysol. He said he didn't notice and it was no worse than any other Caribbean resort room we have had. Just shows how different people notice different things I guess. The marble makes everything echo, so beware that it is very loud in the hallways whatever time people are coming in for the evening. The food, for me, was just okay. The salad bar was great so that's mostly what I ate. A lot of people really loved a lot of the food, I did not. There was always something decent to eat but certainly not amazing or anything. For the love of everything good in this world, do NOT have a hamburger unless you get them to re-grill it so it's cooked. We were with a large group and didn't try any a'la'carte's so I can't comment on those. The staff at this resort is really great for the most part. The bar in between the 2 buffet restaurants was pretty slow, the bartenders would have a line up of people but even though there were 3 or 4 staff they didn't really make eye contact or try to help you at all. Tipping did NOT help at this bar. The best service was at the pool bar. The best bartender we had was Sergio at the pool bar in the platium area. (The Sergio we had was not the one that was killed in the explosion, we saw \"our Sergio\" before we got on the bus to leave at 2:30 p.m.) The kids club, sports lounge and entertainment staff were 1st rate all the way. There is a \"mini\" disco at 8:40 every night for the kids to go dance away their energy for a good night's sleep. All of the kids we were with looked forward to this every night. The food at the sports lounge is 24 hrs a day snack stuff, they serve a fantastic grilled ham and cheese. If you want to shop, go into Playa del Carmen, the merchants do come to the resort one night a week but save yourself the cash and go into town. While at the resort the prices were highly inflated and they didn't budge a whole lot on price. The beach on this resort is worth the long walk. Not a lot of getting bugged by sales people while on the beach which I love. They have merchants down there but they have their own stands so you go to them if you want something. They also have a great massage place right on the beach for $50.00 USD for an hour. Very reasonable and very good!! There are some rocks in the water but mostly when you just get in because there is a drop off and the broken coral kind of gets stuck there. We had a great time with the kids digging there for shells!! Overall, I would recommend this resort. I will not go back but that's from other reasons, memories that I don't want to return to when on holiday. I guess I would be concerned now about what else the resort has neglected to keep up. I don't know. P.S. If you go to Xplore (excursion) know that this is an amusement park. You are not going out to see real \"Mexico\". It is fun but not an authentic experience in the countryside.

The grounds were beautiful . The place was absolutely spotless. I am saddened to hear of the news of the explosion after being there less than 2 weeks ago. We stayed in a Junior Deluxe Suite. I wish we had gotten a swim out room. I do not have that youthful figure where I could sashay around in a bikini. Lots of beautiful bodies everywhere. The pool area was fun and where the action was. The swim up bar was fun. I couldn't believe all the alcoholic beverages available everywhere at any time. I liked the ice cream machine too. Nice to cool off with a swim and an ice cream. The down side of the stay was the beach was a major disappointment. I am used to beautiful beaches at Orange Beach Al and expected it to be better but the water was not as clear and almost murky. The vendors on the beach were a big turn off and obstructed the view of the ocean. I think they should ban all the vendors. Also the walk from the hotel room to the restaruant areas was way too far for an older lady like myself. They did have a tram to catch a ride but they did not come often enough. The walk was good for me though.. especially after all the calories I consumed. The staff was generally very nice but the wait at the restaurants was way too long and guess understaffed. The complimentary wine at the meals was TERRIBLE. We rented a car . I was afraid at first to drive but by the time I left I felt comfortable. I would NOT recommend our car rental place. AAA is not the Triple A place we all know. It was some hole in the wall scummy looking place. When we returned our car the office was closed and we almost missed our flight. Of course this car rental place was NOT associated with the hotel. When we checked into the hotel we were greeted with a mimosa. Check in and out was a pleasure. The shows that we saw weren't too great. I think more activiites and dancing and ways to include the quests so they can get to know each other would have made it more fun.

Platinum Pool areas are great. Thai Beach Club area was also lovely. Nothing stolen from our room and no suggestion of it from anybody there so dont fret over that. I had somethimg stolen from the beacj but I had left it unattended right next to the public beach area so I dont blame the staff. Pity the staff made it so very difficult to obtain a letter from hotel security to confirm I had reported the theft. I needed it for insurance purposes but the hotel (who told me they had to conduct a full investigation anyway) kept refusing to give me confirmation i had reported it. I got it in the end but having to make a complaint for this and every other problem ruined the holiday. But frankly if you dont complain nothing gets done. The buffet food was surprisingly good every time we went. Just as well because aside from Le Fleur which we enjoyed and the Miso all the food in the other resaurants was inedible. The Thai restaurant was closed, despite our Platinum deal saying we were entitled to use it. The bottles left as \"gifts\" in our room on arrival were half drunk already. Certainly no glass of champagne offered on arrival at the Platinum check in - in fact when I asked for it the desk guy shrugged and said \"if you want i can get you one\" - well yeah I did just ask didnt I so why are you making me ask again? The fussball tables were ALL broken and the pool tables had broken pockets. The pop corn machine in the sports bar only worked one night in 4. Room got made up and only one towel was left despite there being 4 of us. We mentioned it and then had people randomly kocking on the door at 7.30am or 9pm offering more towels. We heard our door being banged at about 1.30 am and then got woken by a call at 2.15am as security tol dus they had closed our door for us (I know it was left shut and why they called at that time instead of 9am I dont know). The jacuzzi was broken and could not be turned off. No problem really as a maintenance guy arrived within an hour to fix it - but then randomly knocked on our door 8 days later again at 7.30am to ask if it had been fixed yet - IT IS 7.30 IN THE MORNING: LET ME SLEEP PLEASE. Sun loungers really uncomfortable except in the Platinum Pool and Platinum Thai Beach Club area over to the right of the beach. The beer is cold and the coctails good. There is a $20 fine if you lose your room key - fine until the maid service decide to remove our second room key from inside our room whilst we were at the beach. Why? For our security the concierege desk told me. Ok so to improve my room safety you remove from inside the room the key that a non staff person would need to get into the room to steal my stuff? Must be a Mexican thing. The DVD library for a hotel with over 1500 rooms seemed to consist of 20 DVDs. No big deal as we didnt use them but they brag about it when there is nothing to it.

This hotel is GRAND in 2 ways - Firstly the scale - it is immense, built like a small village. It is 2 hotels in 1. Secondly the buildings - the hotel is a beautiful piece of modern architecture. Stunningly built and designed. The beach is superb, plenty of quiet spots, good bar service, and the front of the beach is so picturesque. The sea bed is rocky - but that is well publicised, and some beach shoes get over that problem. The middle section of the resort is sculpted around pool life. Plenty of light and shade, quiet spots, and what we referred to as the 'spring break' pool where the animation team work tirelessly all day to entertain people. The main buildings are very grand, well serviced, the shops are good too. Lots of bars and the main courtyard nearby - where the evening entertainment schedule plays out. Entertainment team and guest bands do a sterling job (but guys - make the schedule run for more than a week to avoid longer stays being repetetive). The rooms are large, fully featured and decadent, The beds were amazingly comfortable! and loved the Jacuzzi baths. It has many other features - and truly is a 5 star resort.........however..... A couple of things did niggle us through our stay. 1 - service is often very slow in the bars and restaurants at peak periods - you do not have enough waiters guys, and it lets down a fantastic resort. 2 - buffet food was sometimes cold as previously mentioned - the food quality and selection is very good, but turn up your hotplates! (the Sunset buffet is the better of the 2 to avoid the problems). By our second week we got used to going to dinner later to avoid packed buffets and queues (but then you miss some of the night time schedule outside) 3 - the charge of 20 USD for 1 hr of internet access is pure extortion - especially with a painfully slow connection.....in other hotels I've stayed in throughout the world free wifi in public areas is standard - and there is no excusing such hiked up charges if people want to check their e-mails/facebook etc on their iPhones or BBs 4 - the watersports facility is dubious, free usage was only allowed on certain days (no fluctuation in weather but they use it as an excuse to cancel the free 'non motorised' facilities, yet straight away offer you the paid for alternatives) - niggled us a lot when we wanted to use the hobby cats most days 5 - lastly the hotel is somewhat let down by some of its clientele. I did not go on holiday to constantly hear the VERY loud nonsensical conversations of large groups of Canadian tourists. It's a 5 * resort and sometimes people's behaviour was quite inappropriate. The guys around the 'spring break' pool were great and the younger people there were not to blame, but other groups thought it fine to swear and talk loudly all the time, and go to dinner in gym shorts and baseball caps. I'm no prude, but there is a place and time for some behaviour, if you cannot handle your drink - dont drink it! This is not the hotel's fault - they depend on all tourists, but some people need to think how their behaviour on their vacation may really annoy others and spoil theirs. This said we did have an amazing vacation, and would return to the hotel. Outside the resort I strongly recommend 'tulum extreme', 'swimming with dolphins', and of course 'coco bongo'.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brampton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWow, we will be back!

I will mention off the top that this was our 4th trip to Mexico the last 4 years and some may say this is a long review. We found this resort to be an excellent resort for the amount of money we paid to go. We booked a Jr. Suite room and I emailed the reservation desk twice advising that it was our 5th anniversary and I was looking for either a room upgrade or a special dinner on the beach but I did not receive a response prior to leaving, so when we arrived to the hotel I mentioned this and we were upgraded right away to a Jr. Suite Deluxe room with a apology from the front desk because they did not respond. We arrived prior to 3pm so we had to wait about an hour for our room keys so we just went to the buffet for lunch and had a drink at the bar until 3pm, then we got our keys and let the bellboy know our room number and we were off..it took about 7-8 mins to walk to our room from the lobby. Rooms Jr. Suite has a walk in shower, no bath tub. Jr. Suite Deluxe has a walk in shower and a Jacuzzi bathtub. Jr. Suite Deluxe with swim out (same as above but with steps to the pool from the balcony) did not see enough people using this for me to feel it necessary to pay the extra money for it. Platinum Rooms-same as Jr. Deluxe (with or without the swim-up) except that you get bottles of booze, no towel cards, 30 min massage, reserved area on the beach (just a roped off section of chairs beside the rest of the chairs at the beach, not secluded and private) and a concierge. We spoke to a few couples but cannot review this section as we did not have platinum rooms... I felt the room was nice and cleaned daily with new bed sheets and towels. The maid did a great job though sometimes our room was still not made up before 3pm but I didn\u2019t care I was at the pool almost every day until 6pm unless we had an al a carte dinner to get ready for. We stayed in room 6124, found it to be smack dab in the center of the resort-7mins to the lobby and restaurants and 7 mins to the beach but we had an outer facing view of the cleared land where the new section is going to be built from our balcony, again we didn\u2019t care as we were only in the room for a little while before bed! Beach It was pretty windy each day that we tried to go to the beach so the waves were a bit rough so I\u2019m really not sure how clear the water is, it seemed very shallow (maybe a sandbar) to us compared to other resorts. The sand is beautiful and soft on your toes! Water temperature was spot on perfection! We read a lot of reviews complaining of rocks but we could not find any until we walked past the resort beach area a few minutes, it is worth a walk to the boardwalk..stunning view! Pools Lots of quiet pools and a very large main activity pool and a few shallow pools for kids, water was really cold but refreshing in the 35c heat! We were quite surprised to see the pool was very empty until around 12pm..then the chairs started to fill up but there was still no need to reserve chairs as it was low season and hotel was only half full..not all pool bars were open during the week and some pools were closed for maintenance (workers were re-cementing and painting the edges of the pool) Lifeguards always present at the pool. Pools bars open until 6pm but you are welcome to stay at the pool until 8pm. Food All the restaurants are smoke free and air conditioned (except Thai). The food at the resort is top notch. I gained weight and was stuffed after every meal. The 2 Main Buffet\u2019s are excellent, many choices for the picky eaters. The Riviera side is green & the Sunset side is orange and are right next to each other. There are also 2 other lunch buffets (Negresco & La Tortuga) by the quiet pools that are Al \u00e0 cartes in the evening. The breakfast buffet is the same everyday and has everything you need to get your day started. The lunch buffet is fantastic I had chicken wings, tacos, nachos etc, or we would stop by the grill at the pool which made hamburgers and hotdogs from around 11am-5pm. Dinner at the buffet was also fantastic and a different theme each night, though we only ate at the buffet for dinner twice we felt it had a great variety and something for everyone. Now the Al \u00e0 carte restaurants are where you will find the best food & premium drinks and service. We ate at the Al \u00e0 carts 4 times and enjoyed each meal. We ate at Miso (Japanese) twice the La Vaqueria (Steakhouse) and Momma Mia (Italian) (See pictures and say Hi to Juan for us..he treated us so well on 3 of 4 dinners with a special surprise for our anniversary) There is also a La Hacienda (Mexican), La Fondue (Swiss), La Olas (Seafood) Le Fleur (International) & Thai Beach Club (Thai cuisine on the beach-not included in any room category) The Le Fleur & Miso are not included for the Jr. Suite room category unless you pay extra, (even if they upgrade your room to Jr. Suite Deluxe for free, you still have to pay) it\u2019s around $20 each. It is true that it is tricky to book your dinners, they have alternating restaurants at this time of year and you have to book them in advance, if you go after 3pm you can book for 4 days. We did not find you had to book 3 days in advance that others have talked about you just need to know what time to go to the desk. We arrived on a Sunday and ate Al \u00e0 carte on Monday. Bars There are 16 in total...I think, we did not get to drink in them all because it was low season and they had most of them closed. We enjoyed drinking at the Plaza Bar in between the main lobbies every night. They had a band or singer every evening and a pre show at 8pm (Fire shoe, fashion show, vendors etc) and the waitress\u2019 are quick and excellent. There is also a staff member that has a booth set up for Flaming Mayan coffee\u2019s, we enjoyed this every night and they also had the best cappuccinos\u2019 at the resort here in the Plaza. We also enjoyed the 24 hour sports bar. We would go for nachos, popcorn, burgers or hotdogs and watch the hockey game or football game or just catch the scores and play pool. The disco was great, never got too crowded and it is air conditioned and smoke free, with great music from 10:30-2am. The bar was never packed and the bartender was awesome. We noticed that unless you ask for your drink by brand you will get local alcohol so just specify you Captain Morgan or Smirnoff. My favourites included the Mango daiquiris and electric lemonades\u2019, bring your Bubba Keg or an insulated coffee mug as these melt fast in the heat. Animation Team This is the first time I am mentioning a animation team in a Trip Advisor review but the Princess team deserves the credit. They work so hard and they have 4 teams at the Princess, The Kids Club, Jr. Club, Teen club and the Fun team at the main pool and beach. They start bingo at 10am at the main pool and go all day entertaining with games and dancing and then they finish the night with the Show at 9:30pm in the Theatre, these are the best shows that we have seen in the Caribbean and we saw every show while we were there. Do Not Miss the Broadway show, excellent! Really good chorography and sets with beautiful costumes and they even have audience participation, I am married with Mr. Maracas Oct 15 2010. Participate in the games each day, you win prizes...we came home with 8 t-shirts from the gift shops and 2 hats. *Just a shout out to the Photo team as well, they did not harass you to have you photo taken with Boba the monkey or the 2 Parrots or the Iguana and did not harass you in the shop when you went to look at your photos at the end of the day. We found the picture quality excellent and the prices a lot cheaper than expected, we bought 2 photos Must-Do Take a day and go out to Playa Del Carmen, we found the best pricing on all the gifts you can get at the resort and more. We even made a trip to Wal-Mart and found it cheapest price for top notch Tequila. We have been to 5th avenue 4 times now and are very comfortable walking around. We now stop at Karen`s Grill & Pizzeria and grab a bite to eat every trip..wow great food & such a friendly fun staff. We did not do any day trips on the vacation but we have in the past and they are excellent and a great way to learn about the Mexican culture and the Mayan people. Do Not Forget I will not travel in the Caribbean without a Bubba keg for my drinks (a coffee travel mug also does the trick), they serve the drinks at the beach & pool in small plastic water cups and your frozen drinks melt I also always bring a variety of Ziploc bags, they come in handy for everything. We use them for snacks from the Buffets or sand or toiletries or gifts..unlimited uses. I also always bring my own dish soup so I can wash out or mugs or bathing suits in the sinks. Overview For us, we had a blast and a memorable 5th Anniversary on this trip and we would go back to Grand Princess Riviera in a heartbeat. Enjoy Mexico and pass on a Hola to all the great hard working staff...we never met a grump or someone who did not return a Hola without a smile! They work so hard and we found them to be very polite and accommodating to our requests. Please don\u2019t hesitate to email me for more pictures or information. **We are also posting this on Nov 14, 2010. There was a horrible explosion this morning at the Platinum Lobby and restaurant by the beach due to a natural gas explosion. 7 people died including 5 guests (4 of them Canadians (I\u2019m so sad to hear of the 9 year old boy and his father) and 2 staff members. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their families at this difficult time.

We had temperatures of about 30 degrees every day, and just a few light rain showers. We booked through Portland holidays as it worked out \u00a3100 cheaper per person compared to First Choice, however there was no difference in what we got for our money. When we arrived our transport to the hotel was waiting at the airport and dropped us at GRP in about 50 minutes. Check in at the hotel was organised and quick. As we travellled out of session the hotel was only about 60% full, consequentley we were upgraded to a Deluxe Junior Suite. When we arrived at our room the key card we had been given was not working, however a passing memeber of staff quickly radioed reception and someone was sent down to us to fix the problem within a few minutes. Our room was very spacious for two people, with a massive bed, sitting area, balconey, large bathroon with jacuzzi bath and separte shower. There was also a safe in the room which you programme with a pin number so it was very safe. We felt quite comfortable leaving money, passports, cameras and other electricals in there. You will be spoilt for choice of resturants at this resort. We eat in the al a carte restaurants 9 nights out of the 14 we stayed. These are lovely to eat in as the service and quality of food were great. Our favourites were the steakhouse (Valquenta) and the Thai (miso). In these resturants we had 3/4 course meals that would probably cost about \u00a330-40 per head at home, excluding drinks. The buffet was also of high quality and fantastic choice. For breakfast and lunch you will have loads of choice and never go hungry! There was also a daily BBQ near one of the larger pools that served burgers and hot dogs from about 11am - 5pm. The sports bar is open 24 hours where you can also get snacks like nachos, popcorn, burgers and chips. The drinks in the resort are very good. Just a tip, if you ask for a vodka and coke they will give you a local vodka, however if you ask for Smirnoff and coke they will give you Smirnoff. There is loads to choose from so just be specific when ordering. The cocktails and alcoholic coffee's were a personal fav! The staff at GRP were a real positive point. Everyone we came into contact with from our maid to the barmen, waiters and reception staff were extremley helpful and friendly. All the grounds in the resort are kept immaculate. All the pools and pathways were always clean and tidy, and the beach was also very beautiful. On the beach you can rent any non-motorised equipment free for an hour a day. There is always some sport/game/entertainment going on that you can join in with if that's your thing. Evening entertainment was good, but repeated every week so if you stay for two weeks expect to see the same shows. We went into Playa del carmen twice, once in the day, and once again in the evening for a meal out of the resort. I would recommend this as it was a lovely experience and not expensive. We had dinner right on the beach one evening at a bar called Fusion. Our meals and a few beers came to about \u00a345 USD. A taxi back to the GRP cost approx 150 pesos (\u00a36-7). We also booked two excersions - one with first choice to Tulum and Xel-Ha, and the other with best day travel to Cozumel Island. I would reommend getting out to see some of Mexico as everywhere we went was so interesting and beautiful. The Mexican people were also great - very friendly and helpful. Overall we had a wonderful relaxing holiday in a beautiful part of the world!

Ask for all the do\u2019s/don\u2019ts, what\u2019s allowed/what\u2019s not. My daughter suffered the indignity of having total strangers viewing & photographing her and her husband\u2019s vows in the public lobby bar instead of what was to have been their private ceremony on the beach. You can imagine our distress when we became aware that our beautiful room at the Platinum level made it impossible to have anyone from the wedding group to our rooms if they themselves were not in that same category of room. Our hopes for hosting a small cocktail party were quickly dashed! And to top it off, even our other daughter and her fianc\u00e9 who live in a different city than we do was unable to visit us in our room. Our ideal vacation that was to allow us to combine the wedding of our first born with quality family time was not possible! The restaurant reservation system was difficult requiring guests to make reservations days in advance for the \u2018a la carte\u2019 restaurants. We eventually figured out the \u2018process\u2019 and realized that the resort was minimizing the cost of the \u2018a la carte\u2019 restaurants while encouraging guests to use the buffets only. Again, we were not allowed to make reservations for non Platinum level guests and as a result were unable to enjoy a non buffet meal with many of our friends from across Canada who had travelled to our daughter\u2019s wedding with hopes of being able to visit with our family. Once we were onsite, the Concierge in the Platinum lounge was very quick to alert us to the fact that the private club atmosphere of our room at the resort was not conducive to a group gathering. In addition, the telephone system did not allow easy communication within a large group. We spent a lot of energy during the course of our 10 day vacation trying to connect with the other 52 people attending our daughter\u2019s wedding. Notes under the door became the common practice! We would not have been so hasty to book the Platinum level which appeared to offer so much more for a reasonable incremental cost had we had any idea how it worked and the numerous \u2018rules\u2019 that we were expected to abide by. And regrettably, we paid extra to take advantage of many additional amenities including the private pool and the lounge that we were unable to utilize. Spending time with our guests was more important to us in the final analysis. In my view, this is basic information that should be readily available to anyone contemplating Platinum. The room categories should be reviewed, understood and a decision as to the price point and additional services required prior to the time of making the deposit. The best accommodation for making the wedding group accessible to each other should be clearly communicated. I am hopeful that as a result of my documenting our learnings that other families will not experience the same disappointment with this venue as we did. And a final piece of advice...Grand Riviera Princess has NO idea what good Customer Service is all about. Once you're there, you're expected to abide by 'the rules' as restrictive as they are. Oh and one final word, stocked daily means they will replenish your fridge with a maximum 2 cans of beer...if you have 2 in it, you won't get any more!", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cAwesome, Really big and loads of fun!\u201d", "Author": "Kimaroo", "ReviewID": "UR86681408", "Content": "We travelled to the Grand Riviera Princess from Oct.27-Nov 3/10.

Our bags were delivered with 15 min. to our room. This is a very large resort,so be prepared to do alot of walking. We were able to find a room fairly easily but had to really pay attention to the signs. Our room was very clean and spacious for a family of 4. The room was cleaned daily and usually was done by midafternoon. We never had any issues of theft, we used our safe for any valuables we had. Our mini fridge was restocked daily and we nevr had to ask for anything extra. The grounds of the resort are simply beautiful and very well looked after. There was always someone cleaning up and picking up after guests. The pools were all very clean and well looked after. The food was fantastic, there was always a huge selection of food and it was very well looked after. The a la Cartes restaurants were great, our favourite was the steak house. The t-bone was amazing. We had to wait awhile for our food but the delicious steak made up for the wait. our Waiter kept us happy by bringing us buns and drinks and making us laugh! the kids favourite restaurant was the Mexican, it was very good! The beach was the only disappointment for us. We found it strange that all the huts that sell things and the massage hut were taking up the best real estate. The lounge chairs were all behind the huts, so when your laying on your chair your view is of the vendors!! You had the option of renting a lounge chair for the day, but we said no way we paid enough to be here we aren't paying a penny more! the entertainment staff are amazing, they keep you laughing at the party pool all day! the shows in the evening were also great! The resort offers a free shuttle into Playa del Carmen. they take you in at 12pm and return you for 6pm. We found this to be a long day in the hot sun for the kids, so we decided to take a cab in.

Once there, check in was minutes, grab a quick one at the bar and off to our beautiful room above the swim-up rooms overlooking the pool. I have to mention that the walks were great (some people complain about the largeness of the resort) with one of the most gorgeosly manicured grounds I have ever seen. The room was great, 2 nice beds (our children are 9 and 11), double sinks, stocked fridge, double shower, jacuzzi, and nice balcony. The beach is very nice....yes, some rocks but not water shoes needed. The sand is very white and soft and the water turqoise blue. The only complaint is that some locals set up shops/huts in prime beach real estate areas....oh well....have a few drinks via the beach bar or waiter service and relax and you will get past that small inconvenience. The pools are beautiful and many of them; with swim up bars in all.....plenty of room/chairs/palapas at both beach and pools. The food at the buffets was always enjoyable.....neither my family and our friends (also brought their children and also aged 9 and 11) had any complaints. We tried most of the a-la-cartes....mexican very good, italian very good, steak very good (we all loved the t-bone), asian very good, la fondue very good.....drinks all over the resort very good. The 24 hr sports bar was excellent....food, games, tv's, drinks and atmosphere. The animation team was by far.....the best that we have ever seen....especially in the party pool during the day.....EXCELLENT and we were all very impressed.

This year we decided on the Grand Riviera Princess in Mexico. We book threw SellOffVacations.com, had used them before with no real problem. After figuring out what side of the resort to book, Sunset or Riviera we ended up booking the Riviera. I was a little confused as to why the Riviera side was more money then the Sunset side when the website basically said they were identical! After booking SellOffVacations called us (several times) and said even though we booked the Riviera said we would be staying on the Sunset side due to renovations that were taking place in the Riviera lobby and rooms. Okay, no big deal, since both sides are the same I thought. Air Canada: Flew with Air Canada, usually fly with Sun Wing, no real problems. Air Canada was fine, but Sunwng includes thing like free meals, ear phones and wine well on the plane and Air Canada does not. Flight arrived on time and were picked up from the airport within 15 minutes. Check In: When we were dropped off at the Resort, we were dropped off on the Riviera side. To my surprise, there were no renovations going on. Check in went smooth, we booked a swim out room. When we asked why we were told we would be on the sunset side and ended up on the Riviera side due to renovations, the people at the resort seemed to have no clue about these \"renovations\" that were taking place. We were a little early but told our room was ready and were given a map of the resort and were sent off to find out room. Our luggage was dropped off by a bell boy within 30 minutes. Grounds: Beautiful is what they are. There are always people doing something around the resort. Remember this is an extremely large resort, but the staff seemed to always keep it looking great! Room: Swim out room was great! Loved it, if I could book a swim out room at every resort I would! The bed was not that \"hard\" as some people described it. The shower did not \"leak\" as others said. Our in room safe was fine, no theft! And the room did not smell! Remember you are down south, so you towels will never really dry and this like that, its like that no matter where you go. Restaurants: Went to a few a la cartes. The Italian was great, loved the food. Tried Fondue, our reservation was for 6:30 and did not see the main course until after 8pm. I mean if your looking to relax and have a romantic dinner, or stay for hour talking its fine, really. But if your hungry be prepared to wait. The buffets were great, no matter what you like Im sure you can find it there. Activities: Did a few day trips, went to Coba and had a lot of fun. Tried para-sailing on the beach, not as scary as you would think. House Keeping: Great, no real complaints. Only the last day there they seemed to forget about our room. Went to the front desk around 6pm on our way out to town. Explained our room was never made up. They said someone would be out right away to clean it. Came back around 10pm only to find our room was never made up. Still had no clean towels to even take a shower. Called down, to the front desk, re-explained our situation. Were given no explanation but were told someone would bring us towels right away. 1.5 hours later the towels arrived. Over all: Take the small things with the grain of salt. Did I enjoy my holiday? Yes I loved it! Just dont let the small things bother you. The beach is great, pools are great, people are wonderful! Would I recommend this resort? Yes, and would still go back in a heart beat!", "Date": "November 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely loved everything about this resort.\u201d", "Author": "firsttimer81", "ReviewID": "UR85854139", "Content": "ok i will try to make this as detailed as i can. We Stayed at Grand Riviera Princess, platinum side from October 24th, 2010 to October 31st. Absolutely loved it. It was our first time staying at a resort, and it exceeded our expectations. We went with an open mind, determined to have fun and not stress over anything - and that's basically how everyone should travel. At the airport, as you are preparing to exit - you will be approached by many people asking which airline you came with. they might even claim to be from that line. The actual person awaiting your arrival will be outside holding a sign, anyone else at the airport is trying to sell you timeshares - just be firm and make your way outside. You will then get on a bus or as in our case, a van with a few other guests as well. The drive to the resort is about half an hour. We checked in at about 4. Platinum people get a special shuttle, as the rooms are located all the way at the end of the resort, close to the beach. I've seen many non platinum people get on the shuttle as well, and the driver doesn't mind stopping in the middle for you. The overall look of the resort is breathtaking. It's extremely grand and looks like it goes on for miles. The grounds are well kept, you will always see a gardner working throughout the day to keep the place beautiful. the staff, waiters, everyone was so incredibly friendly and helpful. never had complaints. I also strongly recommend upgrading to platinum - so worth it. The platinum lounge is also very nice and tastefully decorated. There are 4 computers there for the use of platinum guests. We brought out laptop, and with a 20$ deposit, were able to borrow the wire directly to our laptop. No wifi at the hotel, although no complaint there - it's a vacation, spent very little time on the computer. I actually saw a lady on Farmville - which was pretty sad. The actual room is beautiful, very modern looking. I loved the bathroom. his and her sinks, jacuzi in the bathroom, and one on the balcony. some people complained that the water from the shower leaks out on the floor - no such problems with us. There is an alarm clock/dvd player, iron, ironing board, fridge full of drinks, complimentary bottles of alcohol, and a fruit basket waiting for us. the room was always kept clean for us. there are many pools at this resort, platinum guests had their own pool which was nice. pool beds, and lounge chairs were usually always available. the beach was less than a 5minute walk from our place - so i think that's why the platinum pool was not too full. there is a main party pool, which always had the most people, music was always playing and many activities were going on. water polo, water aerobics, rifle shooting, archery, dance classes, and bingo. this pool also had the swim up bar. the beach was beautiful. white sand, blue/green water. i had read some reviews saying the water was brown in places, i had never seen that. yes the beach is a little rocky, but its a natural beach - relax. the waves are great, had alot of fun. the platinum guests have their own private section where it was very quiet and relaxing. private bartender as well. they don't disturb you if you are lounging around, but if they see you looking around for someone, they will be there. some people don't know, but the platinum guests are also allowed to order breakfast/lunch from an a la carte menu. they don't need to always eat from the buffet. this was a nice change, as i think with any buffet, 7 days can get tiresome. the steak and red snapper is excellent from the menu. There is a large variety of food at the buffet. Our concierge booked the a la carte restaurants for us for the whole week. Which ofcours, we got to pick. our favorites were Miso (japanese), La Fleur (international), Vaqueria Grill. Many people had positive things to say about the seafood restaurant, which we hated. Didn't try the fondue place, neither the mexican or italian. We also had a special iffet dinner provided to platinum and villa guests. It was nothing special, normal buffet. the evening 8:00 entertainment was enjoyable, the theatre entertainment was average.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cWedding at the Grand Riviera was AMAZING\u201d", "Author": "psuedo", "ReviewID": "UR85831171", "Content": "I just came back from the Princess Riviera with 50 of my wedding guests and we loved it.

From the outset, there was a complete lack of information provided. Numerous emails were sent months in advance as we attempted to plan this extremely important event. We were seeking detailed information as to pricing and \u2018the process\u2019 by which weddings occur. At best, what we received in explanation was always minimal and never detailed enough to answer all of our questions. Ours was not the first wedding held at the resort and as a result, we believe that a complete package of information outlining the options and specific details should be readily available to all prospective bridal couples including the revised venue for inclement weather conditions. We continually felt that we had to pester and plead for every piece of information while giving ample opportunity for the wedding planners to communicate with us by providing phone numbers and other contact information in all our correspondence. We were not told when our appointment with the wedding planner was and in fact had to seek out the wedding department as we had heard nothing a few days before our actual wedding. By us seeking out the information we were told we had a meeting with Sandra on Friday at 10:00 a.m. This was news to us as we had not been contacted previously. When we arrived for the 10:00 a.m. meeting, an office move was in progress and we were asked to come back the following day at 10:00 a.m. A note under our door in the absence of a proper inter-room telephone communication system would have been the polite way to handle this situation. Instead, we had to use our limited vacation time to arrange the details of our wedding that we had been trying to arrange for over 5 months rather than enjoying the amenities of the resort. The one piece of information that we were aware of was the start time of the wedding at 4:00 p.m. At our first meeting with Sandra at the resort, we were informed that the bride walked down the aisle at 4:00 pm. Given the lack of inter-resort communication, this important detail had already been communicated to all guests in the form of a written itinerary. No aid was offered by the wedding coordinator to ensure that all 52 guests were contacted and advised of the time change. Guests were not called to let them know of the changes of the wedding ceremony and reception locations due to the tropical rainstorm that occurred on the day of our wedding. We did that ourselves and at a time when we had other things to attend to. It was assumed that guests would call the concierge however when approached and asked for details, they had no knowledge of the location of the wedding or correct time. Also during our first meeting with Sandra we had discovered that the Platinum suite we were staying in had strict guidelines to the guests allowed in the building. If you weren't Platinum, you weren't allowed in. We understood the reasoning, but no where was this information given until you arrived at the resort. This would have been nice to know as we would have stayed elsewhere in the resort. We discussed with Sandra that our room being so close to the original ceremony site we had planned for all preparation for myself and bridesmaids to take place in our room (5219) along with our photographer and hair stylist (all who were non Platinum guests). We were told that this would not be a problem and Sandra would take care of this detail and they would make an exception as it was for our wedding. This information was never relayed to anyone working in the Platinum lounge. And when the group of bridesmaids, hair stylist and photographer made their way to our room they were rudely stopped in their tracks and told that security would be called to have them removed. Flowers form an integral part of any wedding ceremony including photos with various family members prior to the ceremony. In our case, we had our 2 grandmothers (aged 89 and 82 yrs) in attendance and would have appreciated the traditional picture of the pinning of their corsages. However, this was not feasible as the flowers arrived at the bride\u2019s room late and 10 minutes before the bridal party was to leave on the golf cart (3:40 as opposed to 3:00 as it stated on the itinerary presented to us by Sandra). In addition, the flowers were of inferior quality, were falling apart and drooping. We questioned Sandra about the flowers and she immediately passed the blame to the bell boy or whoever delivered them. How they managed to appear in this condition is of no consequence to us. They were ordered and paid for and should have been beautiful and available to us in a timely manner. Thankfully, a friend from Cozumel saved the day and showed up with the most magnificent bouquets and boutonnieres! I would highly recommend not using the resort flowers! They were awful and so ugly! The lack of communication we had experienced leading up to the wedding was continued throughout and was extremely frustrating. We were always the ones calling and even those calls the afternoon of the wedding day when the alternate site plans were not clear were ignored by Sandra. Simple things went awry \u2013 the groom had to re-start the music with the correct song, the cue to start the processional was aborted causing a bridesmaid to stand by herself waiting anxiously for the rest of the wedding party and eventually returning herself to \u2018do it again\u2019 and the aisle was not wide enough for 2 when in fact there were 3 trying to navigate the space. Many of the issues could have been avoided had there been upfront and unhurried communication. After all, we paid thousands of dollars to have a spectacular Mexican wedding. With the advent of foul weather, we understood that we would be unable to have our wedding ceremony and reception on the beach. We had discussed the \u201cPlan B\u201d option with Sandra and that the substitute ceremony location would be a closed off area of the main lobby bar on the Riviera side. The area looked perfect based on the pictures shown to us. We agreed based upon those pictures and our assumption/understanding that the designated area would be private as this was the only option given to us. However when our photographer and assistant made their way to the ceremony area at 3:15 p.m., 30 minutes early to set up some lights, the area was full of a large group playing bingo. When the concierge was questioned as to where the wedding was happening, he pointed towards the bingo group and said the ceremony would happen at 5:00 pm where they're playing bingo. As previously stated, we had been told the bride was to be walking down the aisle at 4 and the groomsmen were supposed to be standing there waiting at 3:30. Our photographer had to convince the concierge that the bingo playing people had to be moved. When we questioned Sandra about the ceremony site, she simply stated that \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be here if you had your perfect day on the beach, we can\u2019t control the weather\u201d. We had long accepted the weather as an uncontrollable issue. However, we do blame the resort for making this unforeseen situation even more difficult by their lack of caring and again extremely poor customer service. It is clear to us that they are not set up to handle a \u2018perfect wedding\u2019 if the weather is bad. We were not asked where we wanted to get married under the Plan B option. Instead we were blamed for having such a big group. Surely a resort of their size would have more suitable premises (Platinum Lounge, Piano Bar, a Hallway even!) for such an important and solemn event. Instead, the processional was along the lobby bar with patrons turned on their barstools watching me and my parents. There are very few photographs that show a beautiful Mexican backdrop for the ceremony. Most show vacationers sitting in the lobby bar and gawking at us - total strangers \u2013 and worse yet, taking our photos and videos. We had planned to have our ceremony completed by 4:30 p.m. allowing for 1.5 hours of photographs prior to the start of the banquet. As a result of the delays described above, we had 45 minutes to take these once in a life time photos. Regrettably, we failed to get all the shots we had wanted (including the signature bride and groom portrait) as there was simply not enough time. This was through no fault of our own. We paid $3000 US to bring an amazing photographer to the resort and failed to utilize him to his full potential (he was a photographer not a wedding organizer). There was NO element of privacy and in fact we felt completely on display to all of these people we did not know. The post ceremony photographs were also compromised as the bar patrons were in the way and did not voluntarily move. It was very uncomfortable and definitely not what we had imagined our wedding would be like. Even on the beach, we would have had random people in the photos however they would at least have been distanced from us and not in our faces! My mother also determined that we had been given the wrong name for the banquet hall (Hivaljo) and was finally given the correct information at 5:45 pm when the reception was to start at 6:00 pm. Despite all the hard work that the reception staff went through to make up for the disappointing ceremony the issues did not seem to stop. The reception halls were amazing with large vaulted ceilings and chandeliers. Unfortunately, adjacent to the chandeliers there were two dangling projectors 15 ft from the ceiling that made the room and all of our photographs appear tacky. A person\u2019s eye is automatically drawn to the un-retracted projectors making the photos of this amazing banquet room unusable. The head table was about 6 ft too short for the 10 people in the wedding party (a detail that was made known ahead of time to the wedding planners.) We were shoulder to shoulder with barely enough room to eat. As well, the back drop was that of a fire extinguisher and exit signs \u2013 again not a fitting scene for our Mexican wedding! The buffet set up had a better back drop than the head table. The reception staff was very attentive to our needs however at times they were too attentive. The groom, when questioned how everything was going, simply stated \u201cdinner was amazing however the ceremony was quite rocky.\u201d The staff then proceeded to question the groom for details at a time when the groom\u2019s only concern was to have fun and attempt to enjoy the rest of the evening. The DJ appeared to be slightly aggravated from the outset. He was standoffish when approached by the best man about a microphone for speeches and overall was not easily approachable. It seemed whenever someone asked him to play a song off of our playlist he didn\u2019t seem very happy about it, it was like we were inconveniencing him. There were some major sound quality issues, severe enough to the point where people could not understand due to the halls acoustics. In summary, we brought revenue of approximately $35,000 US (excluding airfare) to the resort and surrounding area, we paid $6,300 US for a beach wedding for which there was no acceptable Plan B alternative for inclement weather and we suffered much unnecessary tension and stress due to the resort\u2019s lack of professionalism and all this on what should have been a relaxing start to our lifelong marriage. All in all, we tried to give the resort and wedding planners a proper amount of time to apologize. We sent in all the information as they had asked for our comments and after many many emails from August until now, November 1st, 2010 - it was apparent that this resort does not care about their customers and all they see are dollar signs when people choose their resort for a wedding. They completely take advantage of tourists and charge you for every little detail for your wedding - and their product and service are not at all the quality you would expect with the expensive price you pay. All we wanted was an apology and all we received was empty promises of compensation and that they were \"working on it.\" We finally heard from West Jet Vacations that the resort was not planning on doing anything for us. West Jet is a wonderful company who actually care about their customers and felt horrible about our experience. They gave us a generous credit towards future travel and apologized countless times, even though it was not at all their fault!

I just don't vent on TA, I believe I'm pretty well traveled and I'm very fair. This was a trip with myself, partner and two other couples. This is a MEGA resort, its HUGE let me say that again its HUGE. Its a walk pretty much any where you went. We had a swim-up room and it was very well appointed, after checking in and found where our room was located, we did try to get a room switch because our room was located right outside of the \"party pool\" so from 11am -5pm it was constant loud music and drinking games. I'm beyond that point in my life and was disappointed when they refused to move us. We even said we would pay extra to get the \"platinum\" but again they refused. We booked via expedia and they said we had to contact expedia because from what I understand the travel sites buy blocks of rooms so if you book through them you're their customer not the resorts (I felt they were just passing the buck) that was the only issue. Finally we just decided to be happy with the room and make the most of it. As I stated the room is nice, its new and was cleaned well every day. I as an American am very accustom to tipping for good service and I can say it does go a long way here. Everyday we had towel animals ( I know not great, but its fun to see what you get) and the room was spotless. I started with $5 the first day and $2 every day after. I also left $2 in the fridge with a list of what I wanted. EVERY DAY I had a FILLED fridge with everything I asked for. The guys next to us got 2 beers and a couple of sodas and that was it. (it does pay to tip) Also at the bars when theres a long line, just hold up a couple of dollars they will remember you and go right to you for your drink order. Also at dinner if you return to the same restaurant they'll remember you. The food was good, it was a little bland but when you're trying to cook for 1000's of people I understand trying to keep it right in the middle. We went to every restaurant, and the asian twice. I really liked the sushi, so did everyone I was with. ( I read one review, where a guest left candy as a tip. These people only make like $15/day and are feeding families, they cant on M&M's) The pools were nice, very clean as I stated we had a pool room so all we did was have to walk out our door, also the waitress came over to take drink orders (it rocked). I can say the beach sucked. It was small and had a great deal of chairs but wIth most resorts, guests played the towel game. (they get up early and save chairs with towels or shoes) I've been to enough resorts and don't play those games. When we couldn't find chairs we just moved the towels, no issue. I'd like to state a towel and sandal does not represent you! I just wish more people would do as I did, and not let these people get away with it. Nonetheless you can play if if you choose. The crowd was a mix of single couples and families. I would say that 70% of the people were from Canada I'm would assume they must do a great deal of advertising there but we met very few from the US. The club was ok, the shows are ok nothing special but gives you something to do at night. Coffee in the \"la Plaza\" is the best. We went every night.

Firstly we were put in the sister Hotel (Riviera Princess) but after you haved walked around this complex you realise it is all one with 2 seperate lobbies which makes it all part of the same hotel. They do spend an awful lot of time tending the large gardens - usually 20 or so people always trimming and cutting plants and sweeping up. The rooms were nice but they do not like to give you more than 1 bar of soap and one bottle of hair shampoo and even that was not given every day, but these are just the little things you like and expect if it were a 5 star hotel. Rooms were kept clean and sheets were changed when we asked for them to be - towels were changed daily The food was good and the write ups say you would be really fussy if you could not find something to eat but on the other hand it was nearly always luke warm or cold but there was plenty to choose from and you could ask the chef to warm it up on her hot plate - but then it is not the same is it. Drinks were good but again half the bars (and resturants) were closed as they were painting the place - swim up bars were open well 2 out of the 3 were but the pools were not heated and the water was freezing even though it was at least 27 to 29 degrees in the sunshine - if you do go to the special themed resturants then expext the same food as downstairs but you get it served to you by a waiter the only good one is the steak resturant - the \"T\" boned stake is very good but you need to get up at 7am to book them as they fill very quickly and by 10am each day they were fully booked so we only managed to get to 3 out of all of them and we were only allowed to book 3 days in advance (the Japanees and the Mexican were the other 2) again nothing special. Entertainment - not really sure how to put this but I suppose crap would be a fair report - it was good in so far as the coreography was concerned - they did the show \"Grease\" but they only mimed to John Travolta and Olivia Newton John and the same was done all week at other shows (but we gave them a miss after listening at the door) plus it was done in a thearter on hard wood chairs - not much for the entertainment as it was all mimed except when they had a fashion show (why the hell would you want to go to watch a fashion show on holiday?) but some did go - not many. they did have some early shows in the main quadrangle fire eater/dancers and mexican bands etc which was not bad Do wait for a special coffee with brandy etc as these are lovely (one highlight of the holiday) The pool enternment was good but the music was a little loud at times but the good thing is that you can walk a little further down the complex to another pool (still freezing) and not hear the music. The beach was nice but not kept as clean as other Hotels we have stayed in and we believe they had a leak from a sewer pipe right on the beach outside the hotel (brown clouds of something comming out into the sea - but again some people seem to be oblivious to what this may have been - we just walked up the beach a way and went in the sea there as it was warmer than the pools. One last thing that we did not like was that the hotel was only half full with half of these being French Canadian,s - we go to America every year and like the Americans but these people are obnoxious rude and think they own the place. All in all if you read this writeup then I would have to say it was not a bad holiday just no where near as good as the Rui Yukatan that we stayed in last year the other side of Playa Del Carmen (we thought that was very good value for money) in fact we are thinking of returning to the Rui Palace next year. My Advice is this is a more than fair write up of our experience you pay your money you will think the same, ho and by the way we flew with Thomsons/First choice premium - must say not as good as Virgin but then it is \u00a3100 cheaper on the way back they lost our plane somewhere and had to send us one without premium seating or premium food/or priority check etc,etc so you have been warned (this happened 2 weeks previously so we were told looks like it does not matter once you have had your holiday) not impressed!", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "grays essex", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "heatherharris", "ReviewID": "UR84630666", "Content": "first niggly points food was only warm in buffet restaurants plates were always cold which quickly made the warm food cold, plastic glasses in plazza bar and lobby bar. you expect at beach/pool bars but not at all other bars.theme restaurants lacked any real atmosphere could do with making, look more like they were supposed to be ie italian also we brits like a cup of tea in morning but no tea bags or milk in room. only coffee now the good points great hotel very very clean ,great bedroom lovely grounds, great pools, fantastic beach ,water was blue and very warm you could go out 50foot and it was still only upto your waist", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA must visit hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mekimme", "ReviewID": "UR84466407", "Content": "This hotel was amazing very clean, beautiful gardens, so ignore all the negative comments, the only let down was the loud rude americans and canadians!!", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincolnshire", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Place, great staff, Very Informative Holiday Rep\u201d", "Author": "Arbonne_9", "ReviewID": "UR84418201", "Content": "My husband and I have just come back from the Grand Rivieria Princess, Rivieria Maya and it was absolutely brilliant.

First week we stayed at Now Jade Riviera Resort and Spa, look it up... PERFECT!! Now on to the pros and cons of Princess. Cons: Let's start off with their greeting. When you book a PLATINUM Suite you are supposed to have a special check-in area, a warm towel and a glass of champagne all waiting for you. When our taxi dropped us off, we got \"your room isn't ready\", no champagne, the \"special\" check-in area is a special rug that says \"Platinum Check-In Only\", I didn't even ask about the warm towel, after getting checked-in the front desk clerk says \"o yes, you want something to drink?\" Once we did get into our room, I looked at my husband of 3 days, which had 2 double beds. I booked in January for a KING bed suite... JANUARY! I called our concierge, supposedly he is there for U - the customer, I said \"I think there has been some type of mistake with our room, we have two double beds, and it's our honeymoon\" I kinda laughed thinking he would say something like \"o your right, we'll make it right\", instead he says \"when you book, the room type is not guaranteed\".. When you book and book a King room you would expect a KING bed. He basically said we're going to push them together for you and that's what your going to have to deal with! My husband tried to talk to him as well with no change. I finally walked down to his desk in the Platinum lobby and talked to him face to face, taking with me our reservation sheet showing where we are supposed to have a King. He then tells me that it's only a special request, not a guarantee. At this point I was getting mad, and when I get mad I tear up, he saw that and FINALLY took some action. He tells me that he will put us on a waiting list for the following day and TRY to move us. The result ended with us moving the next day. Beds: HORRIBLE, unless you like to sleep on a rock, then you may like it?? Did I mention the room with the double beds had a used ashtray inside the room (which smelled like someone had just been smoking inside the room) and the bathtub outside was filthy! Maids: Don't be naked around the time they come. They barely knock and then just put their card in and come right on in. Actually it's all the people that have a key to your room... Watch out! Restaurants: with the Platinum bracelet you are supposed to get an \"a la carte Breakfast and Lunch service in the Buffet restaurants near the Platinum Lounge\" (per their website) um I don't know exactly what they are talking about bc there was only 1 BUFFET open for Platinum members and the food sucked! It was only buffet, it didn't have anything a la carte. There were 2 restaurants that were OK which was the Grill - T-bone was pretty good and the Japanese hibachi grill (another thing, if your concierge reserves you the hibachi grill for just the 2 of you, they don't take hibachi for just 2 people, you can only have a table). Waiting staff: if you tip their great, if not, don't expect good service! Cable: went out maybe 3 times - that was while we were in the room... Which wasn't very often. Room service: order something they can't screw up, like a hamburger.. The chicken nuggets are like a mixture of chicken leftovers and hot dog leftovers and maybe some other type of beef substance?? EWW Entertainment staff/Activities: Everyday is the SAME thing!!! They don't even have to change their schedule board... Beach: all the beaches down in the Riviera Maya are beautiful, some are better than others. Don't plan on snorkeling! It's kinda murky, you can't see your feet or anything. At our first hotel just 10 mins away I could! Chairs: the beach chairs were SO incredibly uncomfortable Trolley: be prepared to walk and walk and walk.... And the so-called trolley, it is supposed to come every 15 mins, but it barely could make it every 30 mins. Disco: never anyone there, doesn't have anyone there after 12 am. If you really want to dance your butt off, go to Coco Bongo. Private Area: it wasn't open the entire time, sometimes they wouldn't put the cushions down so you would be basically on the wood. There are two different types of chairs one in the Platinum are and then in the public pool/beach area. Location: from the main highway to the entrance of the resort was a bit far. Most people could just hop on the bus and get into Playa Del Carmen for .50 cents, not us.... Taxi only!!! Which will cost you $16.. Ok.... On to the Pros: It was beautiful grounds, beautiful!!! Room was nice. Bathtub outside was pretty cool. And that's all I have that was good! Honestly spend your money somewhere else like Now Jade Riviera....

I've been to Mexico three times now (the other two times were in Cancun), and this is the only trip that has made me want to return. I highly recommend upgrading to the platinum suites. It is a fairly cheap upgrade, but the benefits are amazing. Platinum guests get a private lounge with internet access (slow, but you are on vacation and shouldn't be on a computer all day!), bar, and concierge. There is also a platinum pool that is just heavenly. It's very quiet and is surrounded by thick, cushioned lounge chairs, and lounge beds under thatched roof huts. A waitress comes out to take your drink orders poolside, and the lounge has breakfast and snacks available all day. Platinum members also get a private section of the beach (again, with a waiter who comes around to provide drinks). I've read other reviews that complained about towel access at the beach and pools. Platinum guests have unlimited access to towels and you never have to return them. Also, the platinum section is on the beach, so your room is literally seconds away. No walking through half of the resort (which is enormous). PROS: Service: The staff works HARD to make sure guests have a good time. Everyone is very friendly (Raul at the platinum bar is excellent)! Lots of smiles and Holas! Food Variety: There is something for everyone. The breakfast buffet was very good and had pretty much everything you can imagine. The lunch buffet was good as well, and I really enjoyed the poolside grill where they grill burgers and hotdogs in the afternoon. There are a number of a la carte restaurants. Le Fluer (international gourmet) was pretty terrible, but La Hacienda (Mexican) and the Miso hibachi were both pretty good. The platinum lounge always had little sandwiches, chips and salsa, fruit, and desserts set out. The Sports bar serves burgers, fries, and nachos 24 hours a day. You will not go hungry here! Grounds: The resort itself is absolutely gorgeous. Just gorgeous. Marble everywhere - even in the beachside bathrooms. The main walkway is surrounded by a lagoon that has thatched roof cabanas with little seating areas to enjoy a drink, read a book, or just relax. The staff is always cleaning and the place is immaculate. The resort is VERY large, but a tram will drive you around. It's about a ten minute walk from the lobby to the beach. We walked all over unless we had on heels. Beach: We were struck by how easy it was to get a lounge chair pretty much anywhere you wanted. We got down to the beach around 10am our first day and were afraid everything would be taken already. The platinum section was empty except for two other people! There are a ton of covered lounges for those who do not want to sit in direct sun. The beach itself is absolutely gorgeous as is the water. I never once noticed the brown spots or the sewage smell others have complained of, and we arrived the day of Hurricane Paula! Spa: The spa is a little pricey, but I had a wonderful 50 minute massage. Platinum guests get a free 30 minute massage that can be upgraded for a longer session. Overall Experience: It was such a wonderful few days, and I wish I could have stayed longer. The weather was absolutely beautiful, the staff was friendly, and the biggest decision I had to make on a daily basis was whether to start out at the beach or the pool! Would go back in a heartbeat. The staff is excellent. Absolutely NO worries about theft. We kept everything in the safe and set the code ourselves. I left my blackberry and kindle out a couple of times with no problems. We even left housekeeping a tip on the refrigerator the first morning, and they didn't take it! No crowds: Granted, we went in the off-season and nearly had a hurricane derail our trip, but the crowds were non-existent. Easy to get lounge chairs, easy to make spa and restaurant appointments, and we never experienced a line of more than 5 people. CONS: Food quality: Breakfast and lunch were both good. I usually had cereal, an omelet and fruit for breakfast and burgers or salad for lunch, but the food is not five-star quality (it usually isn't at all-inclusive resorts where the goal is to provide a lot of food for a lot of people). The wine is pretty bad as well. Restaurants/time of year: Since we went in the off-season, some restaurants were closed on certain nights and we weren't able to get all of the reservations we wanted. Also, platinum members are supposed to get a special dinner at the Thai Beach Club, but it was closed during off-season. Instead, the platinum members got a special buffet dinner which was pretty bad. There was a ton of selection, but none of it was very good at all. Ocean: The water is beautiful, but it is VERY rocky. It can be hard to come back in when waves are pushing you around. Since Hurricane Paula had just come through, the water wasn't as clear as normal, so it made it difficult to avoid the rocks. In short, we had a wonderful time, would recommend this resort, and would love to return when we need another few days of doing nothing but lounging on the beach!", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canton, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cExcellente!\u201d", "Author": "MandM204", "ReviewID": "UR83755198", "Content": "My husband and I booked this trip for our 7th anniversary.

You should make reservations early if you want to get in somewhere-so try this one. We didn't really care for La Fondue because the main dish was a protein you dip in cheese with hershey chocolate syrup for dessert. Not really what we were thinking when we booked fondue. My husband's favorite part of the day was the flaming coffee served outside with the lounge singer performance. We were also very happy with the staff at the hotel-they were always friendly when they pass you and always offering assistance. The spa was phenominal and well worth the price (below average pricing for spas). The only small criticism is the fact that you have to walk up to the Principal building to make an appointment for dinner every night and the resort was lacking nightly entertainment options.

The queue in buffet restaurants can be painful a 10/15 minute wait for an omlette in the morning is not unusual when the weather is bad add another 10. the staff in the buffet restaurants struggle to cope so coffee also very slow. Felt that the buffet restaurants not managed tightly enough, lunch time buffet menu limited choice, burgers and hot dogs excellent by pool area however when it rained it's closed, which was quite frequent . Towel system a bit of a pain as we had our towels swiped twice they try to charge you 10$ per towel for replacement however if you go to the reception desk they will begrudgingly give you an other towel card. The towel \"staff appear toremve towels randomly\" they are signs up stating that you must not reserve beds but the americans and the hispanics are up at 6.30 am doing it and the staff turn a blind eye. If you need a sunshade Get up early and reserve by placing a bucket and spade on beds rather than your towels(they can't then get taken). Drinks in the reception area and pool bars, and beach bar very good staff expect a tip every time you order a drink, americans and hispanics very very loud by the pool bars, you do get used to it after a while they can be quite amusing to watch and listen to. The evening restaurants were mainly of a very high standard except the mexican bizarrely enough! which was disgusting. The Italian and the argentian were just exceptional to the most highest standards, above langans and the Ivy in london in my opinion. our teenage son loved the fillet, rib eye steaks and the veal in the italin was again just delightful, swiss very nice chocolate fondue hit the spot. The booking system for the restaurants was a pain as you may have to q for 15/20 mins to make a booking, book the restaurants for as many nights as they allow you, the staff are not always consistent and it seems more a case of what mood they are in. Staff in restaurants mainly lovely and we were more than happy to tip for good service. It was a 15 min walk to the beach form our room and a 10 minute walk to the reception so from reception to beach 25 min walk. Used hotel taxi to playa del carmen and got taxi back ourselves, quite nice we went in the day but evening would be nice as there are lovely bars down by the beach, street traders are a nightmare just say thank you and smile, every 2 seconds someone will approach you. Son went swimming with the dolphins it was wonderful and we also went to the mayan ruins that again was very enjoyable and our guide was most informative, guide trip is for about 50 minutes so you can sit and have a beer at the end of the trip, only 10$ for a bucket of 4 sols, nice little souvenir shop at the exit too. IF YOU ARE TRAVELLING WITH YOUNG TEENAGERS READ THIS. the entertainment staff on the beach WOULD NOT ALLOW our son to play beach volleyball or football as they said it was for the adults only, we normally holiday in Antigua and have never encountered this before. Our son would not want to return there for that reason 14 days is a long time with little to do in the day except swim!. All the above said a nice holiday, would we rush back. No. Airport a bit of a nightmare be prepared for a long wait when you arrive going back not so bad. Forgot to mention resort so big had the feel of a \"disney complex\".

What an amazing resort! I am so shocked at some of the reviews on here about the resort. I think some people just like moaning for moanings sake! The only problem i could find with this resort was the rude guests that treated the staff as though they were sub-human! The staff truely are so friendly and polite, from the receptionists to the maintainence staff. We were greeted with a friendly 'hola' whenever walking through the resort. A big thanks to Gabrialla the maitre'd at the resturants. She is so sweet and polite! So many people hugged her on the way out of the door, myself included! She's a really lovely person. Also thanks to Angel the crazy waiter who kept my husband well stocked with beer most nights! He provided fantastic service and always with a smile. I left my shawl in the mexican restuarant one evening and completely forgot about it. 5 days later when i returned for a meal, Angel presented me with said item! Thank you very much Angel! I guess that puts a sock in the mouth of those who believe theft to be a problem at this resort! We got a free upgrade to the junior deluxe suite when we arrived. We were more happy with the room. The bed was a super kingsize and extremely comfortable. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard and the jaccuzzi bath was lovely! The mini bar was re-stocked daily and on a couple of occasions we had a few extra cans of lager in there! The resort is big, but it only takes about ten minutes to walk from the lobby to the beach. My advice to anyone complaining about the walk being too far or exhausting.....get to the gym! If a ten minute walk through beautiful, perfectly maintained grounds is too much, then you've got serious health problems! On that note, both my husband and i took full advantage of the gym at the resort. It has a great range of equipment and even offers spinning classes in peak season! We tried all the restuarants apart from La Fleur and the Thai Beach Club which were both closed for refurbishment. I loved Miso. The sushi and Pad Thai were fantastic. My husband loved the grill. Take your appetite to the grill and try one of the huge T-bone steaks. They were cooked to perfection. Las Olas the seafood restuarant was also great. The fish was beautifully fresh and delicious. The entertainment at the Princess was brilliant. The entertainment team work so hard, day and night. From games pool and beach side, to shows in the evening, everything was such fun and you could see the amount of effort they all put in. The Cuban band that play twice a week were brilliant. I challange you not to tap your feet to the beat! Its impossible. The mariachi band were great also. Lots of fun! Another thing i loved about the Princess was the wildlife. Iguanas, lizards, raccons, frogs all sorts of wildlife roam around. The mangroves are part of a conservation programme and its great to see that the local wildlife doesn't get pushed out and left homeless by holiday makers. We did encouter a couple of days of rain, but were expecting it due to the time of year we went. But the hotel provide a rain schedule of activities so it wasn't a drama. I feel i really need to reply to some of the complaints about rocks in the sea. Yes, there are rocks, but short of draining the ocean and removing mother natures rocks, there is little the resort can do about it! And if its that much of a problem, just lift your legs and swim over them!! I know this is a very lengthy review, but i hope it helps those who are hesitant to book the Princess. I truely is a 5 * resort. I'd return in a heartbeat!

Peaceful location with views over rain forest (Block 1). Immaculately clean. Very comfy King size bed. Well equipped bathroom (no bathtub, didn't need one, has large walk-in shower). Towels changed daily, bed linen every couple of days, (ridiculously frequent really!). Same comment as with the Riu in Jamaica re: damp smell - IT ISN'T DAMP, IT'S THE AIR CON. SMELL. On arrival room was (for us) icy cold, and bedding felt COLD, which is not the same as DAMP (Ignore comments in other reviews about damp sheets!) Turned Air Con. off as we didn't need it on, the room was cool enough, humid smell disappeared. The whole area of Riviera Maya is HUMID, it's in the tropics, what do people expect? Only thing missing was somewhere to hang laundry to dry on the balcony. A small clothes horse would be discreet and a great help, as it takes ages for laundry to dry, draped over tables or chairs, due to humidity levels. No great hardship though, as we lived in beachwear pretty much the whole duration! A tip! Take quick dry clothes if possible!! GENERAL SERVICES/FACILITIES: Lobby/Reception service efficient. Staff (all departments) extremely friendly and helpful. Only needed Maintenance once (room safe blocked itself) and they arrived and solved problem within 15 mins. Bars plentiful, good variety of spirits etc. Pool areas always immaculate. Never had problems getting parasols or loungers, though we were there during low season I admit! Don't take beach towels, hotel provides them. Stayed generally around quiet pool near beach, but the Party pool is plenty lively if that's what you want. Grounds/gardens beautifully maintained and gorgeous to stroll through. Ignore reviews about it being a 30 min. walk from beach to Lobby! Strolling leisurely it takes maybe at most 10 mins, 5 in my case (long legs, walk fast!). READ the brochures, they SAY it's a BIG complex. Free shuttle buggy ran all round complex frequently anyway for those who didn't wish to overuse their legs! Loads of wildlife around grounds inc. Iguanas, Coatis (similar to raccoons), comical birds, gorgeous butterflies and Dragonflies. Like staying in a Wildlife Park, Lovely to see the respect for the natural environment in this Hotel and the area generally! BEACH: White sand, wide and extensive in both directions. Plenty of loungers. Always clean. Sea was always clear and warm, plus very shallow for a good distance from shore. Plenty of fish to see! No need for water shoes. The \"rocks\" are large, generally smooth, stones, and are easily seen and avoidable. Area directly in front of Hotel has been pretty much cleared of rocks anyway, though further along beach, (away from this Hotel) the shallows ARE very rocky! BUFFET RESTAURANTS: Generally used main Buffet for all meals. LOADS of variety, (breakfast, lunch and dinner). Different \"themes\" nearly every evening (Mexican, Spanish, Japanese, International etc etc...). Beautifully presented food, always tasty. A pleasure to dine in both Buffets! Staff super friendly. THEME RESTAURANTS: Used Mexican and Italian. Nice surroundings, waiter service, \u00e1 la carte menu (not over extensive however). No problems booking in. Personally we preferred the Buffet but no complaints about the smaller theme restaurants. ENTERTAINMENT: As usual, hard to be objective as it's my own line of work. Reasonable \"sporty\" daytime activities, though ALWAYS the same daily programme. This could be more varied in my opinion, but seemed to be acceptable to majority of guests. Evening Shows varied, mainly dance based, and all mimed, but this is the norm in most Hotels. (We sing live, but this is the exception). Generally entertaining for the majority of guests I would imagine. No idea about Childrens' Club as A) We don't have kids and B) there were very few kids about as school Hols were over! Overall I cannot give a truly unbiased opinion, because Ents. is what I do!! If pressed, I would say Programme seemed to be adecuate for most people, but NOT varied or complete enough to me. GENERAL: Go to this Hotel without fear or worry over the few bad reviews. I honestly DO NOT know what these Moaning Minnies expect to find, but we found The Riviera Princess SUPERB in all respects, and I would love to return!!

My wife and I just returned from a 5-day trip to the Grand Princess. We were a little skeptical like most because of some of the bad reviews. What a bunch of crap. From the moment we arrived to the time we left, we were pleased with EVERY feature of this resort. When we arrived we were greated by a wonderful staff and BEAUTIFUL surroundings. A speedy check-in at 3:15 in the afternoon was a welcomed sight. We had a short walk to our Swim Up Suite in the 2000 section. Within 5 minutes, our bags were delivered to our suite. The refrigerator was well stocked with water, soft drinks and cold beer. The room was perfect. The only concern was the tile floor throughout, however we never faced an issue. My wife was recovering from a broken shoulder so we may have been more catious than neccessary, however there were NO slipping incidents. We had reservations for La Vaqueria one evening and La Hacienda another. Reservations were not a problem and the food was FANTASTIC. If you have a hearty appetite try the T-Bone at La Vaqueria, be warned IT IS HUGE. We ate Breakfast and a few lunches at the Buffet. Again we would consider the food very good and the choices were satisfactory. I called room service every evening for Ice for my wifes shoulder. This was a quick service and the staff always greeted us. The Swim Out Suite is a MUST. This was a highlight of the trip for us. We were located at the beginning of the pool complex, so the walk to the lobby was about 5 minutes and the walk to the beach was about the same. The beach was magnificent. We NEVER experienced the so called \"dirty water\" or \"rocky beach\" The water was as clear as it gets and the sand was pure as powder. The vendors were not an issue to us. The bar service was good and we really enjoyed our time at the beach. We took the trip to Playa del Carmen through the reservation desk (free service) and enjoyed our day shopping and drinking. We decided to take a cab back ($14 USD) instead of staying the entire 6 hours. The security guards check all vehicles going in and out and keep track of you. This made us again feel secure. We only saw the acrobatic show and the Mexican Market in the Plaza, and enjoyed both. We are already planning another trip to the Princess and can't wait to return. Read what you want, but seeing is beleiving.

Can't understand some of the negative comments regarding sea and the size of the resort. The resort is huge but they don't hide the fact it has 1200 rooms. The resort is beautiful with statues and lots of green areas. We booked through First Choice and flew with Thomson. All flights were on time and and we upgraded to taxi transfer which was waiting for us when we got there. The Thomson staff at the airport were excellent, really welcoming. We originally booked the Riviera Princess but when we arrived we were taken to the Sunset side. There was no explanation at the time and we found this strange as no one could explain to us why. The concierge said the hotels were identical on each side and the Princess side of the hotel was virtually empty. We confirmed this with our rep and were more than happy with our room which was exactly as the brochure described (Junior Suite.) Room- Mini bar was re-stocked everyday, if you tip the staff they will fill with more beer and bring treats like rum and tequila. Room was cleaned everyday provided we put the sign on the door. If you don't want your room cleaned at 9 in the morning put your do not disturb on as the staff start early. Food/Restaurants- The buffet restaurant is brilliant, theme nights every night and plenty of food to choose from. There are two buffet restaurants but one was closed due the hotel being at 40% capacity. The al a carte restaurants were not open every night and a few were not included in the Junior suite package. This was not made clear when booking the hotel, when checking in or meeting with our rep. The al a carte restaurants were not as good as we expected with the exception of Miso. The staff in the al a carte restaurants were less attentitive than the buffet and seemed unhappy. The al a carte restaurants need to be booked in advance. The booking system is terrible. There is a girl at a desk with every menu in front of her, people tended to sit down and look at the menus and discuss them with her which made the waiting time very long. One day there was a huge queue and my partner waited for up to 45 minutes to book. Good job its just round the corner from the lobby bar so I could take round beers and refreshments. Another thing- the red wine is freezing cold everywhere you go! and if you drink a mexican flag shot- prepare to be ill for a while-its lethal but yu will not realise at the time lol! Bars- The sports bar is open 24 hours and the staff and service in there is excellent. They serve food 24 hours (burgers, sandwiches, hotdogs, nachos) and have pool tables and table football. This place can get pretty wild at night, so wouldn't like to be there when the hotel has more guests. The lobby bars and outdoor bar in the square are lovely and the atmosphere is great but it can take a while to get served. The pool bar can also take a long time to be served. There's a small disco open to2:30am but its pretty tragic. Pools- There are loads of pools all over the place. The main pool has games and entertainment during the day. This can be noisy but there are loads of places you can go to get away from this if its not your thing. This might not be the case when the hotel is busier. From the pool you can book a trip to coco bongo in playa del carmen. Word of warning if you plan to pay in Pesos- don't! They charge you more. Pay in USD. This is the case for all excursions. Hotel shop- The staff follow you round like you are a criminal! Spa- The spa is lovely! We had booked treatments and this meant you had the use of facilities for the full day. They charge in USD, we paid in Pesos and it worked out more expensive. Specific to UK travellers- Take USD. We were advised by the travel agent to take only pesos but dollars are widely accepted and it works out better value for money.

Time to book dinner thinking cant wait 5 star hotel should be great.Mmmm thing is you need to book meals 3 days in advance !! Who knows when and what they would like to eat while on holiday 3 days in advance,not me. Anyway we did our best and booked things and were offered 6.15 pm or 9.40 pm.We are now thinking whose holiday is this I want to eat when I want to eat. So we did the buffet as no availability that night and cant complain what was on offer. Plenty of everything lots of choice, we just wanted to be served in a restaurant after spending lots of money to get here.But hey ho you need to eat. Our meal reservations became a daily argument and on one occasion was told NO reservation possible in any restaurant NONE.Asked why? got the shrugged shoulders and a smart sarcastic look and told none available ! Now we are getting very frustrated.Its our holidays . Pools were lovely beach was lovely and there is service there or so I was told ,the staff do on occasion come round and ask what you would like to drink,sounds great.Im thinking this is the life so ordered our tipple as I did on quite a few occasions guess what !! still waiting! not once did our drinks arrive. waiting what a joke. I became our drinks person at least we got them. By now 2 days in we are totally fed up and angry .Bathroom still floods all towels are used mopping up they never get replaced .We need to phone and ask .While we phone we remind them that our fridge does not get restocked its empty again. Sheets never changed .Time for a serious talk. Adriana our rep listened and got bathroom fixed immediately.We asked to pay for upgrade get out room maybe get more service,she enquired. Told yes have a look if you like pay surcharge and move.So 1 minute later we go to desk to arrange. WHO said that WHEN did they say that NO ROOMS available.I said YOU did 1 minute ago. No NOT ME was answer. We decided to look in hotel shop various items are on sale clothes, toiletries,nic nacs etc. We do know a little spanish but the staff didnt know that we did and we soon became aware we were being watched we asked why and also if customers were allowed to browse in the shop more shrugged shoulders and all of a sudden no english spoken This went on about everything wont bore you any more . This hotel has a problem everything is an issue you need to ask for everything and it gets frustratring you are on holiday supposed to be enjoying yourself. It is not a pleasnat place to be. Next thing we did was tell Adriana to GET US OUT OF HERE ASAP .This was day 3 .She was brilliant found out what we asked got us a price on a few hotels we selected another paid MORE cash to move .The best decision we made because after 4 days we were out of the up market prison camp staffed by unhelpful and as i now think unhappy staff. A 30 minute taxi ride and we were in our new hotel it was fantastic ,happy staff ,eat when you want ,where you want ,service with a smile.No rules or fines. Everything perfect .Holiday saved all I can say is thank god we moved and Im so happy we had a good holiday rep,never needed to use one before but this time I did.

I was a little nervous reading some of the bad reviews on here, especially with only 70% recommending it - but either they've improved alot recently or else there are tons of hard-to-please people out there! We chose this hotel mostly because we knew that it was partly shut down for renovations...we don't like crowds of people, so we thought that having fewer people around would be nice. Great decision!!! The beach and pools were barely even half full; we never had a problem finding a lounge chair, at any time of the day; we made reservations at every a la carte restaurant with no problem; it was fabulous! This resort is beautiful --- the beach is gorgeous with nice sand (a few rocks in the water, just watch where you're going), and a sandbar out in the ocean that's awesome to sit on. We walked down the beach past the resort property, which made us really appreciate how nice our beach was! The pools were very nice - and clean - the only ones that ever got busy were the ones with the bars in them, so you could choose if you wanted music and people or just sit quietly by one of the emptier pools. I was very surprised to read about people's experiences with rude Americans and Canadians....we felt like a minority being from Canada/English-speaking and the only rude/loud people we encountered throughout the week were all speaking Spanish...not sure what country they were from. The rooms were very clean and quiet, never heard anything from our neighbours. We were upgraded to a deluxe room, so we enjoyed the jacuzzi tub and larger room. We chose to only have our room serviced every other day, and never had any problems at all. We always tipped the housekeepers and the person who filled the fridge, and kept everything valuable locked up in the safe. However when we were out at the pools or beach, we kept our nice camera and cash for tipping in our beach bag just sitting on the chair and never even thought about somebody stealing from it - everything was very safe there. The food was excellent...we only ate supper in the buffet once - it was great - and we loved all the themed restaurants. LaFleur wasn't a favorite, but that's just our personal opinion - nothing wrong with it at all. Our favorites were Miso (Oriental) and La Vaqueria (Argentian). Had excellent service at all the restaurants, including the buffet. We had breakfast at the buffet every morning and really enjoyed it -- wonderful selection. Not sure what people were talking about with the funny smell in the rooms....in the hallways around the rooms you could smell the humid vegetation, but it wasn't bad and it never lingered in the room at all - it just smelled like the tropics...go figure! You'd have to be searching for negatives to complain about that! The only complaint about this hotel we have AT ALL, would be the vendors on the beach. The massage hut was nice and we took advantage of it, but we really could have done without the little stores blocking the view of the ocean and always being bugged to buy something. They were good about only asking once a day, but if you even wandered too close by mistake, they were right there trying to sell you something. We talked to travellers from other resorts while on excursions and found that other resorts didn't have the vendors.....that would be nice. The staff and bartenders were quite friendly....we're not big drinkers, so we didn't get to know any of the bartenders by name....but we enjoyed the drinks we did have and found the service to be excellent. Housekeepers especially were very friendly, always greeted us as we walked past.....not a common practice everywhere! The resort was quite large and took awhile to walk from the beach to the lobby/buffet area, but if it was any smaller, then people would just complain that there weren't enough pools or it was too crowded, so I think it's perfect! When you book a resort that clearly states it has that many bars, restaurants and pools, you have to expect that it's going to take some space to fit them all in....so just suck it up and bring comfortable shoes! The entertainment was quite good....the staff did a great job during the day and at night. My husband liked the beach volleyball and got to know a few of the entertainment staff, so that made the evening shows even more enjoyable for us. You can tell they put alot of effort into their shows...we were quite impressed....even the cheesy stuff was well-choreographed and well-performed. We would return to this area of Mexico definitely, and even this resort. We're wanting to bring our kids next time and this resort had lots to offer for kids from what we saw.

Oh and as for theft ..not a problem with it on our part and never heard on any either Part of the hotel is closed on the Princess side but the lobby bar is open go up there and say hi to Jacob the barman there, he is fantastic say hello from us too thats the good bits not much on the bad other than lack of entertainment on an evening .. oh and security waking you up at 05.30 in a morning because a light is on ???? hmm our room was showing empty the hotel computer system is a joke and trying to get a response via e-mail well still waiting so concierge if you r reading this a reply would be nice.

Here are the truth: no stealing! This was our first concern. The safe is safe! You pick your own security code. We lock all our passports and value item in there and never got steal. We have two door card. We always kept them on us. You can leave it in the room to run the system, lights and ceiling fan, but we never left the card there when we were gone. We were vigilant and made sure to not leave anything valuable on the tables or easy to grab. We locked our luggage every time we are out. We took simple precaution. Room: On our first day, it took longer, our room was ready at 3h30, but on the other days the room was cleaned around 9h00. So if you want to take a nap in the afternoon, not a problem. Another person comes in to fill up the fridge. Maybe some people think that this person was the \"stealer\" but no, he passes after the maid to fill up your fridge. No worry on this. When we arrive, the room does have a weird smell. It was really bad. We higher up the AC and by the end of the day, no more smell. We think it's because of the \"inside\" garden they have in each place with a fountain. It is very humid, so it causes the bad smell in the room. One you break the humidity, the smell will be gone. We had the deluxe junior suite. The room is nice, with lots of space. The bathtub is ok and the shower also. The toilet doesn't have a lot of pressure when you flush, so keep your hand on the handle for a while to avoid blocking it. Hotel: Yes it's HUGE! Yes you have to walk, and yes almost everything is at the lobby area. Our room was located near the beach, we are beach person, not pool. So we did take long walks to get to the restaurant at night, but it didn't really bother us. Restaurants: You have to reserve as soon as you get there. They reserve 3 days for you, after, you have to come back for the rest. We loved the a la carte! We tried the Mama mia, italian, excellent! Los Olas, seafood, excellent (you have to love seafood). Miso, oriental, very good, we had the chef that cook on the grill in front of us. The only thing we didn't like is that we were sit with people we didn't know. So the ambiance was not as fun as being with a gang. The presentation of the cook is quit fun so it break the atmosphere a bit. Vaqueria, steak house, really really impressive and GOOD! You have to try the T-Bone! it's huge and delicious! La Fleur, international, not quit good. I wouldn't recommend this one. We had Fernando as our waiter in two different restaurant. He is really nice and likes to talk! So if you have him, you would enjoy your experience that's for sure! We like the inhouse white wine more than the red wine. The drinks are good! We've tested other places in mexico, and they really do some good drinks! We've tried the buffet one night. It wasn't the best, but still ok. On lunch time, you can have hamburgers and hotdogs at the pool area, not everyday but it happened twice during our stay. It was good. The lunch buffet is good too! Same food all week. The breakfast at the buffet is ok. Same food all week as well. Beach/Pool: The beach wasn't brown as some pictures on TA. We stayed at the beach a week long. Did have some egg smells in the morning in some area of the beach (more on the left). It's not that rocky. We brought our watershoes though. The beach was nice and the water clear. There is a lots of pool in the resort. We did go for some nice swim. It was ok. The swim up people are kinda annoyed when you go in their pool... that is not technically theirs, but we did feel that it was bothering them. Although, they were loud! Activites: We went to LAPIS, jewelry factory. It was ok, you're kinda \"forced' to buy and it was quite expensive though. There is a bus that brings you to playa del carmen everyday, and brings you back. It was cool. Although we took the taxi, cost 12$ USD. Playa is a safe place to shop. We were walking on the 5th ave. Not everything is cheap, but it was interesting to get there. At the hotel at night, on the central place, between the two lobby, there is always places for entertainment. We enjoyed staying there and having a delicious cappuccinos. Hope this review would help. I would recommend if you want to have relaxing vacation, but it wasn't our best hotel since we've visited other places and resorts before.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing clean property\u201d", "Author": "alma59", "ReviewID": "UR80320590", "Content": "The resort was very beautiful, especially the grounds.

I was uneasy about staying there because of what I had read prior to going there. however, I need not have worried. We went with Thomson's from Manchester, arrived after a 10 hour flight to steamy hot Cancun. The rep met us and escorted us to the air conditioned coach where we were given a bottle of water (free). The journey was around 40mins from Cancun. When we arrived there were some other English people who asked reception to give us an upgrade, so we got a pool room view but with a jacuzzi bath which was nice. The room was ok, but the next day the toilet was leaking water and it blocked so there was a foul smell in the room. We informed reception and they told us to pack our stuff and got us a room down the corridor without us having to ask. Room was always stocked with water and drinks in the mini bar, cleaning staff were all very friendly, when we passed them in the corridor we always got a 'hola!' from them. The room was very comfortable with air con, tv and a great bathroom with a wetroom for the shower area. The only downside was some noisy neighbours that joined in the second week, the floors are stone and they seemed to like dragging chairs at all hours over the floor! Food was great, I think there was 9 a la carte restaurants, ranging from Italian to Spanish, Mexican and the Swiss fondue yum. The buffet restaurant for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner were also great. A fab range of food was available and the buffet had a different theme each night E.g italian, Mexican, Chinese etc. Entertainment wise, there were activities around the main pool, beach stuff included in the all inclusive such as kayaking and snorkelling. You can paint your own Mexican pottery if you wish, it makes a nice souvenir. Each night at around 8pm there is something going on near the outside bar, fire-eaters or Flamenco, once a week there is a Mexican market selling traditional things. be careful if any one comes up to you asking for your name, they will go away and make something for you and then expect you to buy it for around $5. There is a disco on from 10pm until 1am I think, play good variety of music. There is a show on around 9pm each night it is different, it is run by the pool entertainment team from the day time. We saw some amazing dancing and traditional Mexican acts. The beach.....the beach was beautiful and very special at night, there is no light pollution so you get a fantastic view of the night sky.....if you like that kind of stuff. It is true it smells during the day, but I never saw any 'brown stuff' but then I didn't go looking, it is a problem up and down the coast, but there are no health warnings around so I'm guessing it's not too much of a problem...but you never know. The tide is quite rough though not as bad as Tulum,, sand is gorgeous, there are a few rocks/coral so if you're planning to go further out probably better to wear swim shoes. The sea is like a bath tub, it's something to remember the first time you dip your toes in :) The hotel itself is stunning, beautifully landscaped gardens with palm trees galore, swimming pools are also great, lovely and warm. There are Mayan statues lining the path up to the main building and they are all lit up at night. We did a bit of travelling about, Tulum is pretty but v v v Hot!!! Coba is a great place to go as are the Mayan villages around. You must try a ceynote while you are there, they are the limestone sinkholes only found in that part of Mexico. Cancun is good for a night out....Coco Bongo is the best club in Latin America and not to be missed. Cozumel is a nice island to visit and the best place to see the world's 2nd largest coral reef. Playa del Carmen is an interesting place...very much geared for tourists you will be hounded as you walk down 5th Avenue(which is not really an avenue at all) there are many street vendors trying to catch your attention. Tour reps were great and the staff at the hotel were all very helpful and polite. I never experienced any negative attitude from them, they were always willing to help. It is such a shame that Mexican's are considered 2nd class citizen's even in their own country, I witnessed incredibly rude and arrogant behaviour from American's who walk around like they own the place, speaking to staff like they are dirt. One family started shouting at the restaurant manager in the middle of a crowded dining room one night. I suspect many of the negative accounts come from those that don't get their own way. The Mexican's are amongst the most happiest and generous people I have ever met. Tipping is big in Mexico, where most of the population survive on about a $ a day, so we tipped in the speciality restaurants, the sports bar is open 24/7 it tends to do fast food and the outside bar that's open in the evening is quite good, people mainly tip in those places. Also on bus trips, there is a free bus from the hotel to Playa del Carmen every day. All in all a fantastic holiday, I would definitely stay in the Princess again.", "Date": "September 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nottinghamL", "Title": "\u201chuge ... and fantastic\u201d", "Author": "stuhunt", "ReviewID": "UR79866451", "Content": "Just returned from theprincess, stayed with our children and their partners, all 3 rooms were upgraded and very nice they were too. always clean and no smells!!. pools were great, you could if you wanted lively or quiet, all had swin up bars -perfect.

Plenty of sun beds, nice sand and easy to get in and out of the sea. the food was terfiric, from morning til night, sure the waiters were rushed in the buffet at busy times .. but that wasn't their fault, they all tried hard. Ala carte means were great esp the asian. Didn't see too much of the entertainment, usual hotel fair but a little more professional. Sure the place is huge, but there's plenty to see and do, getting lost is just a new adventure.

Our room (1232) is part of the Sunset block and was Junior Deluxe, a free upgrade that we were not told of at checkin but pleasantly surprised to find out about [please be aware that this does not make a difference to your booking whatsoever as Sunset or Riviera are just the accommodation building names and not separate complexes]. The room itself was cleaned and the minibar restocked daily, for which we tipped both the maid and minibar man 20pesos, believe me they work extremely hard and really do deserve it. I loved that the rooms are minimalistic but please do not let this deceive you, they are still extremely comfortable. Despite what you may have read in other reviews there were not any bad smells upon arrival, mosquitos or any other bugs for that matter within the rooms. The safes are electric and we did not have anything disappear from the room whether left in or out of the safe neither did we hear of any such problems from any other guests. The food is gorgeous, there is so much choice and always something for everyone. The choices available for breakfast, lunch and dinner were endless and to top it off the BBQ and Sports Bar food were pleasant additions. My personal favourite restaurant was Las Olas (Seafood) and my boyfriend's was La Vaquiela (Grill) all other A La Carte restaurants were lovely as was the Sunset buffet (I can not comment on the other buffets as we did not eat in them). Each restaurant is decorated accordingly as are the staff uniforms and menus, again staff work extremely hard and are quick to serve therefore we tipped 20pesos each night. Nicholas and Angel were our restaurant staff favourites and were tipped 50pesos, they always remembered you from previous nights (this does not by any means mean that other staff were not accommodating)!!! Each day we stayed by the party pool and every day we had the time of our lives. Neither myself our my boyfriend usually participate in such events however we were both highly entertained by those involved and did choose on a number of occasions to join in with tequila volleyball and water polo. The entertainment staff work well with the guests and thankfully are more than aware of which guests will get involved therefore do not force others, the same staff are part of the evening entertainment in the theatre. Special mention goes to Gabo...we miss you!!! Lastly we will most definitely be going back in the future, it really was the best holiday we've had and we always stay in 5* accommodation.

We also had our wonderful wedding there, 27th August 2010. We also had family & friends join us for 2 weeks in the middle of our stay. We had a wonderful time during our entire stay and feel that people\u2019s views are very much dependant on their expectations, but we went with an open mind and the most important thing to us was that our family & friends enjoyed their time and that the wedding day went without a hitch. The rooms - We and our guests, paid for the standard junior suites, but we were all upgraded to the junior deluxe suites upon arrival. The suites themselves are very spacious (a little cramped if it\u2019s 2 adults & 2 children), and spotlessly clean. The maid did a wonderful job and had usually cleaned our room by 11am each day. The bed\u2019s are huge and very comfortable. The bathroom has a huge walk in shower and his/hers sinks which was very nice. We were in room 2134 which looked onto the gardens and was nice & quiet. All our guests were placed close by which was also good. The Food - We visited each of the A La Carte restaurants while we were there and found both the food and service to be very good. Our favourites were La Vaqueria (steakhouse), Miso (oriental) and La Fondue (for something a bit different). If you order steak and don\u2019t like it pink, you really must stress well done as everything comes pink. The Tapas & Piano bar\u2019s were closed due to it being low season and the Thai restaurant is closed for 2 months which was disappointing as we\u2019d planned to treat ourselves to a meal there with some friends who\u2019d flown over from Abu Dhabi. The sports bar served hamburgers, hotdogs, chips, popcorn and nacho\u2019s with cheese sauce 24 hrs a day if you got the munchies but I don\u2019t care if I never see nacho\u2019s & cheese sauce again as we ate way too much of it. They cook burgers & hot dogs near the main pool most days and these were delicious and it\u2019s useful if you don\u2019t want to dry off in order to go into the buffet (no wet or damp clothes allowed). You can book you\u2019re a La Carte restaurants up to 2 days in advance anytime between 7am and 11pm (suggest booking ahead if you can as 2 restaurants are usually shut each evening on a rota system. The Resort/Complex - It is big and not ideal for older people or anyone with walking difficulties but after a few days, it\u2019s not quite as daunting as when you first arrived. It is a good 10 minute stroll from the beach to the lobby but you can walk through the buildings if you need a bit of shade from the blistering heat or the occasional downpour. The Riviera side of the complex appears to have been closed due to being low season, so everyone is placed in the Sunset side but I think their identical so it really didn\u2019t make any difference. There are plenty of places (near the lobby areas) to sit and have a relaxing drink on your own if you wish. Weather - With it being the rainy season, I was a little worried that it might rain a lot, especially on our wedding day. I am pleased to say that it only rained a couple of times during our stay, and this was mainly short, sharp showers which didn\u2019t last more than an hour. Plus it cleared the air and is very welcomed when it\u2019s just so hot on some days. The weather was mainly was VERY, VERY hot, especially on our wedding day. Most days it was over 30 degrees and we were informed that the humidity was over 100 which often made you feel physically drained. The Pools - LOVELY!!!, it was like getting into a cool bath when you\u2019re really hot. There were plenty of loungers and shady spots. Our room was near one of the quiet pools which was just what we wanted, but in the distance you could hear the entertainment team working very hard to give the livelier guests a good time with pool games & competitions. The pools themselves were very clean and there are quite a few to choose from, depending on what you want. The Beach - We preferred the pool but did visit the beach a couple of times and also ventured into the sea. There are pebbles & rocks near the shoreline, which can be a bit tricky to negotiate if you\u2019re not too steady on your feet or if it\u2019s a windy day and the sea\u2019s a little turbulent. Once you get past knee depth though, it\u2019s fine and you can go quite far out and it still only reaches your waist. The sea itself was beautifully warm (even at 9pm) and not a great deal of seaweed. Occasionally you could see the much talked about brown water in patches which appeared to be worse if there had been a downpour of rain earlier. We did experience a bad smell once but if you walk a little further, your in clear water and no smell. Entertainment - There was live music each night in the outside Plaza at 7.30pm, followed usually by some sort of entertainment, whether it be fire dancers, or a band playing, then you have the main evening show in the air conditioned theatre at 9.30pm. The entertainments team work extremely hard all day long and the dancers were fantastic in the shows but we have personally experienced better entertainment in other all inclusive hotels we\u2019ve visited. The Reps - Our Thomson Reps, Carlos & Adriana were always available and very helpful. Carlos gave us lots of useful tips at the welcome meeting to help us save money and you certainly don\u2019t feel like their just there to make a commission on excursions. Playa Del Carmen - We only visited once, at night and by cab for a meal out with friends who were staying in nearby Cancun. The taxi was cheap, the restaurant and meal were lovely but it does come across as a little \u2018shady\u2019 at night time, so I\u2019d keep your wits about you. We were advised to go during the evening as the shops up their prices in the day due to the cruise ship passengers visiting. Staff - Everyone says Hola as they walk by and the staff were very pleasant & friendly. The people who live & work there, do seem genuinely happy that you\u2019ve come to spend time in their beautiful country. Occasionally we felt that the bar staff could have been happier & more attentive but on the whole, the staff were very good. Security - We had absolutely no issues with security at all and neither did any of our friends/family. We kept our most valuable items in the safety deposit box but often left money or jewellery on the dressing table and nothing was ever touched. The Wedding (positives) - I couldn\u2019t have wished for more. The weather was a little hot to be in a wedding dress all day but I\u2019m delighted to say there was no sign of rain what-so-ever. The wedding planner \u2018Sandra\u2019 worked very hard to ensure that everything went according to plan. The beach gazebo was decorated beautifully, the flowers were gorgeous, the judge who performed the ceremony was lovely and seemed to genuinely love her job in marrying people, other guests on the beach were very respectful in not edging into our photo\u2019s, the setting was perfect, we had no hitches with the CD player which played our 4 chosen songs (I understand that other guests had problems with the CD\u2019s sticking and one couple even had the wrong song played as they walked down the isle), our wedding dinner at La Vaqueria was wonderful and the staff/Manager at the restaurant treated us like we were the only guests who were dining, they sectioned us off and it felt very private, the wedding planner made sure all the table items & decorations I\u2019d brought with us, were placed as I\u2019d asked them to be, the wedding cake was beautiful the lady who sings in the Plaza each evening, even sang our wedding song so that me and my new husband could have our first dance together. Everyone enjoyed the day and commented on how beautiful everything was. The Wedding (negatives) - Some members of our families could not be there to celebrate with us, but we were thinking of them and raised a glass in their absence. The flowers and buggy arrived a little late, our hair appointments were cutting it fine for time as we should have booked the appointments a lot earlier due to them only having 2 hair stylists available on the day and we didn\u2019t receive any room decoration for the wedding day but these items faded into insignificance as the rest of the day was absolutely perfect and I personally, couldn\u2019t have been happier. General Positives - The grounds are kept beautiful, the weather was glorious, the pools were lovely, the rooms are very clean & comfortable, the staff are very friendly and genuine, the reps were very helpful, we had no issues with security despite reading previous reviews, the food was good and plenty of choice (even in the buffet), the hotel is spotless and the wedding setting was amazing. General Negatives - This place would definitely benefit from installing some big powerful fans in the lobby/bar & plaza areas, as it\u2019s just too hot of an evening and being 10 minutes from the beach, you can rarely feel a breeze. Thai restaurant being shut was a disappointment. The sand on the beach is beautiful but we have personally experienced better beaches than this one. The resort is a little on the large side for those with walking difficulties, and they could also benefit from a couple more lifts (only found 4 in the whole resort - both sides). Additional information you may find useful - If you change travellers cheques up at the front desk, you will receive the currency in peso\u2019s and not US dollars. If you need to buy stamps for your postcards, you can get them in the jewellery store and post them at the front desk. The children\u2019s club seemed very well organised and the staff seemed to genuinely love keeping the kids entertained. You are provided with towel cards when you arrive, so no need to take these with you from home but you\u2019ll be charged 200 peso\u2019s if you loose your towel or the card.

The trips are a little pricey but that is the same on any holiday you go on but th 2 we went on were swimming with dolphins and tulum and both were value for money and we would definately do them again. We were lucky that the weather was lovely but even if it wasnt it would not have been the hotels doing. The beach was lovely there are stones in the water but they are very managable to walk over without shoes we had no problem what so ever, there are larger rocks but the water is so clear you can see them. So to sum it up, staff - great, hotel - great, food & drink - great, beach - great, trips - great. Loved every minute of it and wish we were back there this year!", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort and Great Value!\u201d", "Author": "travelers0512", "ReviewID": "UR78483707", "Content": "My husband and I traveled to this resort from Aug 31 - Sep 4. We have stayed at many all inclusives in Mexico and the Dominican Republic and we've taken 8 cruises. We thought this resort was the most beautiful we've stayed at so far. The grounds are absolutely breathtaking. We didn't mind the walking at all. We paid for a standard room, but was upgraded to the swim out suite upon arrival. We were told that the resort was at 40% occupancy but still couldn't get our room until 3pm. We just changed our clothing, grabbed some lunch and a drink and headed to the beach. We headed back at 3pm and was given our room keys. Our luggage arrived at our room within 5 minutes. The room--Our room was amazing! We stayed in building 6 and was close to the beach and the 2 buffets by the pools. The room was very spacious and we slept very well every night. The pressure in the shower was lacking. We never had a problem with the water leaking into the other rooms. We were on the go from about 7:30am and didn't return to our room until 5 or so. With that being said we didn't notice any problems with our room being cleaned. We definitely would've liked more beer in our mini fridge but we never tipped. The beach and weather--It rained 2 of the 4 days we were there, but only for about an hour or less and then it was bright, sunny and very hot! The beach was nice. We loved all of the palapas and palm trees. We never had a problem getting some shade no matter the time of getting to the beach. We laid in the shade most of our trip and still got a lot of sun each day. The beach did have some brown water that seemed to shift to different spots each day. My husband took his goggles with him and said it looked like buried palm leaves under the sand. I don't know what it was because I didn't want to get close to it! It did smell bad from time to time but the rest of the water was beautiful turqoise. The platinum section was hardly ever occupied. I think the most people we ever saw over there were 4 at any one time. That seemed like a huge waste of space. We think it would be better utilized as anadults only section. The food--We reserved our restaurants as soon as we checked in. We were able to get all of the restaurants we wanted. Our first night we ate at the steakhouse, La Vaqueria. We both had the t-bone and it was great! Our waiter was Wilbert and he was wonderful! The second night we reserved Le Fleur, but after a long day in the sun we decided to go to the buffet. The buffets were better than any we've had at other resorts or on cruise ships. The breakfast was really good. We also ate at Mama Mia and we thought this place was aweful! There were only 4 or 5 other tables eating during our time frame and the service was terrible. We waited for an hour to get our food. A couple that came in before us was still waiting for theirs when we left. We ordered lasagne, pizza and canneloni. We've had better food at Fazoli's. We left and went to the buffet. The pools--We liked the pools, but they were pretty warm. The activities in the afternoon were pretty funny. The bar service was a little slow at times, but we took our bubba kegs and this kept us from having to go back as often as other people. Again we never had a problem getting chairs in the shade and we usually didn't go to the pool until after lunch. This is our first time staying at an all inclusive that wasn't adults only. We will definitely only stay at adults only going forward. We don't have kids and enjoy relaxing on our vacations with plenty of peace and quiet. If it weren't for this we'd probably go back to this place. Also, we never had a problem with theft. We kept all our things in the safe with no issues. Don't let the other reviews keep you from going to this resort. Go, enjoy and have a great vacation!!!", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMY DREAM WEDDING??\u201d", "Author": "L0VES_to_TRAVEL", "ReviewID": "UR78256513", "Content": "Where do i start? The good things, This resort like most is beautifully built. There were two really good employees there that made my stay bearable and kept me from a breakdown. 1) Ruben, he is a bartender and funny as hell we want to bring him back to canada and fully intend to do so sometime. 2) Lupita, she works in the platinum lobby and helps with pretty much everything. This is my trip. My husband and i brought our son and my parents we are having our dream beach wedding at what looks like a really nice resort online. We arrive at the resort at three in the afternoon and our room in not ready for another hour, not such a big deal we have some drinks in the lobby bar and sweat it out with cold beers. We finally get our room keys and cant wait to go for a cool swim as we are soaked from the intense heat. My parents go to wait for the shuttle (the resort is HUGE from the lobby to the beach i would say ten minute walk and my dad had knee surgery just a cpl days prior to leaving) so we walked the other way and are completely lost after wandering around and around fully clothed dragging our carry ons and a child we are getting pissed. I see my parents drive by in the shuttle and wonder why they too are not at their room. Its freaking hot as hell. I flag down the driver where is our room? seems we booked the rivera side of the resort and they put us on the sunset side. Not where we wanted to stay and not what we paid for. We went to talk to the concierge about putting us where we were supposed to be and she said there was no room!??? what? We inform them there is no way we are staying there and we are angry something needs to be done but we go to the room we were given just for now until things are fixed for us so we can change eat and swim as we are soaking wet from wandering around lost and starving from crappy air Canada not feeding you anymore. We call to let them know we are in our room and they say our luggage will be there in 6 minutes. and we wait and wait. after two hours i call my moms room and ask if they got theirs nope. We call them they said they thought we had not called and our stuff is still sitting up at the lobby in the sun for anyone to steal. (i would have taken it myself but your not allowed) We wait another TWO HOURS! He shows up we change and go talk to the concierge again then they say suddenly that they do have rooms for us and came back to get us to take us to the other side of the resort to our platinum rooms. So we paid WAY more for platinum and its no different, nice. Im getting married and there is nothing different than my parents room? how romantic. We are all upset but are trying to not let the first day define our trip. Tomorrow will be great. We went to the beach but cound hardly swim because the rocks were so bad. I read about them but the descriptions were not clear enough. It is not as you enter the water and they are not pebbles so water shoes would not help as some reviews suggest maybe shoes would be a better answer. The rocks are random everywhere and big and sharp. Because the water is a little rough you cant really see where they are and the waves knock you into them you cant step around them, a wave will knock you over you try to plant your foot and you step on one you try your other foot and fall over because you tit another. It hurts and was really hard to swim. My dad couldn't even go in, the waves were knocking him over he couldn't plant his feet because of the rocks we had to help him out. I read about a pipe leaking brown stuff into the water and thought we were lucky because it was not like that for me until our second last day when i was in the water with my son and it turned brown GROSS! and it was really hard to run out. We spent only two days at the beach. I don't even want to tell you that i think was coming out of that pipe. some people have posted pictures of the brown water be sure to check them out! Im going to make the shuttle complaint short and clear. My dad just had knee surgery we really needed it and it was NEVER running i felt so bad for him. They had two shuttles and when they get to each spot they change the clock on the post for every ten minutes and half the time you would get there and the time had not been changed since an hour before. We had to have lupita call them almost everytime. We find out there is only like 15 people staying on the Rivera side of the resort and so they are always just on the sunset side.(how did they not have the room for us to stay in the platinum rooms we paid for?) Two days later they only come on a phone call basis because they decide to shut down the whole rivera side of the resort. All the lights are off down the path and on all the buildings except platinum. Our fridge was not filled until the day of our wedding when the guy just used his key and walked into my room unannounced while i was in my bra and underwear just about to step into my wedding dress i was horrified! I dropped it and ran into the bathroom and my mom stood there and had my fridge filled while i waited so i would actually have some beer and WATER for my son and to brush our teeth thank god they give out bottles in the bar! (i have to mention this was the SECOND time this happened luckily the first my husband was there) For the wedding ceremony i was to stay in my room and wait for my flowers to be delivered and a wedding cart would come get me and my mom and take us to the beach. Since my flowers were an hour late i was really worried about my husband my son and my dad standing in the sun at the beach! Finally they arrive and we go to the beach. The day before we went over everything with the wedding coordinator yet when i started to walk out they played the wrong song it was sad, so much stupid little things had finally added up and this was our wedding song we chose and i didn't even know it. Horrible. We went back to our room after for champagne and there was no decoration like there was supposed to be. In the wedding information we were given there was just so much that was supposed to be done that was not i was wondering what i was paying for it was supposed to be special but it wasn't at all. My husband ran down to the bar and got glasses for everyone and we had a drink together. Its all the small things that add up. The turn down service came twice in a week. Not a big deal, i can pull my own sheets down but again just one more thing. The maid skipped us more than once then we just decided they forgot us on that side of the resort. There was nothing and nobody but a few guests there. Our wedding dinner was at mama mia restaurant the service was excellent they were so nice they constantly refilled our glasses the food was the best in the resort. They brought us our cake we cut it they took the top and told us it would be sent with our breakfast when we ordered in the morning. We sent the rest that we had to all the tables around us it was a beautiful evening. The next day we never received our cake and when we went to talk to the wedding coordinator about the wedding the following day she said they said it was delivered. Nice! The resort was very nice LOOKING, i loved having a private platinum pool it was so easy to keep an eye on my son. The food was ok but the service was just so bad. This was my worst trip ever and not something i wanted to say about my wedding it was supposed to be our dream wedding but in the end we just wanted to leave. I honestly believed that because i was having my wedding there i would have gotten something nice like a nice room (we sure paid enough!) maybe room decoration, or even some respect. Not to have people just walk in on you with out knocking and all the other crap. There was nothing nice about it. I guess i should be happy it didn't rain on my wedding day.

If you are not in a room near the pool or the beach, it is a ten minute walk. Every area of the this place is immaculatly clean and I can see why when you are not aloud to take any food from the buffet to the beach or the pool area. The only food outside was a BBQ near the Platinum pools. Service is below standards at this resort as if you call the front desk to ask for anything, it takes forever. Our shower leaked into the washroom and sink area and called everyday but no once came and once I gave up on that I just asked the maid to leave a few extra towels and that didn't happen. Oh well! Beach water was brown and smelled really bad on some days and the alcohol wasn't the greatest! Know for the main reason I am writing this review!! Please make sure to have all your food cooked very well done at the a la carte restaurants. My wife ate a piece of Salmon on day 4 at the Steak restaurant and after the first 2 bites, she said it was spoiled and didn't eat anymore. That night she had a fever, diarrhea, and vomiting and lasted till we went home. We flew with WestJet and before we were to get on the plane, she threw up and was not well on the plane before take off. The stewardess noticed and gave her some water and a cold clothe, BUT had to do here job and she called MEDLINX (the airline doctor) We were then told we could not fly back home as they did not want to endanger the rest of the passengers on the flight. I completely understood and started to de-embark the plane with my 2 boys and sick wife. Westjet took control from there and made sure we were looked after. After we left the plane, we were meet by Mrs. Gomez-Cordova a westjet rep in Cancun and she was AMAZING!!!! Words could not express the gratitude we have for her and all the help she provided us while we were stranded at the airport. While my wife was seeing the doctor at the airport, Mrs Gomez-Cordova called my travel insurance company (Sunlife which were amazing as well) and got us booked into the Marriot down the street from cancun airport and on the earliest flight back to Toronto the next day. My family and I have travelled to the caribbean many times and this was the only time we have had a bad experience, it could happen to anyone! So, if you do book this resort please make sure tread with caution from our experience! Westjet and Sunlife took control of the situation and helped us out tremendously. Also, please be sure to keep an eye on all you personal belongings especially if travelling with kids and there Nineteno DS, Gameboys, or PSP's. I guess when my son put his DS back into my napsack he did not zip it up and someone took it. With what was going on at the time, I was not paying attention as I usaully do. All in all we figured out that the resort thing is not for us and we enjoying cruising.

But on our last day at check out I forgot my cell phone in the room and remembered about an hour later, they had already cleaned the room and I went to the front desk, they told me to go meet the manager at the room and I got my cell phone back in the condition I left it and they found a shirt left behind. Hotel-- Huge/Nice, bring your walking shoes. It wasn't to bad, but it's hot and wearing flip flops all day your feet start to hurt. Rooms-- Walk took about 15 mins from the lobby, we had a swim out pool, which was amazing! But the room smelled sooooo moldy! (When I got home everything smelled moldy...) No bugs. We did have a crab knock on our window at 7am. one morning haha which was intresting. The bathrooms... nice, the shower head presser sucks.... I have thick long hair, took forever to shower. We always took out belongings with us, so we had no theft. Food/Drinks-- Wasn't bad, but wasn't the best. You always found something you liked. Could not wait to get a good meal at home! Drinks were good, Corona on tap... Yum! Frozen drinks were good too! Nightlife-- Boring.... We did the party hopper one night and it was worth the money! Go to Coco Bongo, it was awesome! Pool/Beach-- We mainly stayed at our swim out pool, bring a raft to float around on. A couple of times these same kids would jump in where our swim out pool was and were annoying and their parents would just stand there and watch them, clearly I was relaxing on my raft floating by my room and they kids come screaming and splashing water. I was not to happy, but they didn't stay long maybe 15 mins. Parents need to keep their kids in check! The beach was nice, only went there one day. Didn't have any problems with towels.

I traveled with my family and some friends for my daughter's wedding (41 of us) ranging from a 5 yr. old to my parents who are in their 70's, I had my doubts about this resort reading all the bad reviews and somehow put them aside and decided to give it a try since my daughter really seemed to like this place. Well, I knew we were going to have some problems when we started to confirm our reservations and the hotel couldn't located some of the guests reservations considering that they were all booked at the same time. After endeless emails that were never answered and 10 or so long distance calls we decided to wait until our arrival. At our arrival they still couldn't locate some of the guests and came to find out that they were placed on the Sunset side. After 3 hours trying to get our rooms and checking in my parents room was on a third floor with an extremely long and complicated walk to the elevator. We asked for a room change and it took them 3 days for us to finally get them changed into a room closer to the other guests rooms. Most of the people in reception were pleasant except for one who I can really say needs a humans relation course. As far as the installations are concerned they are very well kept and the rooms are clean once you arrive however our rooms were never cleaned before 4:00 p.m. and they smelled of mildew even though we were on the second floor, some reiked of smoke and they could never get the smell out. Food and restaurants: For such a large group as ours it was impossible to get reservations even for 12 people into any of the restuarants and even if we tried to reserve in advance as they suggested it just never happened. The only restaurant that we dined in was Vaqueria's for 10 people and had to settle for a special menu. So it was buffett every day. The food was varied but after a week they repeat the menus. Unfortunately, this hotel does not cater to large groups. Drinks: We aren't drinkers, but the alcohol they serve is very cheap. The house wine tastes awful and as far as tequila, rum, gin, vodka's etc. they give you the cheapest on the market. The bartender's have their hands full trying to accomodate all the guests and please everyone they do the best with what the managment provides. Wedding staff and coordinator: I am pleased with the help my daughter and wife received from the wedding staff trying to coordinate her big day. Thank you for all your help! However, on the day of the event not all went according to plan. They had electrical problems with the equipment at the bar and it wasn't resolved until 20 minutes into the cocktail hour. Unfortunately for our family and guests. They served some snacks and fruit but they also some plates with chocolates and other pastries which on such a hot and humid day even at 5:30 p.m. didn't with stand the heat. My wife asked the personnel to have them removed and offered during the banquet and was completely ignored, such a waste of food and money. The banquet which was scheduled to be from 6:00 to 10:30 with a formal dinner was a complete choas. Thirty minutes into arriving at the banquet room the air conditioner stopped working. After requesting that this be repaired the only response was in less than 30 min. it would be corrected and working .IT WAS NEVER REPAIRED!!!! Our guests were very uncomfortable and the bride was so upset and sick from the heat in that room it was so hot that you could compare it to being on the beach at noon with out air Our food that was supposed to be served during an hour took 3 hours and none of the guests ate a warm meal or at the same time. The cake melted and the coffee service was never offered even though it was paid for. I guess they considered no one wanted coffee with sooooo much heat. UNBELIEVABLE!!! Management staff: After reporting all the mishaps and misfortunes to the coordinator who was not around during this ordeal but left an assisant to take care of things, said that she would look into seeing what could be done to compensate for this. Well needless to say what they offered was a complete joke a meal at one of the restaurants for 15 or 20 people. Give me a break any meal in any of their restaurants except for the Thai is included in your package. When we asked for it to be at Tapas and not Fleurs like they wanted they said that they couldn't accomodate us. Well, the people in consiergs were very nice except for a Ms. Gina Gonzalez who is the public relations person in this hotel. I don't know where she studied but there was no interest in here to better my daughter's situation and all the fustration that her husband and my wife went through trying to resolve these problems that arose. After days and many visits to the consiergs office they finally had an interview with a Mr. Carlos Velazques who is an assistant resident subdirector after he reviewed and according to him made the necessary investigations to verify that all that was reported had occured had the audacity to offer them a measly 500 dollars after we spent thousands to accomodate 41 people for more than a week and had from platinum suites to Jr. Suites and the wedding package alone was customized to our liking. WE SHOULD OF GONE ELSE WHERE. When my daughter explained and tried to reason and compromise for at least something more than that the initial offere was withdrawn and was accused of being rude. Give me a break they ruin your wedding day and make you run around like crazy trying to see someone to make up for the inconvieniences and they expect you to be calm, cool and collected, let me tell you this really STRESSED BOTH MY DAUGHTER, SON IN-LAW AND WIFE OUT! And like they said this is B.S. One good reason never to come back or even recommend this hotel not for large groups or personalized weddings anyway. The Spa and beauty services are also a rip off.

It is a large resort and very beautiful. I would not say that it is too large. I enjoyed walking around the resort. The food is average for a all inclusive not great but not bad either. The rooms are large and have good beds. I must say that this is the first time that I have had a good sleep in a bed in Mexico. I have been to Mexico 6 times and the beds here were the best yet. The Check in was fast and easy. I can't comment on the bell boy service as I choose to take my luggage to our room my self. If you decide to do the same look for the elevator, it is around the corner behind the lobby bar, which is on the other side of the stairs from the check in. Now for the honest truth. The service at this hotel is poor the waiter staff are not to on the ball. I was there for 7 days and I did not receive good service once in the buffet. The bar staff is pretty much the same. They will see you standing there and go about there business and then ask you what you would like. I found that to be frustrating. The service at all of the bars were the same. I can not comment on the restaurants because I never ate at any of them. The beach was narrow I would not say that it was small but I would say that it was narrow. Very hard to find a place to lay down. With all of the reviews I read about stuff being stolen I did not want to take a chance with my money so I carried it with me everywhere. This made for not a very relaxing holiday. One more thing about t he buffets you could not get a mixed drink in there only beer, pop, wine and water, juice. I found this to be weird considering the hotel was rated a 5 star. I have stayed at 4 stars and gotten mixed drinks. We went to the disco 3 nights that we were there andteach night it housed the same crowd young adults probably aged 18 to 26. Music was not to my liking\" all rap\". The sports bar is quite but there are children in there playing pool so if you are trying to get away without kids it may be difficult. There are many pools here as well but all the activities are at the main pool it is the second one on your right when walking from the lobby. If you want a good spot get there around 830 am. Towels well that is another thing they are only available at weird times so bring your own if you want a dry one. that is what we did. Towel shack is closed from 1 to 4 every day. We brought BUBBA Kegs with us thank you to the person on trip advisor that suggested it. The bar tenders where okay filling them. The marble floors are everywhere and I did not find them to be slippery but the cement walks were after it rained. Also I was a little disapointed to find that there was no where to get food other than the buffet or the sports bar. Would have been nice to get food at the pool or at the beach. There is a bar at the beach which is nice. I was at the Barcelo 2 years ago and would say that it was a much nicer resort for what I like the beach there was fabulous and the service was great and food everywhere. Beds hard though and rooms not as up to date furnishings. Would I go back to the Princess probably not , but that's just because I really enjoyed the service I received at other resorts. Shopping here well there really is not much all I saw was 2 jewelery stores and 2 other stores. Cappacino well that is available at the lobby bars and the sports bars not in the buffets, another disappointment for me. Tipping well I suggest to everyone save your tips for the house cleaners and the mini fridge guy they were excellent give them extra and don't bother with the wait staff or bartenders I found it to be no different when I was tipping and when I was not for service. Our rooms were cleaned every day before noon which was very nice. We traveled through West Jet vacations and they were excellent will most definitely travel through them again best service on plain and transfers to hotel I have ever received. Happy travels to all that are going on a vacation I wish I was still their but just with a little better service. If you are going here watch out for little red ants they like to bite and they are everywhere even in town so I think this is something that you can't avoid traveling in the summer. Other than the little red ants I never saw not one other bug or mosquito. One more little bit of advice you don't need to purchase bug spray if going to Xel Ha there are no bugs there either, save your money. If you are going for a full day to Xel Ha ask when booking so that you get there on time and not at 1030 like us we ended up getting there at 1030 not knowing that if we booked on a Tuesday we would have been there at 9 instead. Money exchange you are best to exchange down town in Playa you will get better rates than at the hotel.

I was with a pretty large group : around 14 ppl and stayed for 11 days. Reasons I didn't like this hotel: mostly because of terrible/non-existant service. 1- When trying to book restaurants we were told we can only reserve up to 3 days in advance, and if we all wanted to sit together, we would have to have a set menu i.e. everybody has to pick the same thing and eat it! How ludicrous! And if not, we would have to split both tables and wouldn't be able to sit near each other... All of that is if we actually get a reservation! We tried several days to book them, and we never could, until we got sick of the service, threw a tantrum and actually got the manager of all the restaurants to accommodate us. He was honestly the only person in that whole hotel who valued some sort of customer service. After complaining several times at the front desk and getting frustrated someone in our group told them :\" I can't believe this is a 5 star hotel!\" They responded with:\"Well if you want 5 star service, you have to act like a 5 star client!\" Can you believe that?! 2- Don't even think about trying to talk to a manager, they're never on the property... If ever something's wrong they send you to the concierge to try to \"resolve it\". But you end up more frustrated than when you walked in! One of them refused to speak to us in english because she thought we spoke spanish!! 3- Several of our rooms (I would say 75%) were crawling with bugs. In my case, we had to call someone to change our sheets twice, and spray our room 3 times (on different days)! After the 3rd time, the man suggested he leave me the bug spray! And I definitely needed it because the bugs definitely returned! 4- Men: don't forget to pack pants if you want to go to an \u00e0 la carte restaurant, they will not let you in without them! And they will be rude about it too! 5- On the last day in this God forsaken hotel, the bellman never came to one of our rooms to pick up the luggage, so we had to drag them all to the lobby which was like a 10-12 minute walk. The food was good, but the lunch menu never changes... Pools were gross, beach was alright but kind of rocky and smelly on some days... Honestly the best part was the excursions and the beach volleyball", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york city", "Title": "\u201cDO U PROMISE TO TELL THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH?

We spent a week at the GPR, a family of four adults and four teenagers. When we arrived the beauty of this hotel took my breath away, beautifully designed,well maintained and HUGE! we 'supposedly' paid for 3 junior suites but they 'UPGRADED\" us to Junior Suite Deluxe, this is where the scam begins, they gave us 2 rooms by the beach and 1 by the lobby, of course the beach rooms were VERY FAR from the lobby so they told us they would transport our luggage and meet us at the rooms with them, for the 2 rooms by the beach there were 5 pieces of luggage, and we had locks on 4 of them. We arrived to the rooms, 6013 and 6105 the rooms were also very nice huge king sized bed, jacuzzi, lcd t.v. and a balcony, very impressing. The luggage was in the rooms as promised with the exception of the bag without the lock, we called the front desk they said they would call us back in 10 min, 40 minutes passed no luggage nor phone call, we called again they told us they would bring it in an hour, the bag showed up in a hour. Next we decided to go to the beach again the property is beautiful the grass was well manicured, the pools were nice and plentiful. We arrived on beach and were shocked the water was brown, the seating area was small! We ended up at one of the pools after the pool we went to the buffet, the food was the same the whole week! We booked restaurants it took about an hour! Make sure u go to Xcaret and Xplor SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!!!!!! Take the free shuttle bus to Playa del Carmen make sure to book the shuttle a day before! The entertainment was good,the drinks were ok, this resort is so big that there is a trolley that takes u back and forth make sure to bring bug repellant the mosquitos r ferocious! When u r leaving the resort the staff asks for ur room number thanks to reading prior reviews we gave fake room numbers because this is when they enter ur room, on our 3rd day, I left my bf in the room and went to have breakfast when I came back he said someone entered the room and he thought it was me and said my name 3 times he then jumped up and a lady ran out of the room and just said HOLA as she was entering another room with a card! Our last night we had dinner at Las Olas upon entering we were asked for our room numbers and to hand over the receipt which had the room numbers, after dinner we walked back to the rooms and heard one of our family members scream, we ran up and her room door was OPEN and ALL OF HER CLOTHES and souvenirs were stolen out of her luggage, this was the same luggage that did not have the lock and came 1hour and 40 min after ours the first day.We called security and that was a joke after 3 of us informed the security 'chief' that we were law enforcement officers and showed our badges 2 of the security guys said they would be right back they said they had to read the card detector machine to see who was the last person in the room, it was pitch black and this resort is huge the 2 security guys came back within 4 minutes with half of the stolen clothes in plastic bags and said they found them on the lawn! The next day our family member who had the room by the lobby had $100 stolen from her room! It wa sour last day so we stopped at the concierge to report everything and they had a HUGE STACK of reports from other people ehoomhad belongings stolen from them. One couple on the trolley with us mentioned that someone walked into their room at 3 a.m. and when they jumped up and asked who was there, the person said they were from the concierge and ran! This place employs A LOT of people so it very difficult to keep track of everything and everyone! It is so sad because this place is truly beautiful. I hope this review helps someone, if u do choose to go here make sure u read the good and the bad about this resort and make sure u keep ur luggage LOCKED when u leave ur room!

Please take my honest advice about this hotel. We are not complainers, and we have been to numerous all-inclusives in mexico. We were first amazed by the elegant appearance of the hotel when we entered it. The hotels are side by side, so it is like two super huge resorts put together with the pools in the middle. The lobby was beautiful on both sides of the resort. There was marble flooring all over the resort, which did cause a problem if there was even the slightest bit of water. My husband fell 3 times and injured himself, bleeding nose and mouth. Beware of the floor everywhere you go in the resort, you can not escape it. The customer service at the resort was terrible. From long waits to get your luggage to any other problem that you may have had. When we first entered our expensive swim-up room we though that it was really nice....until we found over 200 mosquitoes all over the room. There was blood all over the walls of the bedroom and bathroom from killed bugs. The rooms around the pool (swim-up) smelt terribly bad...to the point i would rather sit on the balcony. You need to blast your ac and fan to rid the smell a little. SO DISGUSTING!!! We moved rooms three times on our honeymoon and were never compensated a penny or an extra. The buzz around the hotel the whole trip was that it was terrible. No one working there can help you if there is a problem, the people at the front desk were absolutely useless. The pools were full of drunks (which i don't mind terribly bad) and children that are screaming and uncontrollable. Perfect place for a big ol' family reunion but terrible if you are trying to relax on your honeymoon. NOTE TO PARENTS: control your freaking kids, you are ruining others vacations. The entertainment staff was very interesting. If you have kids, as a warning you will be angered. They flaunt their bodies and grab themselves in-front of the guests. All they are interested in is hot girls...and touching them. They advertise the club coco bongos everyday. If you like to go out and dance and love music...go!!! We had so much fun, best night because we got off the terrible resort. The food was mediocre at best. The a la cartes were terrible, especially the fondue...what a joke. They give you a big pot of cheese (mozzarella) and you dip your gravyed meats into it. The drink were also disappointing. I love miami vices at every other resort I have been to and these were awful. Everything was made of red and white sugar syrup...yuk!!! We had the worst time. We feel that we were totally cheated. Please consider this before you go, i wouldn't want you to have the same experience. Honeymooners do not come here!!! Please! The only thing we were pleased with at the resort was the beach, very beautiful! We also went into playa 3 nights, had amazing dinners. That was worth the trip. We loved our time outside the resort.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoney Creek", "Title": "\u201cA Trip to Remember\u201d", "Author": "ddcosta", "ReviewID": "UR75597226", "Content": "This was our very first trip as a family, and so we really wanted it to be special. We went with WestJet Vacations to The Grand Riviera Princess in Mayan Riviera. OMG! The hotel was beautiful, and we were upgraded from the Jr. Suite to a Jr. Deluxe. The rooms were huge and modern. We were really happy . The cleaning staff, the ground keepers and bar tenders were all very polite and acknowledged you whenever they passed. Very kind people. The resort is HUGE, and when I read this before in other reviews, I thought...Big deal...so put on your walking shoes and suck it up...but honestly...walking in that heat can be wearying...I don't know how older people did it. The buffet was excellent. After day three it did get a bit monotonous, same stuff, in a different variation....but again the service was great. We had our 4 teenagers with us....21, 18, 16 & 15. There was not a lot for them to do at night. The two younger ones wanted to go to the club with their siblings, but because their wrist bands indicated they were under age...they weren't allowed in...but really, the club wasn't a happening place anyways. The teen disco went from 7:30 to 9:30, but it was filled with \"tweens\", so the 15 & 16 year old didn't want to go. The saving grace was they ended up meeting a ton of kids their own ages in the pool, and at volley ball during the day...and so they would make a date to meet all of them in the sports bar around 9:30, and hang out then...but again, they would hang out in the sports bar, or on the grounds, there wasn't anything that they could do, and they all wanted to dance. So that was disappointing. If you want to snorkel, don't do it on the beach...go to Tulum, and you can get a package that includes your snorkeling....the snorkeling at Tulum is soooooo much better! And it works out cheaper. The cab system is amazing, and for four of us to go to Tulum it cost $110.00 USD return for four of us. Much cheaper than the Best Day deal through the Hotel. Also don't take the Hotel shuttle to Playa Del Carmen, it only run twice a day...unless you LOVE to shop. We took a cab in and back, and it cost us $13 USD each way, and we had the freedom to come and go as we pleased. The shows that were in the middle of the main bar, were fantastic. The broadway shows were fine, but they lip sinced to everything, which we thought was bizarre. But the main bar shows were fabulous. They had Flaminco Dancers one night, a Mariache band another, Flame experts another night, and all kinds of really interesting entertainment, so we enjoyed that as opposed to the 9:30 show in the big hall upstairs. All in all, we all had a fantastic vacation. Relaxing and memorable, and that is exactly what we wanted. We didn't gain any weight, because we did so much walking, but thats a good thing...lol. I hope you have a great vacation.

The curtains had mildew growing on it and the smell was awful. However, when we complained next day they changed the room for us. The second room we got was fine (probably 40% hotel vacancy helped - easy for them to move us to address our complaint) The people working there are very very hard working and friendly. The maid didn't quite live up to our expectation. She didn't fill up the items such as kleenex or toilet paper (luckily we never ran out of the toilet papers) The worst part of this hotel is the beach. It stinks - we read the bad review before, but we really didn't expect this bad smell. We spent most of the swimming time at the pool. The main attraction is the beach - and smells sulfur. Some review said sewage, but we couldn't confirm this - so I won't say it is sewage but it sure smells bad. This is the main reason we gave one star. We would not come back even everything else is well. Why would you go to hotel by the beach if you really cannot use the beach. We recommend booking somewhere else. If you like excursion, it would be better if you book a hotel near Tulum. It is closer to various activities. Or if you like Playa de Carmen, book a hotel close to the town. Bus is very inconvenient. Tax will charge $25 USD to Playa de Carmen one way. Xcaret will cost $50 one way...(without activity cost) expensive.

After reading the negative reviews, I was extremely nervous about my stay but we all loved it. Arrival - The front desk staff was friendly and my check-in was a breeze. All of my requests were met (room on an upper floor, ocean view, king size bed) with no problem. My room was ready at exactly 3:00pm as promised and my suitcases were dropped off shortly after. Whether it helped or not I\u2019m not sure but, I e-mailed all of these requests to the hotel 2 weeks before my stay. I received a reply from them within a half hour saying my requests had been noted and they would do their best to grant them. Grounds - The grounds of the hotel are immaculate. They are perfectly manicured and constantly being cleaned. It is a bit of a walk to the lobby (almost half a mile from the beach) but the grounds and statues are so beautiful, especially at night, that I didn\u2019t mind it at all. I also never had a problem catching the trolley. Room - Our room was beautiful and clean. My only complaint \u2013 there was not enough space for our clothing. We had a closet which some hangers but there were no drawers. The house keeping staff was phenomenal and kept our room spotless the entire stay. I did notice, as many people mentioned, they enter the room very quickly in the morning (after only one knock and a pause). To avoid this, I just locked my door with the deadbolt before I went to sleep at night. There was turn down service at night and chocolates left on our bed. I had only one problem with ants in my room but that was because I left chocolate cake out and uncovered. Once I threw it out, they didn\u2019t come back. Food/Drinks - I would recommend making your dinner reservations as soon as possible. Since we stayed Platinum, I saw the concierge (William) first thing. I made reservations for a special dinner offered to Platinum guests, Japanese, Mexican and Italian. At first William told me the Italian restaurant was booked for my entire stay but I explained I wouldn\u2019t accept that. By later that day he came to find me by the Platinum pool with my reservation for the Italian restaurant. Breakfast was great with almost too many good things to choose from. I enjoyed the French toast, muffins, omelets, yogurt w/granola, fruit both dried and fresh (the mango is amazing). Lunch was good. My favorites were the salsa/guacamole with chips, shrimp ceviche, grilled fish (different everyday and grilled to your liking) and fajitas. Now the dinners - the special Platinum dinner was good. I had lobster, steak, steamed veggies and a baked potato. The Japanese was fun and the food (steak, shrimp, chicken, veggies and fried rice) was good but it was salty. I personally like salt but I can see how people wouldn\u2019t be happy. The Mexican was the best and I would highly recommend it. I had quesadillas, salsa w/chips, tomato and avocado soup, and chicken fajitas and I enjoyed all of it. I wish I saved room for dessert because it looked great, peanut brittle, chocolate cake, cream puffs etc. After all the fuss, I never made it to the Italian restaurant but opted to do the buffet which had a Mexican theme night. It was okay. The ice cream at the buffets is addicting especially the coconut and almond flavors. The drinks were great and trust me they will make them as strong as you want them. I loved the margaritas and electric lemonade. There were also waitresses walking around the pool and beach in the mornings and afternoons with fruit, cheese, sandwiches and pastry platters. Beach/Pool - I stayed in the Platinum section of the beach and never had a problem getting chairs or a hut at any hour of the morning/afternoon. The Platinum section also had a towel stand on the beach which was great. The waitresses were extremely friendly and attentive. I would give my waitress $15 and tell her to keep bringing the drinks every 20 minutes and without fail by the time my cup was empty she was there with another. The ocean water was brownish but it seemed to get less and less as the days when by. It didn\u2019t bother me because you could enter the water to the left or right of the \u2018brown spot\u2019 and avoid it. When you walk into the water it is extremely rocky but as you go out further it becomes soft sand. The Platinum pool has the most comfortable chairs and day beds and was often very quiet and relaxing during the day. The Fantasy pool had all the action, loud music, games, and a crowded swim-up bar. We would often spend the afternoons there and had a great time. Again, we never had a problem finding chairs at any time around the pool. *Be careful because the floor around the pool and in the restrooms is very slippery. Platinum Service - I can\u2019t recommend the Platinum service enough. The lounge was great \u2013 computers with free internet, newspapers, towels, bar (which also served coffee and espresso), and snacks including soft serve ice cream. The concierge, William, was extremely helpful and friendly. He made all of our dinner reservations and appointments for our free massages at the spa. FYI - If you stay Platinum for 4 or more nights you are eligible for the free massages (contrary to what the hotel\u2019s website says). I loved the Platinum pool, especially the day beds which were great for a nap in the late afternoon. Please note that I took all of the negative things I read prior to my trip and used them to properly prepare myself. I made sure to keep my money, cameras, cell phones etc hidden (not in the safe) or on me and I had no theft problems. I also read a lot about mosquitoes so I made sure to bring plenty of bug spray and I didn\u2019t have any bites. They also provide bug repellent wipes in the room. All of the people in my party loved the resort and would consider returning.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeware !!!\u201d", "Author": "piatek", "ReviewID": "UR74605948", "Content": "I went to this hotel July 4 for a week with my wife and a 8 year old.

Staff were lovely and very friendly - even after long hot hours serving in the bars they still had a smile and a joke. I would agree with other reviews about the restaurants - you need to book several days in advance - but most of the ones we tried were worth going through the booking process.

The wine in the buffet restaurants was not nice!! If sparkling wine was available that was drinkable but red, white and rose were not good. The food was very salty - but that maybe just a personal thing.

The resort is made up of two hotels the Princess and Sunset, both are a mirror image of the other and guests can use both sides for facilities. Check-in was smooth and we were shown straight to our rooms, our luggage arriving 10 minutes after we did. The rooms are well appointed and we had a free upgrade to Delux Junior Suite, which we wanted to book originally with First Choice but were not offered. Room 7211 was very central, had comfortable beds, a good minibar, spotlessly clean interior, large bathroom with jaccuzi, balcony, fresh towels and toiletries are provided daily. A word of warning - the floors in your room and around the hotel are very slippy when wet. The 8 A la carte restaurants are excellent but have to be booked in advance which you are able to book 3 days ahead. This can be time consuming but if you do it to fit into other visits to the Lobby is no hardship. There are also 3 buffet restaurants, a 24 hour sports bar serving food and drinks, a lunchtime grill and afternoon tea served in the Lobby Bar. There are many bars around the resort and even an adults only Piano Bar all serving plentiful supplies of local and international alcohol, cocktails, soft drinks, coffee etc. Also various shops and a weekly market on site for those who want to shop. As I said the resort is quite large and takes 7-10 minutes to walk from the Lobby to the sea, but no where as near the time that some people have said on their reviews of 30 minutes, anyway what\u2019s the rush, you\u2019re on holiday! I would however say that this resort is more suitable for those who are more mobile although a shuttle bus travels around the resort and all areas have lifts to all floors. The grounds and communal areas are immaculate and staff worked tirelessly to keep them that way, each of them greeting you with a pleasant \u2018hola\u2019 as you pass. If you can use a little Spaniash in coversation please do so, it is really appreciated. The international entertainment staff also worked hard keeping all ages entertained throughout the day and evening. Each evening they put on a show in the Theatre, yes some of them were cheesy but enjoyable. The resort is right in the middle of the Riviera Maya so is easily accessible to all the attractions such as Xel-Ha, Xplore, Xcaret, Tulum, Cozumel, Cancun, Cenotes, scuba, snorkelling, Coco Bongos, water sports etc We have tried them all over the past few years and enjoyed them all. The First Choice/Thomson Reps, Adrianna and Carlos are also Mexican and full of useful information, trips booked with them were no more expensive than other operators. The hotel also runs a free shuttle bus to and from Playa del Carmen each day. Some reviews mentioned things being taken from rooms and safes although we did not hear of anything whilst we were there, obviously we did take precautions just to be on the safe side and were sensible with what we left on show. Covered sun loungers are taken up early and however much you do not want to join the crowd that put out towels early in the morning, you are forced to do so to get some cover from the blistering heat. There are however a plentiful supply of non covered sun loungers should you not want to get up early and the many pools available for a welcoming dip to cool down. The beach is pure white sand but the sea floor is quite rocky in some areas, either enter further to the right or wear beach shoes. We found the resort mainly made up of American and French Canadian visitors, which did begin to \u2018grate\u2019 on us after a while as they became louder (and louder) when in a group of two or more and also rude to the point of clicking fingers at staff and also they did not see why they should wait to be seated at a table, instead just walking past the queue to a free table, disregarding those waiting patiently in line. The Mexican staff are very friendly people and very hard working, they really did deserve a \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018thank you\u2019, a few of the words that so many of these guests seemed to forget. Probably these people are the ones responsible for the negative reviews that the resort has received! Please make up your own mind - the resort and staff are great and a holiday is what you make of it. Overall a very good experience, good accommodation, good food, central to all attractions, very friendly local people, spotlessly clean, plenty to do and a holiday that we all thoroughly enjoyed.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't have been happier!!\u201d", "Author": "Aliciamarie0307", "ReviewID": "UR73498711", "Content": "I was hesitant to book a trip to this hotel because I have seen some bad reviews in the past.

We really enjoyed this vacation. We concerned after reading so many negative reviews, but we were very pleasantly surprised. The service at this resort was very good. We were greeted upon arrival and always felt taken care of. After checking in, we went right over to make our reservations. I was really concerned about this, but it was a breeze. We were able to make reversations for our first four nights right away. We were able to eat between 6:00-6:30 every night. Miso (Japanese) and Vaquero (steak house) were our favorites. We also tried the French and italian which were just ok. The buffet is nice, but it does get to be a little repetitive. I'm extremely picky and never had a problem finding something to eat. We loved the swim up suite. Our side seemed to be much more private. We never had a problem getting a chair, and their was a bar maybe 20 yards away. If fact, on one day, one of the bartenders would come down and check to see if we needed another drink. This typically wasn't a problem because we had our Bubba Kegs in hand (thanks to everyone for that advice). Our room was very clean, and we used our jacuzzi almost every night. I run every morning, so I enjoyed runing on the grounds. I checked, and it was .6 miles from the lobby to the beach so there is a lot of walking involved. We enjoyed it and never used the shuttle. The grounds are immaculate. We tended to stay in our swim up area, but the one day we spent at one of the swim up bars was a lot of fun. We used our room safe and didn't have anything turn up missing. The negatives we noticed were the beach. It is pretty rocky, and the water turns brown with an odor after it rains hard (run off from the wooded area). There were also a lot of mosquitos once it got dark (including a few in our room we took care of). We saw hotel staff spraying several times so I'm not sure what the hotel could do to remedy this. There is a lot of standing water wo that would explain the problem. We took the tour through Edventure. I highly, highly, highly recommend this. We paid $122 per person which included our guide taking our pictures with an underwater camera. It sounds pricey, but for everything included, it would cost much more if you took different tours. We also took an ATV/Secret Cave tour which was fun (except for the van ride to their offices).

The resort is actually marketed as two resorts \u2013 the Riviera and the Sunset, though it is all one complex with separate lobbies. Both sides are identical in terms of appearance and amenities. I\u2019ve tried to keep this comprehensive and to the point, although I tend to write long reviews (so be warned). I hope it helps, and by all means feel free to email me with any questions. The tour operator, flight and check-in: Our tour operator was Sunquest. The flight down was to be expected \u2013 cramped and uncomfortable, although the meals were palatable and the staff were friendly and accommodating. The in-flight movies were horrendous though (Free Willy 3? Really?) but we arrived safely and were escorted to the resort without incident. Check-in was actually terrible \u2013 we had a very early morning flight and arrived at the resort at 11am. We waited in line for 45 minutes, only to be advised that we could not check into our rooms until after 3pm. Having been awake for 24 hours and arriving to a torrential downpour and foul weather, our moods were less than cheerful and we were not overly impressed at that point. Once we checked in, we had to wait 3 hours for our luggage to be delivered to our room, which was probably the most irritating situation up to that point. We were desperate to shower, brush our teeth, and change, but we called the lobby 3 times and were told each time that it would be another 5 minutes. When we said we would be happy to come get the luggage ourselves, we were told we had to wait. Very annoying! Eventually it did manage to arrive intact and undisturbed. The Rooms: Upon check in, we inquired about an upgrade to the platinum suites (none were available when we booked our package with our travel agent). We were advised that none were available or expected to become available for several days, but the Junior Deluxe Swim-Up rooms were available on the Riviera side. We took that upgrade, and frankly we were extremely pleased with it. The room was beautiful (#31059), and although they didn\u2019t have a king bed for us at that time, we had two doubles and it was fine. The walk-out from the room directly to the pool was really great, and because we were on the quiet side of the resort, it was really lovely and restful. It actually turned out to be a far superior upgrade to the platinum suites in terms of location and amenities. The platinum suites are on the far end of the resort on the beach, and are thus at 10 minute walk to the lobby and entertainment area, in addition to a large majority of the a la carte restaurants. There are also no swim-up rooms with the platinum suites, and after having access to one at this resort, I would recommend them over the upgrade any day. The only thing I would have enjoyed would have been the unlimited internet access, but being on vacation, I tried to force myself to live without its constant presence (a hard thing for me to do!). As a side note, I received the impression that the Platinum suites were not the safest place on the resort, as many people reported that they had valuables stolen and that safes had been raided while they were gone. The room service was sporadic and unreliable. We had turn-down service on a few evenings, though inexplicably not on others. In addition, on one day our room wasn\u2019t even cleaned at all, and we had to call housekeeping to bring us fresh towels. It was somewhat annoying, as tipping didn\u2019t seem to make any difference. If you don\u2019t want to be disturbed, make sure you put the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign on the door, or the staff will just barge in after one quick knock (one time when I was only partly dressed\u2026pretty awkward). The Resort and the food: In one word: gorgeous. It really was beautiful, well-kept, clean and modernized. The gardens were lovely, the pools (with the exception of the central \u201cparty\u201d pool, which was questionable-looking at the best of times) and common-areas were all immaculate. The only major issue is the sheer size of the resort \u2013 it is monstrous, and certainly the biggest resort I have ever been to before. It\u2019s a very long (and hot) walk from one end to the other, although there is a little transport train that runs approximately every 15 minutes. Most of the time it seemed longer, and we usually gave up and walked. Due to the extreme heat, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for people with low stamina or health problems that would make walking difficult, although the resort IS wheelchair accessible. If you get into some kind of trouble, I suspect you\u2019re on your own for quite a while, with help not easily accessible (case in point: We observed a woman who was completely unconscious being piggy-backed by a friend back to the main resort, while another friend was walking behind the two trying to hoist the girl up. Honestly, it was a very long walk at that point, and if there was something critically wrong with her, she could have been in serious trouble by the time they got help. I don\u2019t know, as I never saw them again). The moral of the story \u2013 get some decent travel/health insurance! The resort is family-friendly, though not having children yet ourselves, we didn\u2019t really appreciate this fact. Our fault for not buying a package at an adults-only, so I can\u2019t complain about this, but keep this in mind if you are looking for a child-free zone for your holiday. Also, we happened to see a boy who couldn\u2019t have been more than 14 (at MOST) stumbling out of the bar late one night with his laughing family supporting his body and presumably hauling him back to his room. We were horrified \u2013 there is no excuse for this, no matter where you are in the world. The resort should be much more vigilant in protecting children and monitoring whether they are consuming alcohol or not. The food, overall, was very good for a resort. The buffets were the best we have experienced at a resort, although like any buffet, it did tend to get monotonous towards the end. The only problem I had was the lack of fresh vegetables or salad selection - but other than that, I found the rest of the food to be of a fairly high quality. We tried several of the a la carte restaurants: the Mexican (mediocre), the Fondue (pretty good), the Tapas (very good), the Teppenyaki/Japanese (very good), and the International (EXCELLENT). You can only book two nights at a time, however, which again was somewhat annoying, especially considering every restaurant was only filled to at most, one third of its potential capacity. I\u2019m assuming this had to do with staffing considerations \u2013 gourmet food (sometimes\u2026or at least close to it) for no additional charge leads me to believe the resort was trying to contain the cost and were not willing to bring in additional servers. A lot of people grumped about not getting a reservation as a result of the restaurant being \u201cfull,\u201d only to see that there was plenty of room for more people. Oh well...we booked and never had a problem. Entertainment: We attended one show and it was fine. (I find all resort entertainment to be the same-old, same-old). There was a disco that was a pretty happenin\u2019 place. Aside from a peek, we didn\u2019t spend any time in there though, and spent most of our evenings in the lobby bar (or the piano bar, which is lovely). We met the most amazing people at this resort, and had a really fabulous time getting to know them, so the \u201centertainment\u201d to us had more to do with the people than the resort itself! The \u201csports bar\u201d was small and lacked seating. It was full of kids or parents with their kids and thus it was very noisy. The bar served some really tasty hamburgers though, which were great if you were looking for a late-night snack after a night at the bar! Excursions: We didn\u2019t book the excursions to the ruins in Tulum or Chichen Itza as we initially wanted to as a result of our fear of the weather (we caught the tail end of a hurricane on the way in and had inclement weather throughout the stay, though we did have periods of sunshine at least!). We did book a last minute ATV excursion, which was really fun. I was somewhat disappointed with the \u201ccave exploration\u201d component of that excursion, as the pictures from other providers showed some really beautiful cenotes and caves that we didn\u2019t get to see with our tour provider (we booked through Sunquest, though there are many other providers who work on the resort and provide the same excursions, and presumably they take you to different sites). You must go into Playa Del Carmen. This town is extremely touristy but still worth the visit. A cab there will cost you $13.00 (USD) and takes about 15 minutes to get there from the resort. We walked around and picked up some tequila, and had two of the best margaritas we\u2019ve ever had in one of the restaurants off the beaten track (beyond the most touristy area, though sadly I couldn\u2019t tell you where as I have no idea myself). I recommend waiting to use the internet at a caf\u00e9 in town - the internet at the resort is about $10 USD for 30 minutes, which is ridiculous. In town we paid 8 pesos for 30 minutes (About a dollar). The Beach: Beautiful, but rough. The sand was powder soft, and white. There were a few days where it was calm enough on the beach to tan and lay in peace, however on a few days there was such a strong wind that the sand would whip over you - painfully. We retreated to our pool on those days, but we\u2019re beach people at heart and we were disappointed in the weather. The water was beautiful but very choppy \u2013 there were no water sports that I observed at any point. I\u2019m not sure if the resort provides these or not, but they are hardly responsible for the weather and I certainly can\u2019t fault them for it. I would imagine that post-raining season the beach is superb. During the good periods, there was never a lack of chairs (nor around the pool areas) and palapas were always available. Miscellaneous: The most obnoxious thing I found was the \u201cCoco Bongo\u201d sponsorship at the resort. Coco Bongo is a \u201cworld famous\u201d club, though I can\u2019t attest to that because we didn\u2019t go. During our sunquest meeting, our tour guide conveniently pointed out that he always goes on a Tuesday, because it\u2019s ladies night, and he would love to get a big group to come with him. We declined (we aren\u2019t into the club scene), but this became a recurrent theme throughout our stay. At the main pool area, the entertainment were constantly harping about the club. There were Coco Bongo posters around the pool. At the show in the evening, they stopped halfway through to wave a Coco Bongo flag around the stage and encourage people to attend. When I approached one of the entertainment staff, I asked what the deal was. I was told that they get a commission for everyone they bring in to the club. Enough already! They warn you about the time-share providers that approach you, but Coco Bongo marketing was by far the most aggressive. Other people kept commenting on this as well, so I feel better knowing I wasn\u2019t the only one annoyed by this ;). If you are still interested in going though, it\u2019s about 5 dollars cheaper to go with one of the entertainment staff. A huge issue at many resorts has to do with the mosquito population\u2026 I can happily report that mosquitoes are most certainly NOT a problem at this resort (although I got a few nasty bites from something that felt more like a horsefly bite than a mosquito). I didn\u2019t have to wear bug spray at all. Definitely an enormous thumbs-up there! That\u2019s it really. It\u2019s a great resort, but taking everything into consideration, it felt more like a really nice 4 star than a 5 star in many respects. If you really want to upgrade, I highly recommend the swim-up junior deluxe rooms, which are less expensive and a much better bang for your buck. There really was something for everyone at this resort \u2013 parties if you party, calm if you don\u2019t, and lots to do, see\u2026and eat! A truly great vacation.

If your not happy with this resort then don't be cheap and go pay more for some of the other resorts in the area.... We got a great deal for our 7 day stay, and considering what we paid was well worth it! The rooms are beautiful and very modern, comfortable beds and always clean. We left tip every day and only asked once for extra towels and had 8 large towels every day in our room after that! Fridge was always restocked, never had to ask for anything! The swim up room was very nice, great little added bonus to have. The food... We ate at the buffet almost every night and never complained. There is so much choice and you will always find something you like! The first night we got there, they were cooking lobster tails and steaks on the grill... how can you really complain when you get that at a buffet?!!! We only went to the Japanese resturant which was ok... for a group of 14 it was difficult to book the restaurants, so we opted for the buffet. At lunch the bbq with hamburgers and hot dogs was really nice if you didn't want to dry up and go to a buffet. Staff.... Best animation team I've ever seen! We mostly stayed at the party pool and had a great time! The girl animators were kinda boring but the guys were so friendly and entertaining. Oscar and Leo deserve a raise if management reads this!! They made our week!!!! They are always in a great mood!! The shows were fun too! All the employees were very friendly, always saying hi. It does help if you speak spanish a little.. if anyone here says the staff were unfriendly and rude maybe you should try smiling and answering hello. The staff are not the rude ones! Ok now onto the bad.... Beach... water was not nice! A little disappointing, but I prefer the pool anyways. If your looking for a beautiful beach and are complaining.... stop yapping and just go to cuba! Chairs... Not enough chairs when the resort is full. And barely any in the shade.

You shouldn't have to go to a 5 star resort and worry about theft.

However, if you have any reservations about an all inclusive resort, DO NOT stay here, it will put a damper on your trip. Reasons I did not like this hotel: -It was unnecessarily enormous. We stayed at the Platinum suites near the beach, and the walk to the lobby if you strolled at a leisurely pace was about 6-8 minutes. There is a shuttle, but, it made leaving the hotel to go anywhere that much longer. - The rooms smelled very bad. I am not picky at all but the rooms smelled like mildew and dirt. If you yawned, you would get the taste of it in your mouth. - The beach was not nice. There was this brown shmegma that would float from one end of the beach to the other throughout the day. This brown stuff also smelled. The beach is also rocky where you enter the water, so you have to be careful. Its fine once you get past the rocks, but, its not an inviting strip of water at all. - The hotel is NOT walking distance to Playa Del Carmen. It is a 10 minute cab ride. So dont be deceived by the way they portray this place. If you have taste turn the other way and do not stay here. If you care about natural beauty and want to experience the Mayan Riviera the way it should be, do not stay here. Go to Tulum :) its lovely. The resorts are small and preserve the beauty of the natural environment. Stick up to your friends and refuse to go all inclusive.

The food was pretty much the same every day, quality average, nothing great, 4 buffetts with just one person serving pasta,omellettes (line could be up to 20 minutes) restaurants (4-5 I believe?) were ok, but always reserved, couldn't get to try them all. To get in the buffet also had to wait, had to help myself a few times getting forks, coffee, etc. There is a swamp right before getting to the beach. According to an employee the dark, smelly water right at the beach is a pipe coming form the swamp and releasing the extra water. It really stinks! and to get in the water have to get away from the hotel or walk thru that dark spot which is about 50 ft wide right in front of the beach!. There is nothing really for kids to do at night, and the hotel is so huge I didn't feel safe leaving them on their own. The bar employees wouldn't let the kids play pool or other games. We did find a few employees with great attitude but for the most part the service was bad, not to please the customer but to get the job done, always asking for tips, very unhappy employees and explaining how much money they made and how hard it was to raise a family with that. I feel bad but I work hard all year and deserve a good vacation and don't need to hear complaints from others. The hotel is just too big and good service is not possible.

I did not see anybody complaining or argueing with the staff. FOOD - Buffet had many varieties but got a bit sick of it after a while which is probally the case for any buffet in the world. The resturants were very high class and fine dinning and just like any resturant out there, there are always gonna be better dished than others and some you like and some you dont. All personal preference and everybody is gonna like some things more than others. All the people saying that the menus were too small don't know what fine dinning is. ALL fine dinning or most have limited menus. People are complaing over what they only ordered but they havent tried everything. EVERY resturant you go to go in the world there are always better dishes than others. So to judge the food over just what you had and not having everything on the menu is just unfair and those people are too picky. RESORT - Overall very clean and maintained and is truly 5 star living.

Overall it delivered as promised, few issues with timings of room cleaning - ie chamber maid not turning up until 17:00 - 18:00 however manged to get this resolved after 4 seperate trips to the concierge over 4 days so by end of week one we had a serviced room by 14:00 every day.. Agree with comments on reception, not a good impression on arrival, not given any info on hotel facilties other than a 30 second briefing with a very poor map of site. Apparently we were upgraded on arrival but no one told us. Never heard of a Hotel that does not inform you when you are being given something for nothing! Also agree with comments on the teenage entertainment. Good during the day with organised events which teenagers can choose to participate in such as Archery, Volleyball and Water Polo. However once once darkness falls they are not really catered for apart from a pool table and table football in the sports bar. My main complaint is to do with the construction work on the Princess side of the Hotel. This is being carried out by part of this Hotel group, they are currently clearing the jungle and flattening the land to build apartments so we were woken up at 7:00 am every morning and this continued to 19:00 to 19:30 hours every evening including Sunday. We did complain within several days of our arrival but no suitable alternative rooms were available due to the complex being fully booked. (suspect this is why we were upgraded due to overbooking) The Hotel , on initially complaining denied any knowledge of this but the work which was taking place the whole length of the Riveria side of the Complex. So if you have a non pool facing room you will experince the sounds of heary trucks, bull dozers and chain saws and the beeps of reversing warnings. The Hotel, via concergie subsequently were very well informed on the site and stated that the constuction should be starting at 9:00 am and finished by 16:00 and only be over 6 days but this is not being adhered to if true. This rendered our balcony useless which was a shame as the gardens are beautiful and so did impact on our overall holiday experience. To some people this may not bother them but for our family we were looking for some quite peaceful reading and talking time first thing in the morning and late afternoon. Also as the weeks progressed the noise did get lounder and can be heard from some of the communal areas. So on arrival I would check if you are in block 5,6 or 7 and if you are facing outwards from the central pool areas request an alternative room. Other than that the food was good, restauant bookings for a party of four was fine, the communal areas are well kept and continuesly being cleaned and maintained and all of the staff with the exception of the Reception are cheerful, willing to help if they could understand. There are mosquitos so be prepared for this and use protection however this is made up by the other wildlife such as Iguana's , possums and birds in the ground plus do go and see the crocodile in the mangrove swamp next to the Hotel on the Sunset side.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cLet's set the record straight\u201d", "Author": "HerrBear", "ReviewID": "UR72175068", "Content": "We too read the recent batch of bad reviews of this hotel which made us feel apprehensive about our decision to go to this hotel just prior to our departure. (Many seem to emanate from the same geographic area, maybe a group with a grudge, hmmmmm?) They truly are an unfair representation of the hotel. We had a great time. The Rooms We did upgrade to the platinum suites when we originally booked. If you are going for the beach, this building is closest to it. You also get a few extra amenities and an exclusive area on the beach with someone coming by and getting you drinks, which is really nice. In the platinum area you get your own mini lobby and a concierge which makes making dinner reservations much easier. The upgrade to platinum was well worth it. The rooms are clean, well stocked and nicely outfitted. At first our mini bar was not working properly and would not get cold, they quickly changed out the unit for another. The rooms do have that typical seaside musty smell present at most beach resorts, I think this is more of an HVAC/humidity issue than a housekeeping one. The smell is typically only noticeable when you first enter the room but is not noticeable after a few minutes. The beds are firm and I like that. When we arrived there were no king beds which is what we had requested (and also a common complaint). We were however moved to a room with a king bed the next day and a roll-away was brought in for my son, which was our original plan. They were very apologetic about this issue. Upon re-reading the online info, I now understand that king beds are more of a request than a firm guarantee. The Staff ALL of the staff members that we encountered were always exceedingly helpful and friendly. We did not have to tip prior to services being rendered to be treated properly as some have suggested. We did of course tip afterwards. If you are staying on the resort there didn\u2019t seem to be much of a reason to change U.S. money over to Pesos. We took a bunch of 1 dollar bills for tips. If you need someone that speaks English fairly well, try a concierge, the front desk or a bartender. The maids and general service people seem to have less skill in the English department (still I think their English is superior to my Spanish) but they do try extremely hard to accommodate you. We did leave tips for our maids with a note of \u201cGracias!\u201d on a daily basis and our room was always clean and our mini bar always stocked. The Grounds They are well maintained. Someone is always trimming, cleaning or maintaining something or other. The pools are plentiful and we could always find a place that wasn\u2019t too crowded. There are an abundance of lounge chairs and they are close together, but again there always seemed to be a place that wasn\u2019t too crowded to settle into. A couple of the pools did have lower water levels but not all of them. Some areas on the grounds do occasionally have an odor. This is not sewage as some have suggested but is generated by some of the surrounding wetland preserves and natural algae. I grew up in south Florida and am quite familiar with this smell and you do get used to it. While we were there we heard a few complaints of construction noise but we did not hear it ourselves. They are evidently expanding the resort. The grounds are extensive but not so extensive that walking to and fro should be a hardship, and the trolley runs about every ten minutes if you need it. There are rocks under the water at the beach so I would recommend water shoes. We did not need to use insect repellant and did not experience any issues with bugs at the resort but did get some bites at Xcaret. Restaurants and food Make reservations for restaurants for your entire stay as soon as you arrive and note that you may not be able to get into one for the first couple of days of your stay as they do book up. They do have menus available where you make reservations to help you make decisions. The food at the restaurants is better than that at the buffets but the buffets are pretty good and they do change up the menu. We ate at the Miso and the Las Olas. Miso is an Asian/Japanese steakhouse hibachi style and the Las Olas was seafood. The Miso was quite entertaining. Some of the restaurant facilities seem to be multipurpose. They serve as buffets during lunch and breakfast and as a full service restaurant for dinner. They do have a large number of tables and staff to accommodate a greater number of guests during buffet services. If one were to walk by during dinner service however, one would notice a large number of empty tables. It makes sense that a full service sit down dinner service has different requirements and that the kitchen and staff can only accommodate so many guests at that service level, hence the need for reservations during those services and the reason for all of those empty tables. All in all While it may not be a 5 star hotel by some people\u2019s/country\u2019s standards, we felt that the quality did meet or exceed what one should expect at the price point. Even with the few bumps that we experienced, we enjoyed our stay and had a great time.

Beautiful and well maintained. Rooms large and nice, maid service very good. Drinks pretty good. Pools very nice. We liked the one by the grill. Not as crowded as the main pool in the center of the resort. Food was OK, not great, not bad. Just OK. Only tried two ala carte restaurants, not much selection in either. We could not get reservations for the nights we wanted in some of the other restaurants so we just gave up trying. That was OK though. We all could find something to like at the buffets. It would be GREAT if they had more selection at the pool grill though. Only burgers and hot dogs which gets pretty boring. It would also be nice to have the buffet by the platinum suites open at night for dinner. The one on the sunset side was open for 2 ala carte restaurants but the riviera side was closed for dinner. This forces you to go to the lobby area every evening. We went to Xcaret, fun and had a great time. We went jet-skiing and it was the best time I have ever had jet-skiing. DON'T rent the skis off the beach. Costs $120.00 for one hour per jet-ski and you get to go nowhere! We reserved through Best Day tours and they picked us up and took us to a marina where we were met by a \"tour guide\" (that is what he called himself). He took us all over and it was fantastic. It was only $130.00 for one hour per jet-ski. Well worth it. Spa was beautiful. A little pricey but they offered very nice services. Don't be afraid to tip here and there. The wait staff, bar staff and spa folks really appreciate it. So-so stuff: Floors are very slippery. Marble is beautiful but not very safe when it gets wet. Even the concrete paths can be quite slick so be very careful. Pools not deep enough, only 3 1/2 feet or so. I would have liked one to be deeper. Men's dress code was ridiculous. Women could wear whatever they wanted and I saw many wearing shorts and flip flops in the ala carte restaurants but they would not let a man in the piano bar with shorts and sandals on. Crazy! So men, be sure to bring long pants and closed shoes if you want anything other than the buffet at night. Not much to do at night except see the shows. My kids (11 and 17) were kind of bored. They did not want to participate in the \"kids clubs\". Kiddie one was too babyish for my daughter and my son is a bit too old for organized activities so it would have been great if they had a tween-teen disco time. They had the disco for the little kids and then the adults but forgot that age group. BUGS BUGS BUGS.....we were eaten alive! It would be GREAT if the hotel could somehow do something to cut down on the mosquitos. I never once saw anyone spraying and I have to say there is so much water on this resort including the lagoons (which in my opinion were more like swamps) this place is a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos. So bring repellant and a good one. \"OFF\" did nothing to help. The ocean was awful! I am not really sure why it was brown, murky and nasty smelling. I heard a lot of stories, everything from dumping raw sewage to pumping out the dirty lagoon water and dumping it in the ocean. In any case that was VERY disappointing. We were there a total of 12 days and swam in the ocean only 1 day. It is a shame because the water in Mexico is usually beautiful. Internet service was just awful. They claim they have wi-fi which was a disaster to get going and you could only get a signal in the lobby and it was a weak one at that. Playa was OK. Found some nice things. Hotel gift shop is pricey. I heard a few people complain about the children. I can't seem to understand why people who don't like kids travel to family resorts. There are a LOT of kids. If you don't like them, go somewhere else! There are plenty of couples only options all over Mexico. To the UGLY: The service at the front desk, concierge and reservations was truly the worst I have ever encountered. I used to be a travel agent and I have had the pleasure of traveling to many destinations and stayed at many wonderful resorts but this resort was just horrible in the customer service catagory. There was a HUGE problem with my reservation and NO ONE would help us. We got bounced from one person to another. We continually requested a manager and it took 1 1/2 DAYS to get ANY manager to talk to us. The error was with Expedia.com. We had two rooms, 3 people. I added my son after my original reservations were made and expedia's agent said she called the hotel and had him added. The cost was the same as my husband's single room was priced double occupancy. The hotel said expedia messed up and their prices were based on a per person rate, not a per room rate. No one at the hotel believed me and basically accused us of trying to pull a fast one which was ridiculous. I paid for his airline ticket. I would of course pay for his hotel stay but I was told there was no additional cost. No one at the hotel would help us sort things out. They told us it was our problem with expedia, not theirs. They refused to even make a courtesy call to expedia saying it was too expensive. They were more than happy though to threaten to charge us an additional $200.00 per NIGHT for my son. When we did finally get a manager to show his face (remember, 1 1/2 days later!) he offered us a \"discounted courtesy\" price of $170.00 per night. How big of them! We ended up sending emails, spent $60.00 in phone cards and wasted 2 days to get out of the mess we were in. Ultimately, expedia did take care of everything but it was such a hassle! Because of the way we were treated, if I could have gotten a full refund immediately when the problems began, I would have left and gone to another resort. The staff really needs training in the area of basic customer service! Once I got home, I did a \"mock\" reservation on expedia and priced 3 people vs 4 and it was EXACTLY the same price for the resort whether you had 3 or 4 people in two rooms! Expedia was right all along. I have been home now for a week and I am still searching for a contact in customer service for Princess Hotels to send a letter. If anyone has one please let me know. If nothing else, I would like to send a letter just to give me peace of mind. All in all: Any vacation is a great vacation. Once our mess was cleaned up, we had a great time. Met some great people and had a fun relaxing time. I won't go back though. If we ever do go to Mexico again, there are plenty of other great places to stay.

I booked this resort because it looked beautiful and we got a lot of extra amenties for staying in the Laguna Villa. Afterwards, I did begin to worry, I started to read reviews on trip advisor and some were horrible! But now I realize, that those people who complain were likely not be happy anywhere and are probably snobs. I did see a lot of snobby, annoying folks when we were there and we stayed clear of them! We arrived in Cancun from Minneapolis and Dallas around 2:30. Immigration and Customs were a breeze (we got the green light) and then connected with our transfer, Lomas with Funjet. Remember to exit the airport, do not stop and talk with anyone after your claim your luggage, they are time share reps and will hold you up. Lomas was great, within 15 mins we were on the road with about 10 other folks. They had cold beer 2 for $5 and we were also the first stop in Playa Del Carmen. Arrival at the resort was awesome, the lobby is stunning and they greet you with cold drinks no matter which room level you are in. We did wait a while to check in, around 15 mins, but who cares, the scenery is lovely! The man who checked us in was very nice and gave us all the info we needed to get started. He also invited us to a special martini reception for our room level. We got to our room, the Villas are about a 5 min walk from the lobby and were already excited! It was an amazing room, HUGE king size bed, nice big jacuzzi, 2 sinks, the AWESOME outdoor shower, a nice sized walk in closet, a sitting area that came with snacks and a special bottle of Tequila because we were honeymooners, a big TV and DVD player (but US DVDs will not work) and lots of bottles of liquor and soda, water and beer in the fridge. We had originally wanted a downstairs room so the shower had no roof but they were none available. We soon realized the balcony view was better on the second level. The Villas are the nicest rooms in the resort, you have your own private pool area (no kids allowed) with a bar and snacks 6am-6pm. The pools are all open till 8pm (not 6 like some people mentioned). We also have all the privileges as Platinum guests and frequented their lounges, they also have a bar and snacks but till 11pm. The Platinum pools are much smaller and for more people and with kids...but you do get an option of an ocean view and a jacuzzi on the balcony, but the privacy of the Villa pool and our shower beat that! Ok, the smell, people complained of a smell...have you ever smelled a jungle or the ocean before? That is what it smelled like...there are also some beautiful protected mangrove trees right before you get to the beach that also have a smell, but it's nature...people are strange. People complained of the service too...REALLY? Everyone we met was busting their backs to make you happy, we tipped EVERYONE at least 1-2 bucks or 20 pesos each time!! They work hard and their salary is not enough. Please do this. Yes, not everyone speaks English, but you are in Mexico and trying goes a long way. We were fortunate that we both speak Spanish, my husband is fluent and they really appreciated it. People also complained that the drinks weren't strong enough...um, it's all you can drink, order another one...plus I may not be a big drinker but all my drinks were heavy with alcohol. We spent the most time at the Villa Laguna pool bar area, and they had top shelf liquor, the lobby bar made the strongest drinks. We did spend one morning at one of the bars in a main pool and it was fun. After noon thought the pool bars are filled with loud drunk people, so we were happy to have a sanctuary away from them! You need to know what you are getting into and if this isn't your scene make sure you book platinum or Villa, there a gazillion pools too, so I am sure if you want some quiet you can find it. I always saw an open chair at the beach...bring a villa guest, you get your own area of the beach and there was always great seats open there. People liked to complain that there put too many chairs aside for us...we paid for it! You pay to know you don't have to risk not getting a chair in the shade, but their were always seats. The ocean floor was a little rocky but managable, what do you want the resort to do, disrupt nature and remove the rocks, just wear water shoes or sandals! We got massages on the beach for $50 for an hour, so worth it, best massage I have ever gotten. They gave us a free day at the Spa and it was awesome. They have all sorts of water jets for different parts of your body. Also as part of the Villa package, you get a 30 min massage, hand and foot exfoilation and a facial...so we did that too. The Spa is definitely worth checking out! FOOD! YUM! People love to complain about the food here...and I have NO idea what they are talking about, there is SO much to choose from, you will not be without choice. We tried all 4 buffets, mostly for breakfast, we loved the breakfast and we did have one lunch, which was also great. We usually just had snacks for lunch from the Villa and Laguna area and one day my Husband got a burger from the grill (which is near the beach entrance) and he loved it. The Villas also have 24 hr room service and we got breakfast one day which was awesome, a club sandwich and a pizza, all great. I really don't get it! We also tried MISO, LE FLEUR, HACIENDA, and TAPAS. TAPAS was my fav and they have a live flamenco show which is EXCELLENT! Next I would have to say MISO, we did the Teppanyaki, and it was a great show and the food was YUM. People like to complain that its not authentic, but you have to know where you are and it's delish food so whats the deal! Hacienda has a great appetizer buffet that we really enjoyed and the fajitas come with handmade tortillas. Le Fleur was also good just not my fav. You must try the flaming coffees in the main square, served everyday 6-10pm, really fun to watch and drink! We also enjoyed the music in the square every night, especially the mariachi, flamenco and sometimes there was just a singer. We only did one of the theatre shows because we felt like most of them sounded crazy cheesy. We saw the acrobat show and it was really good but also a little cheesy! We would have loved to have seen the Mexican dance show but it was on the day we left. The piano bar is great, hardly anyone knows about it so its super quiet and the pianist is highly skilled! Ok, now...going to a resort is not Mexico and I encourage you to get off the resort and explore the Yucatan, you really need to! We spent one afternoon in Downtown Playa Del Carmen, they have a free shuttle at the resort that you need to reserve. We had a blast, we ate lunch at Los Durados, off the beaten path a little, had the best shrimp tacos! I also recommend the Mayan chocolate drink at Aha Cacao!, we did some shopping but the prices are super inflated here and most of the souveniors are made in China. You really need to haggle. On Friday, we had already booked a trip with Yucatreks to Chichen Itza. Yucatreks are WONDERFUL, look for my review on that, coming soon! But most folks who stay in Playa if they see Mayan ruins they go to Tulum or Coba, both impressive but nothing beats Chichen Itza, just because it is far doesn't mean you shouldn't go, it's one of the new 7 wonders of the world and a Mayan masterpiece. You need a good tour tho and Yucatreks is the one! We also went swimming in a cenote (underground cave/freshwater lakes and rivers) and visited a small colonial town Vallodoid for lunch. Yes the resort is large, but it only takes 10 mins to get from the lobby to the beach, I enjoyed walking after eating so much everyday, they do have trolleys if you are unable! Awesome week at the GRP, I really recommend!

Overall, the GRP is average AT BEST! The atmosphere of this place is more like beer bong as opposed to say, fine wine, so I guess if that's your thing then this place is for you! Food- While the food at the a la carte restaurants is VERY good, the food at the buffet for breakfast and lunch is barely edible. Having something specially prepared by the chef (omlette for BF, pasta for lunch) is about the only way to get anything decent. Rooms- The rooms have a terrible smell of ???? mustyness? damp earthiness? I don't know, it just stunk. The air conditioners barely keep the rooms cool even in December when the high is in the low 80's. Beach- The beach is NEVER combed, so it is nasty and FULL of seaweed. It's all you can do to walk out into the ocean 30 feet without getting all tangled up. Wait staff on the beach is very good! Grounds- Manicured beautifully, and well kept. Lots of mosquitos, so bring your Off!. Staff- Friendly for the most part, assuming that you go out of your way to ask them something. Other than that they are not outgoing in making sure all of your needs are met. Shows- Nightly shows were very good! We stayed in a Junior Suite with the swim up option and for a few hundred dollars more we could have stayed at a top notch resort like Iberostar, others. We met a couple there who also had stayed at many resorts in the Riviera and said that GRP was one of the worst, and they go 2-3 times a year for over 14 years! In the end, I realized that people have both good and bad experiences at resorts, so all I can testify to is my own. That being said, what I can say WITH CERTAINTY is that my wife and I will not go back to this resort.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Odessa, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot a good place to stay\u201d", "Author": "kwagner10", "ReviewID": "UR71792310", "Content": "This place is way too big, you have to walk a mile everywhere you go.

Just a word of warning, if your not a walker, this hotel isnt for you! Before i left for my holiday i read the reviews on this website and it made me partly regret my choice of hotel thanks to the negative reviews! But trust me, ignore them, they must be very very fussy people! The hotel grounds are beautiful! Everything is spotless and as you walk around the hotel you always find people tending the gardens and cleaning the hotel. The grounds ar huge and it takes about 9 mins to walk from the lobby to the beach!! The pools are spotless too, they clean them every morning and they do a very good job of it! The rooms are always cleaned daily by a maid and you also have a mini bar in your room which they top up every day with fizzy drinks, water and beer! I have heard a lot of people complaining about their goods being stolen from their safe and i can tell you that i stayed there for 2 weeks in room 7053 and me and my mum put all our goods in our safe like our phones, ipods and money, we left them in there all day and not once was anything touched. The food is not the best ive had at a hotel. Its not that tasty and its pretty much a repeat of the same food every night. In the morning i lived off of pancakes with chocolate syrup and cereal! And at night i just took what i was given. My mum is a vegitarian so we wernt able to go to many other resturants as they dont have much choice for vegitarians! from what i can remember there are at least 7 resturants in the hotel (one which you have to pay for, which is crazy because its meant to be an all inclusive hotel!) I owuld tell you what all of them are but i cant remember as i mainly stuck to the buffet. If you are like me and are not a fussy eater then you will be fine here, i didnt mind the food, as long as it was edible and it was enough to keep me going. At lunch they have a bbq by one of the pools which has burgers and hot dogs, these are very tasty or you can go to one of the buffets! and also it takes a long time to get a seat in the buffet, very slow service! The beach is average! the water was fairly clear and it stays shallow for a long time! The only let down is that there arent enough sun loungers, so you often find yourself having to wake up at 6am to run down to the beach and put towels on the sun lungers to claim your spot. There are also chairs around the pools, but again there arent enough of them! During my stay, we had a thunderstorm which lasted a whole day, and after this thunderstorm, the sea turned all brown and smelly, apparently it was from the lagoon near the beach and the water from it had run into the sea during the storm. So me and my mum moved to the pool for the rest of our stay. Entertainment is quite poor, at night there is a show in the theatre, it is a good show but after its over there isnt much else to do! theres not a lot to do for children aged 11-17 because there is a kiddys club at about 8 but then after its over it changes into a club for 18+. there are a few things to do during the day e.g scuba diving in the pool which is free, jet skis (but you have to pay $60 for half an hour!!!) and there is also free kyaking. There is also a spa and gym at the hotel. There are a lot of excursions to do, e.g dolphin swimming, visits to under ground caves and lagoons, turtle swimming, visits to mayan ruins. I reccomend going to a place called Xcaret, its sort of like a big theme park but without rollercoasters, you can swim with sharks there and snorkel and swim with dolphins, see the jaguars see the bat cave and loads more different things!!! Over all, i enjoyed my stay and i would return for a second visit to the grand riviera princess. Hoped you find my review helpful and hope you have a fantastic stay at the resort!

I just got back from 1 week at this hotel. ALthough beautiful it is NOT safe at all! We were a group of 24 people travelling for a wedding. Out of 24 people 3 got money stollen from the safe in their respective rooms! I am not talking $20; some got over $100 stollen from the safe in the room! Not only that but one of our friends was sleeping in one day with the do not disturb sign.. and somebody entered! She had no cleaning cart, or towel cart.. NOTHIGN! She RAN away when she realized people were in the room. I am an adult and I did not feel safe at all. ALso, one of our hotel room neighbours was in the shower and her husband and kids were in the room... nobody knocked.. she came out of the shower as a man (staff) opened the door and walked in! Somebody had to come check my room with me before I went to bed (I was alone in my room). As we spoke to more and more hotel guests that we met during our stay we found that we were not the only ones who had been robbed. The hotel even admit that approximately 100 people per day get robbed at that hotel! They said it is an internal problem and htat they cannot do anything about it! As if! It is written in the hotel binder found in each room that the hotel is responsible for up to 20 000 pesos (approx. $2000 US) of money or objects stollen from the safe. However, they do not live up to this! They would not repay the stollen money. Some poeple we met got robbed and up and left the following day. As for the food: the buffet did offer variety however this was not 5 star quality. There are several different restaurants but if you compare the menus some items (gaspacho, rosemary lamb chops) recurr. I was not impressed for a 5 star hotel. Beach: the sand was nice but the water was not a crystalline blue at all! there is an underground river from the swampy water surrounding the hotel that connects to the sea... the water was brown for most of our stay. Not only that but when you walk into the water there is approximately 3-4 feet distance of rock to navigate through. Some poeple cut their feet. Room: large and spacious. I had paid extra for a platinum suite... the outdoor AND indoor jacuzzis were DIRTY. I did not take advantage of this amenity. THe club was always empty. There were lots of mosquitos at night. Overall I kept hearing complaint after complaint from many guests... money stollen from safes, staff entering rooms unannounced or even with do not disturb signs, not getting the type of room requested, poor service, nobody held accountable for anything.

We stayed in the Riviera side of the resort, in the Platinum section - room 5210. I would highly recommend the Platinum suites, there are many excellent perks and benefits, including 24 hour room service. The Platinum suites are large and beautiful and located very close to the beach and pools. I loved the Platinum lounge and found it difficult to live without its amenities. The private Platinum pool was small but very well appointed. I cannot rave enough about this resort; it is amazing and absolutely gorgeous. We have been traveling to this area of Mexico for over 10 years and have stayed in many quality resorts and the Grand Princess is my favorite by far. The grounds are amazing and very well manicured. The pools are just outstanding and the beach is wonderful. The resort itself is very large and spacious with very comfortable walkways throughout the resort. We enjoyed walking most of the time to work off all the food and drink : ) There are trams available for those who prefer not to walk, they operate every 10 minutes. There are a plethora of activities to keep you occupied, there is a gorgeous Spa and excellent fitness center. The nightlife is excellent and the main theatre is air conditioned. Their nightly shows are by far the best productions of any resort that we have stayed in. All of the restaurants are air conditioned which is a huge benefit when you want to get out of the heat and humidity and enjoy your food in a cool area. The food is very good in the buffets and restaurants. I cannot complain about anything except that perhaps they are slightly understaffed in the restaurants; at times the service was a but slow - but nothing that was troubling. I found every staff member very helpful, kind and pleasant and they work very hard to make all guest feel content. The main plaza area located between both lobbies transforms into a great are for night activity, it was our favorite place for evening drinks and people watching. There are nightly mini-shows in the main plaza along with decorated stands serving Mexican coffees and other elaborate concoctions.

Theese two resorts clim 5 star but no where near this rating...more like a 3 star. They always overbook and entice guests with an upgrade to the 3rd floors with no view. If you want to switch it cost you more money. If you complain they ask you to come bck the next day only to be told agaain and again that there is no avilability unless of course you py the per person per night upgrade. A la carte...they are tight on wearing pants and closed toe shoes. If you don't have them they will embarass you right at the recpetion of the restaurant and will not allow you in. Their customer service from lobby and conceriage is terrribele. No flexibility andeven though you point out \"reputational risk \" has more value than the 2 week stay they dont seem to understand long term business. They upgrade us to the deluxe junior suite but stripped all of the benefits 4 days into the 2 week vacation. Bassically, their reason was the room upgrade was sufficient and exclusive restaurants are excluded. They claimed they can change the rules at any time. Beach water directly in front of the hotel seeps brown sewage seeps out of the hote septic tanks. Beach Lounge chairs cannot cross the ropped areas that go onto the sand of the beach. You are iterally rubbing elbows with other guests. Room service is extra...even if you are sick they will chrge you. Mini bar fridge in room has a sign on it 2 beers , 1 pepsi, 1 diet pepsit, 1 orange, 1 club soda and 3 waters.. 2 beers were never replaced and when i reports they insisted it was refilled. They even wanted to charge me to refill. This is where I drew the line. Each day \\|I mde sure that fridge was cleared out so that they can refill it each time. Pool bar unless you are tipping forget about being served. I watched Israel a bar tender and he was pretty arrogant ...finally when we started to make apoint did he pay attention. Only 1 pool has the activities and it is crowded. Heavy drinkers staay in the pool and at the pool bar. I m certain they urinate they as they never came out.

Sports bar, foosball tableare broken, pool tables are ripped. This resorts is long and deep and is not accessible to 80% of the guests at pool or beach. It is a 15 minute brisk walk. Therefore, if you forget something at your room your screwed. Spa - you have to pay. unlike the 2 resorts I stayed there was no access. 5 star resorts will allow you access to jacuzzi, steam and vapour room, rock water etc. not at the Riveira.

There were adequate beach chairs (considering the resort was supposedly at capacity, but we could never get a palapa until late in the day) Great burgers by the pool everyday.

The food in the Grand Riviera Buffet was usually cold. It appeared to be they were understaffed. The food was cooked but then it took a while for it to be placed under the heat lamps.The food was fine at the Sunset Buffet so walk those few extra steps. Specialty Restaurants understaffed.

We are generally easy-to-please and have never had a poor experience anywhere we've been before. But suffice it to say, we will not recommend this resort to anyone. We've just returned from our holiday at this resort (July 3-10), and our disappoointment began right at check in. We had booked our holiday months in advance and had booked two adjacent rooms (1 king, and 1 with 2 doubles). We did get the side-by-side rooms, but both had king size beds. This does not work with 2 teens (1 boy, 1 girl). We were told the resort was completely booked, and they could only offer to bring a fold-away bed. My kids worked it out, and in the end it was okay. However what was NOT okay at all was the swarms of mosquitos the kids had in their room. Our room (right next door !) was fine, but theirs had TONS of mosquitos. I would go in and kill them all at bedtime, and there were many more come morning again. My kids were eaten alive. Thinking the mosquitos were coming in while the cleaning staff cleaned the rooms (they leave the doors wide open) they started leaving the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door. So they had a dirty room, no clean towels and still tons of mosquitos ! And now they had dead mosquitos on all the walls and bedsheets ! I did complain at the reception, but they said they were fully booked and could offer no help. It was terrible, and I continued to coat them with bug spray every night before bed. Again, our room, which was right next door, had next to no mosquitos. We were on the first floor, and we could only think that perhaps the kids' room was above some sort of water run-off and the mosquitos were gaining access to their room somehow. I spoke to someone else who said theri room wasok (2nd floor) but their friends' room (on the first floor) had the same problem. So my advice to you, unless you like mosquitos, is make sure you do not get a room on the first floor ! Pools were plentiful and well maintained, although water was low (below the filters) for many days. Marble floors and even those around the pools are very slippery , so use caution. A la carte restaurants were just OK. Service at La Fleur was probably the best, and food was decent. Portions were small, and my husband's meat was served with a chocolate cake. Lasagna in the Italian (Mamma Mia) restaurant was very salty, but the kids enjoyed their pastas. The Mexican restaurant (Hacienda) was probably the worst. Service was very slow, food was not great, and they actually delivered my son's soft drink to the next table and when they realized the error, they were going to remove it from the kid's hand to give to my son ! Miso oriental was my favourite. Service and food were excellent. Buffet foods were repetative, bland and we were so tired of it, it was the only good point about coming home. Bacon was like pork rinds dipped in a deep vat of oil, and the toaster (ONE toaster for the entire buffet) was awful. Even 3 passes thru it were not enough to toast the bread ! And coffee was never hot, always tepid. Service at Riviera buffet far exceeds service at the Sunset buffet. We sometimes had to wait for drinks by the poolside bars, even though we were tipping as others recommended. Yes, the resort is large, but not as large as others we have stayed at before. We found it quite manageable. Not much in the way of activities for teens. Kids club ok for young kids, but lacks activities for those over 12. Beach was not the greatest.

Very poor transportation around the site- only one small tram car that would carry maximum 8 people at a time. All we got was a sad shake of the driver's head and a \"wait for next pick up\" That was 10 - 15 minutes later. The head concierge did nothing to try and improve the room situation.

I can't say enough about how wonderful this resort was. We had a suite that was connected directly to the pool so you could walk right out into the pool off of a spacious balcony. The rooms were very high end. The bathroom had a tiled shower and vessel sinks and a jacuzzi tub. The room was absolutely beautiful. The food was outstanding. We ate breakfast and lunch at the buffet. It was always great and they had a large variety that was different each day. For dinner, we ate at the specialty restaurants that you had to make reservations for. Our favorites were the steakhouse, Mexican, and the Italian. The presentation and professionalism of the staff at all the restaurants and buffets was outstanding. The beach was the most pristine beach in the Playa area. It was very large and there were plenty of lounge chairs. There was a bar on the beach, and the constantly served you the drinks you desired. The resort itself is very large. They do have a shuttle that runs every ten minutes to take you to where you need to go (your room, beach, or lobby area. My husband and I love to walk, so most of the time we walked everywhere. The decor at the resort was very elegant with beautiful sculpture and art pieces. The entire wall of the lobby bar (which was huge) was all done with glass tile. No expense was spared in building this resort. There must have been 10 swimming pools, most of them with swim up bars. During the day, there were all kinds of activities going on you could participate in. There were shows every night that were very good. And there was a disco. The only negative I can say about this resort is I wish they had offered more shuttles to and from Playa during the day and evening since it is only 5 miles away. We rented a car one day to go to Playa. Everyone on staff was very friendly. Even the maids and maintenance workers always spoke to you. I must say, we would definitely go back, and thought the resort was a very good value. We booked through Cheap Caribbean.

My only problem with this resort that was only open six months when we arrived there was the restaurant reservation booking. There was a lot of wasted hours of beach time since you could only book every other day two restaurants. If you had an upgraded room (some had mosquito issues near the water and had to be fumigated), you were all set for dinner since you had a concierge. Thus, we never made it to the Italian restaurant. I would strongly recommend booking this one first since it's hard to get into. We did get great manicotti in the buffet on the only night that restaurant was not open so I resume it was delicious.

It is really big, and I don't think I even saw the whole resort while there. As for the people who complained about the long walks from place to place, they must be the kind of people who are lazy and don't get out much. I enjoyed walking around the resort, even when I was wearing heels at night. You might as well just get used to walking because the shuttles aren't reliable. I did get eaten alive by mosquitos so remember to take bug spray (they gave us insect repellant wipes in the Platinum suite but I'm not sure if they provide them in all rooms.) The room was very nicely designed and large, but not exactly luxurious. The bathroom and closet door were almost impossible to open and close. The shower was not properly sealed and water leaked out and soaked the entire floor each time we showered. Everything was clean, but the jacuzzis in the bathroom and on the balcony were stained so not very appealing. The mini fridge was not cold AT ALL. The whole room smelled a little stale and all the bedsheets and towels felt moist, but that's to be expected with the amount of humidity at the beach. The bed was rather hard and uncomfortable, but my boyfriend didn't have an issue with it. There was also a loud knocking sound next to our room that bothered me the first night, but every other night I was so exhausted I didn't even hear it when I slept. All of us enjoyed the buffets. There is a lot of variety, and though the food's not mind-blowing, it's tasty. I'm a vegetarian and had no issues with finding something different to eat every day. The a la carte restaurants are decent. I ordered room service twice and it arrived within 20 minutes. Drinks are plentiful.. we drank a lot because well, it's free so we took advantage of that. But don't forget to tip, they really appreciate it! Most of the servers and bartenders are really nice and deserve a tip. Don't be cheap, people. Customer service isn't the best. I think the concierge people deal with a lot so they're not always eager to help. Most of the staff is friendly though, learn some Spanish greetings and they'll love it. Overall, it's a nice place to stay. It is definitely not 5-star like some websites claim. There are tons of children there too. I'd probably recommend it more for families, but it's good for couples or groups of adults too. If you want 5-star service and facilities, go somewhere else and expect to pay a lot more. If you want something affordable and quality, go here.

I do have a complaint about hous keeping, when we got to our room, the floor wasdirty and so was the bathtub, we dont complain much so we washed out the tub ourselves after about 4 days of it not being cleaned, ya the rooms smell but we always bring airfresheners when we stay in hotels, so it does solve the smell problem. we should have complained about the dirt room, didnt like the fact that other rooms next to us got towel animals and we never did, but thats minor. Bring bug spray, there are lots of misquitoes around at night but thats due to the fact there is water everywhere, which is nice and relaxing. We stayed in the Jr. Deluxe room, and was about a 5 minute walk to the awsome beach and a 5 minute walk to the buffetts, we only ate at the buffetts and enjoyed the food, there was a good variety for everyone.

After reading a lot of the negative reviews on here we were quite concerned about them and even considered changing our accommodation but are so glad we didn't. The hotel and grounds were beautiful and the staff worked very hard and were friendly and helpful. If they didn't understand what you were asking for they would get someone who would understand. After a long ten and a half hour flight and six hour time difference we were absolutley shattered but once we arrived at the hotel we were amazed and soon woke up to start our fantastic holiday. Check in: Our check in was very fast and efficient (less than ten minutes) and the staff had lovely smiles on their faces. We were directed to our room and the bell boys brought our cases to our room on the truck about 30 minutes later. We were a little concerned as to why they were taking so long so we called reception and they told us they couldn't get the truck started so were sending another one. Rooms: We were upgraded to a room with a jaccuzi which was wonderful. Our room (6128) was further away from the lobby area but very close to the beach and pools which was wonderful. It was only a ten minute (slow) walk from the lobby anyway and the grounds were gorgeous to walk through. There was a large balcony with a table and two chairs, two doube beds, small table and two chairs, settee, coffee table, side unit with TV on and minifridge, two large mirrors, walk in wardrobe with iron and ironing board and a large bathroon with two sinks, jaccuzi, hair dryer (which was very useful as ours didn't work properly over there) sperate shower and toilet. There was also a large (free) safe in the walk in wardrobe and we used it for everything including our jewellery and we never had anything stolen. We checked everyday and nothing had been moved. We even left our cases unlocked and never had anything stolen. The rooms did have a slight musty smell to them I can only describe it as a smell from an older caravan in Wales. There were a few mosquitoes in our room (we arrived at the end of tropical storm Alex so it was very humid). We called reception and they sent the maid around within five minutes armed with a can of RAID which did the trick for the ones that had taken up residence in our room. Restaurants: At our welcome meeting we were told that we could also use the two platinum buffet restaurants that were very close to our room as well as the other two buffets and restaurants that you had to make reservations for. We had no problems making the reservations and we could book a couple of days in adavance. Men were required to wear long trousers for these restaurants and also the disco but my husband found it very uncomfortable wearing light jeans in the tropical heat (still humid at night)so we only went to the restaurants twice. The buffets were great and catered for all and you could go when you wanted to (during the opening times). As soon as the buffet closed for breakfast the BBQ near to the beach was lit and burgers and hot dogs were flowing all day. The sports bar was open 24 hours for snacks and drinks but we didn't need to use it at all. Pools: There were plenty of pools to choose from with jaccuzi pools in the middle of them and we found 3 with swim up bars. The only pool we found to be extremely busy and a little noisy was the pool with the entertainment and animation team encouraging holiday makers to take part in their fun and games. We preferred to watch as some games involved who could drink the alcohol the fastest and we didn't want to get too drunk during the day. The participants were mainly aged 18 -30 in this pool. Beach: The beach was beautiful and the sand was like flour. We have been to many hot countries and always found the sand to be too hot to walk on but this wasn't the case here the sand was lovely and the sea was very warm, even warmer in the rain. There were a few tiny pebbles here and there as you first stepped in but they soon disappeared as you walked a few feet in front. You could walk out for quite a way before you became neck deep which we loved as we always felt safe when we knew we could have a swim and still touch the floor. The waves were great fun too as sometimes they would come one after the other and then sometimes you would have to wait. We never had any problems finding sun loungers although if you wanted one in the shade you would have to get up early to reserve one. The beach bar was right there and the staff would walk round asking if you wanted a drink. There was a small area of the beach that was roped off for platinum guests but it was further away from the beach bar and snack bar (it was also quite empty only about half a dozen people on the loungers - not worth upgrading to platinum unless you want a really lazy holiday and be waited on 24 / 7) Entertainment: The animation team worked very hard and there were shows on every night. We really enjoyed Grease and the All star show. Just a tip if you decide to go and see a show take a flip flop with you and reserve a seat as the theatre gets full very quickly and you could end up sitting too far away or having to stand. We only found this out after a couple of days and after that we had front row seats every night. Insect bites: We used tropical Jungle spray every night and were fine at the hotel although we did get a few bites on one of the excursions Excursions: We booked the Jungle Maya trip through our rep which cost \u00a390 GBP each (quite expensive but well worth it) There were many excursions to choose from but we wanted a trip with a tour guide so we could experience the best of everything. My husband is also accident prone so we thought it was better for health & saftey reasons. We did 3 zip lines, walked and cycled through the jungle, repelled (abseiled) into a cenote, took a ride on a 4*4 metal truck through the jungle (absolutely hillarious but scary when we thought it was going to tip over) then we snorkeled in two more cenotes. We all had to turn our torches off for a whole minute in the last cenote to experience what it would be like to live in one, it was dark and silent apart from the bats flying around but all I could think about was the film the decent! The only problem with this trip is that you could not use your own insect repellent or sun tan lotion as it had to be biodegradable. You could use thier own repellent but you had to wash it off before entering the cenotes and if you forgot to put it back on when you dried off you got bit by the mosquitoes (which we did and ended up with about 5 bites each but I suppose thats not too bad for being in the middle of the jungle). We didn't get sun burnt either as the jungle in in the shade. Summary: We would recommend this 5* hotel to any of our family and friends, we felt safe at all times and enjoyed every minute of it (wish we had booked two weeks). The food and drinks were fine and we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a drink. It did get a little busy over the weekend but a lot of new guests were only there for 3 to 4 day breaks. The hotel guests were 90% canadian with only about 5% English 55% other but we didn't have a problem with this as they were all very friendly. There were a few guests from Texas (we found these to be the louder guests but also very friendly) and never came across anyone agressive or unfriendly. The only down side to this hotel is when it rains it becomes very dangerous as all the floors are marble and although the staff work very hard to remove the rain from the corridors and path ways it is still very slippy. We were lucky not to fall over but we spoke to a few different people that had slipped over and were very badly bruised. We had 7 days at this hotel and for the first 24hours it was overcast, the next 5 days was gorgeous hot sunny with a nice breeze and then it started raining at 2.00pm on the Monday and was still raining at 4.00pm on the Tuesday when we left for the airport. The weather is not the Hotels fault its a risk you take when you go the Mexico in their Monsoon season. (PS our Orange pay as you go phones had no service in this hotel so we had to purchase a phone card which was much cheaper anyway (\u00a311.50 for 18 minutes to landlines) We could not understand how to work these cards so asked for help, the first staff member could not explan so fetched someone else who could.

We had a great trip and really enjoyed our stay. The facilities were extremely clean and well-maintained. We were the most impressed with the excellent service and friendliness of the hotel staff. From the moment we walked in we recieved a warm welcome, were offered champagne, and able to check into our room about 2 hours early! This high level of customer service & staff friendliness was consistent throughout our entire stay. The weather was a bit extreme, starting with a very rainy tropical storm and then incredible heat and humidity. However, this was all part of the adventure at the Princess, and it certainly didn't stand in our way of enjoying daily beach walks, long hours at the pool, and even a trip into town to check out Playa del Carmen. The hotel was helpful in offering a free shuttle, which we had to book one day in advance, leaving at 10am and 12pm. The only downside to the shuttle is that it doesn't return to the hotel until 6pm, but we were easily able to find a cab and return to the hotel for $13 USD, so we could return a bit earlier than the scheduled shuttle time. We only encountered three issues throughout our stay that were a bit of a challenge. Firstly, the insects were our biggest complaint, but I was able to get some bug spray in the hotel gift shop, which helped but definitely didn't eliminate the problem. We were both itchy the whole time and had several insect bites. Secondly, we struggled a bit with the food. We were easily able to make reservations in the many hotel restaurants and the restaurant staff was friendly and helpful. We ate in the buffets or at the poolside bbq for breakfast and lunch, and then dined in one of the restaurants nightly, but overall we really did not like the food. I think we tried 6 or 7 of the restaurants, and I was consistently disappointed with the food and often had a stomach ache after eating. In retrospect, I think we would have done better if we had stuck to the buffets for our dinners, since they offered a bit more variety. We certainly couldn't have gone hungry at this resort, but the food was really not very good by our standards. Thirdly, it was a bit hard to get a pool towel in the middle of the day because the towel huts close from 1-4pm and then again at 6pm. This was more of an annoying incovenience rather than a real problem. Again, this was a great vacation and beautiful resort. I truly enjoyed my stay and would certainly recommend it to others, especially other young couples like us looking to get away, relax, and enjoy each other's company. Although the resort accomodated many different guests, from wedding parties to families with small children, and it would have been difficult to get bored, I would suggest that it may not be ideal for anyone with mobility issues. It is true that we did quite a bit of walking, which we actually enjoyed, and for those who prefer less walking there are hotel shuttles around the resort. With this said, however, the floors and walkways get extremely slippery and it would just add to the challenge of trying to get around with a disability and is probably less than ideal for older guests or those with mobility issues of any kind. Otherwise, great destination for a beach adventure! This was a great vacation and we felt extremely safe during our stay.

We were there a few weeks ago and we loved it! We found the staff to be very friendly and courteous and had no trouble thankfully with items going missing nor did we hear of anyone else having these issues. Also there was no pressure for tips and our room was lovely complete with jacuzzi bath and minibar included. The resort is huge and it takes around 15 mins to walk from the lobby to the beach and there is plenty to do. We did however choose to laze around the pool drinking cocktails most of the time! There are 9 a la carte restaurants so suite every taste. You must visit the Muso Tepanyaki and Mama Mia restaurants. There are many bars, pools, shopa and a nightclub/disco type place on site and various entertainment. You are also about 20mins in a taxi from Playa del carmen if you want to go out. I loved this place, very picturesque and romantic but still had a young and fun side to it. There were many wedding parties which meant a hen and stag do on most nights in the disco place and there were many often rowdy American and Canadian guests in the swim up bar every day however there are so many pools and bars that if this bothers you you can go to another! We went to Cancun last year and so the thing I loved about this resort was also the thing I didnt like (confused?? yes so am I!) I loved in Cancun being able to jump on a bus and head downtown during the day or to the lagoon or beach etc. This resort has a lovely beach and you can walk for ages on it however its like fort knox! you can only really leave in a car as it is miles of motorway to get anywhere but then you have everything you need in the resort. We visited Cancun once and Playa del carmen once. Cancun was great but we werent too impressed with Playa del Carmen and it can turn out to be a very expensive night. We cant wait to go back next year for our honeymoon to the same resort! Most of the resort is very tranquil and romantic with many sitting areas overlooking gorgeous gardens and manmade water features. I would say it is more 4 star than 5. It was very clean, staff helpful and friendly, food lovely and international branded drinks were available too! If we had gone on hol with no spending money we would still have a had an amazing time as it was a genuine all inclusive resort.

I saw 5 cockroaches in 2 weeks (and 3 were dead so thats a bonus!) but only ever in the gardens as the maintenence men were always tending to the gardens with their spray stuff! (I freak out with them thats why I was counting!) some wee centipede things and horse fly things.

I don't understand the negative reviews here. The rooms are amazing (we stayed a week in the Platnium and then a week in the Lagoona suites so I am unsure of what the basic rooms are like). One tip: Make sure to lock your room and put out the do not disturb sign or the housekeeping staff will enter anytime of day with an \"hola\" and a smile. I did find this a bit disturbing as I like my privacy. Also I suggest putting a towel under your door if you are on the bottom of the Lagoona suites as there are little black caterpillars who will visit your room if not. These were not a big deal to us. The property is well manicured and very clean. It is a larger property but you can walk from one end to the other in about 5min so really should not be an issue as long as you have no mobility challenges...and if you do there is a shuttle that runs every 10min so you never have to walk very far. My husband and I choose to walk everywhere. The beach itself is very nice, lots of beds for everyone and a special roped off area for the Platinum/Lagoona suites guests. Great beverage service at the beach and a great beach for taking a daily stroll. The water at the edges is a bit rocky due to the reef offshore but once you are in there is no issue. I would recommend water shoes for those with sensitive tootsies. A special treat: If you walk up the beach (north) there is a cove that is undisturbed and there are no rocks in the water...it is just past the resort right next door. Well worth the walk and my husband and I enjoyed many hours of undisturbed swimming and wave jumping at this spot. The food was very good with something for everyone. The nachos are to die for and the salsa is a treat for the taste buds. The A la Cartes are wonderful and the service there is great. We only ate at the buffet for lunch and breakfast. I would recommend one of the smaller buffets on the property for breakfast to avoid a crowd. The buffet staff seemed harried and overworked and so were not as friendly as I had come to expect but were polite; a few more staff members would make a big difference here. The nightly entertainment is wonderful. The entertainment staff work all day and then into the evening to ensure a pleasurable stay. The show is different every night and they are held in a large amphitheater with plenty of seating and air conditioning for all. After dinner treat yourself to a specialty coffee made in front of you where the girl lights the liquor on fire while making the treat, yummy! The spa is great and Wendy gives an amazing massage!

A bunch of people in our group were robbed out of their safe and the hotel basically laughed in their face and wouldn't even give them a paper to confirm the theft for insurance purposes back home ! IT WAS THE GIRL'S ENGAGEMENT RING !!!!! This theft occurred on the very last day and what is most shocking is the fact that she took it off to go play volleyball for 1 hour- 1 hr elapsed between the time she put the ring in the safe and when she came back to her room and it was gone ! The restaurants were a hit or miss - everyone in our group LOVED the STEAK HOUSE and raved about it ! IF you go and get platinum the private beach area is very secluded and nice and would recommend spending your beach time there, since its quieter and much cleaner . If you are having a wedding there the gazebo is very nice and scenic (breath taking) however the food at the reception is pretty skimpy and the whole reception is pretty rushed (it was about 3 hours) and they kicked our group out of the hall so the group went to the DISCO to dance afterwards. (it spells like vomit ) but was a good time had by all because our group was so large we practically dominated the place. The excursions are pretty great from what everyone in our group who took one said- not a single person had a complaint and everyone who went on one came back very happy :) Also the pool side bars were pretty great in the pools closer to the platinum buffets, and next to the BBQ. I think everyone in our group fell in love with the ELECTRIC LEMONADES !!!!! Speaking of the pool they were well kept and cleaned with the exception of the activity pool which was constantly dirty.

We booked this hotel as a 5 star, but to be completely honest I would give it a 4 star rating, I have stayed at the Riu hotels in Playacar and they just seemed to have more class, IE. not so many loud noisy people loping around in the evening, and a more efficient service. Although the hotel itself was mostly excellent, there were a few small incidents which I cannot imagine happening in a 5 star residence. One night we heard a very loud knock at the door, and upon investigation found a woman unconscious in the corridor adjacent to our room. Her boyfriend was busy trying to revive her so we dialled the reception by phone to get help. We were told to wait and put on hold for about 5 minutes, we hung up and tried again, only to be told the same information, the girl had banged her head on the concrete wall (with her full body weight behind her fall) so I decided to run to reception to get help. I spoke to 2 staff at the concierge office who couldn't understand quite basic English and eventually told me the doctor was not going to attend, as it would cost me 128 US dollars???? Despite several attempts to inform them it was not me personally requiring a doctor, but another hotel guest. Eventually they sent for security who again could not speak English. The girl had being lying on the floor all this time and her boyfriend had had to carry her to her room unaided. It was obvious to us that alcohol was not to blame and it turned out that she had had some form of food poisoning and we later found out she'd spent 2 days in hospital as a result of this. I thought immediately that I would not want to fall ill/sick in the evening hours as I thought the staff's reaction/response was dire. I have to be fair to the hotel though, I can understand that Spanish is not my first language and English is not theirs, however i just expected more. Food! Hmm where to begin. Mostly the food was superb, in fact I preferred the buffet to the Al la Carte choices. We tried 2 of them (Steak house and Mexican) and quickly realised they were not so special, and if you enjoy fine dining then you may be slightly disappointed. For example I ordered a sausage meat starter in the steak restaurant and received a sausage next to a small salad......it looked hilarious and our table took pictures of it. I guess it's what I ordered but the presentation was a little odd. Barring that the meal was still enjoyable, but not quite Michelin star, and giving that the claim is 5 star luxury etc we expected a little better. The dress code isn't the strictest either,with training shoes being an acceptable form of enclosed shoes, and sports t shirts are allowed instead of collared shirts, something most 5 star establishments would refuse entry upon noticing. Back to the buffet though, wow! Brilliant, there is always something to like and the desserts were fantastic! Bravo! In fact during our 2ND week all the chefs etc walked by the pools for some reason, and they were greeted by applause and wolf whistles, high praise from all the guests who saw them, they even waved back. This was well deserved in my eyes as they must work flat out all day to provide the constant food on offer. Our stay was somewhat blighted by a tropical storm and the beach was shut for several days and to be fair rightly so. It was the season for this and we got the bad luck, most people just stuck to the pools and hid beneath the shade when it rained too hard. It didn't spoil our holiday as we were staying for 2 weeks, but I can imagine for the Americans and Canadians who were staying for just 7 days it was a little different. British and in fact European guests should be aware that the resort is mostly attended by our north American cousins, and that comes with it's own cultural differences, expect loud whooping and hollering, not to mention chants of USA....USA....USA if a contestant from one of these games is from the US. Of course this would not affect any stay but as a European you are definitely in the minority. The room we stayed in was a junior suite with king sized bed and jacuzzi etc and was very tidy, however there was an unpleasant smell on some of the bedding, a bit sweaty/musty. This was on the decorative pillows and not the ones you sleep on. There were 2 broken electrical sockets in the room, one had bare metal contacts showing, but were fixed within minutes of my call to reception. Unlike my later attempts to get a doctor mentioned earlier they were spot on with this problem and we were very impressed with the reaction. I had no problems with security or missing valuables however our safe's battery failed with 2 days to go and despite our call was never fixed, we just locked our wallets etc in our luggage. I did notice that we had female maids for the duration of our stay but upon checkout and of course tip day the maids were all of a sudden men.....coincidence?.....probably! We wanted to reward the girl who looked after our room as she had done a good job to be fair, we left our tip with our rep and can only hope he passed it on. All problems were managed very well by our Thomson/First choice rep Carlos. He was always on hand to help if required. In fact he was at the hotel between 9 and 4 most days unless he was at the airport helping with transfers, but even then he was reachable by phone. Outstanding service we all agreed. In conclusion, would I go again......absolutely. I wouldn't usually return to the same hotel if returning to a resort but in this case I would. Any small problems we had were mostly dealt with very well. I am left with only favourable memories of this hotel, and our party all agreed it was a beautiful setting.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWas nice until we got stollen in our room\u201d", "Author": "cathyf84", "ReviewID": "UR69617147", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at Grand Princess but we got stollen in our room.

What a wonderful trip we ended up having and I'm not sure where the bad reviewers stayed but our experience was excellent! The hotel and grounds are immaculate and the staff couldn't be nicer or more efficient. We had nine people in our party ranging from 11-52 and everyone loved the trip. Our twenty somethings enjoyed the clubs/night life and the beach volleyball very much and my husband and I enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere and the grounds. Everyone loved the swim up pool bars.....Luis at the pool closest to the beach made great Riviera Mayans and Miami Vices! There are pools for everyone's tastes and the beach was beautiful. We've been to Aruba, Barbados, the Caymans and the ocean was gorgeous. It's neat how you can be so far from shore and still be only shoulder deep in the water! We do recommend the Platinum Suites if you can do it. You have your own concierge to book dinners and more personal service. You also don't have to deal with the towel card which would have been a pain. As far as food, we got room service the first night which no one really enjoyed but some of our party got it on another night and it was fine so it must have been an off night. We ate at the breakfast buffets every morning and the selection was huge and good. We did several of the ala carte restaurants and enjoyed the steak house the best. The menu at the seafood restaurant was very limited but the salmon was delicious. We did the Thai restaurant, which is included in the Platinum service but would be extra otherwise. We could only get a 9pm reservation and the place was pretty empty. It took forever to eat but the food was delicious. We liked the Italian restaurant as well but the steak house was by far the best! The dinner buffets were also very good and varied. Our 15 year old always hungry son loved them! Probably the only negative and it's not even a big one is the entertainment shows were pretty cheesy. The lip-synching was not expected and detracted from the dance performances. We did two excursions while there. We did Chichen Itzah and the Xplor tour with the zip lining, jeeps and swimming or paddling thru caves. We booked thru an independent company and both were well worth doing! We did a trip into Playa del Carmen and took the shuttle from the hotel into town and took a cab back to the hotel because the shuttle comes back at 6pm. It was around $14 for a one way trip back. We were hoping for a van to get our whole party back but had to settle for three cabs which was no big deal. Lots of good souvenir shopping there but be prepared for slightly aggressive vendors....everyone tries to get you into their shop! Negotiate every price if you can if it's a more expensive item. So, to sum it all up, this was a fantastic trip with something for everyone, beautiful hotel, good food, wonderful staff and a lovely setting.

I have travelled alot and this has to be the best holiday ever for food, the rooms, the pool, the grounds. Il get bad thing out the way first. I had a silk nightie go missing from the room. The cleaners and concierge didnt care really and I never saw it again. So a bit of a downer for that. The safe was very safe also, I think they have changed them. Also I did the trick of touching all the buttons everytime I locked it. So that anyone who wanted to read my finger prints could nto tell which buttons I had pressed-Just to be on safe side. When we got there, we were booked into a normal junior suite. My h2b asked if we can pay to upgrade, which they said there was no rooms, however he then presented us with a free upgrade to deluxe suite with jucuzzi and mini bar and also access to all other resturants for free! So amazing and the room didnt disappoint us at all. The jucuzzi was huge and we used it every night with a free drink before getting ready to go out. Luxury! It seems all the british coming in while we were there all got the free upgrades to the deluxe rooms! Room was huge, very clean, very modern and bed was comfy for a hotel bed. Pools, there was so many to choose from but we stayed near the bbq pool as there was a swim up bar, toilets, close to beach and the bbq. I counted about 10 jucczis within the pools, so plenty of space to sit, chat to others and enjoy a cocktail in the sun. Plenty of loungers, even in the afternoon, so you dont have to get up early to reserve your lounger at all!. Even with the hotel being very busy with we think either american holiday or mexican holiday time. Dont worry there Try as many cocktails as you can, they can be non alcoholic also. Have the RIVIERA MAYA or strawberry slush puppy type drink. Yum yum. This is first hotel, you can have cocktails included in the allinclusive package. Served with large cups if by the pool or glasses at the bars. Nice cold glasses too. We sat most nights in the lobby bar, then usually headed to the sportsd bar to cool down for last few drinks and to have a midnight feast or toasties or burger and chips for free. The food, I am such a fussy easter, but i tried curries, sushi, seafood, mexican food, different chinese food. I loved it all. Even if you dont want to eat in the main buffet whenthe theme is on, still go in as they do normal food also, like jacket potatoes, chips, burgers, chicken. I loved the icecream too, really thick and creamy! I didnt speak to one person that complained about the food while we were there. The Al carte restuarants are great too, if you want to get dressed up in a nice dress and men in shirt and trousers, you have to take long trousers and closed shoes for these places. Worth it thought. Weather, it was great everyday, late 30s everyday, It was that hot that the sea and pools by 12pm were like having a bath, so cant cool down but still lovely and very clean. I am still taking about this holiday even a week after we got back, it was amazing, met some great people who we hope to stay in touch with and will go back in a few years after we get married. We arranged our holiday with Thomson for 2 weeks and it was worth every penny. Noticed some Americans moan about this place, but its petty things. like wish the pool towels were dropped off in room every day. Os they didnt have to go get the, It was never actually anthing to do with the hotel or food etc. First time i have wrote a review and everything is true to the word. You will love it.

We prefered the buffets no reservations required eat when you want always something good.Drinks at the bars are awsome never got a bad drink at any of the bars(only one thing bad no Dos XX but I can live with that.)bartenders and bar staff are awsome very busy but never a long wait,allways happy smiling and ready to chat with you about anything.We made some true friends with the staff here at G.R.P. can't wait to see them again.(Ruth,Santiago,Alberto.Wilbert you are the best!! )", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHuge Review - The best holiday I've ever had\u201d", "Author": "DauntingGecko", "ReviewID": "UR67889749", "Content": "The Grand Riviera Princess, Mexico. You\u2019ve been browsing the reviews trying to piece together information; fear not \u2013 the big review is here (I\u2019ll try and be unbiased). Let me put it this way \u2013 I\u2019ve travelled a lot and this was the best holiday ever (and that includes my stay at the Ritz in Malaysia)! The Hotel itself: The hotel is vast \u2013 very vast. Do not let this put you off because it doesn\u2019t mean your room is a million miles away from anything. They\u2019ve been very clever with it\u2019s design \u2013 it\u2019s actually classed as two hotels symmetrical to each other (you can use the others facilities) and the pools run through the entire grounds with restaurants placed throughout (like a big wobbly ladder shape with pools running through). There are small carts (like long golf carts) that take you from one end to the other, although we always walked about everywhere. The hotel is good and very clean, the staff are very friendly and seem genuinely happy always saying hello every time to walk past. It\u2019s not posh like the Ritz, however you\u2019d have to be a very hard guest to please if you didn\u2019t like the hotel. The gardens are maintained perfectly to the exact flower (I kid you not) \u2013 no random patches of burnt grass. There are tropical birds flying about outside (hey \u2013 it\u2019s Mexico), iguana\u2019s, tropical fish in the sea and even the occasional crab on the beach (don\u2019t worry \u2013 nothing, including insects will get into your room). From the front of the hotel to the beach at the back actually takes around 10-15 mins walk it is that big \u2013 but it isn\u2019t at all overcrowded. It has a nice mix and amount of people with a good atmosphere. There is a kids play area, hammocks, bridges, etc \u2013 you could happily stay in the hotel grounds for a week if that\u2019s your thing. The hotel room (junior deluxe suite) is pretty big with cool air con, fan, mini bar, TV, long mirror, dressing table, sofa, etc. The hotel isn\u2019t under any major flight paths so no noise from aircraft either. Package: We went with First Choice, all inclusive junior deluxe suite. The drinks (including well known branded alcohol), meals (buffet & special restaurants like Mexican), etc are all for free (eat as much as you like \u2013 including the room mini bar, which is restocked each day). We were met at the airport by our rep who comes from Mexico and was shown to our coach (modern, so don't worry). The journey from the airport took around 30 minutes and is pretty much a dead straight road down the coast to where all the hotels are based. Once upon arrival, we were greeted with a big smile and we could grab a cocktail straight away, whilst our bags were taken to our rooms. The Flight: We flew about 10 hours from Gatwick to Cancun using First Choice Airways. It was a Boeing 767 and had a 2-3-2 seating plan. The path from London to Cancun isn\u2019t straight \u2013 you head towards Canada and curve down past Bermuda, New York, over the tip of Florida and then land in Cancun. Nothing much to see except sea outside \u2013 too far away from land. Service on the plane was good, seats comfortable and couples most often get to sit next to windows. Larger groups tend to sit in the middle. In flight entertainment was \u00a35 (pay on flight) if you want more choice of movies - there wasn\u2019t much there. Most of the time I looked out of the window, played games or slept (or eating the meal - bangers and mash, which was nice). The Bathroom: Very nice and even has a Jacuzzi bath, separate shower and toilet cubicle. It\u2019s very clean, well maintained with large mirror, proper toilet, etc. No complaints basically. The bathroom was re-stocked each day with shampoo, etc so no worries there (take tooth paste though). The pool: There are a lot of pools \u2013 if you like swimming, seriously go here. There are some pools with a swim up bar, others for kids and the rest for just chilling and splashing about. The pool is like a huge wobbly \u2018H\u2019 shape with other smaller pools dotted about. It\u2019s by far the biggest pool I have ever come across (and am likely to see). The pool bars can get busy as you would expect but there are quieter areas with pool Jacuzzis too. Pool bars server cocktails and even ice cream! Don't worry about bringing towels - they provide them for free and give you towel cards. We even took snorkels in the pool and it was clean on the floor, no broken tiles, etc. Restaurants: Breakfast served from 7.30am \u2013 10.30am. Lunch 12pm - 2.30pm. Dinner 7.30pm - 11pm. There are two buffet restaurants that changes it\u2019s menu each day; there is tons of food - all to a very high quality. No funny tasting bread, etc - all very good food that the chefs take pride in to make. Between meals the grounds have BBQs (with chefs) serving hot dogs and burgers and so on in case you get hungry (doubt it). The al-la-carte restaurants seemed alright too \u2013 we only went to one (Mexican) and you have to book at reception before you go so they can allocate a table for you (they are smaller than buffet that can accommodate a lot of guests). There were even giant ice sculptures in the middle of the buffet that change each day (real ice hand carved \u2013 not fake ones). Food ranges from pizza, curry, steak, salads, soups, fruit, meats, seafood; the whole lot (caters for everyone). Beach: We went during the hurricane season during June and it didn\u2019t rain once \u2013 even though the forecast before we went said thunderstorms. Not a grey cloud in site (in fact we wanted rain by the end of the holiday). If you come across any bad weather during your stay, you\u2019ll be very unfortunate \u2013 seriously, don\u2019t worry about it. The beach was immaculate with a crystal clear sea that you can swim in (it feels like a warm bath). You can swim out for a good 100m and it still only comes up to chest height. Amazing \u2013 plenty of sun beds, volleyball, small bar etc at the back for sun worshippers. It\u2019s not a party style beach \u2013 perfectly suitable for everyone and everyone respected each other. Staff: Staff were very friendly and it was quite rare for any of them to not say \u201cHola\u201d when you walked past. The great thing is, most of them seem genuinely happy, hence making you feel happy too. The don\u2019t come across as if everything is for tips, although the odd dollar here and there does help them (remember \u2013 its not much to you, but to them they really appreciate it). Other Guests: Most guests are Americans, although there are French, Canadian, English, etc. The majority are younger (20 \u2013 35) and for some reason all look seriously good looking! Everyone respects each other with no shouting and causing trouble \u2013 a few giggles near the pool bars but families are there too with some older guests as well. Everyone got along great. You can mix in and have chats or you can happily be by yourself \u2013 it\u2019s up to you. This isn\u2019t a 18-30 party hotel \u2013 just a normal one with a bit of music and chilling out. Complaints: None at all. Everything was spot on. Those who complained in their reviews must have been very unlucky or extremely picky. Everyone I knew was having a lovely time. Weather: Again, I can't tell you what the weather is going to be like when you arrive. But for June 2010 (start of hurricane season) it was from 30*C onwards every day and the nights were warm and fuzzy \u2013 I guess around 23*C. Make sure you keep covered and be sensible \u2013 a few burnt people walking about including myself. Remember \u2013 your virtually in the jungle at the sea front! Locals: We stopped off at Playa-del-Carmen one day expecting to be pulled into various dodgy shops \u2013 but it was the total opposite. Locals were friendly and seemed fine. Sure they ask if you want something from their shop as you walk past but just politely say no and they don\u2019t worry about it. They won\u2019t start walking after you pestering for a deal like many places I\u2019ve been too. Some of the friendliest people I\u2019ve come across. Money: Between myself and my girlfriend we took around \u00a3300 GBP to spend. \u00a380 (each) of this went on a day trip to Chichen Itza (Mayan Temple). You will need 640 pesos (around \u00a335) each when you leave Mexico as a departure tax. Everything in the hotel is free (except the shops obviously) are free so unless you\u2019re a heavy tipper then it shouldn\u2019t be too bad. Obviously the more trips you do the more you have to spend, although on average a 1 day trip costs around \u00a380-\u00a3120 each (pretty expensive!). Out in Mexico itself, everything is very cheap but tourist areas didn\u2019t really see too many mind blowing offers. Trips: We decided to go to Chichen Itza. This cost \u00a380 each for the day, which involves catching the coach at reception at 7.30am and travelling for a couple of hours inland / jungle. You will be taken to a Senote (ancient natural under water river / well) to have a splash about in for an hour (if you want to), then on to a restaurant for lunch and finally then on to Chichen Itza (Mayan Temple / city) for 3 to 4 hours (seriously \u2013 take a camera). The Senote was pretty special \u2013 you get to swim with small catfish in this crystal clean water from an under water well. Very refreshing with birds flying above your heads since it forms part of a cave as well. Chichen Itza is a new 7th wonder of the world \u2013 a truly mind blowing place. I don\u2019t need to say anything more to advertise this and we returned at about 7pm local time. Distances: Hotel to Chicen Itza / Senote well is about 2 hours coach journey. The airport is 30 mins away from the hotel. Tip: Iguana's like banana's. People moaning about staff stealing stuff - buy a padlock, shove valuables into suitcase and they won't steal it (you can't moan after reading that the staff steal your stuff and you leave it in the safe that security have access to). Well, I hope this answers most of your questions. I've summed up everything I could think of - if you need anything else answered then give me a shout. :) Liked \u2014 The pool, the people, the food.

Highly recommend the Platinum or Villa rooms to get away from the busy swim-up bar pools which tended to be quite loud in the afternoon. Both these room options have private pool areas which are much quieter and have their own bar service with premium drinks. Also, these rooms permit guests to make a la carte dinner bookings through a private concierge which simplifies the reservation process. With Platinum or Villa rooms you can book a la carte restaurants every night of your stay- a must since the buffet would likely become tiresome if frequented three times a day. For vegetarians, although unadvertised, each a la carte restaurant has a separate vegetarian menu but you need to ask the host for it when you arrive at the restaurant. Vegetarian options at the buffet are rather limited. Overall the food was pretty good, but everything else we got with our Platinum stay was excellent (clean, comfortable room, beautiful beach, variety of pools, nice jacuzzi on the terrace, free massage, good service).

All of the hotel staff are as helpful as they possibly can be. There was never a time that we would walk by one and they would not say \"Hola.\" Not only that, but the staff literally works their tails off to keep the resort looking immaculate. This hotel has so much to offer. There is no time to get bored and you really have no reason to leave the resort. My husband and I did do snorkeling one day as well as a trip to Tulum for the Mayan Ruins. The nightlife is a blast, but be prepared to not last past 12:00am because of all of the walking, drinks and activities you will do each day. I highly reccommend having a massage on the beach, it was wonderful! Also make sure you go to the pool where Jesus is the bartender and be sure to tip him well! The entertainment staff was fabulous and always making the guests chuckle. I did however get over 20 bug bites while I was here, but I am always getting eaten up. Just make sure that you bring bug spray. The piano bar is wonderful and very relaxing if you are looking for a mellow night at the hotel. We had a swimout room and it was fantastic! We found that we like to mix it up with the beach and pools early in the day and end with being in the pool right outside our room. The pool does close early, which kind of stinks, but it is a way for them to get you into the nightlife. There was nightly entertainment and it was great. There was also a night when the venders from the city came in and sold their items. This was a very fun night because you are able to see how they make certain things they are selling. We highly reccommend Momma Mia. It is the italian restaurant. It was so good. We are very picky eaters so we were sure to make a couple of reservations at this restaurant to avoid buffet food breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Compared to most Mayan Riviera resorts, this one was close to Playa del Carmen, which was a huge plus. The resort is huge, and beautiful, which means that there is a lot to see and do. I read that the walk from the lobby to the beach was 15 minutes but it's closer to 5-7 minutes. We were upgraded to a deluxe room, which was sweet. The rooms were great, particularly the bathrooms with a big rainfall shower and whirlpool bathtub. Food was typical resort grub, but good variety. My friend's wedding was great, the staff did a great job. The Thai Beach Club, which is where my friend had her reception, is definitely a highlight of the resort. Things that could be improved: the lobby bar closes too early (midnight) considering that it's best place to have drinks. \"Sports bar\" is dead and \"Disco\" is like taking a hit of acid (pitch black, crazy lights and \"club hits '99\" cranked to 11). Also, while all the other drinks are good, the wine is seriously not drinkable. For a purported five-star, they need to upgrade to at least a cheap bottled wine. What they had was some kind of homemade vinegar & grape juice mess that tasted like poison. For a huge resort, it was very well run. The beach was beautiful and the location close to Playa was key.

There were plenty of sun loungers at the pool and the beach. There is a free shuttle bus twice daily to Playa del Carmen (you need to book it the day before, just ask at reception and they will point you in the right direction). You can only book two A la Carte restaurants at a time. Any one entering the complex through the main entrance lobby passes through a security barrier.There are security staff patrolling the grounds and we did not hear of any rooms being broken into and our safe was secure. I had a minor accident the day before we left and all the staff were considerate and caring. Can't really comment on evening entertainment, as like many of those we met , by 10.30pm we were ready for bed. We met a great many people from the UK, Canada and the USA.

There is no limit to how many times you book the a' la carte restaurants, unlike many hotel. So if you don't like buffet style meals on an evening then you don't ever have to have one. However the buffets was very good, especially breakfast! I would recommend the steak restaurant or the Miso (oriental). We were upgraded to a Junior Suite which was a great room, well laid out, well maintained and very clean. The bed was comfortable and the air conditioning worked well.

I have to say...some of the negative reviews were a little confusing to me!? I must have read every review before we left and I was freaking out a little bit! However, I was pleasantly surprised, thankfully! It is true! The resort is absolutely stunning and so immaculate! They definitely earn points for being so nice. Check in was quick and easy, we even got our champagne. We reserved the Deluxe Junior Suite and tried to upgrade to Platinum, but they said they were full. But I am glad we didn't, we didn't need to, the room we had was soooo great and spacious, it overlooked two pools as well! It was by the activities pool, but the noise did not bother us, if we could even hear it! Beware though, the beds are pretty hard. Didn't bother me, but my boyfriend was not a fan! Since the resort is sooo big, we didn't have to wake up at the crack of dawn to get prime seating! There were so many options of where we could go. We even found palapas on the beach everyday we spent down at the beach, which is key when it is that HOT! We didn't wake up until 8:30-9:00 everyday and still got great seating at the pools and beach! I know people have said that they line you up line sardines on the beach, but we never had a problem with being over crowded by other people, in other words they were in close proximity but not on top of us, but they do line up the chairs in rows. Maybe it didn't bother us because there was only 2 of us? They also have a bar and waitresses on the beach. Dinners: We managed to get a reservation every night we were there (except our first night)! We made our reservations at 9 pm every night. This worked great for us as we like to be out at the pool until 5 or 6, rest, have pre-dinner drink at the lobby bar and go eat. The A la cartes were not too bad. Our favorites were Miso and Hacienda, these two have pretty good food!!! Tapas was pretty good too! La Fondue was ok, Las Olas was ok, La Fluer was probably my least favorite, but still ok! The lobby bars, I felt they closed a little too early. By the time we were done with dinner and on our way to get another drink they would close shortly after. We did not want to go to the dance club or whatever it is, and we never felt like going to the sports bar after being at the lobby bar. However, those options were open to us. Just wish we could have had another few drinks at the chill, airy lobby bars! The swim up bars were fun! Always nice to have that around, and there were sooo many to choose from! Drinks-were pretty good! They had Absolute, which I loved! But you have to make sure to ask for it! The wine-was pretty bad! But I still sucked some down as I was sick of fruity drinks. So if you are like me, then just at an Absolute dirty martini DRY-though. :) We never had anything stolen from us and I was afraid we would, as the sticker that probably allows someone to open the safe was coming undone. But again NOTHING was stolen. Thankfully!!! So I feel safe in telling you to keep you stuff in the safe. We did all week along! Maids came about 2 everyday and we always got towels! :) never an issue with them! Tipping... We tipped all the time, these people are working so hard in the hot sun to ensure you have a good time and we did, but we honestly didn't see any change in service. They still served us, but didn't go above or beyond for us, especially at the swim up bar and beach. But to be fair there were soooo many people they had to serve!!! They probably didn't remember who tipped and who didn't! But we chose to continue to tip, because regardless (again) they work all day and night to serve you! Still plan on bringing money to tip! Negatives: Not too many, but a major one... and I can't believe I am going to complain about this, as I know AI's food is never gourmet and I expect average food!!! but The Buffets were pretty bad! uugghhhh! This is by far the worst buffet(s) I have been to! The worst, was breakfast for me. I don't know why, but to me it was almost inedible. Lunch was better, but be prepared to be surrounded by tons of fried foods. I had salad with no dressing a lot and that was fine. Their fried foods seemed to be pretty safe, but there's only so much fried food you can eat when you normally don't eat it at home! But what the heck, we were on Vacation. However, my boyfriend did get sick one day after lunch, not sure what it was, but we were thinking it was the squid, he thought is was something different and it wasn't cooked properly. So be careful of that sort of stuff at the buffets. Thankfully he was only sick one day and it didn't interfere with him being outside! Oh and it was a challenge to get water, etc... so we never had to tip at the buffets, as we rarely got drinks! Next negative; When we arrived we never received towel cards, I think this has to do with the fact that we were trying to upgrade, so we distracted the gentleman that checked us in. We checked in at around 5pm so we didn't go to the pool when we arrived. The next day we try to get our towels and are told we need towel cards, we walk all the way back to the front desk and they tell my Boyfriend (I was setting up our transfer back to the airport) that I signed for them and that we have to pay $20/towel card. So we go all the way back to the room to look again for them, nothing. We go all the way back this time I go up and explain to him that I never received them and I am not lying, they were never even explained to us, etc.....after 10 minutes of nicely begging, he finally gave them to us and said he was doing me a favor! Whatever, they consider themselves 5 star-HA! That is hardly 5 star service! But it doesn't matter! We got them and the rest of the trip was a breeze!!! We definitely didn't let it ruin our trip, but just want to let you all know that you need to make sure to get them at check in. Things that you may want to consider: This resort is huge! We stayed at the Valentin last November and I thought that resort was big, NO!!! It wasn't bad to get some exercise, but it got really old if you forgot something and had to trek all the way back to get it! If you don't like to walk-DO NOT go here. It was almost too big for me! and I don't mind walking off the booze and fried food! Also it is VERY slippery, (that is true). I never fell and only slipped once, but I was sooo cautious! Just be very very careful! Private transfers-It was soooo nice to not have to drop off others at their resorts, or pick them up! Totally worth the extra money!!!! I don't think we will ever not do a private transfer! Our ride to the hotel was soooo fun, he had beer for us and everything! He was a riot! It was through Lomas/Funjet. Don't fly US Air if you can avoid it! They were just annoying and completely disorganized! Has nothing to do with the GRP but thought I would throw that in! HA! Things that I think they should change: Towel Cards-dumbest thing ever! I have never had to use towel cards at any AI. It doesn't make any sense why you would use them, especially if you have wristbands! Wristbands-Not that that's a bad thing to have them, but it's nice not to have to wear them. :) Reservations-I personally don't like going to make reservations, it can be an inconvenience at times. However, it's great for people who like to eat at an exact time. I just prefer to go where ever, whenever I want that night. :) But again, nothing that ruined our trip! It was very easy for us to get reservations. Room Service-I think it should be available for every room category! We still paid a lot of money! Things to bring: BUG SPRAY! Not sure why, but I seemed to be the only one being eaten alive, my boyfriend... nothing! but I was chomped on all week!!! I have soo many! I brought it last time with me in November and I still got eaten! So I didn't bring it this time, but I wish I had, just in case it worked this time! Sun Screen-Not sure how you could forget that, but lots of people we met, did. I brought 30, 50 and 70. We used the 50 and 70 the most. My boyfriend still got burned and I still got tan! This time of year the sun is even more intense! Just be diligent about applying. Aloe-I can't believe I forgot this, but we needed it. I-pod speakers Hat(s)- total life savers for our faces and scalps. We had a really great time at this resort, met some great people and plenty to drink! :) Do not worry about all the negative reviews! Not sure where they are coming from? I kept saying that all week too! The people I told about the reviews were just as shocked as they all had the greatest experience!!! Just relax and make the most of it! If something negative does happen, like towel cards or buffets, try not to let that ruin your trip! (we didn't) You are at a beautiful resort in the beautiful Mayan Riviera. How could things be bad? I just think some people have really bad luck or a really bad attitude? We will probably not go there again, unless we are with a group and they have kids, but that's only because we like to try out new resorts when we travel!!! Sorry it's so long, but hope it helped!

Lastly, there are several restaurants, bars and lounge areas where one can hang out. We only went to the Disco on one night.. the music was decent and it wasn't empty, but also not too lively. For the most part, the food was delicious. It is difficult to make reservations at the a la carte restaurants, as they book quickly and it's best to try to book two days in advance. The restaurant that served american food was disappointing but not a big problem as the buffets are always an option and always serve satisfying food. The only other downside is that in one of the main pools, there always end up being many plastic cups (empty and not) left inside and around the pool.

Fully stocked mini fridge with water, pop and beer (we exchanged the beer for more pop and water). Room was completely ready when we got there (checked in at 3:30pm). Was clean and the a/c had been on so was nice to enjoy a cool room. Plenty of towels every time and throughout the day a maid would knock asking if we needed any amenities or more towels. Turn down service was also nice. Would not recommend using the jacuzzi in the balcony at night though since after the sun goes down there is quite a bit of bugs out there. Plenty of pools and never had a problem finding a chair in the shade (though some ppl did play the towel game). The grounds and pools are kept immaculate (would see workers scrubbing the walkways everynight with water and soap). Never a piece of garbage or cigarette butts anywhere (ashtrays cleaned out mins after someone put something out). Resort is quite big but I did enjoy walking (never used the trolley once). Beach also beautiful. Water was a bit rough a couple of days but calm the rest of the week. Some areas there were quite a bit of rocks but you can see them and avoid stepping on them. However if you enter from the sunset side right by the water sports hut, its pretty much clear. Lots of chairs everywhere. Waiter taking orders all over the beach (not just if your in platinum area). Same goes for pool area. Did some snorkleing right at the beach, wasnt too great but saw a few tropical fish. If you are snorkler wouldnt really recommend it. Food was good. Plenty of choices in the buffet and for the a la carte. We ate at the Swiss (fondu), Mexican, Japanese, Grill, Italian, and Thai (had invitation in our room when we arrived). My favourite were definetly the Japanese and Thai. Didnt do many activities around the resort except for the massages which were included with our room. The spa is beautiful and the massage was great. They also offer 1 hr massages on the beach for $50.

Neither of us had been to Mexico before and we were both a little apprehensive about going after reading some of the negative reviews on here, but from the minute we got to the hotel we enjoyed ourselves immensely and couldn't believe how people could slate the place! The whole complex is immaculate and staff are constantly cleaning and maintaining the grounds. The surrounding gardens are beautiful and it was a pleasure to walk around. Our room was beautiful as well. We stayed in the Junior Suite Deluxe and it was perfect for us. The king size bed was very comfortable, air con worked a treat, it was spacious with nice decor and was cleaned to an excellent standard daily. Had read on some of the reviews that were problems with security and the safe but we never experienced this. The pools are great- you can go to a different one everyday. we always got up early and found a good spot in the shade as it was really hot, but there were always plenty of loungers in the sun. There are pools quieter than others, some with entertainment and swim up bars-which were great! The beach was complete paradise- clear blue sea and white sand. There is a bar on there as well and plenty of activity options available but if you just want to relax like we did you can. Food was good- it wasn't gourmet but the choice was unbelievable-something for everyone. We tried 5 of the restaurants- the grill being our favourite and also the Tapas restaurant was a great experience with Flamenco dancing during your meal. Several reviews have commented on the fact they didn't like you in the buffet restaurants at lunch time with wet swimwear-we thought this was entirely reasonable, you wouldn't expect to be able to go in to a restaurant dripping wet! Drinks were plentiful! There was always a member of staff coming round the pools and beach asking if we wanted a drink so you didn't have to move at all if you didn't want to! Finally the thing that brought the whole holiday together was the brilliant staff. They were all so helpful. polite and welcoming and they all work really hard. The complaints on here regarding the staff seem completely out of order-they had the patience of saints going by some of the treatment they received from fellow guests. We made an effort to speak bits of Spanish here and there, which is a respectful thing to do anyway when in a foreign country, and this seemed to be very well received by the staff. Everyone said hello and asked how we were. We were treated so well, we can't speak highly enough of them. :) Even when our plane was delayed by a day the hotel let us keep our room and use all the facilities which we really appreciated. If we had one grievance during the entire holiday it was the rudeness and arrogance of some of the guests-it was shocking to see just how rude some people can be. It is not something i have encountered before on holidays in Europe. There seemed to be no recognition of the staff at all- no please or thankyous- expecting to be waited on hand on foot as if it was mandatory. The staff were there to serve but not to be treated like 3rd class citizens. Overall, we would recommend this hotel to anyone, we had a wonderful experience and hope to return some day soon!

The main reason we decided on Mexico was because of the amazing two week deal we got otherwise it would not have been my first choice. The hotel is amazing and it is 5* quality for the carribean that is. Be aware that this hotel is HUGE!!!! It can take 15 mins to walk from reception through the hotel to the beach and if your room is near reception then you are a long way from the pools and the beach!! If you are after quiet, small this is NOT the hotel for you. The hotel was only 40% full wen we went (swine flu scared everyone) they didnt even have the sunset side open and moved everyone into the princess side. So i can imagine that if it is full it might feel very very crowded. Room: We initially had a room facing a brick wall and building site, went bak to reception immediately and asked to be moved. They moved us the next day and we got upgraded as well. if you are not happy be polite but stand ur ground and no-problem. lovely and clean mini-bar filled everyday take toothpaste, toothbrushes and tampons etc to tip the maid with and she will do a fantastic job. Food: lovely, loads of variety at the buffett at all meal times only down side was dinner: it was like feeding time at the zoo. stressful. there was no dress code and it was not a nice experience. (after lying around in a bikini all day i like to make an effort at dinner) we found the al a carts and booked these for every night. they were all amazing some of the best food i have had definately 5* experience entertainment was ok but not really a couple who is bothered with this. enjoyed a nice drink in the amazing courtyard at night very relaxing or the lobby bar was a lovely place to sit and the barstaff were lovely here. pool: if you want lively then there is that or if you want to find a nice quiet corner you can do. only down side was the really loud americans, they were so loud every conversation was a shouting match. luckily they tend to stay near the swinup bars getting drunk so u can avoid them for most of the day. staff walk around all day offering to get you a drink beach: i have been all over the carribbean and the beach is not really anything special compared to what i have seen but i have high standards. but i can not say anything bad about it, it is lovel and clean and you can walk for miles either direction. we did one organised trip which was ok but for wat it cost we could have hired a car and done the things individually for cheaper. also went into the local town on the hotel free shuttle bus, be prepared it is hot in town no sea breeze it was nice to get out and if you are prepared to barter u can grab amazing deals on silver, all the shops sell exactly the same so if u dont like the price jus go to the next shop. dont buy from the hotel shop they sell exactly the same in town for much less cost. all in all it was a lovely holiday for the price we payed. however would not return again there is nothing much to do there and the landscape is very very boring. but for some sun, sea and cocktails it is perfect.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cMiddle of the Road\u201d", "Author": "brinkr14", "ReviewID": "UR66252153", "Content": "We stayed in a Platinum Suite and it was my first time at an all inclusive so I did not know what to expect.

Got a great deal from FunJet out of Chicago. I was a little apprehensive due to the negative reviews I'd read here. Overall - I can't agree with the negative comments. We had a great time! The GOOD: Grounds: This place is HUGE! If you don't enjoy walking, you may want to book a smaller hotel. Go to the hotel site, check out the aerial map. No matter where your room is - we were in the 7200s - you will have a good walk to the beach or lobby or buffets or restaurants. There is a trolley from each lobby strait to the beach, but you need your towels and they can be found near the pool bar. The grounds are BEAUTIFUL! Check out any of the pics people posted - they are spot on. Lots of birds, butterflies and iguanas around! Room: The layout of the resort does not allow for any beach views. Look at the aerial diagram from the site. You need to have a Platinum room upgrade to be close to the beach and a possible beach view. Our room was spacious and clean. The balcony offered a beautiful view of the sunrise over the jungle - pretty cool. The shower door leaked - easy fix - lay down a towel. Not a problem! Food: We had the regular all-inclusive: 2 buffets, 7 restaurants, 24 hour sports bar. You will always find food/drinks. Buffet style food is made in bulk, so you can't expect it to be 5-star cuisine! The food was a solid 7/10, with some individual items better/worse than others. Not a problem. Book your restaurant reservation according to the rules - we never had a problem getting a spot at a time we wanted. Lots of food choices - we liked the Tapas best. Pools: There are several large interconnecting pools. You have to get out a few times because not every bridge is high enough to swim under. The pools were clear and clean, with a central area of entertainment and a couple pool bars. Some rooms had pool access right outside their room doors. Kinda cool. Beach-Sand: Beautiful, a little rocky, a little small for the size of this resort. The Platinum area is roped off and closest to the bar. Stake out a shady spot early! It was super hot & humid during our visit, so everyone wanted an escape from the sun! Sand is a fine texture and nearly white. Many birds and small fish. Felt very safe - it's ok to go to the beach at night as well. Security is posted. Beach-Water: Best to wear water shoes if you have tender feet - some of the rocks are sharp. Based on the tide, the rocks are more prominent in the am, and covered with more sand in the late afternoon. Color of the water is stunning! Clear, light green to turquoise to blue along the horizon. Rent a wave runner - it's worth it! Service: Maid and mini bar service was great. We left a small tip for each the first day only. When we chose not to have the maid come the 3rd day, were called twice to confirm we had enough towels and drinks. Buffet service was great - please wait to be seated! It seems like it's frowned upon to just walk in and sit down. Once seated, drinks were replenished quickly and dirty dishes removed right away. Bar service could sometimes be spotty on the beach, but in the lobby bars and pool bars - great! General staff -- very friendly and polite. A little flirty sometimes - we were a group of 4 women and enjoyed it just fine! Special shout-out to Omar from Lomas travel - You Rock! Thanks for all your help in booking our trips! Entertainment: Fun! The usual pool folly, but the shows were actually pretty good. We really liked the fire show and the Mexican Market. Lot's of day trips to choose from. We enjoyed Xcaret the best! Free shuttle to Playa Del Carmen leaves at 11 and 12, returns at 6pm daily. Taxi is $13 US. Fellow Vacationers: Only rudeness I saw was from fellow vacationers! The staff is very friendly. (Would it kill ya to reply \"Hola\"?) I witnessed several fellow vacationers who were mean, rude, disrespectful and filthy! Can't believe the attitudes of some people. (Learn a little bit of the language and use pesos) This is a beautiful resort and the staff seems to work very hard, but they are not indentured servants or 3rd class citizens! Follow the simple rules - don't put your feet up on the lobby furniture, scream in the hallways, act pissy when the change for your cash purchases is given in pesos (Hello - it's the country's currency!) or be belligerent when you drink! Don't hoard food from the buffet and try to bring it to your room. The sports bar is open 24 hours - there is always food/drink available! Other: Weather was great - but very hot & humid this late in the season. Forecast said 30-60% chance of rain every day, but it only rained briefly twice. Only about 40 minutes from the airport and close to many day trip options. (Xcaret, Paradise snorkel, Zip line/ATV/Horseback/Camels, Playa del Carmen) Will take USD, but use pesos Exchange rate was pretty good. The BAD: 1. Rude people who can't seem to appropriately close their hotel door - they SLAM it! Every floor is marble so the sound travels! 2. Every floor is marble, so when it rains or if some fellow vacationer spills a drink or drips down the hall in a wet bathing suit, you may fall! The staff if very vigilant in keeping the place clean and dry, but I did see a few wipe-outs! That's it! Hope you find it helpful.

Restaurants: We ate at Las Olas, Mama Mia, La Hacienda, La Vaqueria, & La Fondue. All were good/excellent. My parents and I ate basically everything served to us. Just enjoy yourselves and you will like the food. All the waiters were great, nice, very fast and all got nice tips from us. Very fast to clear tables after each dish and bring us drinks that you can order from the bar! Water was filled every 5 minutes. La Fondue was superb! Maybe because it was our last night, but we had a lot of fun at that place. Mama Mia, mom and I each ordered a pizza which were HUGE; share one if you get that! Dad had lasagna and loved it. La Hacienda we all ordered fajitas. My shrimp could have had a bit more marinade of some sort, but was still wonderful. Had salmon at the other two, also good. (I don't eat chicken, pork, or beef so no personal reviews on those choices). Order a Mayan Sacrifice shot at La Vaqueria & tell Houdini the bartender not to drop his full tequila bottle again! I was expecting a lot more disappointment from some of the reviews, but those people must whine about every little thing. Seriously, you can get bad food at Mcdonalds or Olive Garden. IT HAPPENS! No need to throw a huge fit about it. There's always the buffet if you didn't get enough to eat. Buffets: A lot of choices. Again, I was expecting more disappointment. SO much fresh fruit and vegetables, it was heaven! Yes, some food gets cold, it's a buffet. I don't understand what people don't understand about that. Yes, some things aren't that great, go grab another plate of food. The magic of \"free\" food! It wasn't overly salty like I was expecting either...???? The workers there clear your tables very fast & refill drinks like crazy. Wait to be seated (takes 10 seconds). It's generally the same food everyday, but there are some noticeable differences also. I loved the fresh fried fish they were making on the grills! Desserts, so-so, mainly dethawed cakes of some sort. I made banana splits with the bananas & ice cream available. Try that! Yummy yummy chocolate filled croissants in the morning - add butter, so good! The bread station is deliiiccious! Pools: Amazing, we spent 2 or 3 days at the pools. Bartenders work so very fast & never seem to get a break. So what if it takes 5 minutes to get a drink sometimes, do you not see all the people there and how fast they are working? Bars in San Diego here take 20 minutes sometimes! Bring your own large cup if you want. We had them but didn't bring them down for some reason. TIP YOUR BARTENDERS! You wouldn't not tip a bartender at a regular bar where you paid for a drink, would you? Ocean: There are rocks, yes. It's the ocean. My dad and I both did not wear water shoes, mom did. If you step on a rock, move 6 inches to the right or left. Problem solved. Wear water shoes if that will be a problem. I believe the days after it rained, there were more rocks showing. We brought our tubes/swim floaties into the ocean the last day, which was really fun jumping waves with! You won't touch the ground at all then. Rooms: Pretty large. The balconies are huge! There were two days we had to call to have the maid come, BUT they did knock on the door, and we hadn't left yet. My mom isn't good on speaking in \"simple\" english so that they can understand that we'll be out in a few minutes and instead spoke in extravagant sentences, so that may be the problem. A 5 second call to the lobby fixed that and rooms were cleaned when we returned. Fridge was stocked daily as well. Loved the showerhead in the shower. We used the jacuzzi one night in the bathroom. Sunburns didn't work too well with using that! Grounds: Amazing! Every time we passed the Laguna Villas, I looked for the resident iguanas that hung out on the stairs there. Workers are all nice and 95% said hola when we passed them. Never met someone who was blatantly rude, just someone who maybe didn't say hello. No worries! Other: Entertainment was alright. By the time it was \"entertainment time\", we were pretty tired anyway. We just watched one show which was enough for us, I'm not big on those anywhere. They had singers/bands playing by the bar between the buffets. It was a nice place to hang out and relax. Flaming coffees are amazing! We got those 4 or 5 times. Definitely try those out! We went to Cozumel one day and did Xel-Ha. Both recommended! My parents are big on \"all inclusive\" things so we did a snorkeling tour at Cozumel which was fun and then the Xel-Ha/Tulum tour from Best Day Travel, which you can find at the resort. Cons: ---The internet sucks in the room. We bought a 24hr pass for $20 one day just to check in quick & I had to check bank accounts. Was too lazy to go to the lobby, so we sucked it up. It should be cheaper AND be of good quality in the rooms! ---Some of the guests were RUDE! I specifically remember a younger ish couple the first morning at the egg station who cut in line, I told them nicely the line was behind us, they just stared at me. I even pointed to show them if they didn't speak english. Still just stared at me so I called them rude. Wonder what their problem was, must have thought they were entitled to eggs before everyone else patiently waiting? Seriously, just enjoy yourself and stop freaking out about everything. We didn't use the safe, but brought those zip ties and placed all our electronics/etc into a suitcase and tied it shut. I brought small MasterLocks as well, but the zip ties worked well. No problems with theft of anything else (unless it was a sock or something that I didn't realize). I understand some things go wrong (such as a bad plate of food at a restaurant, we met a guy who got sick after something he ate at one, but was fine after that) but don't let it get you down, you're on vacation! Don't be careless (leaving out your $100 bills or something). The walking is nothing, after you binge on food, you will love the walking. Mosquitoes are definitely out. I never wore repellent (BAD IDEA) so I have a bunch of bites still... however, I am originally from Minnesota and bug bites are nothing new to me, are they new to you enough to complain about them on a review? I hope this helps some of you. I am a 24yr old & my parents are in their 50s... we all would go back in a second, and actually may in the next couple years.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent 5* holiday. Worth every penny!\u201d", "Author": "Spuriosity", "ReviewID": "UR65397447", "Content": "I had read a lot of reviews of the hotel on here prior to arriving and was a little nervous about what to expect, particularly as several had stated that the hotel was nowhere near up to 5* standard. Almost every aspect of our holiday was 5* or above. The hotel itself was beautiful and the grounds were just as nice. We flew into Cancun on an 11 hour Thomson flight \u2013 not a nice experience \u2013 but that\u2019s another story. The transfer was only 35-40 minutes long and we found the driving to be very good unlike many other countries we have visited. During check in we were told that we had been given a \u2018free upgrade\u2019 to a room with a Jacuzzi. Having had a swim up room previously in St. Lucia, I was actually disappointed not to have kept ours this time, however the disappointment didn\u2019t last long after seeing the swim up rooms in the resort. They had no privacy and the pools and sun loungers were free for anyone to use. Our room, however, was beautiful and modern. The room was always kept clean, although I\u2019m pretty sure they changed the towels every day even when we had opted to keep them. The only time we had a problem with the maid service was when we were in the room for an hour one afternoon when they called and they never returned to clean the room. Also, the Jacuzzi broke on two occasions but they were very quick to send someone to fix it. We didn\u2019t have any problems with mosquitoes in the room, but the few occasions where we forgot to apply insect repellent on an evening out or on an excursion, we got eaten alive! As well as the usual shower cap, sewing kit etc, the hotel also put insect repellent wipes in the room. There was a mini bar in the room that was usually refilled with water, a selection of fizzy drinks and two cans of beer. We were told by our holiday rep that we\u2019d have spirits in the room as well, but we never actually got any. It wasn\u2019t really a problem anyway, as there were plenty of bars to choose from to get our unlimited drinks. The price of the room also included the use of a large safe, which was a nice surprise after having to pay in excess of $40 for the luxury in other resorts. There were two buffet restaurants to choose from for dinner as well as nine A La Carte restaurants that needed to be booked 24 hours in advance. Needless to say, we only ate in the buffet restaurant the first night before working our way through the remainder of the restaurants! The food in the buffet restaurants was generally good however some days weren\u2019t great. As someone who doesn\u2019t like fish, I normally struggle finding food I like in resorts like this, but there was always plenty of choice of meat and vegetables as well as seafood. We found the best A La Carte restaurant to be the grill, by a long way. The service on the resort was absolutely impeccable throughout. There were hundreds and hundreds of staff working at the resort and every single day there were people out working tirelessly to keep the grounds perfect. The grass was mown twice in the week that we stayed there and the hedges were trimmed every single day by men with machetes!! Every time we passed a member of staff, they went out of their way to say \u2018Hola\u2019 and give us a nice smile. It was always so good that the one time where we didn\u2019t get a smile or polite word from our waiter in the Italian restaurant, it really stood out and we didn\u2019t return there. There was an excellent choice of pools, three of which had swim up bars. The main pool was generally the busiest and also the loudest as that was where most of the entertainment took place but if you were after peace and quiet, there were at least four other large pools that you could choose from. A few reviews I read had complained about the beach being rocky, which I didn\u2019t figure out for a good few days. It was very beautiful and sandy, however as we discovered, if you venture into the sea, sometimes (and I stress, sometimes) the ground can by very uncomfortable under foot. That said, I loved swimming in the sea there \u2013 it was actually warm! It was also quite surreal as you could swim out for fifty metres and still be at no more than waist depth! The hotel offered free non-motorised water sports, which I have to admit, we didn\u2019t take advantage of. We did, however, enquire about scuba diving and they told us that we could just turn up in the morning and we could go. Unfortunately they didn\u2019t tell us that they didn\u2019t dive on Sundays so having waited until the last possible moment to go we were left disappointed. Not wanting to miss out on seeing the second biggest coral reef in the world, we opted to snorkel instead. It cost $70 for an hour including the boat ride \u2013 which was not only expensive in itself but the reef was extremely unimpressive with very few fish to look at. The resort was relatively quiet when we arrived, but got a lot busier throughout the week, with most people being happy to spend their 5* holiday sitting by the pool \u2013 an expensive way to get a sun tan! We like to go out and explore the area as well, which we found very easy to do thanks to our Thomson/First Choice holiday rep. We went on the ATV (quad biking) tour and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was fun and fast and about half way through we stopped for a swim in a cenote (an underground lake with crystal clear water) and then also to see the beautiful caves with the stalactites and stalagmites and learn a bit about its Mayan history. We were advised not to go with some of the excursions \u2013 for example, the trip to see the ruins at Tulum. The excursion itself was overpriced , however it was easy to cut down the cost by doing it yourself. We caught the hotel\u2019s free shuttle bus into Playa Del Carmen in the morning, where we had a good wander around before then getting a local bus for about \u00a35 each return. Well worth it for the hour long journey to Tulum where the attraction itself was around \u00a32 to get into. When we were finished, we caught the hourly bus back to Playa Del Carmen in time for the free return shuttle to the hotel. Another point worth mentioning about that is the souvenirs. We were determined that we wanted to bring home a Mayan Calendar and found that many of the souvenir shops in Playa Del Carmen were selling them with a starting price of around 1900 Mexican Pesos. We\u2019d have been happy if we\u2019d bartered it down to around 900 Mexican Pesos, but we decided against getting it there and then as we didn\u2019t want to hump it around all day. While we were waiting for the return bus, we wandered around the shops in Tulum where we found a Mayan Calendar for 300 Mexican Pesos \u2013 a bargain! It shows how much they are marking up their items in the resorts and in the biggest tourist areas. Don\u2019t be scared to barter. They\u2019ll keep lowering the price until you buy it and if your price is a lot lower than what they\u2019re asking, just say that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got and leave \u2013 they\u2019ll soon call you back and let you have it \u2013 we managed to barter a necklace down from 550 Pesos to 70! In summary we had a great holiday and hope you enjoy the hotel and location as much as we did. My only advice would be to make sure you stay for over seven days because a week was nowhere near long enough!", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newmarket, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeware - Do not go!

It was awesome - from the beautiful landscaping to the room quality, great service, etc. I like to venture out and try new places so next time I'll probably experience a different resort but if we went back to Playa with a group, I'd definitely go back to GRP because it was so good. Pros: Beautiful landscaping and design, contemporary rooms, plenty of activities, tons of staff to help with whatever you need, great breakfast & lunch, very nice beach, bars/pools/restaurants everywhere, shuttle service, service from nearly all employees was impeccable. Proximity to the city was great as well. It was a giant resort so it felt very secure, but you could venture down to Playa del Carmen main street with a short taxi or shuttle ride.

Let me first say that given the price of this resort it far exceeded our expectations - particularly given the bad reviews I read prior to our arrival. Check - in - very smooth and the staff was very friendly. I've read reviews complaining about the fact that you aren't walked to your room and just given a map. It's not rocket science and there are signs everywhere. I'm confused as to why people are expecting RItz Carlton service at this price point. The room was very clean and very modern. Maid service was good with the exception of one day when we put the sign out that said \"please clean room\". I'm assuming the cleaning staff saw the sign and assumed it was \"do not disturb\". After calling housekeeping they sent 4 people immediately who cleaned the room. The only complaints about the swim up is: (A) the mesquitos answer - bring plenty of bug spray and benedryl if you're allergic. I would recommend bringing cintronella candles as well because if you're prone to getting bitten you will. It's my opinion that the mesquitos are worse in these rooms due to the proximity to the pool and the fountains on the ground level on the interior of the buildings. (B) there were a lot of people, particularly children who took it upon themselves to set up \"camp\" on the loungers and steps outside of the swim up rooms. Folks - please be respectful. The people in the swim ups have paid for access to the loungers and pools - don't use them. There are plenty of other places to relax - and you didn't pay for these rooms. Food - Decent - not great but certainly plenty to choose from. Keep in mind that if you miss multiple ala carte reservations they won't allow you to make any more. We found this out the hard way - but given the fact that we procrastinated, we were only able to make late reservations (9:00PM +) so by that late we just went to the buffets. Pools - Plenty of them. Party pool is very \"Spring Breakish\" very young crowd (early to late 20\"s) there to have a good time. So, if this isn't your thing you can either deal with it or go to one of the many other pools. Theft - didn't happen. We did bring a lock for our suitcase unfortantely locked the combination in the locked suitcase. Called security and he had it opened in less than 15 seconds (I'm sure he hadn't done that before :)) We had zero problems with anything being stolen. We put everything in the safe and never had any problems nor heard of any. Excursions - tool the Catamaran tour (9am - 3pm) well worth it. Great lobster and a good time as long as you're not prone to being sea sick. All in all - for the price you can't beat this resort. I can't stress enough - while this might be rated a 5 star resort - it's not the Ritz, the W or another typical 5 star resort. Remember the saying - \"You get what you pay for\"! Would I go back? Probably not, ONLY becaue I prefer a smaller resort with a more mature crowd and no kids.

It's as if the ocean knows how to take care of the swimmers, it's cool when you need it to be and warmer in the evenings when the weather cools down. Our resort had a wonderful spot on the beach. We read a lot of reviews before we left to the point i was extremely worried. I thought what have i done and had buyers remorse after we purchased the tickets and read more reviews.. thanks to the people who wrote such a varied opinion, it gave me a broad idea of what might happen. So here goes for me, this place was BEAUTIFUL!!! I am a very particular person and to see how much work they do to try to keep their grounds manicured, it makes me appreciate how nice the grounds look. The staff was excellent. There are a few that might not like their jobs as much, but they are still helpful and if they are greated with a smile, they return the favor. We opted for the platinum package and i enjoyed that a lot. We had a room on the top floor, and was very happy with our corner sweet. We could see the beach from our room, and so knowing something so beautiful was outside my door so close by made me too excited to sleep. We had different information from different staff, as helpful as they try to be, they don't all have the right information. With the platinum package you get your own concierge,and to they are the ones with the right information. If you need to get the main lobby the platinum has a shuttle that runs to the main lobby about every ten mins. The walk is long, about seven to ten mins, but if you like to stay in shape it's not a bad thing. The grounds are pretty always something to see, so the walk doesn't seem that long. Although the shuttle says platinum stop, there are individuals at other areas that use this shuttle, not sure how that works, but i didn't care too much since it wasn't so busy.. the problem i see is that there might be a wait if the shuttle is full. Somehow though we were able to go the whole week and get on when we needed to.. lucky i guess... :) My friends who went with us, let us pick the hotel, and they were happy with our choice! They really like how clean and modern the resort was. I loved it, and will probably go back again. Main pools close at six, but the platinum ones close at eight. The beach is right there so you can walk on the beach, no swimming at night though since no lifeguard on duty. The resort is clean inside your rooms,but it's just the little critters that find their way into your room somehow. As i am open minded and realized that their might be critters, we experienced an close encounter with a cute gecko. He was in our shower when we came back to our room after dinner. The gecko was quickly removed from our room once i told Marcus our awesome concierge!!! He made our vacation so much easier!! So thankful for him. We did a few excursions : xplor, xe-ha, and our friends did Isla Mujeres while half the group went to Mimosa at Playa and rented one of the beds and lounged on the beach most of the day. All the experiences were beautiful! We bought our tickets to the excursions from the resort and ended up paying less for xplor about 99 dollars compared to the 119 or 139 we saw online., but 8 dollars more for xe-ha then the internet price of 71 dollars so we paid 79 dollars to not have to wait in line to buy our tickets when we were there. We loved Xe-ha!!! Soooo pretty!! .... we would buy from them the travel agency at the resort again because they were very helpful!! Get there early little lines to buy tickets. Renting a car for at least one day to explore 5th street in Playa del Carmen was so worth it for our group of seven. Ended up being 20 bucks a person included gas to fill tank back to original mark.

Check in was a little slow could have had more people on but staff are very friendly. As it turned out all was for a good purpose about ten minutes before our walk to the room rain stopped and sun came out. They gave us a wheel chair for wife and we proceeded to the room and in by 1:45. On big note at this point. Resort is beautiful and very large!! This would have been a problem for us had wife been able to walk but did present a few minor issues. When we got to our room they are tremendous. We stayed in Platinum with Jacuzzi on balcony as well as room. Rooms are extra big but did have a musty smell to them. With this in mind get an extra card to keep in power out let. When it is taken out power goes out in room. We left the card in and with in a few hours it was OK. We booked our restaurants and all were very good. We at at the buffet one night and in a different one every night after that. I can not recommend one over another as all are great and really depends on what you like to eat. Staff at all locations again are great. Beach was very windy for the first three days and was really hard to enjoy. After wind died down we enjoyed it very much. As for a few concerns people expressed. Some spots have rocks on big deal. I have been to Beach's all over and can not say it was a problem. Colour of water, some spots were brown with and oder however easy to see and was a result of algae in the water. A lot of this the resort had nothing to do with and could happen at any water, beach lake Mother Nature is like that. Went to Playa Del Carmen and did some shopping and had some local food. Was a nice are but again with wifes foot was not able to really enjoy would like to go back again. Second day rented a car at the resort for $55 and drove to Tullum. What a great experience and beautiful beach will go back and enjoy more when wife can get around. Only cost $5 per person to get in. Went to restaurant at Tullum and food was good and fair price. Shops in area have great deals and fair prices. Going across the street you can find better deals. We had planned on going to \"Hidden Worlds\" after. We arrived at 2pm and they advised if we had a problem as we arrived late. Did not realize but they close at 5 and it takes 4 to 5 hours to do everything. They told us not to worry we could do what we want and come back again the next day, which we did. I can not say enough about \"Hidden World\" it is GREAT people are very friendly and the experience is outstanding. Swimming in the caves.zip line everything. The staff go out of the way to make sure you enjoy your self. They also have a market operated by some Mayans and would recommend saving some money for them real good deals. Hidden Worlds is not your typical \"big theme\" park that you will see along the road. No big tour buses but one of the best we have been to. As for the resort it is as clean and beautiful as people have said. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. Sure we ran into a few that may not smile but in a place like this 99% were excellent. A few points on the down side. We have never been to a resort before have always cruised. A lot of drinking and waste of booze. Not really for us and feel resort could have done a little more to control it. I understand that this is a issue at a lot of places. At least Riviera has a lot of areas to hang out and stay away fro m the rowdy group. We read a lot of posts about theft from the rooms. We did not us the safes. We brought four Lock's and lock things in the suitcases one inside the other. One night I went out and left about 900 pesos on the bed. Got to the re3sturaunt and realized did not have my money for tipping. Caught the trolley back to my room and ran up stairs. The door was open and the maids cart in front of the door. Went in and could not find my pesos. Started to look in my suit case and the maid came in and began her work.She saw what I was doing and said \"Pesos\" I said yes. She went over she had placed them on my wifes night stand. So gave her a big tip and thanks. Great story for them. Security guards not sure about. The are everywhere and the couple we meet in the same building that had been hanging out with my boys(young men) said they had been in there room about 11:30 and I guess making a little to much noise. Security came to the door to ask them to be quit. Before leaving they demanded money or they would report them. It is my understanding the if reported you get one warning written then asked to leave. They stated they also came back two nights later and asked for more money. I do believe the first incident but second not sure of. I had heard of a few others stories of young people that were drunk being asked for money or they would report them. As I said before we have never stayed at a resort before and really glad we did and stayed at Princess Resorts.

The only thing my friend and I didn't enjoy to the fullest extent was the buffet, but buffet's at all-inclusives tend to provide the same old greasy selections with limited variety, so we weren't going to let that ruin our vacation. We enjoyed the a la carte restaurants immenseley and enjoyed the fact that you could go to as many as you wanted, and go to the same one more than once. That's a great offering especially when the buffet lacks in variety/quality. Our room was a Junior Suite Swim-out room. I'd never stayed at a resort that had this option before. It was fantastic. The water was on the cold side but after being in the hot sun it was necessary to bring down our body temperature so the cold water was refreshing and after a few minutes your body adjusted to the temperature and it was great. Although there was a long stretch from our room to the beach and other pools, the resort offers a shuttle that comes every 10 minutes so that was very useful. We felt welcomed and comfortable from day 1. The staff were friendly and accomodating. The grounds, pools, restaurants and rooms were clean. We saw staff cleaning often so that was great to see. We were also surprised to find that the jewellery store at the resort offered competitive prices to that of the famous 5th Avenue shopping in Playa Del Carmen. I would definately stay at this resort again but next time I will pay extra for the Deluxe Suite which provides daily massages, exclusive access to a pool just for those guests in the Deluxe Suites and private access to the beach. I think a lot of the negative reviews could depend on the entire travelling experience those travellers had. If you didn't have a smooth trip in then I found the negative reviews reflected their bad mood. I read the reviews prior to leaving and it made me uneasy. But when we left, I realized that everyone values different things at a different level and one bad thing changes their view for their whole experience.

We purchased an 8 night stay and upon arrival (during check in at 3am) the hotel lobby clerk handed us a paper for us to sign, which stated a 7 night stay only. We met with the TMR rep (Sabrina) the following day to clarify/rectify the situation and we were surprised to have received no help and no willingness to accomodate for losing 1 night which results in getting only a 6 1/2 day stay due to the late arrival and check out at noon on the departure date. TMR never responded, and the rep they have at this hotel is more interested in you booking tours and charging you extra than providing good service. As for the hotel, I'll seperate the good and the bad: THE GOOD: - It is a nice big resort. The walking is less than 10 minutes from the main lobby to the beach and it is very enjoyable. The hotel offers a shuttle cart that leaves every 5-10 minutes (Daniel, the driver, was always very upbeat and ready to please). Even during checkin at 3am, we had our own shuttle that brought us to our suite. - The Platinum Suite is a definite must for the extra perks and accommodations it provides. Free Internet (24/7) in the lobby, 4 computers are at your disposal. Access to ALL a la carte restaurants and unlimited booking Free Beach/Pool Towels (No need for a Towel card) Free Room Service (24/7) Free Alcohol in the Suite (Whisky, Rum, Tequila...) Access to Platinum Concierge Right on the Beach Very quiet at night, which provides a good night sleep. - The employees were friendly and always said hello. - The room was always clean and the maid always made sure to fully stock the towels and mopped the floors every day.( Which would leave a nice touch of lemon scent to the room) - The A la carte restaurant LAS OLAS in particular was terrific.The service was quick and efficient. It was fairly empty at 7pm, which may be due to this A la carte not being included in the Regular All Inclusive package but available to the Platinum package at no additional charge. - No theft occured during our stay. THE BAD: - The beach is very rocky, you definitely need Water shoes to feel comfortable when walking and swimming in the water in front of this resort. Also has a lot of seaweed, not the best beach around. - The hotel offers Photo Sessions that can invade your view and space while trying to relax on the beachfront, as this is done many times during the day by many photo shoots. Not to mention the 2-3 weddings that occur per day on the beach. The wedding ceremonies and receptions do not take place in a secluded area of the beach, they are held where all the other paying hotel guests are, among all the beach chairs. - The room was damp and musty the first day, the smell went away for a few days but came back for the last two days. The bed sheets felt damp all week and weren't extremely clean. The Air conditioning stopped working two days for the Platinum Riviera suites building. The shower stall can leak if you don't put a towel under the door. The two jet baths had yellow stains in them. The bathroom also showed signs of rust by the shower stall. A 5 star hotel would not present these types of issues. - Mosquitos roam freely at night and you will either need to stay inside or use enough deet to not get any bites. Saw a few 2 inch long cockroaches on the last day, one was even in the room on the sofa (RIP Jorge). ------------------------------------- Overall we had a great time, booked a few fun excursions.

We were in a fairly large wedding group and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It's hard to believe by some of the previous reviews that we were at the same resort at the same time. We had no issues with mosquitoes - we swatted a few but didn't get \"eaten alive\". The wedding we attended included dinner and dance on the beach - there were no insects bothering us although some used bug spray as a precaution. With respect to safety, I have two things to say. One day, we accidentally left our safe open which had a roll of American bills, a roll of pesos, not to mention passports, iphone and wallets. When we got back to our room and noticed it, we checked immediately and everything was there just as we had left it. Another day, in the wee hours of the morning when my husband got up to use the bathroom our door had been left open (we think not latched properly the night before). We were not robbed and no mosquitoes made there way in to our room either... I went into the water at the beach almost every day in approximately the same area - some days I could feel rocks, the next day in the same area I could not - I think the sand shifting around under surf must have something to do with it - but they were no big deal and I enjoyed swimming at the beach very much. The one negative thing about the beach is that they had the chairs lined up right tightly to each other - when we tried to arrange them in a semicircle to give us a bit more space, security came over and told us we had to move our chairs back and \"off the federal land\". That was unusual and a bit puzzling but we lived with it. The next few days we sat in a different area and it was no problem. We found the food and service at all the restaurants and bars very good. Sometimes the bartenders had a hard time keeping up with the crowd but we're patient and try not to get our shorts in a knot while on vacation. If you don't like the rowdiness of the activity pool, there are lots of quiet areas to retreat to.

In my mind 5 star hotels are, for example,: The Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs, or The Mandarin Oriental in Bermuda. If you are expecting or are used to 5 star service and food, you have to pay the price and stay somewhere else. I travel with 5 other people ages 18-45 from April 24-May . We all stayed at the platinum suites. The lobby bar there is excellent and so are the premium drinks: Absolute Vodka, Johny Walker Scotch, Jack Daniels Whiskey, Grand Marinier, Don Julio Taquilla = well worth the upgrade. The pool and cabanas by the Platinum lobby is just great too. The food = 7/10. Not bad at all. Yes the buffet lacked variety in terms that it was the same stuff every day but had enough choices that you can have something different. The restaurants were hit and miss but the Tapas (with flamenco dancing show) the Japanese sushi (not hibachi) were great. If you stay more than 7 days, yes, it can get old, but in 7 days I ate well. Yes you do have to make reservations but for 7 straight nights, as a group of 6 ppl, we always had a restaurant to go to. Its not Ruth's Cris but it its also not Ruby Tuesday. The beach = 6/10. The sand is perfect, plenty of chairs and not very crowded. Volleyball and beach soccer were fun. Unfortunatley once you get in the water there quite a few rocks and a bunch of seaweed, not the best experience. What's worse is that if you like to actually swim, you're out of luck. You can walk all they way to the water bouy that section off the beach, it is just not deep enough! The service = 6/10. It really is hit or miss. The Platinum lobby concierges and bartenders were just great! Always smiling, always helpful and want to talk with you. The drink girls/women on the beach were very friendly too. The check-in staff was great. The people at the spa or the equipment rental guys on the beach were just nasty. You felt like you owed them something for just talking to them, or they were expecting a big tip upfront. Example: I ask for a catamaran rental. Response 1: we are booked today. Response 2: its too windy, Response 3: its not windy enough. Made reservations for next day, and on the next day they say \"we don't know what you are talking about\". The spa: my g/f got a manicure and 20 minutes later the nails started to peel...what kind of spa is that? Overall experience: It was a great vacation. If you are not expecting 5 star service, that you will be fine. Yes, the staff and the beach have some drawbacks but for the $ it is a pretty good value. I would def. recommend an upgrade to the platinum suites for the drinks and being so close to the beach. One last thing. BRING LOTS OF BUG SPRAY!

We have been to several other AIs\u2026but this was our first stay at a Princess Resort. Let\u2019s start from day one. After check in, our room was a pretty far walk away from the lobby, but do-able. When we walked in our room, it was like getting punched in the face with a wall of cigarette smell combined with must. We know it is a humid location, but this was ridiculous. We decided to open the window to let it air out while we called the front desk. First they insisted all rooms were non-smoking, even though there were two ash trays in the room. Then, instead of just switching us to a different room, they told us someone would come out to the room, but 7 days later, no one ever showed up. We ended up just keeping the windows open when ever we were in the room. They had a screen, which was nice, except our room was swarming with mosquitoes! I think they left the front door open while they were cleaning. Needless to say, I was covered in bites and had to go to town to but cortisone cream to help the itch. I would have gone to the staff doctor on the grounds except I would have had to pay $200+ just to get some cream, and they did not have any in the sundries shop in the hotel. The room design was pretty nice; very contemporary. We had a room with the swim up pool which we thought would be great. It is a cool idea, except although it looks like you can swim under the bridges, it was not connected to the main pool or any bars. Every time you wanted a drink or wanted to be where most the people were hanging out, you had to get out of the pool and hop into another one. So if you just want to hang out by your room, and you\u2019re not going to be thirsty at all, it would be good. The hotel grounds were pretty clean; there was constant maintenance going on, which is understandable at such a big place. However, they were doing some kind of work in the room next to us, so we woke up most days to the sound of furniture moving and who knows what else around 7am. Next, when we are in such a beautiful, tropical place, we like to sit outside to eat our meals\u2026however, at our first meal we quickly realized that eating outside was not an option. Even though there is a patio with tables and chairs outside the buffets, you are not allowed to eat outside. In fact, you can\u2019t even take a piece of fruit out of the buffet! I was stopped at the door when I wanted to bring a banana outside after I ate my breakfast. I had to hand over the banana to staff! It would have been nice to be able to have a snack while laying poolside, but that definitely does not happen at the Princess. By the middle of our stay, we did find a soft serve ice cream machine by the main pool, except it was out of ice cream. The next day, we got there earlier, and the cones were very stale. We are pretty social people, and we like to have fun. At other resorts we have been to, the staff always seems super friendly and went out of their way to make sure everyone was having a good time. At the Princess, most the staff didn\u2019t even say hello to us, or even crack a smile. We did meet 2 bartenders, Ceasar and Eduardo, in the hotel lobby bar, who actually seemed like they were happy to be there. They had a competition between each other of who could make us the best margarita! The wait staff in the buffet restaurants were miserable. Some other reviews commented about the shows being good because they are free. Well free is not an excuse to be lame. The outside, \u201cpre-shows\u201d were good, but they have a very nice theater upstairs (inside of course) that they could really do some nice shows in if they tried a little harder. At all the other resorts we\u2019ve stayed in, we always went to the nightly entertainment, however we were bored to death at the first show we saw, so we never went back. The food was just okay. It was really salty. We went to a couple of the a la carte restaurants, but it was hard to get a reservation between 6:30 and 8:30, and you could only book within 48 hours. Being on vacation, we found it annoying to have to go talk to the reservations people every other day, and you cannot just call and make a reservation. The drinks were okay if you made sure they put in the brand of liquor you want. It would have been nice to have some alcohol in the rooms, as we have seen at many other AIs. Would have also been nice to have a map, restaurant menus and times, spa services, etc. in the room, as there are with most hotels. We did like the location. We were close enough to Playa del Carmen, and the hotel does provide a shuttle downtown, if you sign up. We really enjoyed shopping and eating in Playa. If we had never been to any other AIs, we wouldn\u2019t be so critical I guess. It wasn\u2019t one huge thing that was bad, just a lot of little complaints.

Our stay was so good that I wasn't going to bother with a review, but reading a couple of the bad reviews since returning I have no choice. Is it just me, or does anyone else notice that all the bad reviews seem to come from people who travel all over the world, all the time, and they all need to mention that they are big tippers. Why would you tip so much if you are not getting good service? Hmmmm? Anyway, venting over, now let me give you the truth.........stayed for 10 days. Check in was a breeze, guess we didn't get the wicked Dulce mentioned in another review. Strange, I must have got the one great guy. However, he did send us to the wrong side of the resort. He directed us to the shuttle cart, which deposited us about half way up the resort. Searched for our room for about 5 minutes, looked at the map he gave us and knew we were on the wrong side. So freak out? No, we caught the same shuttle on his way back, explained the problem, and we all laughed like hell as he drove like a mad man to get us over to our suite. Have a drink and chill amigo. Had a swim up suite, and I would take it over a Platinum or Laguna anyday. Nothing like swinging your legs out of bed, pulling on your trunks and taking seven steps into the pool every morning. Oh yeah, the pool does close at 6PM as mentioned in another review. If that's a problem for you maybe choose another resort....oh yeah.......they pretty much all do. See, I have traveled to other places. Sorry, couldn't resist. They must have just put up the sign after the other guy left cause I saw it. Our room was cleaned every day. Not at exactly the same time. Usually between 11 and 3. Who cares? The fridge guy came every day, gave me what I wanted. Did I tip big? No. Dollar for the fridge guy, two for the maid. And oh yeah, she mopped every day. The food was good, not great, it never is at AI's. The booze was good stuff, better than the Barcelo (which we loved BTW) last year. They do have a policy of booking dinner reservations only two days in advance. Not my favorite thing, but that's how they choose to do it so deal with it. We had no problem getting reservations 5-6 nights out of 10 for 6:30 - 7:30 PM. The entertainment was very plentiful. Live band in the lounge every night. A show in the plaza every night, and a 9:30 show in the theatre. This isn't Vegas, it's fun entertainment. Your also not paying $150 per person for each show. Go and enjoy. Listen, this is a great resort. Great rooms, top shelf booze, decent food, 8 pools, and 11 restaurents. Beautiful grounds, and the service from the staff in all areas is simply outstanding. Never been around better staff. You will have a great vacation at this resort but it will be what you make it. Go to have a good time and you will. About the theft?

The extra cost was well worth it! Having a pool exclusive to these suites was the very best part. It was much more intimate and kept all the yahoos out! We're not fuddy duddy's by any stretch, we're in our late 30's, but we wanted to have some relaxation time, and to not have to worry about drunken idiots at the pool ruining our fun...Collie, the bartender, was awesome and Vanessa, our pool concierge were both amazing. We had heard about the thefts and were very wary about coming here, but we did what we could to ensure we weren't robbed. We carried our cash, credit cards, and camera with us at all times; left our suitcases open, and only stored our silver, and travel info in our safe. We did what a Boston couple suggested (who were robbed) and rubbed suntan oil on the buttons so that our fingerprints wouldn't be visible. We never had any issues. We did tip our room service attendants generously ($10/day) and in return our bed was made up beautifully every single day with flowers etc. We tipped our room service $5/delivery also. We discovered while there that the room attendants only make $5/day for cleaning 14 rooms...it seemed worth it to us to give generously given that bit of information. We had wonderful service whereever we went, but we will say that the Barcelo staff were much friendlier. We would go back to the Laguna Suites, but probably not to any other suite on the resort as it seemed very busy and the pools and beach were packed daily. We enjoyed the exclusivity of the Laguna Suites. As for the food...it is what it is. My husband enjoyed the variety. I'm a bit pickier, but we both ate well and neither of us was ill. We didn't come for the food, we came for the sunshine! The Coco Bongo is a must see! We booked through the Party Hopper and it was well worth it. We also went to Rio Secreto and Xel-Ha to swim with the dolphins. Our taxi driver Pelligrino was amazing and we even had him for a day to drive us to the shopping hot spots in Cancun! We can totally recommend his services and hope that someone uses him, since he was wonderful! Tell him the Canadians sent you!

The first time exceeded all expectations and our second time was every bit as good. Don't be fooled by all the whining, sniveling reviews. This is perfect money for the value! For the reviews who say they got \"robbed\" of all their money out of their rooms must of been too stupid to operate the supplied safes for people to use. I took lots of cash and important documents such as passports in the safe and never had an issue. We even left money on the dresser and was never touched by housekeeping. The food was very good and very ample with numerous choices. My wife is the fussiest eater in the world and both times never had an issue finding her things to eat, and trust me that's not easy, she turns up her nose at five star dining. For those who do not like buffets, there are 9 a la carte restaurants to choose from and 24 hour room service. If you order room service, it will take a little longer to get than at a hotel. We ordered room service and arrived within 30 minutes and always hot. Pretty good considering the size of the resort. As for cleanliness, you couldn't swing a cat by the tail without hitting 10 people cleaning something. Everything is immaculate and they even power polish the cart paths. The staff was always friendly and very helpful unlike other reviews who say they were \"rude\". This is one of the main reason we chose to go back the second time because of the friendly and courteous service they provide. I just can't figure out what people expect when they travel!!! If you couldn't be pleased by this place then you were never meant to travel.

Let me just say that we've traveled everywhere from Israel to Beijing, England to Tibet, so we have seen some amazing places! Some were spectacular, others you were just thankful for 24 hour electricity. When rating a hotel or resort, you have to keep in mind where you are. Mexico is a developing country. With that being said, we loved this resort. We had upgraded to one of the 96 Platinum Suites for this 6 day vacation. It got us some extras like: 1. A reserved area on the beach 2. A beach concierge and all the towel our hearts desired 3. A butler/waiter who would take your drink orders on the beach and deliver the drinks to you sea side, 4. A buffet restaurant that was available for breakfast and lunch that was only available to the Platinum Suite guests. 5. A bar in the Platinum Suite lounge that served top shelf liquor 6. A private pool 7. A free half hour massage for both myself and my husband 8. Free room service 9. One free beach-side dinner at the Thai Beach Club restaurant. (You would normally have to pay for this restaurant.) The room was BEAUTIFUL and CLEAN. Our view was incredible! It looked right out over the ocean which was something that we hadn't requested, and many of the Platinum suites didn't get an ocean view at all. From what I could tell, this room had the best view out of them all. If your curious the room number was # 5120. I would definitely request it again! (See the pictures I'm posting!) The staff was courteous and polite. The grounds were so well manicured, the beach was clean, the bartenders were great. The entertainment was superb! One night we had fire jugglers, another night we had acrobats, and another we had jazz singers. They also offer some shows like madonna impersonators, etc...but we didn't go to any of those. The food in the buffets was pretty good. Some of it was not as hot as I would have liked, but it was still delicious and the variety was outstanding. They have several other restaurants that are included but you have to make reservations a day or two in advance. The Japanese Restaurant was our favorite, but you HAVE to get the one of the grill tables. The show is great! The food was delish! The Swiss restaurant is not so hot. They serve fondue, and you are dipping everything in more of a cheese sauce than an actual fondue cheese. We wouldn't recommend it. The spa was nice. We upgraded from our free half hour massage to an hour long massage and just paid the difference. If you want to go para sailing or snorkeling or jet skiing, go down to the beach and talk to SeaPro. They have a building located down near the shore and they have great package deals that are better than what your travel company can offer by 20-40 dollars! They provide all the transportation from the shore to the boat for snorkeling and para sailing. TONS OF FUN! One day we took a taxi to Playa and shopped on the main tourist strip called 5th Ave. The hotel takes your name, room # and taxi number down and signs you in and out for security. It made me feel safer. Shopping in Playa was a bit more expensive than I would have expected but we still were able to negotiate prices down by 40-50%. You can find some lovely, clean restaurants right off the beach in Playa to eat at. I felt safe and had a blast. There's even a Starbucks so I was able to add to my mug collection from around the world! Over all, we had a blast!

If we did we would go there. However, what we experienced at this hotel was terrible. I have been on many vacations, this by far was the most disappointing. I have never written a review but I feel like I have to with this resort. I can ingnore a few things however, there were so many dissapointments I can't ignore them all. My next letter is to Princess Corporate. It was my 40th birthday and my husband, and friends booked the \"villa Laguna\" for 10 days. Because of my friends and the private villa pool we had a very good time, but I have a lot of negative feelings I never had before about a vacation. It may have ruined me for Mexico all together. A friend went 3 years ago and said it was the best place she ever stayed. I told her what happened to us and she couldn't believe it. All I can think of is they are having financial issues. I am giving a list of good and bad, because it wasn't all bad. Good: 1. The grounds are BEAUTIFUL 2. The grounds are well maintained and clean 3. The bartenders at the villa private pool were excellent, (you can only swim at this pool if you book a villa so beware). 4. The villa rooms are gorgeous 6. The pools were beautiful 7. The Mexican Restaurant was OK. 8. The Thai \"PAY\" restaurant was good, not included in all inclusive. Bad 1. The food was AWEFUL, (not a picky eater) 5 out of 10 people with us were sick, and many other guests. It\u2019s a 50/50 chance you will to. Bring amodium AD. I had actually had food poisoning after the Italian Restaurant. The buffet was decent however my stomach is still churning since my last supper there on 4/25. On top of the food poisoning I got my second night there. 2. Staff was non-caring and rude. They would say hello when you walked by but that is about it. Get used to hearing \"no lady\"\u2026they say it for EVERYTHING YOU ASK FOR, even ice for the room, and we tipped like crazy. Only our villa pool bartenders went above and beyond and trust me we tipped them well. 3. Carry your money with you. A couple next door to us got robbed, EVERYTHING. They arrived Sat and were there until Monday with no issues. They booked an excursion through the hotel and were robbed that day\u2026you figure it out, inside job??? When they approached management they got very little help until they raised a fuss. At a meeting they were told to go to Playa to fill out a report with the police and they would check in with them after. They never checked with them. I know you are thinking this could happen anywhere, your right but it is how management treated them that was disgusting. And, the woman got sick on the food to top it off. 4. Check in, my friend was told she couldn\u2019t check in until 3 however my other friend was brought right to her room. The couple who couldn't check in had to bring their own bags to my friends room who did check in. 5. The friend that couldn't check in was not allowed to make any restaurant reservations until she was checked in (it was 2 PM). 6. Room service took 2 hours at night 7. Spa staff VERY rude, this was the manager. Not helpful at all. If you stay at the villas don\u2019t lose your ticket for the complimentary services or you don't get one, make sure you bring it with you or they charge you. 8. Complimentary Spa for villa Laguna's. Facial=Face Wash, Manicure=they wash your hands, Pedicure=they wash your feet, message was nice 30 minn. Not at all what is advertised or what my friend was given 3 years ago. She had full manicure, pedicure, and facial\u2026cost cutting!! 9. Restaurants, we were told we couldn't sit together in a group of 10 when we arrived they were empty and still would not seat us together. Management was rude and not helpful. 10. Maid Service, until we tipped our room was dirty, especially the floors. After tipping still not great. They spilled coffee and left it on the floor. Room service trays were left out from breakfast over night until we called in the AM when some animal dragged them down our stairs overnight. Same thing in another friends room but thier sat there for 3 days. The iguana's made a MESS and everyday the room service people walked right by it. 11. Entertainment SUCKED, same singer every night in the outside bar. 12. My friends were bitten by some bug every night in their rooms. They had little red bites all over their bodies, we think it was spiders. 13. The fitness center was TERRIBLE...and dirty.

While those were good, the Grand Riviera Princess had better service (always with a smile), better food (always at least warm) and better beach. I must say though the beach water was a nasty brown until the day we left. This was caused from the torrential rains from the week before and the mangroves leaching into the beach water. Not alot you can do about that without disrupting the environment. I get the the feeling that alot of the negative reviews come from people that are of the opinion that they can be as rude as they want because they paid good money for this vacation and everyone should still kiss their [--]and smile while doing it. Lighten up people and remember you still are in a third world country. It takes a smile to get a smile. Really the only negative I can come up with is the use of polished marble on the floors of the bedrooms. We had a swim up room so naturally water gets tracked into the room. (probably the maids fault, ha!) It made for a very slippery condition, but guess what we did. Put a towel down at the entrance to the room and wipe your feet or have one of the workers wipe your feet for you. The pools were simply outstanding and the place was emaculate.

No you can't move 2 tables together, no you can't reserve a restaurant more than 2 days in advance, no you can't have any ice for your room, no you can't have any extra beers for your room...etc. it was very frustrating. It was never any big problem, just a lot of little ones that made us feel less than welcome. Add to that the fact that our private concierge was only at her station 1/2 the time, and that there were only 2 or 3 people that we could communicate, and we were frustrated. Plus, while we were there, another couple in a suite near us had ALL of their money, camera...etc. stolen out of a locked suit case. It was just a lot of little things that made this place very unfriendly in my opinion. And it wasn't like we didn't tip, we were giving out dollars like they were pennies, it didn't matter. And the food, Oh was it bad. The buffet was ok, as far as buffet's go. But the restaurants... bad. The Tapas... just bad, small portions, overcooked, poorly matched sides. The Steakhouse, NO STEAK ON THE MENU. You could order an off the menu rib eye, but it was thin, and super fatty, and well done (no matter what you ordered). The italian restaurant, oh man, lasagna was spaghettio's sauce I swear it was, and the veal? a think wafer of hard, dry meat.

There are SO many lounge chairs and we never had a problem finding one, even in the middle of the afternoon. Also had great pools, and so many of them. They were never too crowded which was nice. The swim up bars were a nice feature! This resort has great food, even for someone like me who is very picky, i could always find something eat.

We where supposed to leave right when the Swine Flu hit. Worrying about our health we called Funjet and United and was able to rebook for a later date with no extra charge. HOWEVER, GRP refused to waive ANY fees for cancelling unless we rebooked with them. According to our Funjet rep, this was one of the only hotels doing this. All others where happy to waive the cancellation fee with NO strings attached. Once we arrived we where informed that there was only 20 mintues left of lunch service at the buffet, to which we had to rush and try and find. We are not picky eaters and it was hard to find anything that looked appealing. Afrer eating we finally found our room (lots of buildings very confusing) and it was NOT what we reserved. This was one thing I was afraid of travelling with 2 small children. We where given a king size bed with 1 rollaway. We booked 2 queen beds. I called down to the front desk right away. The employee informed me that he had upgraded me for free and basically made me feel like I should be grateful even though it was not what I reserved. I informed him that this was not going to work for 4 people. His solution, was to move my location or make up the couch for free (gee thanks). Since we where basically in the middle of things we chose to stay and tough it out. After getting off the phone with the front desk our phone rang and we received an EMERGENCY call from home. It turns out that we where left an EMERGENCY MESSAGE at the desk while we where eating. Had we NOT been in our room at that time we WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE MESSAGE UNTIL 9PM. The phone message system was not working in our room and we received a hand written note slipped under our door. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND INCONSIDERATE! OK parts. The food was just so/so. The buffet, get used to them. They are all that is available at lunch other than the beach and it is the SAME thing every day. The sit down service at night was ok. We didn't have a hard time getting a time if you are willing to eat early. We would rank the evening resturants in order, Tapinaki/Japenese, Fondue, Mexican and Italian. These are the only ones we ate at so I can't speak for the others. Other than the Fondue place all the desert are the same no matter which one you eat at. Now on to the nice parts. The pool areas are wonderful. There are both salt and fresh water pools. You really can't tell the difference. The beach is clean with plenty of chairs, is very clean and beautiful. There are rocks right when you walk in the water but we where able to find spots with flat rocks or hardly any. The grounds are beautiful with and well maintained. The pool staff at the party pool in entertaining but it's pretty much the same every day. The dance club we did not attend in late evening but tried to get our kids to go during the children's time. It is a cute little dance party for them. The kids club seemed to keep the kids busy but we did not send our kids. They do have local merchants come in one night for souvenior shopping. This worked out great for us since we didn't want to venture out with 2 small kids. The parts that need improvement. FOOD really needs to be upgraded. Most guest don't leave the resort and are stuck with their food. There is no snack bar either which would be nice. ROOMS could be a LOT cleaner. We saw the same piece of paper under our bed the entire time and it was never picked up. The sheets had a red stain on them and didn't even fit the bed right. Room safe was already broken when we arrived so we never used it. There was sand all over the floor when we arrived which tells me they didn't bother to sweep and hand prints on the mirror that stayed the whole trip. The balcony had a great view but that was about it. The chairs on the balcony where covered in bird poop so we weren't even able to sit in them. The hallways are open air which is nice but there was bird poop all over some of the hallway walls. Instead of cleaning them, we saw them painting right over the poop!

Just rude! Staff not very friendly most of the time (I don't think they treat there staff very well). I've been to Mexico before and each and every staff member said Hola to you with a smile each and every time. It sure makes a difference when the staff seem to enjoy being there just as much as you do! Okay, I saved the best for last! On our last day, we had money stolen from our LOCKED safe. We went and filed a report with the hotel security and they said that they would get back to us in 24-48hrs. Yah right! I still haven't heard back from them and we probably won't either! I think they have a very serious problem here at this resort. We heard that every staff member is searched everyday before they leave home from work. But you know who is searching them is the security guards and the security guards are the ones who have the sticky fingers! They came up to our room to do there \"investigation\" (after we filed our report) and they had a little pad of paper with all the safe codes on them to open up the safe. They also have little USB device to record who was in our room and at what times. The security guards are the ones who are the culprits...the maids and maintnence are too obvious. We talked to 2 other families that stayed at the resort at the same time we did and they said that they had items and money stolen from them too. One family had there money stolen from their locked safe on the second day of there stay. They were there for a week and still didn't receive a report on the 7th day. Something tells me that they probably won't. If you already booked this hotel and didn't get any cancellation insurance....I highly recommend that you hide your money elsewhere in the room or bring Tyraps with you to lock everything in your suitcase. If you are just deciding on whether or not you want to stay here....PLEASE rethink your decision! Believe what you are reading on trip advisor! For those who are going to stay here....Good Luck! I hope the same thing doesn't happen to you.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Penticton, BC", "Title": "\u201cLong review.. but worth the read.

FLIGHT: We travelled Westjet. It was a direct flight from Kelowna to Cancun. I have nothing but good things to say about them. Comfy seats, as spacious as a plane can be, satellite television and movies for purchase on the screen on your seat, the staff was very humorous\u2026 which was a nice touch after a long flight! Best Day travel picked us up. HUGE air conditioned shuttle that dropped \u00bd the bus off at one stop and us at the Princess. Quick trip, nice reps, safe and comfortable. TIP: Westjet does not serve meals on the flight. You can purchase a sandwich though so do that or bring your own snacks/lunch/dinner RESORT CHECK IN: Comfortable. We waited about 5 minutes in the line and the check in girl was great! Offered champagne and my husband a cold cloth. Everything was very explanatory and I was provided a map, keys and directions to where to catch the trolley to our rooms. The baggage came on its own about 15 minutes after we got to the room. Everything was there. Nothing lost. FOOD: The 1st night we had to eat at the buffet because obviously you had to pre-book the ala carte. It was great! So many choices. Sure, there are lots of deep fried food, but there was just as many salads, fruit choices, cold meats and cheeses. There was many hot meats, rice, pasta, sauces, etc. I found many things to satisfy my appetite. After the 1st night, we ate at an ala carte every night (unless we were off the resort at dinner time) In order of my favorite to my least favorite for ala cartes (based on food temperature & taste, menu choices, service, wait time and experience) #1 \u2013 MISO \u2013 we ate at the oriental cooking table. FABULOUS! The experience was what pushed it over the top for us. We had a great time and loved the show that the chef put on for us. The meals were piping hot (freshly made for us in front of us) and the appies were great. My husband tipped the chef $15 for his amazing performance. Our server got a $5 tip from us just for refilling our drinks and taking our plates without us even noticing (we were engrossed in the cooking show) #2- Seafood \u2013 we had fabulous service, fabulous appies, soup/salad and what a beautiful d\u00e9cor. Absolutely no wait time for anything. The server took a picture for us. It was just a nice experience to try a bunch of seafood. I had the brisque soup - FABULOUS. I also had the Caesar salad appy \u2013 AWESOME! Then hubby and I shared the seafood platter. It was good. Not fabulous but good. I enjoyed the scallops and jumbo shrimp. Our server was very polite and attentive. #3 \u2013 Fondue \u2013 Another great experience. THE BEST service of the week. Our server was extremely attentive to us. Always offering us more buns, more drinks, water and even more food to dip with! WOW. The appies were very good. See pictures. We also loved our cheese fondue. Not too sure about all of the dips that went with everything but I enjoyed the experience. The chocolate fondue was to die for. The only thing that ruined our experience was the obnoxious Americans that came in and demanded to rearrange the well-thought-out table designs. They started slamming stuff around, making the servers and hostess run around for them and then put 10 people to a small round table that was meant for 6 to dine at. After that they continued to yell at each other at the table that they had smooshed too many people around and yelled over to their kids who were sitting at the next table with their own \u201coutdoor voices\u201d conversations going on. These people were SO LOUD that we failed to enjoy our own conversations because we couldn\u2019t hear each other talk. I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of there. This is nothing to do with the food or restaurant though. #4 \u2013 Mexican \u2013 GREAT service, no wait\u2026 beautiful d\u00e9cor and the staff was dressed right up. The only things that made this one to the bottom of my list was that the food at the appy buffet had very obviously been sitting for 3-4 hours so I could barely bite into any of it, and the menu selection wasn\u2019t all that big. We enjoyed our piping hot menu food. My husband loved the red snapper and I really enjoyed my chicken fajitas. If you have to have fresh food, I suggest you get an early seating. We could only get a 9:20 seating so by this time, the food at the appy buffet had been sitting for quite some time. #5 \u2013 Mama Mia \u2013 Italian \u2013 It was my least favorite. The service was blah\u2026 bland. Our server didn\u2019t smile and didn\u2019t appear to be very happy about being there. We tried joking with him and I am ALWAYS very polite to all servers. He wasn\u2019t buying it. None of us (there were 4 of us this time) enjoyed our main meals. I ordered cannelloni with meat. Blech! Hubby had risotto which was good but a very small portion for a big guy. Friends ordered pizza and 4 cheese potato pasta and didn\u2019t enjoy either although I didn\u2019t try their meals so I am just giving you second hand info. We tipped accordingly for our service. I tipped him $1. As for breakfast I did room service breakfast for the 1st half of the trip and then started going to the breakfast buffet closest to the platinum ( La Tortuga) for the 2nd half. I was beyond ecstatic about the thought of eating breakfast with my husband every morning in my pjs, in which I didn\u2019t have to make, brought to my room with all of the fixings! So I did that for 3 days but there was only 1 time out of ordering room service (at various times) about 12 times, that came warm. Every morning our breakfast was ice cold. I can understand why\u2026 you order it, they say it takes 30 minutes\u2026 sometimes it took 45 minutes, sometimes 20 minutes but every time the service was PHENOMINAL. The servers came in with a large tray, set up place settings for us, laid our food out and one guy even poured my coffee. They got a tip every time. So for me, it was about experience which was a nice treat. But after breakfast # 3, I opted for a warmer breakfast at the buffet. Haha. Lunch was always room service (clubhouse and fries) or it was a plate of food from the Platinum Snack bar\u2026 or we were off the resort so we ate lunch wherever we were. See my gripe section for my gripe about the outdoor grill. ACOMMODATION: WOW! Amazing! We felt like a king and queen. Beautiful king sized bed, beautiful MASSIVE room with marble everywhere. The Air conditioner worked fine. The bathroom was big and spacious. Big closet (probably 6 hangers) NO dresser though. So plan on keeping your stuff in your suitcase. The rooms were very damp. We are in a humid environment. Bedtime seemed to be the worse. I would crawl into bed and into a very moist set of sheets. During the day and in the mornings, it wasn\u2019t moist anymore. It seemed to be just at night. Okay\u2026 controversial topic\u2026 don\u2019t use the safes. I went into this resort with an open mind about the safes and I know full well the extent of complaints, which ones are valid, which ones aren\u2019t, consistencies and inconsistencies in stories etc. We walked in and the first thing I did was checked the safe. The sticker was peeled back. See picture. So husband and I said nope\u2026 and went to plan B. 3 sets of locks. 1) wire fed security travelling fanny pack with double locks. We put our passports and money in here. Then we put that in our laptop bag and double locked that. Then we put the laptop bag in one of our suitcases and locked that. My husband carried around a little key chain everywhere we went with all of the keys. It took 5 extra minutes out of our day but we kept safe and nothing went missing. My friend, however, was not as fortunate. I warned her of the \u201cclaims\u201d but she put her wad of US in the safe. We went to the beach. She came back and 1 $100 US bill was missing. She knew EXACTLY how much she had in denominations before going. My friend does not drink and she is an RCMP member. Because there was now nothing she could do, she took a day to think about it and then headed down to the concierge. She very calmly explained what happened and the concierge didn\u2019t try to deny it. She had my friend fill out a report and then explained that in the fine print it says that they are not responsible for theft from room safes or rooms and that by signing here X _____ we understand that there are safety deposit boxes available to us. Hmm\u2026 Guess I should read that fine print. After our \u201cmoney wad\u201d was down in size quite a bit, we opted for using our wallets to hold the cash and just locked up our passports and laptop in our bags. I have theories on who is doing these thefts. It isn\u2019t the maids people so forget it. It also isn\u2019t the \u201cother guests\u201d Take a look around you when you go next time. What do you see on every corner of the resort, around every single bend with a walkie talkie next to their face? Hmmm. The shower didn\u2019t leak. It had a black lip built into the shower so yes, we put a towel down as we would at home but it didn\u2019t leak. The toilet leaked a bit but who cares? SERIOUSLY! It isn\u2019t enough to worry about! The Jacuzzi tub was a nice touch with lots of room to lay your stuff out. Fridge was stocked daily with exactly what I asked for: pepsi and water. The 1st day it came with orange pop, club soda, beer, diet pepsi, pepsi, 7-up and water. My coffee packs (see tips) came in handy and whitener, sugar, stirsticks were replenished daily. My room was spotless after the maid had been in. She was in and out by noon EVERY single day. I left her $3 a day on my pillow and our fridge guy, $2 in the fridge every day. My maid even lined up our shoes in a row and laid out all of my toiletries on a towel next to the Jacuzzi tub. What service!! The room also consists of a couch with a coffee table and a table and chairs for 2 (we ate breakfast there every morning) Our bathroom had a shaving kit, Kleenex, makeup wipes, bug repellent wipes, shower cap, mouthwash, gel/shampoo, toothpaste and toothbrush. GROUNDS: IMACCULATE! I don\u2019t think you will read too many reviews that would disagree with this statement. Ashtrays were cleared every 10 minutes, no garbage anywhere, the growth was gorgeous. Lots of wildlife to see in the resort. It is amazing that this resort is so new, yet the trees are big and there is shade everywhere. The beach was clean too. It stunk next to the mangrove on the way to the beach but the government owns that strip of \u201cright of way\u201d and oh well\u2026 plug your noise for 30 seconds. My room didn\u2019t stink and neither did the ocean. The ocean had some rocks but they were big and you could see them. Where I come from, we swim in lakes and rivers where there are lots of rocks. The ocean was blue/green every day. The water was warm and there were LOTS of chairs in the sun but if you wanted a chair with a palapa, you had to play the towel game. If you can\u2019t beat them (which you can\u2019t do so don\u2019t even try) then join them\u2026 or stay off the ocean/pool and sulk in your room. Loved the Mayan statues scattered through the resort. Great photo ops. SERVICE: Last year I went to the DR. The service was AWFUL. I will never go back. MEXICO: a completely different ball game. HAPPY happy happy people! I said \u201cOla\u201d to everyone that looked at me. I said \u201cBuenos Dias\u201d to everyone I saw on my morning stroll. I asked people \u201ccomo esta?\u201d before I proceeded to ask them for anything. I was polite and non-demanding. I waited my turn and in turn, I had golden service. The only person that we encountered that didn\u2019t set the tone was the server at Mama Mia, but I just think he honestly didn\u2019t have any personality. I tipped and I was respectful and I thoroughly enjoyed my new friends. BIG shout out to Miguel, Fernando, Gracella, Ricardo, and the other bartenders that made our stay just that much more better than it already was! AMMENITIES: We didn\u2019t really utilize the amenities as much as we could have but we were busy people! I did have a massage at the spa. TRANQUIL! The spa is fabulous! I enjoyed the entertainment in the courtyard at night. It was also great. The singing was really good. Every night we would head over after dinner to meet up with our friends in the courtyard. We would have a mayan coffee and drinks, talk about our day and take in the singing. People got up to dance and it was great to see. We used the gift shop and found the prices very reasonable on gift items. We seemed to spend more time at the main lobby bar. The service was good but it did tend to get quite busy. We found the piano bar at the last night. Go here for a nice quiet get away. It has very nice furniture, a bartender and dimmed lighting. We enjoyed the vendor\u2019s market on Thursday night but we all found that the vendors wouldn\u2019t come down in price on many things. We got better deals in Playa. We used the free shuttle service to head into platinum at noon one day. No problem getting a ticket. Some people walked up to Best Day Travel (who handed out the tickets) the same morning 10 minutes before the bus left and had no problem. We went to the disco one night. Good music. The bar was very busy so hubby just got 3-4 drinks at a time. We didn\u2019t see a server come by once. They probably didn\u2019t offer that service there. One thing I did notice was that people were not allowed to request music. The DJ booth is completely glassed off on the sides. I witnessed one lady slamming her hand and swinging her purse at the DJ to try to get his attention. He wouldn\u2019t have any part of it. He waived her away. There is no smoking in the disco so it was dancefloor packed, and outside the doors packed with people smoking. Tons of tables and chairs to sit at inside. PLATINUM: Is it worth it to upgrade? YES!!! 24 hour room service alone makes it worth it. 2 \u2013 30 minute massages were GREAT. 2 jacuzzi tubs, easy reservations for ala cartes. I walked up and booked 2-3 at a time with no wait\u2026 at any time of the day of night. The snack bar was another HUGE feature to me. Because I had my bambinos at home, having internet in your room was another huge perk. I skyped with my kids the whole time I was gone. Not having to use towel cards was a huge plus. We just walked up and grabbed clean towels from our concierge whenever we wanted. Trolley pick up and drop off at platinum. BONUS! Nightly turn down service was great because the sheets weren\u2019t so wet and neither were the pillows. Private check in was painless too. Rooms were GREAT. I stayed in room 5015 on the main floor. I was right across from the ocean but had bushes in between my balcony and the ocean so I couldn\u2019t see it. But that was okay because I was a 1 minute walk from the beach. You get a little reservation ticket when you get to your room that gives you your complimentary dinner at the Thai Beach Restaurant. I personally cancelled ours but other people used theirs and said it was fabulous. You also get 5 bottles of liquor in your room when you get there. This came in handy for night caps! SURROUNDING AREAS: We went on a tour with Edventours. Highly recommend them. They incorporated \u201cThe Jungle Place\u201d into our tour. We went to Tulum and Akumel too that day. We also rented a jeep in Cozumel through Marguerita at ISIS and took the ferry over and spent the day in Cozumel. Favorite part of my trip!!! Loved visiting all of the little beach bars and exploring the blow holes and searching for shells. We also spent a day in Playa Del Carmen on 5th Avenue then did a \u201cpeeps meet\u201d at Carboncitos which was AWESOME! You need to go just to try Russell\u2019s pumpkin seed salsa. YUMMM. Also, a big hit for us in Cozumel was \u201cWet Wendy\u2019s\u201d go there! Absolutely a MUST STOP! GRIPES (Mostly to do with my fellow guests): -There is NOWHERE for you to eat lunch if you are lounging at the pool or ocean. If you have a wet bathing suit you obviously can\u2019t go into the buffets. I ended up walking into the platinum snack bar and grabbing a couple plates of snacks to tie us over until dinner (or going back to our room early for room service) I had heard about this \u201coutdoor grill\u201d so I started out in search of this so called grill. I came across a maid. I asked her. \u201cThere is no outdoor grill\u201d was her response. Hmm.. ok. So I walked up to a bartender and asked him. He told me over by the pool bar beside the fondue on the sunset side. So I went over and searched. Couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. Nobody by the pool had a hot dog or burger on their lap and I couldn\u2019t smell it. So I stopped a security guard. He said it was down on the beach. Haha. This was getting quite humorous. After a quick trek to the beach and coming up empty handed, I gave up and raided the platinum snack bar, not without feeling sorry for everyone staying in the junior suites who didn\u2019t have access to the snack bar. -Do everyone a favor. Don\u2019t let your patio Jacuzzi tub fill to the top and then let your 3 kids jump into it, flooding your patio. It is NOT cool for the person on the 1st floor who has clothes drying on the balcony, or is enjoying a nice sun soak on the loungers. RUDE RUDE RUDE! Especially after the 3rd time security has to knock on your door to tell you not to do it!!! -People that complain about the slamming of doors: It is people with their balcony door open, and they open their front door to talk to someone then go to close it. The back draft takes the door right out of your hand it slams it extremely loud. So stop complaining about the slamming of doors. Nobody is doing it on purpose! -People that complain that this resort is not for kids: I just read a review about not recommending families with babies to go to this resort. Give me a BREAK. Do you think there is a better place in Mexico to take your baby too? Get over it! This is not Chucky Cheese and yes, you will have to eat at the buffets with the rest of the screaming kids and their parents because the ala cartes aren\u2019t McDonalds. The ala cartes are for the adults that came to relax and not listen to a bunch of screaming hungry kids that are up way past their bedtimes. What the heck are you doing taking a small baby to a resort like this anyway? I saw soooo many babies/newborns, toddlers. They were all screaming, whining, hot and suffering from sun stroke, crying and the parents looked irritated. You did it to yourself! Once the kids are 4, they can attend the kids club and have much more fun in the pools, ocean and the entertainment. Do every other guest at the resort a favor and leave children under 4 at home! Or go to Disneyland. This is coming from a mother of two that loves children. -French Canadians give other Canadians a bad name. RUDE RUDE ignorant people! WOW! Ever hear of a line-up? Here\u2019s a clue: wait your TURN! Don\u2019t be arrogant. The Mexican people work HARD to give you fantastic service! Also, some of the Americans could tone it down a notch. They aren\u2019t as bad as the Quebec residences though. I was very proud to be (Western) Canadian and got a huge smile and big sigh of relief from the staff when we told them where we were from. TIPS: Bring those coffee filter packs from home that you can buy at the store. Their coffee wasn\u2019t very good in the room and we were SO happy that we had read that tip and did it. Also, hit up the platinum lobby for coffeemate packages or ask for cream/milk at room service. It comes in a glass with saran wrap on top. I kept it in my room and had fresh cream in my coffee in the mornings. Also, if you order room service, keep the condiments. They come in handy later. I kept mayo packets and little jars of jam in my room and had them to add to my other meals that I brought from the snack bar. If you book the MISO you have to request a cooking table. Make sure to clarify Pool area is slippery. BE CAREFUL Bugs \u2013 if you get a room on the main floor, you will see bugs. If you don\u2019t care, then don\u2019t read any further. If you are scared of bugs or have some sort of \u201cprincess problem\u201d with them, then ask for a 2nd or 3rd floor room. You are staying in THEIR jungle. I had a few mosquito bites in the mornings. No biggie. We saw beetles, spiders and lots of geckos in and around our room. Get over it! You are staying in the jungle. LOL Ala Cartes: If you get a later time than you would like (9:40) try to go early. Just go in and say you have a later seating but would love to get in on a cancelation. EVERY single night we saw \u00bd of the tables not show up for their reservation. This is part of the reason I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the reservation system. My friends did it 3 or 4 times and it worked. Or\u2026 go about 20 minutes early, we did that a few times and we got right in. There is a bank machine in the lobby for those that always seem to be asking this question. I had no problem using it. It wrote everything in Spanish and English. When you 1st get to the platinum lobby, do 2 things. 1) book your ala cartes as far as you can in advance. 2) ask for your massage coupons and then go back to your room and book them right away. If you decide NOT to use your massages, don\u2019t just \u201cnot show up\u201d or you will be charged! You need to give them 6 hours warning. This is fair and probably another big reason why it\u2019s hard to get in and booked up so far in advance. Go online or Canadian Tire or Walmart and invest in a Bubba Keg. None of the bartenders care. They welcome it. It is environmentally friendly and you don\u2019t need to wait in line as many times for refills. Everything stays very cold. If you plan on going to the pool or ocean for the day (with or without your Bubba Keg) TAKE STRAWS with you. They will NOT give out straws at the pool bars or beach bars. So for me, I would ask for extra straws at the platinum concierge or at the lobby bar and stick them in my beach bag for later. They do not give out straws at the pool and beach because of litter. I brought 2 of my own towels and think it\u2019s a good idea. I used them for reserving my chairs at 7am. This way people won\u2019t move my stuff because it\u2019s not a hotel towel. I also took my Sudoku book and placed it on top of my beach towel from home. When it was time to leave, I used them to wrap sea shells up in. That being said, I got my seat (usually the last ones) and then went for breakfast and came RIGHT back to me seats. I personally think that after 12pm, it\u2019s fair game to move people\u2019s towels. Bring hair conditioner. There isn\u2019t any supplied in the little bottles in your bathroom. Also, if you are looking for Kleenex, it\u2019s in a little box with the rest of the bathroom items. If you go to the lobby bar, ask the bartender for peanuts. They will give you a little plastic cup with a lid of nuts. They are AWESOME!!! I craved them the whole time I was there. They were seasoned with lime juice. YUMMM! I even took some home for my plane ride. Take ziplock bags. We used them for everything and anything. Taking food from the buffet to make sandwiches, fruit etc. To store seashells, sand. To make sure your toiletries don\u2019t explode on your way home, to put little treasures in and use at the beach. Biggest tip that I can give you: SMILE\u2026 be happy. Have a good time. Don\u2019t stress on the little things like rocks, wait times and walking. You are on holidays. Where do you have to be? Take in your surroundings and treat that staff exactly how you want them to treat you. It will go further than you know. Chill out. There you have it. If you have any questions, PLEASE feel free to message me. I have tons of info. Here is a link to a place where you can find everything I have collected except for the new stuff I obtained last week during my stay. https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B5kpH0of919ONDllYjcxMGUtY2Y2Ni00YmIxLWExNjQtMDgyY2M0NGY3MGQx&hl=en Don\u2019t forget\u2026 people that complain, complain for one of 3 reasons. 1.Bad luck--something stolen, got sick, etc. 2. Didn't do their homework. 3. Are the type of people that are never satisfied We will ABSOLUTELY return to the Princess. Already planning my next trip!

My boyfriend and I were there from Mar 27-Apr 3, This was our 1st all inclusive vacation however we have done quite a bit of travelling and have high standards. Like a lot of people we were worried after reading the negative reviews but we figured we would make the best of it. This resort is breathtaking! The grounds are immaculate, the rooms are gorgeous, the service incredible. It is true that this resort is huge but we really enjoyed that. Always a place to go to be alone or join a party and it kept people spread out when it was at max capacity like during our stay. I think during off season it might feel a little empty but for us it was perfect. Food/Drinks: We ate at the Buffets for breakfast and lunch everyday (except a couple days we had burgers and hot dogs from the beach grill) and two dinners. There is a variety of food to suit anyone, even my boyfriend who is a picky eater. It ranges from regular fast food types to gourmet meals. And the food seemed to get more elaborate every day. Breakfast was our favourite as you can literally eat anything you could ever think of eating for breakfast. There are salad bars, cold meats and cheese bar, bread bar...and the bread is to die for. And the desserts were fantastic! There is so much food to choose from that we realized by the time we sat down to eat, our food had turned luke warm. My suggestion is to have your meals in a lot of courses so that you are eating it hot off the buffet. We ate at almost all the a la carte restaurants for dinner and were extremely pleased. Highly recommend Miso, the Japanese restaurant. There are 3 different sections in the restaurant which you will be told when you reserve. We ate at the Teppanyaki one, where you sit around the chef;s grill and he puts on a little show. Also at Le Fleur, we had the Beef Fillet and you could literally cut it with a fork. The Grill we weren't too crazy about, only because they didn't have a steak menu, the menu was more fit for a 5 * as it served duck and rabbit, a little too extravagant for our tastes but we ordered the chicken which was very good. The red table wine is not very good, it's extremely sweet, but the white is pretty good. We love wine but after drinking all day we were ok with just having water with dinners. Tapas restaurant was another great experience, here they have spanish dancers putting on a show. The drinks have plenty of alcohol in them and there are lots to choose from. We got really hooked on Tequila shots while we were there. Drank a lot of Mango Tangos and Margaritas too! The Corona on tap was wonderful! Things to Do: Near the buffets there is an outdoor lounge area where they have singers at night. There are 2 shows every night, one put on by different people they bring into the resort, such as the fire dancers(amazing) and the acrobats(also amazing). The entertainment staff also put on a show every night in the theatre and they are really good, you should definitely go as there is a different one each night. The entertainment staff are all fantastic! They are always around, mostly on the beach and at the party pool. They have games for everyone. Drinking games, bingo, water aerobics (we did that a could times and it's a lot of fun), stretching, tequila volleyball, archery, spanish lanquage class around the pool. Tons of stuff. There is a \"crazy game\" every day at the party pool and it's different every day, we were apart of it one day. The staff really need support though, it's harder for them when no one cheers or anything. So if you are at the party pool you should be ready to have fun. We went to Coco Bongo twice which was FABULOUS! I can't stress it enough. Don't ask questions just go. You can get tickets at the party pool, its $45 US and includes transportation, cover, drinks all nght and VIP seating area. The show is crazy! And it's not just for young people, we had people of all ages in our group and everyone had a great time. It's worth it! Our suggestion is to go on a week night rather than a weekend, we went both and the Friday night was too crowded. There are entertainment staff who work at the kids club. They look after a group of kids all day, taking them to all kinds of activities, eating lunch with them and everything in between. It's great for parents I would assume. We took a taxi to Playa Del Carmen one day, it's $13 US each way and they don't rip you off. The resort records who is going in and out all the time and they make sure you are not over priced. Playa Del Carmen was very nice, not what we expected however. We were thinking it was more of a market but it was a lot more luxurious than we imagined. It felt a bit like being in California, but it was still great. Lot's of shopping and great deals on alcohol. We brought back some specialty bottles of Tequila. Now that we are back home, we realize that nothing beats Tequila in Mexico, it's just not the same here. Beach/Pools: The beach is just astounding. The water is gorgeous, not cold at all. We always got up early on the days we were going to the beach to get chairs, then we would go eat breakfast and go back to the chairs. There are people who reserve chairs and never show up for the entire day, which is unfortunate. The first day we were on the beach at 6am and there were still plenty of chairs up until 9am. Keep in mind though, after 3pm people that have been there since the early morning (which is pretty much everyone) are heading back to their rooms...so if you wait until then you are sure to get chairs. There are massage tables set up on the beach, we got massages one afternoon. It's $50.00 US per person for 1 hour which is really good compared to where we live, plus you are on the beach listening to the waves. And it's shaded so it's also a nice way to get out of the sun for a bit. There is a bar at the beach as a server going around taking orders. For the pools, we only really stayed at the party pool. We switched between the beach one day and the pool the next. We tried one of many quiet pools one morning but ended up moving to the party pool. It was more exciting for us and we saved our relaxing time for laying on the beach. You will get a towel card when you arrive which you turn in for a towel, afterwards you can keep exchanging towels and then the last day when you turn your towels in you get your card back. The towel hut is located on the main walk way, between the party pool and the beach. It's also a public bathroom (by the way the public bathrooms are incredible). Room: We booked a regular Junior Suite but when we got to our room we realized we were upgraded to one with a jacuzzi. And the jacuzzi is much bigger than it looks in the pictures. Our room was fantastic. I didn't stop being excited about it the whole trip. Wonderful balcony with a giant palm tree in front, gorgeous decor, huge bathroom. I felt like a queen staying in this room, I can't imagine what the platinum rooms or laguna villas would feel like. The first few days of our stay we tipped the bar fridge guy and the maid but found that the service wasn't exactly on par. We started out with a lot of towels and for the first two days hung up our towels in order to keep the same ones, but the maid took them without replacing them, leaving us with less towels. By the third ot fourth day she had replaced all the towels. We never received any towel art or anything special but the week we were there it was at max capacity so I think she ust didn't have time, especially since they spend a good hour cleaning 1 room. And the rooms are immaculate. This is the only negative thing I can possibly think of, even though we really weren't too concerned. For the rumors of money being stolen, we didn't have a problem and can't imagine any concierge staff being rude at all. We took precaution anyway and didn't use the safe, we kept our valuables in our suitcases and kept them locked during the day. Grounds: The grounds are kept perfectly clean at all times, there are people cleaning all hours of the day and night. And everyone working at this resort are so friendly, everyone says \"Hola\" when you walk by. I was feeling badly that people were working so much and so hard but it seems they are so happy to be working there. They pay attention to every little detail and you don't realize how much work it takes to upkeep such a large resort. You will see a lot of iguanas and geicos, very cool. We didn't see the crocodile though so I am not sure where he is living. Everything is marble and glass and just gorgeous. This place is definitely 5 star, maybe more, and we could have not asked for a better vacation. We were very lucky with +30 every day and no rain. We are absolutely recommending this resort to everyone! You will not be sorry! We will most definitely be going back as soon as we can.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cold Lake, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort!!!\u201d", "Author": "tkaminski", "ReviewID": "UR61237567", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Riviera from Apr.1 - 8, 2010.

We were two couples travelling with 3 children ages 17mths, 20mths and 5.5yrs and looking for reviews from people with small kids. Here's how we would break it down: The Good - Weather was wonderful. Resort grounds were beautiful & immaculate. Staff was friendly & loved the kids. No issues with security. Kiddie pools were warmer and separate from main pools - they were fresh water versus salt water in the main pools++. Also good was the self-serve ice cream at the main pool, awesome for adults and kids!! Beach was gorgeous (directly in front of lifeguard stand), no watershoes required. All the kids loved the beach, water was warm this time of year.Stroll on beach after dinner was nice too but a bit windy so sand in the babies eyes was tough (ah mother nature). The resort was long from lobby to beach but we didn't really mind the walking - we had a stroller for the child not yet walking though - that really helped. Shuttle was good but infrequent. The Bad - Our kids needed to eat dinner by 5pm or 6pm so we couldn't go to any of the a la cartes which opened at 7pm. Eating at the buffet twice a day for 7 days sucked after awhile. You really tire of the luke warm food; selection was just OK. We had to put towels on chairs by kiddie pool by 6am to make sure we got a spot but we were up early with kids anyway. I just noticed a comment about the \"beach grill\" - we missed that entirely because one of our big complaints was that you couldn't eat on the beach. We snuck food out of the buffet a few times so we weren't stuck inside; reprimanded several times for it though. Didn't see anyone on the beach with food - strange. As two separate families, we tried everything to get rooms next to each other (big tips, frequent visits to the front desk, upgrading rooms) and were assured we would be together...when our friends arrived the day after us they were assigned to a room on the total opposite side of the resort! Very frustrating. If mosquitos like you they'll find you at this resort - my baby & I got several bites as soon as we arrived but the room provided insect wipes which I put on wrists, knees, ankles and necks before walking to dinner - it seemed to help. The Ugly - Our room had a terrible damp/musty smell when we arrived that made me nauseous - it went away by day 4. Maintenance came by to caulk the shower on day 1 - fumes were horrendous for 24hrs. We tipped and service was still terrible the whole time we were there (slow) perhaps not enough staff for the # of people. We waited an hour for bottled water from room service when our baby was ill (they said we could go buy it ourselves at the gift shop) - our friends didn't get water refilled in their mini bar for 2 days! They forget about you if you ever put 'Do Not Disturb\" on your door (when kids were napping). Not nearly enough service staff around the pools or on the beach offering to get you drinks, etc...big letdown there for a 5star. All in all it was nice to get away but with all the choices available I think we could have gone somewhere that better suited our needs. It's completely different travelling with little ones so I hope this helps some of you parents.

Please leave tips if possible, they do appreciate it. This resort is big with lots of walking but we didn't mind. This is our 4th time in Riviera Maya and not our last, we love Mexico, it's a beautiful country with lots of culture. Prior to our arrival, we sent e-mails requesting a room on the 3rd floor facing the inside of the complex. Well, we ended up with a room on the 2nd floor facing the outside. We got told immediately at the check-in that the resort was over crowded and chances of changing weren't good. Anyway we when off to our room 7117 got there and the first thing when we opened the door was this awful smell just hit us. This was not normal smell! We opened the patio door and sprayed air freshner. We decided to go for a walk hoping when we get back it'd be better. When we got back an hour later the room door was open with two maintenance guys working on the air condition - we did not call them so we figured right away that somebody has already refused this room and we were stuck with it. Anyway, it did not get any better, the bed sheets and pillows has an awfull smell too. We had to put our t-shirts as pillow shams. We complained to the WestJet rep. twice and were told we would be contacted the same day - nobody contacted us... we even offered to pay for a room change... The beach was beautiful but no place to sit. People get up at 5:00 in the morning to put towels, bottles, rocks, etc... whatever they can find to reserve their chairs. Our first day we ended up at the kiddie pool, the only place with chairs. Getting to the bar was a task as the young (and under age) drinkers crowed the bars. They had to beef-up security as there was alot of young people drinking - some people got escorted to their room.... The food was typical buffet style that you see at resort, not super, not bad...

The food was good. If you like oriental/sushi i recommend the Miso restaurant. It was delicious. The buffet was ok...some of the food was salty and greasy, but i always found something that i could enjoy. Before booking this resort i read some reviews about theft from the safes. We had no problem, nor did we hear of any issues with theft! We left all of our personal items in the safe daily and had no issue at all. The beach was beautiful!

Don`t stay on ground level rooms unless they have the pool access to keep out mosquitoes. But the big problem was THEFT. THEFT FROM THE SAFE!!! The safe in our friends' room was accessed by someone, presumably staff, since they would have access, and $400 was stolen. The passports were safe and they didn't take all of the money. Everything looked untouched. It was as if they were thinking the money wouldn't be noticed missing. The security accessed the safe using the USB port beneath it to check the records. Nothing was ever solved. We ended up talking to the people in line behind us at the airport who had also stayed at the Princess and had a similar problem. He had 3 one hundred dollar bills in his wallet and 1 was stolen. Security again told him that he either left the safe open at some point or forgot how much money he had. When he suggested involving the police security was quick to say they would find out what had happened...they never did. In both cases security, not maids, had stopped by the rooms in the morning to see if they wanted their room cleaned. That seemed strange. They had never stopped at the rooms of other people we were with. (None of us had problems either.) I`m not sure if security is involved, but someone with safe access is stealing a lot of money from tourists! Now that we read TRIP ADVISOR we see SAFE THEFT is a common theme at this resort. Check for yourself. We wished we would have checked more carefully before we chose the Princess. We loved our trip and had so much fun. The resort was amazing!!

I definitely wouldn't return under those circumstances, but might consider it (at the right price) if I was traveling with kids. The breakdown: PROS - They're always cleaning something. - Platinum rooms are very nice. Our was extremely close to the beach and included two whirlpool tubs, one in the room and one on the balcony. - While the main beach can be very crowded, if you're crafty, you'll head over to the Platinum-only beach in front of the Thai Beach Club on the property. As far as we could tell, they don't check for Platinum bracelets during the week. That said, it's also a hike to the nearest bar for drinks, but the quiet beach makes it worth it. When they do check on the weekends, the bar at that facility is open (waiter service is spotty), and non-Platinums can sometimes talk their way onto a lounger for $10. - Room service is free and fast (if not delicious) in Platinum rooms, and you can order up to four beers at a time. CONS - The food leaves a LOT to be desired. - The front desk personnel were quite rude when a member of our party called to point out an apparent discrepancy between what she'd booked and what she got (while we later suspected it was the travel agent's fault, the hotel could have handled her complaint more professionally). - No hair conditioner, even in the Platinum rooms. - Nearly zero activity at any of the pool bars (one of my favorite things) regardless of time of day. - This isn't the all-inclusive for you if you're a big wine drinker. Don't even try it. - There are lots of situations where you really do get treated like a second-class citizen if you're not Platinum (again with the travel agent screwup, some of us were and some of us weren't). Unless you have young kids and need to go ultra-budget, I probably wouldn't bother staying here if not Platinum. - There was a very odd lack of activity at night (even though the resort was full and we stayed during Canadian spring break). On a couple nights when we didn't go into the city, we were looking for some fun things to do (involving a bar) as early as 11pm, and most everything seemed completely dead, especially near the beach.

We stayed at the Grand Riviera Princess from Mar. 23rd through Mar. 29th. There is no dought the complex is very large. 15 minute walk times Ive read about in other reviews are exagerated though, unless your in your 80's or older. They do have regular shuttles to take people from one end to the other, but you may have to wait for up to 15 mins. I would estimate walk times from lobby to beach to be around 10 mins.We didn't mind the walking. The Jr. Deluxe Suites are all mid way between lobby and beach so get one of those to keep walk times lower. Plus you get access to two more restaraunts with Jr. deluxe. Its worth it. Beach was very nice. Yes the towel game is played, but early bird gets the worm. Were all spending alot of money to go on vacation and some will go out of there way to get what they want while others swear its not fair. Niether is life, get used to it or get up earlier. I would estimate that on Fri-Sun you better have a chair picked by 7:00 am. I do agree its rude to save chairs and then leave them sit until 3:00 in the afternoon. Witnessed that, and it did anoy me. Pools were all nice, you could always find a spot. Maybe not always near where the entertainment was but still close by. Bars were plentyfull and you rarely had to wait more than a few minutes. They do have semi premium liquor. Smirnoff, and absolut, but if you don't specify you'll get some off brand Ive never heard of. Service was always good and friendly. We do tip some and the service was the same either way. I only saw our housekeeper once the whole time but everthing was cleaned up daily. Only used the mini bar for water and two beers the whole time but it was also stocked daily. We did tip the houskeeper. Food. After a trip last year that would have been rated good was spoiled due to really bad food we were skeptical going into this. Reviews were mostly good but mixed. I can say we really didn't have a bad meal the whole time. We did eat at one of the ala Cartes every night and they were all good. The last night was the Japanese where you sit at the grill and it was fun. Heres a hint, Mama Mias fills up fast. You can make reservations for two nights at a time. But if you make a reservation at 11:00 am for that night and also reserve for your next night, you can come back after 3:00 PM and reserve for the third night. This way you can get earlier seating times. Now other than the first night where we had to take what was left(we arrived around noon) for a seating time at 9:40 Pm, we ate between 6:00pm and 7:15 pm the rest of the time. They do have outdoor seating at most of the restaraunts and it is, in my opinion, more comfortable than being indoors. Just request it when you arrive. Another trick we learned by accident. We like to sit down and have a drink before dinner. Most restaraunts had sit down bars in the lobby. We would arrive over a half hour before our reservations and stated we would like to sit at the bar and we knew we were early. We also told them we were not in a hurry. Every single time, we were seated within minutes. I actually would have liked to sit for a bit but worried what would happen if we declined. Tapas was good and the show was fun to watch. We happened to get a front row table for the show, made it fun. There is a piano bar just off Tapas that never seemed to have more than a few people in it. Great place to go to get away in the eve. Food quality was good at all the restaraunts but portions are not overly large. We never left hungry though. Service was very good everywhere. My wife worked in the restaraunt business as a server for 15 plus years working at some high end places and she was satisfied. We ate at all but the seafood and the grill. Buffets, were, buffets. We only ate lunch and breakfast at them. Everthing was fresh and well prepared. Omlets and eggs to order. Also at lunch they had grouper and salmon depending on the day. You could spice up you fish and they would cook it for you. Another hint. We arrived the first day before the buffets were open. The only food was at 5th avenue the sports bar. Burgers and fries made to order. Not bad but we were stuck inside. If you go to the closest pool to the beach they have an outdoor grill where they cook burgers and hot dogs all day. They put the cooked ones in warming pans but will cook to order if asked. When we arrived and were told the sports bar was the only open restaraunt I asked about the outdoor grill and the lady didn't know what I was talking about. So we ate inside the sports bar when we could have been outdoors in the sun. Oh well. Man thats a small gripe isn't it? And that is really all we had to gripe about.

We had a deluxe junior suite in the building close to Las Tortugas and a swim up room in the next building. Two rooms; two very different experiences so I understand why people can give different reviews even though they are at the resort at the same time. The positives: We left a carry on bag on the bench where you wait for the shuttle and it was immediately turned in by an employee. The employee forever has our gratitude as it contained necessities. The rooms were both gorgeous and the beds were comfortable. A swim up room is fantastic and I would highly recommend upgrading to one. The pool is cleaned continuously and even the stairs to the patio were scrubbed daily. The grounds are beautiful and meticulously kept. There are butterflies, iguanas, geckos, and beautiful birds. The beach is well kept and the sand is mostly soft; we did not use water shoes. We went in the ocean in front of the lifeguard stand as others had suggested and this area was all sand/no seaweed or rocks. It is a perfect beach for children as the water is shallow for a great distance. Each part of the resort is different and one can choose from the activity pool where the animation team keeps things hopping; to the smaller pools where young children/babies can be found; to the swim up channels where people tend to congregate in smaller groups playing catch/chatting/swimming; to the new swim up room area where one could hear a pin drop and people seemed to be reading books and relaxing; and to the swim up bars which were, as would be expected, louder and filled with party people. There are lots of chairs around the pools and no difficulty finding either sun or shade. There are lots of choices for food venues. Las Tortugas was my favourite for breakfast with lots of options and the food appeared fresher and more frequently replenished. Breakfast service was also excellent. The beach BBQ (hamburgers/hot dogs) was great for lunch as they had take out boxes so that one didn\u2019t have to eat indoors and could stay in wet swimsuits while eating. For dinner, the Riviera buffet had better service and appeared better organized than the Sunset buffet. However, if you want to eat early, the Sunset buffet opens first. We only at one al a carte restaurant, Le Fleur, and both service and food was fantastic. The Sport\u2019s Bar has tortilla chips/salsa/cheese as well as hamburgers/hot dogs and is a great place to spend some time. There is a doctor available in the Medical Centre in the Sunset main building. Dr. Pineda was on rotation when we needed medical attention for a sick child and the service provided was excellent. The prescription is written on a form to take to the concierge. The concierge telephones the pharmacy and the prescription is delivered to the hotel room. (The only down side is that cash must be used for payment for the doctor and the prescription and one cannot use a credit card or charge to the room.) The negatives: The deluxe junior suite had many (more than 30) mosquitoes on our arrival and we had to request that the room be sprayed. We went to the second room while this was done but the smell even three hours later was overwhelming. By six hours later it had dispersed and we could again use the room. However, the location of the room was a problem for reasons I cannot figure out. The mosquito problem continued our whole trip and there were no other rooms available. At night, despite killing multiple mosquitoes and applying insect repellant before bed, we woke up with many bites. Except for sleeping, we spent most of our time in the swim up room where there were no mosquitoes. Two rooms; two totally different experiences. People saving chairs at the beach. They start saving them by 5:00 a.m. and have no intention of using them until much later in the day. There were some arguments over people moving other peoples\u2019 belongings. Skyservice going bankrupt. At all of the other resorts, passengers had personal contact with a representative and most had also been contacted by their travel agent. We got a postcard under our door late the night before we were leaving on which the representative at our resort had scrawled that our flight had been cancelled, our pick up time had changed, and a different flight was available. We found a different representative the following morning and managed to get information that we were actually booked on the flight, where we were to be picked up, etc. I have yet to contact our travel agency and find out why they did not contact us and let us know what was happening. The hotel had no rooms available so we could not get late check out. We had to wait twelve hours with no hotel room (which was not the hotel\u2019s fault), but, when one of the children lay down on a couch in the lounge area to rest, security came and told us she must sit up. Despite explaining that she was ill and there was no room available where we could take her to rest, we were told that it was the rule and she must sit up. This was our only negative interaction and was an unfortunate ending to an otherwise perfect interaction with all staff at the hotel. On a final note, I would not hesitate to stay at this resort again if I could be guaranteed a room that does not have a mosquito problem.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mason, OH", "Title": "\u201cToo much walking\u201d", "Author": "oconnorryanpatrick", "ReviewID": "UR60270883", "Content": "Their was way too much walking from the main enterance to the guest suites.

Perhaps this hotel has taken note and they have greatly improved. For the price, this was a fantastic hotel. We went as a group of 12 - three different families with 5 teenagers. SERVICE - excellent: We booked as a group to ensure 5 swim-up rooms together as our teenagers were over 13 and needed their own room. When we arrived at the Grand Sunset side- they did not have 5 swim-up rooms close together so we were upgraded to the Grand Riveria Princess Platinum suites. They were going to upgrade us into the Villas but then realized we had minors and therefore we had to accept the platinum upgrade. We had ocean view rooms, our own private lounge with our own bar and food, 4 computers and free internet, private pool, free room service, jaccuzi on balcony, etc.... We also had our own excellent, extremely helpful concierge. I left my wallet on a cab and the concierge helped me get it back with all its contents including credit cards and cash within about 90 minutes. Also, our concierge helped us arrange ala cartes so we could all 12 dine together every night. No one in our party experienced any theft. All hotel staff were eager, helpful and happy (tip or no tip). Our sunwing representative was very pushy and got angry when my husband started talking to another excursion company (the only time the whole trip I felt uncomfortable). SIZE: huge resort. We stayed near the beach which was as far away from the main lobby and supper buffets as you could get ..... so we enjoyed the beautiful walk through the grounds or we caught the shuttle which came every 5 - 10 minutes. BEACH: some rocks in the ocean but they are avoidable when you look where you are walking. We borrowed the sailboats and boggie boards many times ---great fun. Had them longer than we were supposed to but we did not get charged extra. Too many chairs on the beach. You can walk for miles and miles either way down the beach and feel safe. On calm days, you could see many swimmers out swimming lengths in the ocean and the beach was perfect for joggers as long as yu went before it got too hot(good for the triathletes) - who needs a gym. GROUNDS: immaculate, beautiful FOOD: Ala carte restraunts were very good - our favorites were the International and Swiss. Buffets were good and room service was excellent. Cocktails were excellent - you name it, they made it. Specialty coffee (flaming with whipped cream) every night in the main square. A poolside barbecue of hot dogs and hamburgers everyday was a huge hit (excellent burgers). TEENAGERS: we felt safe letting them go off to the sports bar or the activity pool. The 4 teenage boys ate breakfast and lunch at the buffet, had snacks and ice cream all day long at our lounge, ordered room service in the afternoon and then ate again that night at the ala carte restraunts. SHOPPING: some shopping at the hotel but we loved 5th avenue, Playa del Carma. $13 for 4 passengers to get to Playa del Carma by cab as the free shuttle was too much of a pain. One night, they had a huge market in our square at the main lobby. EXCURSIONS: 6 of us we went on a private fishing tour and caught 8 fish - 5 of which were huge. This trip was arranged by our Sunwing rep. even though not one of their packages. We also went snorkling/diving at Cozumel which we arranged there - it was very reasonable. We loved Cozumel. The hotel was full and very busy (spring break) yet we always found a lounge chair, a table at the buffet, and never waited long for a drink. Even though we were a large, self-sufficient group, we met many, many very nice, interesting people from Canada and the U.S. - who enriched our holiday.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201cumm...\u201d", "Author": "junng", "ReviewID": "UR60140822", "Content": "bad food poor and lack of staff crappy weather [--] STOLE ME JEWELERY FROM MY SUITCASE", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel; wonderful people!\u201d", "Author": "mexicoamigosx2", "ReviewID": "UR60061375", "Content": "My husband and I stayed Mar. 20-27, and had a wonderful time.

We were in a junior deluxe suite and we were very pleased with it; the king size bed was very comfortable, and we had a view of the ocean with Cozumel in the distance. The walk to and from the beach or lobby was not that far, and it was a very enjoyable walk at any time of the day or evening - listening to the birds during the day, or walking along the lit pathways at night. The food was not the greatest, but definitely something to satisfy everyone. We enjoyed the dinner buffet better at the Riviera than at the Sunset, and the breakfast buffet seemed better at the Tortuga Restaurant. The flaming coffees in the evening were always good; even better if you asked for \"dos\" kahlua - then you'd get a double shot! We ate at 3 of the a la carte restaurants: the seafood, the Mexican and the Japanese; enjoying both the Mexican and the Japanese ones better than the seafood. The staff at the Princess are unbelievable, always friendly and very pleasant and seem to be very hard workers. The beach is very clean and no, you don't need water shoes at all! Yes, the lounges at the beach get saved very early, but those ones that are saved early are usually given up by around noon, so you can almost always get a spot on the beach, and if not at the beach, then there are always lounges available around the pools.

Check in:Fast and friendly.We got upgraded to Jr Deluxe suite for free.It had a jacuzzi and allowed us to eat at two other restaurants not offered to reg jr suites. Rooms:So clean and beautiful.Some riviewers commented on the hardness of the beds so if your used to a bed with 6 inches of mattress topper then yes you will find the beds a little hard.Bathrooms are very tidy,and our towels were always stocked and we always had plenty of water ,beer and pop in the fridge. Pools:There is a pool for everyone!The pools closer to the lobby are quiter,the pools in the middle we dubbed the party pool :) and then there were a few near the beach with a few kiddie pools as well.Also some of the rooms are swim up rooms. The beach:My husband and I walked both ways up and down the beach from this resort,and the beach at the princess was by far the nicest!It had little to no rocks and beautiful sandy beach.No problem getting a chair to sit on just don't show up at 2:00 in the afternoon and expect to have your pick. The Food:One word awesome!If you can't find something to eat at the buffet then there is something wrong with you!At breakfast they had...baccon,ham,sausages,pancakes,french toast,omelett station,hash browns,spanish omeletts,croissants,muffins,toast,cereal,yogurt,fresh fruit and much more.For lunch they had hamburgers,hotdogs,nuggets,fries,fajitas,quesadillas,fish,rice,steamed veggies,salad bar,rolls and lots of desserts etc,etc. For supper they had again salad bar,rolls,pork chops,salmon,rice,steamed veggies,different meat casserole type dishes,lots more to name and yummy desserts and ice cream. Night life:We didn't participate in too much of the night life went to three of the hotel shows.One was boaring different dance styles.The second was a fire juggling act pretty good,the third was a 70's 80's retro act pretty good,and the last was a cirque du soleil type show pretty good.The diso seemed popular....quit packed when we went by and the sport bar was too bright.When I think sports bar I think dim lighting? The a la carte restaurants:We only did two while we were there.The spanish and the itallian one.The spanish had dancing and singing but the apptizers were alittle to be disired.The main course was good.We had the chicken.And the itallian was very good.The bartenders at the bar were hillarious.Ask for a dirty frog...they were awesome! Drinks:They were hit or miss...by this I mean if you got a mudslide for instense at the beach in the afternoon and then ordered it at the lobby bar that evening it might not be the same as the one you got at the beach.Not terrible just not as good.Or vice versa.But trust me they were deffinetly loaded with liquor regardless of were you got them! Walk from the lobby to the beach:I read from some reviewers that if you don't like to walk then this is not the resort for you???Come on it's not that bad!Obviously these people are way out of shape and instead of spending their money on an all inclusive maybe they should be going to a weight loss spa!!!Yes it is about a 7 min walk from the lobby to the beach but the rooms are not in the lobby and your looking at everything going on,on the way there.Lots to take in especially going by the \"party pool\"LOL.If your expecting to walk right on the beach from your room then you'll have to upgrade to the platinum suites near the beach! The staff:The staff is very friendly and always smilling.Always around with water and coffee durring meals,seemed like they couldn't do enough.Front desk staff were very nice and seemed glad to help in any way. We had a great time at this resort there were no time share people there that we saw.We did an exursion to tulum(beautiful beach) and xel-ha.Awesome snorkeling.We also went to Playa del carmen twice and loved it!The taxi cost 13 US dollars in and 13 US dollars back for 4 of us.We ate at the swing bar.The club sandwhich was delicious!I have nothing bad to say about this resort so if your looking for a great all inclusive that's clean, friendly and safe with great food and a beautiful beach then book here.You will not be disappointed at all I guarantee it!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Brunswick", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort,Service excellent\u201d", "Author": "funinsunNewBrunswick", "ReviewID": "UR59977103", "Content": "Beautiful resort.

The grounds were beautiful, the pools were plentiful, and the food was good. It is mixed in with the Grand Sunset Princess resort so it is actually two resorts in one. There is a lot of walking, so if this isn't ideal for you then this isn't the place to stay. The resort has pretty much everything one can offer. It suits families, couples, and large groups. I was there for a wedding, which went absolutely perfect. There are 3 pool bars, 3 buffets, and a lot of a la cartes to choose from (all of which you can get from their web site). Now with that to say, the only downside that I found was the theft!! I travelled there with a group of about 66 people. At least 3 of our rooms had items stolen from them. Now with the amount of rooms on this resort I found this to be fairly high. I had a very nice pair of earrings go missing from my room that I had forgotten to lock in the safe. Some neighbours of ours that travelled with us had money, jewelry, and cell phones stolen from their room....some of which was in the safe at the time it went missing. I found that at any given time there was at least 3 to 4 different staff members going in and out of our room in a day, as well, we never had the same cleaning staff. This makes it almost impossible to track who steals things, and thus is the reason why we never bothered to report it. I believe our neighbours filed a report; however, they were told not much could be done. So, if you are staying here, leave your expensive things at home and take your wallets with you when you leave the room!", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "USABostondan", "ReviewID": "UR59810389", "Content": "My wife and I went March 22-27 and had a great time. The hotel was probably 80% full. We booked the Platinum package and it was worth the upgrade. With platinum you get unlimited towels, private lounge, beach area, pool and consierge....very nice. It's great to book everything from this lounge rather than walking to the main lobby. AS other people have stated it is a 10 min walk to main lobby from the beach. The resort is huge and you will do alot of walking which is what I wanted if I was going to be eating all day. There is a shuttle that runs around the perimeter about every 10 minutes if you are too tired. The grounds are beautiful and very clean. I have never been to Mexico and was a little nervous with the language, theft issues and other issues I read in the negative reviews. I decided to go anyway because after researching I found good and bad with each resort. Briefly here is the good, bad and just plain quirks on the trip. Quirks... Bring hair conditioner if you have dry hair...it is not available in Mexico. Plenty of shampoo though. No cream just hot milk for coffee. No Tissues other than a pocket pack in the bathroom that you would never know unless you open all the silver boxes by the sink. We booked the Anniversary package which gave us dried fruit, towel art heart, and 4 bottles of hard liquor. When I went to the lounge to ask for champagne they were puzzeld. 'Didn't you get the liquor?' Yes, but I would much rather have a bottle of champagne rather than downing a fifth of Vodka and Tequila. They were totally puzzled by this and told me champagne would be extra and the cheapest bottle was $68 US. Forget it! Good... Most of this is good. The grounds, rooms, and bathrooms were immaculate. The staff always had a smile and went above and beyond to try to please us. WE wanted early check in, anniversary package, ocean view, and king bed. I knew from reviews that the bed could be an issue. We wound up putting the beds together as no king was available and even though that wasn't the best for our anniversary, it worked out ok. They delivered on the other requests. The attitude of the staff made up for any shortcomings as they try very hard . Nothing will be perfect and you just have to go with the flow and relax. We did see several guests who were rude to the staff. If you smile and ask nicely you will receive the same back. One day the coffee station ran out and the girl asked us to wait 2 min so she could replenish. The woman in front of us said she would not wait and wanted to be served immediately as she was in a rush....after telling us moments before she had nothing to do! She berated the coffee girl who was working very hard . Unbelievable! The beach itself is nice and if you are in Platinum the waitress comes often...not so much on the main beach though. Bad.... the food is the same every night at the buffets and very bland. Even the alacarte restaurants. The presentation is beautiful, but we found the food to have no flavor. I've never had a steak that was tasteless, but we had that at the leFleur. Same with my wife's Veal. Momma Mia also same issue. I had rissoto avoiding the meats and that was very good. Thai beach and Miso were good. Buffets need to change up more and maybe have a theme ( ex italian) some nights. Hamburgers were prefrozen like you can buy at the supermarket and hotdogs were a weird meat. You need to book everything as early as you can. Restaurants and Massage book up quickly so do this on the first day. If you wait till mid week you may not be able to get your massage. The other thing that dissapointed was the lack of Mexican flavor in the entertainment. At Lefluer they asked if we wanted music at our table and I wanted something romantic for our anniversary. I was expecting Spanish guitar, but we got an accordiian player playing the Theme to the titanic. Hillarious but dissappointing. The lounge singers also sings American songs from the 70,80,90's. We heard Hotel California every night. The staff shows were a little cheasy. They lip sinc and show movie clips, but are great dancers and very enthusiastic. I would have oved more Mexican guitar. Beaches and pool chairs to fill up early. Most people went down by 8am to put a towel to reserve a chair. If you do this please just eat and come back. It is not ok to leave a towel at 8am and show up at 1 or 2pm. Overall we loved the beauty of the resort and the friendly hardworking staff. You need to go with the flow...if you are picky, then this is not the resort for you. If you don't like walking and are all about food, then this is not the resort for you. The things we cared about were nice beach, lots of drinks ferried our way, beautiful grounds/views, plenty of pools, cleanliness, and friendly staff.

Do NOT stay in this room!! My husband and I just got back from a 2 week stay at this resort. It is beautiful spacious and if it were not for the fact that I got a sinus infection from the moldy mildewy smell in the room and the concierge's reaction to my situation - seemed to not believe me even after I went to the doctor and she perscribed antibiotics. A doctor bill and medicine costs and still the manager said there was no other rooms available to move us. They did put a dehumidifier in our room which leaked water all over the floor. I had to put towels down to soak up the water. They sent a guy to try and figure out why it smelled so bad, he removed the pipe going into the air conditioner and showed my husband how it was dry and proceeded to pour 4 litres of water in it. It appeared that we were getting uncirculated air into our room or sewer exhaust. Whenever we saw Dennus the concierge after we asked to be moved, he would see us and quickly look away. I feel they could have handled this a lot differently. I did learn a lesson, when we were let in our room after the 3rd attempt to get the card to unlock the door the bellboy that let us in made a loud noise indicating that the room smelled, but never said anything so I presumed that that was the way the rooms were, I well never assume anything again, if a room smells musty when I walk in I well then walk out. They did make an attempt to fix the situation but when it could not be fixed they should have put us in a different room. I lost 4 days of our trip feeling so sick and not being able to rest in our room as it smelled so bad, I spent 2 nights on the couch cushions on the floor in front of the patio doors so I could breath fresh air (I was woke up every morning by the workers outside at 4 to 5 am.) We left the patio door open every night. Enough about that........just remember that room number 6103. If it were not for this problem I would say it is a 5 star plus. The resort is beautiful, the food good with lots of choices. The staff excellent...friendly, helpful and very hardworking. The a la carte restaurants were good, I do agree with the reviews that said some of the food was on the salty side. The drinks were good and the bar staff generally quick. The grounds were well manicured and very clean. The beach large and busy. The room was large and the maids cleaned it daily, we had lots of towel art, elephants, swans, dogs etc. The fridge was well stocked with beer water and soft drinks. Reserving the al a cartes was easy, JOHANNAH the girl who did the evening shift was happy helpful and always smiling. We ate at all the al a cartes without a problem getting into them. You can reserve for 2 nights so after reserving for the first 2 nights I just went back each night and made a reservation for the 2nd night. The steak at Le Fleur was fork tender, Miso was good (all 3), Tapas was good for the entertainment, flamingco dancers were great. We enjoyed going to the piano bar for a drink before dinner some nights. The piano player asks what you would like to hear. Mama Mia's had delious potato knocchi. Did not try the wine so can not comment on that. The entertainment was good, some of the shows in the theatre were fantastic. The history of Mexico through dance and music show was excellent. I enjoyed the fire dancers and the prehistoric show that they did in the open area in front of the bar between the 2 buffets. The fellow at the mexican market who painted pictures with spray can paints was interesting to watch and the art he did was amazing. We spent one afternoon at the swimup bar. Jorge was informative and pleasant to talk to. Alex made a good mojito. The resort is not a late night resort, it quieted down after the shows around 10:30-11 pm which meant that by 6 am people were milling around and going down to reserve cots on the beach. All in all this is a beautiful resort, would I go back again or recommend it.....probably but knowing to make sure the room is not musty smelling. We used the shuttle service to town, never had a problem getting on coming or going. WE used the collectivos going to Tulum and Coba and cenotes without a problem. We also got on the bus on 5th ave in playa and went to Tulum twice. Very inexpensive and quick. If you want to explore some of the attractions on your own it if fairly easy to do on the collectivos and buses.

We stayed in a Junior Suite which was very big and spacious. The room, bathroom and wardrobe were spotless when we arrived and continually kept clean by the maids throughout our stay. Our room backed onto the grounds at the back, with flowers, grass and hammocks as our view. Hardly anybody needed to walk past our room and this suited us fine. If you like to sit and people watch with views onto poolsides or the main walkway you might wish to request this when you book your holiday. The hotel is very big, and is actually two hotels, the Grand Riviera and the Grand Sunset, which mirror each other pretty much from both lobbys all the way down to the beach. Regardless of which you stay in, you have access to both buffets, both lobbys as it is all under the same resort on the same grounds. We found that having all the space between the lobbys and the beach worked for us, as we dont like to sit by the same old people round a small crowded pool each day. With this hotel, we could choose whether we wanted to sit by a busy or quiet area, whatever we fancied. We also enjoyed the fact that we could go for nice walks around the grounds, down to the beach or hrough the immaculate gardens searching for iguanas or even catching site of the small croc that showed up on the outskirts of the gardens (dont worry there was a small pond, hill and fence in the way!). The buffet food was interesting and nearly always something there to suit your tastes. We like trying new things and there was plenty to choose from. The only time we heard someone moan about the food was an American over the burgers and hotdogs. Unfortunately it is that Nation which those are provided for, and to be honest, if you have a day where you fancy a nice hotdog or burger, go for it as they are tasty. We found that the restaurents on the grounds were not much better than the buffet, and as you have to book in for these, we found it easier to just go to the buffet to experience the different food each night and also the entertainment in the square outside of the buffet restaurants. As for the beach, it was gorgeous, but we only took morning or late afternoon strolls as it was always heaving with people, 'reserving' several sunbeds with various items of clothing, yet we could go for an hour walk and still find these beds unoccupied. Certain greedy people. If you walked away from the front of our hotel either side, there were quieter more picturesque areas and if you dont mind laying on your towel you can always plonk there, however we were more than happy with the poolside as we had a little lizard friend who occasionally popped by to see us. I would fully reccommend this resort to anyone really as it suits all. If you are slightly older and after a really quiet holiday then maybe reconsider this resort, as although you can find quiet areas to spend your day, you still have to battle with the rude Americans and Canadians we came across when by the poolside bar, buffets and beach. However, if you revert to being rude and ignorant back you'll find your time there very enjoyable.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, service and time, shame about some of the guests\u201d", "Author": "TedleyHedley", "ReviewID": "UR59414452", "Content": "We recently spent 2 weeks staying in a junior suite at this hotel.

We were excited to see this resort after seeing pictures and reading reviews and were not disappointed. We booked and flew with Air Canada Vacations and were very happy with our flight and service, especially when we are used to flying with smaller charter services that cram you in like cattle. The resort is very beautiful, with a large marble lobby, lots of room to sit and relax by the lobby bar. We were in the Junior Suite and the room was very nice. The bathroom is very large, with two sinks and mirrors, the shower and toilet in separate cubicles. We missed having a tub for an evening soak but the upgraded rooms have them. We had no problems witht he servicing of the room, fridge was always stocked and no problems with the maid service, though some in our group had issues with getting bottled water for their fridge and the bride and groom requested on the wedding day that their rooms be cleaned by early afternoon as we would be getting ready in them, and it was not done. We did have one significant issue with our room, and that was the door. On our second day we went on a 12 hour excursion and returned to find the door to our room open an crack. We found the latching mechanism was not catching unless you put pressure on the door till you heard the click, and the maid did not ensure it was closed. When we called the desk, a maintenance worker was there within a couple minutes and worked on the door for us. We didn't have any further issues but did not trust the door for the rest of our trip. Also, the locking mechanism gave us some trouble. On three separate occaisions, it would not recognize our key card. When it's a 5 minute walk each way to go back and forth to the desk, that is very frustrating. After the third instance, they sent a maintenance worker who replaced the batteries, and we had no further problems. The next morning we returned to our room to find a snack tray and bottle of tequila normally reserved for upgraded packages that we took as a sort of apology. These were small frustrations in the big picture. The grounds themselves, there are so many pools and all were very refreshing, though for some reason they were all about a foot and a half low, so skimmers were not operating and the jets in the whirlpools were out of commission. There is lots of greenery and watch for the iguanas all over! Be prepared to do a lot of walking, this place is huge. The food was excellent, both in the buffet and the a la cartes we visited. Our only issue with the buffet restaurants was that the service was less than inspiring. If you want coffee in the morning or wine or a drink at other meals, you have to often go to the waiters and ask them to come to your table. We did the Seafood a la carte twice, the Japanese, and the Grill, and all were fantastic. As we were there with a celebration, we became quite familiar with the bars. Drinks were excellent and they were not shy with their alcohol. Most bars are very quick to get your drink, but the beach bar is usually very busy. If you have a Bubba, that's the only spot you'd really appreciate it. Finally, the beach. The beach is very nice, and the widest we've seen in our travels. Walking up and down the beach we found this is by far the nicest on this strip. Be aware though there are rocks and coral in the water. Again, it is the nicest on the strip though, the neighboring resorts are un-swimmable.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous. Stay here, you will not regret it!!!\u201d", "Author": "hoop0049", "ReviewID": "UR59051209", "Content": "This is hands down the nicest resort I have ever stayed at. Like many reviews I've read on here, I was apprehensive when booking. The pictures looked nice and for the price we got, I figured if it wasn't wonderful, we'd just spend a lot of time in town. I was so blown away and impressed by almost every single aspect of this resort. I can't imagine who wouldn't give this place at least 4/5 stars, if not their 100% rating. I figure the people who rated this place low are just the kind of people who can't ever be happy-- there was honestly nothing to complain about that had to do with the Riviera Princess itself. So, from the beginning. When you walk into this place, it is breathtaking. The huge, marble lobby is so impressive, a lovely, modern hotel bar and lounge is on your left and the check in is on your right. A massive marble staircase is in the middle, leading down to the lower level shops, restaurants, bars, and onto the rooms and pools. Check in was a breeze. We immediately headed to the bar for our first all inclusive drink, then we asked where we made our reservations for dinner. They directed us to the area in the hall behind the bar, where we waited just a few minutes and sat down with some friendly girls who helped us book our dinner for that night and the next (you are able to book one day in advance but since it was already 4pm, they had no problem with us booking same day as well for that night). Then onto our room, which was the most basic (Jr. Suite)-- anything but! So clean, so cute- we didn't need anything more than that room- a big, comfy king bed, sofa area, flat screen TV, fridge (stocked with pop, water, and Modelo- all free and replenished daily!). We were a little confused at first about how to turn on the lights- but the bell hop came by promptly with our bags and showed us how you put your room key in a slot by the door and it turns on the power for the whole room. I liked that- saves power when you're out! Our room overlooked the hammock area and it was peaceful and beautiful. The balcony was nice, it was awesome to have a breeze while we slept. The bathroom was new and modern and had a great big shower. Two sinks, areas for toiletries (shelves), big closet with a free safe in the room too. Just perfect for us. It is a very large resort. I did see some golf cart type trollies around but we never used them. The walk from our room (in the 7000's) to the beach was about 10 minutes. To the main pools, about 7-8 min. Of course, we didn't mind as it was a nice walk with beautiful things to look at. There is very clear signage as to where everything is. The beach is great. I recommend, if you are going to spend your day there, getting up early and putting your towels down on chairs as it is hard to find somewhere past about 10am. I know that kind of is unfair to do, but everyone does it, so, eh who cares. Then go back to bed or have breakfast or something!! The water is of course clear and warm and wonderful- yes, it is a bit rocky about 5 feet into the water, but it is only rocky for a few feet, then back to sand. Not anything to worry about. The pools are also great. So many of them! There is one main pool where they do the \"crazy games\" around 3pm (I think this is their attempt at like a Cancun style party for 20somethings, its really not that lively esp. when we were there but its fun and people get kinda into it, hey we were tispy so it was humerous!). Apparently the pools are salt water but I didn't notice this at all. Good pool bars, great drinks, friendly bartenders. The restaurants are great! I would say 4/5 for the food. The best one, in my opinion, was Las Olas, the seafood restaurant (there is something about salmon from coastal towns that makes it so much better!). My boyfriend liked La Fondue which is, uh, fondue! We also went to the grill the first night (in my opinion not the best, but they made my boyfriend a special chicken dish that wasn't on the menu because he didn't want anything else-- big baby-- and I was so impressed they did this. It was our first night and it really set the tone for the rest of the week!!). We also went to Mamma Mia, which was wonderful. Each place is very similar- clearly diff. styles of food but similar presentation. Very fast, efficiant service. Friendly staff, quick seating- at one point my bf said \"I better get some more wine\" and literally within 30 seconds there was a waiter with a carafe filling up his glass. The breakfast buffets are great, you can be in and out if you want in like 10-15 minutes if you want to get on with your day. Offered so much to chose from its almost overwhelming!! :) Plus- a bloody bar and mimosas as you walk in- nice! Ok, one thing that was a little disappointing and not at all anything to do with the resort itself-- they distance into town. I knew it would be a cab ride but didn't realize how long it would take to get there or the cost. B/c of some construction, traffic, etc. it took about 20 min to get down into Playa's downtown and was about $15 US each way, which adds up. We went there the first night to go out to the bars and oh boy are the drinks overpriced there. Almost not worth it. I guess if you're with a group and can split cab fare and know where to go to get good deals it would be a good idea to go out downtown, but I couldn't keep thinking in the back of my head \"Drinks are FREE at the resort, you dummy!!\" so yeah also watch out for those club hosts who try to get you to come into their bar- \"Free cover and free drink for the lady\" and then you order your drink (in my case, a Margarita) and then they charge you for it (why? Oh, apparently it was good for only a Mojito? Huh? Are those not also kind of pricy drinks? Of course, I wasn't told this). Luckily, I am not someone who is easily \"had\" so I just said um, forget you, and left the drink on the bar and we went somewhere else. Rip off! The Blue Parrot is a cool bar- again, super overpriced, but they have this amazing fire hula hoop/dancer show and its worth hanging there for awhile to see that. We went to Coco Maya and that was pretty cool and chill. Then we went home. Clearly, there are a lot more places to go but we were tired. I'm sure the nightlife is amazing for 1. people not so worried about spending mucho dinero 2. people who DONT have a toddler at home (in MN clearly) who had drained them of most of their energy the day before :) 3. bigger groups. Ok back to Riviera Princess. When we were there, this was the main makeup of fellow guests: Old couples, young (20-30s) couples, and young families with toddlers. I think we went right before \"spring break\" started and it wasn't too wild. Not much for night life in the resort, which was ok with me as I wanted just a relaxing vacation but the bf wanted to party more, so he was a little let down. However, it may be more lively during later March, when I imagine more spring breakers come down. That said, I don't imagine this place is ever like Cancun, though, so if you're looking for a wild time, uh- go to Cancun. Staff: awesome. Friendly. Everyone. Efficiant, happy, holas to and from everyone. The place is immaculate. Like, completely and utterly eat-off-the floor-able immaculate. Those people with the pics of the cockroaches? Seriously, I couldn't even imagine that there. The worst thing I saw was a grasshopper. Also, if you can do the scubadiving. It was a really great experience. They offer lots of diff options, we did the one dive which was $100 and included a lesson in the pool first. Our instructor was Emmy, she was very very patient and kind and didn't get frusterated with us when we got freaked out! It was really worth it and I'm so glad we went through with it. I loved this place, clearly- judging by the encyclopedia I've just written about it. I highly, HIGHLY recommed this place if you want to relax, not worry about spending extra money (we did tip a bit, but not everyone did, I don't think its expected at all), have some great drinks, food, and come back home pretty much blissed out :)", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cWatch Out!!!\u201d", "Author": "LAAFE", "ReviewID": "UR59042971", "Content": "My husband and I had our credit cards taken from our safe (which was locked).

I figure I've read some reviews on this site and trying to weed out the good and bad can be challenging. I have travelled to quite a few resorts and each time we try to compare places we've been. Although subjective. There are a few things you would want to know about a place before going there. First off, this resort is huge! For some this can be worrysome if you have mobility issues. They do have shuttles but I never used them. If takes a good 10-12 mins to walk from the lobby to the beach. In some ways this was good since your usually eating and drinking too much anyways. The grounds are really nice! fountains and pools everywhere. Plants and landscaping are also top notch. Rooms are very clean and maids seems to do a great job too. Food is good for the most part. We ate 5 times at various al la carte restuarants. Most are good to very good. I did find the buffet did oversalt many items. The fresh fish usually it too salty for my taste. Drinks are ok. Most premium brands although none of the really good brands. The beer on tap is Corona and it's pretty decent. The wine wasn't the best. The white was very sweet and the red I tried was terrible. The pools are scattered all over the place and they all seem to have a theme. One quiet pool. One pool with animation. And a pool closer to the beach which was a mixture of the other two. They did have a few kiddie pools as well. They are all kept very clean. One of my complaints about the vacation had nothing to do with the resort but rather some people who bring there children into the adult pools wearing diapers. For me it's a real turn off. They have kiddie pools. So not sure why people do this?? Make sure to check out the lobby bar at night and the disco. Also the piano bar is nice. The beach is ok. The sand is nice. To be honest Cuba seems to have the best beaches. Most spots are ok but there are some rocky areas. The surf can be rough at times as well. Chairs are in short supply in the busy season. If you want one you might want to get up earlier and put a towel over a few chairs. Go eat breakfast then go back to sit on the beach.

This was our first trip anywhere tropical, and we sure weren\u2019t let down. I was a little unsure after reading some of the reviews, but quickly learned that there was nothing at all to worry about! We arrived from the airport around 8pm. Check in was quick and easy, with a friendly front desk staff. We brought our own bags to our room, although we had the option to have someone bring them. There was a shuttle we could have taken as well, however we wanted to take in the scenery of the resort right away. We were about halfway between the lobby and beach, so it was a 3 minute walk or so, walking slowly. The grounds were beautifully landscaped, and the statues lining the walkway were magnificent. We got to our room with no issues, thanks to the signs directing us. The room was gorgeous, complete marble floors, like the rest of the resort. We were on the quieter side of the resort, right outside the Kids\u2019 club. The room was clean, we had a welcome basket and a few bottles of liquor. We were hungry from our long day of travelling, so we set out to find the buffets. The food at both of the buffet restaurants was roughly the same, and didn\u2019t vary much from meal to meal \u2013 however, there was so much of a selection that it didn\u2019t matter, we couldn\u2019t possibly try everything in one sitting anyways. I tried almost everything throughout the week, and most of it I liked. I hadn\u2019t ever heard of most of it, but I\u2019m in a foreign country, so I expect that. If I wanted a burger & fries, I could have gone to McDonald\u2019s. Courteous service at the buffets, and we left a tip most of the time. The beach was a little on the small side, but no matter when we went, we could usually find two chairs side by side. I didn\u2019t have a problem with rocks, although this is the ocean; there are rocks in the ocean. I didn\u2019t have to wear water shoes when I walked on the beach or in the water, like some reviews say. On day 2 or 3, my husband and I each had a massage on the beach \u2013 I highly recommend it for anyone. It was the highlight of my trip! We went to 3 a la carte dinners; Mexican, Japanese and Fondue. I enjoyed all of them, the Japanese being my favourite. Unfortunately, I was sick the day we went to the Fondue restaurant, so I couldn\u2019t eat too much, but what I did eat I really enjoyed. This one was my husband\u2019s favourite. The service of all the staff was wonderful. Every time we looked around someone was cleaning, fixing or improving something, and the staff helped us out whenever they could.

We did book it and i'm happy we did, this resort is absolutely amazing, it offers something for everyone and it truly is a good deal. Although the resort is huge, it really is to the guests' benefit, for one can always find a pool chair or privacy, or just join the fun where everyone else is. I actually loved the fact that it was so big because we ended up walking a lot, especially after having huge meals, i barely gained any weight. The resort itself is luxurious, marble everywhere, its unbelievable..its very clean-the rooms as well as the outside of the rooms are constantly being tidied up. It offers a variety of restaurants ad bars, u can never go hungry or thirsty here..we went to the Tapas, Hacienda(mexican), La Foundue and Mamma Mia. Our favorite was definitely the Tapas, the food was amazing, just the right portion and they had a flamenco show..very very nice. All the restaurants we went to except La Fondue which was really bland..all the other ones were absolutely delicious and really looked like 5 star restaurants. As a side note we did tip the waiters and really anytime we were serviced by anyone..the staff works really hard and they are always so nice and helpful to the guests. We spent most of the time at the party pool, its a lot of fun, they have activities and music playing all day..as well as a server who comes around the pool say every half hour to get drink orders lol its great especially when its so hot outside..the bar by the party pool also has a self serve ice cream machine..yummy there are also nightly shows, earlier ones take place in the plaza and the ones at 9:30 take place upstairs in the theater. All the shows were enjoyable .. There is really nothing to complain about..we had a great time at this resort, we really did not want to leave and would love to go back.. FYI we did not have a theft problem, we put all the valuables in the seif and nothing went missing.. Also this is not pertaining to the resort but i recommend getting out of the resort and visiting Playa del Carmen, it is stunning..also we went to Aktun Chen and swam and snorkeled in a cenote, it was one of the most amazing things i have done in my life..", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cOUTSTANDING !!!!\u201d", "Author": "BeachBabee007", "ReviewID": "UR58517774", "Content": "I traveled with my mom and we absolutely loved it.

We had originally booked at the Sandos Playacar but after reading reviews and doing more research we changed our travel plans to stay at the Grand Riviera Princess. We were very happy that we did! We upgraded before we left to a Junior Deluxe/Pool Suite. The room was great! We had asked for a king bed during the reservation process but were told up front that we would get one, based on availability. When we checked in we found that we had two double beds. We were put on a list for pool suite with king bad and after two days were advised that there was one available. Before we took the room we noticed that it would be on the opposite side of the building that we were now in and it would be mostly shaded based on the position of the sun. So we kept our original room. Our patio was exposed to the sun most of the day which was great! The staff was very courteous and helpful. We had no problem with roomsafe entry. We did place a towel on the floor in front of the shower door to prevent water from escaping. This was thanks to others who had posted this tip. Thank you to them. The food at the buffets were great - Tip: the earlier you arrive the warmer the food. We ate at two alacarte restaurants, Miso and Mama Mia. Miso (Oriental) was ok. Mama Mia (Italian) was excellent (get the veal)! Excellent, spacious, well maintained resort. Would go back again, but we want to try other resorts also. Trip Advisor comments do help in our choices. I'd like to ad that we did book the Camel Safari through our onsite travel rep. This was a unique walking pace ride through the jungle to the beach and back. Guides were very knowledgeable and interesting. If you're looking for something different, go for it. Thank you to our Lomas Travel Rep. at the Resort - Carlos Steves.

We definitely rated this hotel a 5 star!! Not sure why the negative reviews. It's about a 10 minute walk from the beach to the lobby, but there is a shuttle to take you back and forth if you wish. We stayed in the Platinum suites closest to the beach, which I highly recommend. Platinum guests have extra perks like a free 1/2 hour massage at the spa, free 24hr room service, 4 computers with internet access, invitation to the Tai Beach restaurant, complementary bottles of alcohol(whiskey, tequila, vodka and rum), private pool and beach area, and unlimited towels without having to turn your used ones in for more. Rooms are very large with a jacuzzi in the bathroom and another on your balcony. Room fridge is restocked daily with water, beer and pop. The platinum lounge was great to go to in the evenings, with our favourite bartender being Matilde. He could make you any drink you asked for. We tipped him and got the best premium drinks. My favourite was the mango tango a must to try. The buffet was large with a variety of food including an egg station and pasta station made to your liking. We tried 2 alacartes, the grill (okay) and the Italian. The staff were always friendly and helpful. Say hola and they had a smile from ear to ear. We always tipped our bartender, maid and fridge replenisher. Our maid always left us with a new towel art each day and chocolates with our evening turn down service. The beach is large and there is no problem finding a lounger. We did go down early in the morningto put a towel down on our loungers that were front row to the beach. The ocean was beautiful and the sand is a fine powdery white. There is also drink service on the beach. There are nightly shows in the main lobby, a jewellery store that was reasonably priced. I would certainly shop there for silver. We went to Playa Del Carmen, 5th Ave which is a must to see for their various shops and open air restaurants. The cab fare is $13.00 US, so negotiate this before you get into the cab. This resort is family oriented and has a kids club with many different activities. A few things to clear up from some of the negative reviews I read......There are no mosquitoes and theft was never a problem...We locked our stuff in our suitcase and carried some $ on person.

Unfortunately, it is not. At most, it would make a lower end 4 star or 3 plus. Having been to quite a few resorts in the Mayan Riviera over the past decade, sadly, it wouldn't be on my recommendation list. So a few pluses and minuses. It's location is only 45 minutes from the airport. There is daily free shuttle from the hotel to Playa del Carmen; leaves at either 10am or 12 noon and returns at 6pm only. Enjoy the day in town! This didn't bother me but just so you know, the resort is quite large so be prepared to do a little walking. Grounds and buildings are very nice and clean. Rooms are large with large balconies. Bathrooms have a cutout window with sliding doors that open to the room. Not much privacy. The water from shower leaked out of the walls onto the floor. The floors are dangerously slippery when wet! Swimming pools are large but cold; not too many people used them. Lots of chairs around the pools; easy to find some. The beach is very nice; quite a long stretch, the water has some waves and is shallow; no coral. Just a few small rocks upon entering; water shoes not needed. Finding a lounger on the beach is difficult unless you arrive early. This area is roped off like a pen and there are definitely not enough chairs for the size of the resort. Yes, there are mosquitoes; they come out at dusk (about 6pm). We are mosquito bait, but only a couple bites amongst us. The quality of food and lack of service were the real disappointments. Not much variety, all the meats are over-marinated and everything is extremely salty! The only fish we ever saw was grouper. The food was never hot even when they put out 'fresh' trays. This also included the 5 a la carte restaurants where we dined. Drinks were very 'light'. And this is coming from an cheap drunk so if I didn't even feel anything after a drink or two....It seemed that the wait staff was either understaffed and/or unhappy. Not many smiling faces and we were probably checked upon 6 times at most while dining during the entire week. Most of the times we had to flag down a waiter or get our drinks ourselves. Did we go during an 'off' week? I don't know. The food and lack of service are the main reasons I wouldn't suggest this resort in comparison to others.

I have to say, this is not the Mexico I've known in the past. Everyone seemed quite respectful of us. The roads were clean.

At least 10 minutes to walk from lobby to beach. But when you are at the beach and need something in the lobby it can get a little tiring. There are 3 buffet restaurants for breakfast and lunch.

The a la carte restaurants are very good. We went to 6 of them and were disapointed only at the seafood restaurant. Salmon was overcooked and the menu said red snapper but it was not. The italian is good (try the veal, excellent) and Le Fleur (try the filet mignon, also excellent). We did not have enough days left to try Tapas or the Fondue. As for the wine it was terrible. The red was sweat and the white tasted like Koolaid. For a 5 star hotel they should have better wine. You can also buy wine by the bottle but they were expensive. The pools are great and so is the beach. The beach is wide with lots of palapas and you can walk a long time on the beach both sides which is good compared to Cancun where most beaches are rocky and have been destroyed with the last huricane.

Although, some people are never happy and are just compulsive complainers.. When we arrived at this resort, we were very impressed with this massive resort. Check-in was quick and the front desk was very friendly. The grounds are immaculate, and are constantly being manacured. The gardeners work very hard to keep it this way. Say hello to them, it doesn't cost anything. We were in a junior suite room 7237 on the third floor and just at the edge of the start of all the pools. When we woke up every morning, it was just like being in paradise to see the tops of the palm trees and the pools to our left. Everything at this resort was beyond our expectations. We travel every year and stay at 5 star resorts, and this one is at least a 7 in my eyes. The food was amazing, no matter where you went whether it be the buffet or the a'lacartes, which we never had a problem getting into. There was so much to choose from in the buffet that we enjoyed going there also. The beach had powdery white sand, with just a bit of small pebbles when you first walk in, but nothing to worry about. It was very clean and we did not see any seeweed like I had read by other writers. Our hats off to \"Best Day Travel\", who looked after the excursions at the resort!! They were the greatest we had ever experienced from any other trip we had taken . Farid and Valente you are the best and I hope you will be there when we come back some day soon. I found the prices for the silver jewellry in the resort store to be very fair and bought all our pieces there. We went into Playa twice and looked around there for the silver and you have to be very careful as one store owner told us some silver is only plated and there is some kind of metal underneith. When buying Vanilla, make sure you get the glass bottle. I found out that the plastic bottles that say \"Pure or Natural\" are not if they are in plastic that's why they can sell them so cheap. When tipping your maid, I would advise to give it to her either when you see her or at the end of your stay. We found out in our second week there that the money we left on the bed by the pillow was gone before our room was made up. We just happened to go back to our room one day to find the money gone from the bed and the room was not made up. We looked in the fridge, and sure enough our fridge was stocked!! I went to the concierge desk to tell them and they said they would look into it, but never heard back. No wonder we had only the one towel art from the first day. Can you imagine, if the person filling the fridges gets to the rooms before the maids, well their tip is gone!! We were very upset about this because the maids work so hard . Oh, one last thing. For all you people that slam your doors in the middle of the night or very early morning, have some consideration for the people that are still sleeping!!

We travelled with Sunwing from Toronto. This was our second trip to Playa del Carmen in 5 months - last time we stayed at Secrets Capri. These two resorts are total opposites of each other and I wanted to touch on a few things that I never saw mentioned before I went... Nightly Activities: Every night starting around 7pm they have a nice duo performing outside so you can grab a drink before dinner. There is a show every night in the HUGE air-conditioned (and bar-serviced) theatre. We saw about 4 shows, and they were all entertaining. The disco opens at 10:30 and was so much fun! This is a true nightclub... no kids, amazing lights and lasers, fabulous music. Definitely make the trip into Coco Bongo with the activities team one night too! Spa: My husband and I both had massages in the spa - not on the beach. The beach massages had no privacy and I wouldn't think they would be very peaceful. Being in the spa was fabulous. Beautiful music, low lights and excellent massage. However, it was more like visiting an excellent RMT that a true \"spa\" experience. They had the facilities to spoil you, but didn't seem to use them (ie. Hydrotherapy Circuit). That being said, I would still highly recommend - especially on a rainy day like we had. Overall it was great accommodation (Jr. Deluxe Suite), good (but not great) food (breakfast and lunch awesome, dinners were poor), crowded but nice beach, fun by the pool and spectacular grounds! No issues with theft - and nor did we hear of any.

My wife and I went down expecting the usual all inclusive service. Well we were very very very surprised from the time we arrived!!!!!!!!!!! My wife and I went down without our kids to pamper us. This was our first trip without our kids in about 15 yrs. I cannot say enough how nice EVERY staff member was with us. Everyone from grounds keepers to the Managers were very pleasant and wanted to make sure we had a great time while we were there. We went from February 21-27 and sure the weather was not the greatest but lots of stuff to do. We went to the spa had a massage and aroma therapy and spent the afternoon in the spa. We had the whole pool and hot tub all to ourselves. The steam room was not working however the sauna was nice. We went on a cool cloudy day and well it was the perfect thing to do on a not so perfect day. We traveled through signature vacations and Darren our advisor at the resort was very helpful with setting up excursions. We spent one day swimming with the Dolphins at Dolphin Discovery and wow what a great day thanks for the suggestion Darren. We also went to COCO BUNGO\u2026 for all of you who want to have a great night out with dancing and shows this is a must\u2026 it is a late night you leave the resort at 1030 pm and get back at 4 am. Coco bungo is electrifying and well if you like your drinks you will never run dry there the wait staff make sure of that. Watch out for the people walking around asking you if you want a Picture with Spiderman or other characters of the shows\u2026 barder with them they will tell you a picture is 20 bucks but you can get it for 10 easily.Ohhh and hello to our new friends from Boston and Fort Mc. and thank you to the animation team that took us on our trip to the best show/disco around.... The only bad part of our trip had nothing to do with the resort or the staff of the resort but some of the guests. We were staying in the platinum suits and there were 6 guests who everyday took all the covered lounges around the platinum pool but they also took the six other chairs around the covered lounges taking up a total of 12 spots. My wife and I were there one day and there were many other guests who would walk up see that everything was taken and turned and left. Now this might be the Canadian in me but there was no need to hog 12 chairs/loungers for 6 people. Very upsetting to know that these people were also Canadian and well hey just pissed me off.

As far as all inclusives we rate this one very high. One of the things that attracted us initially was the variety of a la carte dining options. We don't mind buffet for breakfast and lunch but really appreciate a sit down meal for dinner. We were not disappointed. The first day we arrived too late the make an a la carte reservation, but after talking to the host at the Mamma Mia Italiian restaurant he was able to find us a table. Great meal and great service in this and all other al a carte restaurants (Miso, LeFleur, La Vaqueria, La Haciernda, Tapas and Thai Beach) The Tapas had a flamenco dance show which was really unique. We booked Platinum level rooms due to the great deal we got when we booked on Travelocity. We flew on Westjet through Toronto. I would definitely book in the Platinum rooms again as we received many perks (close to beach with ocean view, jacuzzi tub on balcony and in bathroom. Bottles of liquor and fruit /nut tray in room on our arrival, special platinum lounge and free internet access. There was even a continental breakfast and all days snacks in the lounge. We were able to make our dinner reservations two nights ahead for each of the restaurants. We also received a complimentary dinner at the beachside Thai beach restaurant. Unfortunately the evening we went it was cool and windy with rain, but we enjoyed it just the same. The grounds and pool are very well kept and there were always workers grooming and cleaning.

The resort is 2 years old so is not showing any signs of decay. There is constant maintenance being performed in every area. After a 32 minute trip from the airport our check in was seamless. Although our rooms were not ready, we stored our luggage, ate lunch and wandered the property. At about 3pm our rooms were ready. My husband and I were initially assigned to a room with 2 double beds and when we asked to be switched to a room with 2 queens or a king there was no issue. (I suspect the resort was only about 90% capacity, making this possible). The room itself was a standard Junior Suite size, the bathroom amazing, the shower large enough to hold a party in, very clean and well appointed. No bugs, no mold, mini bar restocked daily, safe, iron, hair dryer, etc. We spent most of our time on the beach as Mother Nature decided it was going to be about 25 C daytime and 17 C nighttime for our vacation. The pools were too cold to get into but the ocean was lovely. The beach itself is amazing. White powdery sand to dig your toes into. The ocean is shallow and clean, a joy to swim and jump waves in. We had no issues with chairs on the beach as we are early risers. Lots of chair vacancies at any of the pools any time of day. Again, I suspect the resort was not at 100% capacity. Our package included 7 \u00e1 la carte dinners, which is wonderful and a bonus on other resorts we have stayed at. Our only issue is with the \u00e1 la carte reservation system. We were allowed to book only 2 days in advance so had to keep going back and trying to get into the restaurant of our choice, not one that had space available. For the record, we did not enjoy the Mexican \u00e1 la carte, really enjoyed the Tapas and Italian, are luke warm on the Grill. We did not have the opportunity to sample the Asian, Seafood, Gourmet International or Swiss. We ate one dinner in Playa del Carmen and lucked into their annual Carnival while there. The other 2 dinners we had at the buffet, rather than repeat the Mexican \u00e1 la carte, which was all that was not boked full on those nights. The buffets have more than enough to satisfy any palate and we strongly recommend the bbq burgers and hot dogs for lunch. We did not take any excursions as we have been to Mexico and many other countries in the Caribbean and find there really isn't anything we would pay exorbitant rates to see. We would rather hire a local cabby and have him take us wherever and tell us about his country. (tour guides give a very vanilla version of what is really going on) The resort touts itself as being ecologically responsible. We were saddened to see this is not the case. The bbq has styrofoam containers, rather than a paper plate or strong napkin. We saw plastic garbage bags being tossed with only a few cups in them and a new bag lining the container. Plastic stir sticks when a straw, that is needed for other drinks, would have done the job. The resort is wheelchair accessible, except for the beach which has only a small wooden board walk.

There is really something for everyone at this resort - we've stayed at another 5 star rated resort on the Mayan (El Dorado Royale) and found the Princess to be comparable in many ways, and since we were travelling with our 5yr old, the Kids Club was very important to us. The Kids Club was fantastic - though our daughter was one of only 3 children for most of the week who were the right age to use the kids club, she loved it there (Phew!) - it had a sheltered area for crafts, a playground and a small kiddie pool. The staff were genuine and were interested in making it fun. There is also an evening/indoor kids club that is used during bad weather, but we didn't use this one. There was also a daily mini-disco for the kids (with parents) to have some fun in the evening. The food at the a la cartes was very good, the wine was not...if you're a foody needing some decent wine, I recommend heading into Playa and stocking up at Walmart (not a great selection, but you can get by and spend a lot less than buying off of the wine list). The spa was a disappointment - half of the \"features\" were not working, including the steam room, half of the jets in the main pool and the hot tub was only lukewarm. Access is free with a spa treatment (we had massages and pedicures which were great) - but happy I didn't pay $22USD to access the spa alone - would have been very disappointed. The service as a whole was very good - most were friendly, enthusiastic and eager to please. Our room was kept spotless and when we used the \"make up room\" sign, our room was often tended to before 10:00 am. I would recommend making your dinner reservations 2 days in advance (they accept new reservations starting at 2pm each day) and highly recommend Tapas (for the Flamenco/spanish guitar show) and when booking at Miso you have to indicate whether you want the Tapayaki Grill, the sushi bar or the oriental restaurant (were disappointed nobody stated this - would have loved to eat at the Tapan grill). For all of you Canadians out there who prefer cream in your coffee, the closest you're going to get is carnation evaporated milk - again you can buy 35% cream at walmart and keep it in your mini bar if you're desperate. I personally grew to love Baileys in my coffee in the morning (hey we're on vacation right? ;-) Grounds were beautiful and very well maintained - literally there were people who were scrubbing the stones in the lagoon - gorgeous!

I would have to say this is the worst hotel I've been to so far. The food is very bad, no open-air restaurants, only open-air lobby. Not much in the way of foliage. The way the hotel is laid out is not very pretty on the eyes (no big palm trees, very concrete). I dont like to spend the majority of my time at the lobby, but that is where all the a la cartes are at, sports bar, etc. Not very spread out, everything is in 1 clump pretty much. I've been to Grand X-Caret and thought it was way better since you feel like you are in a jungle, there are animals, birds. This resort has no animals (I didn't even see any iguanas? Very odd). The beach is very rocky with seaweed, not clear at all. I found everything seemed to feel really cheap. The drinks were overly sweet, not good quality. Claiming to be a 4 or 5* this is the worst I've seen. X-Caret is a 4* and everything was way better quality. Another tip, don't eat at the sports bar, you will get food poisoning. They don't cook their burgers, blood gushes out of them. Also, the ocean wreaked of sewage, only at this resort though. They must have a sewage line right at the swimming area. Also, they were fumigating outside in front of the shuttle, not very safe. Everyone was coughing and couldn't breath.

See our top tips at the bottom of this review for maximum enjoyment. We (My Mom, Dad, Girlfriend and I) visited GRP 25th Jan to 8th Feb. 2 luxurious weeks in Paradise!! This resort is stunning! First and foremost. TAKE PESO'S!.... USD $100 = 1000 peso's on the street. Exchange your money before travel or withdraw Peso's from the Scotiabank ATM (where the shuttle bus drops off) on you get 1250 Peso's for your 100 bucks. You get the equivelent of US$25 for free per 100 changed. Same applies in GBP sterling but better. On the street a dollar is 10 peso's. \u00a31 = 20 peso's. Effectively you're getting $2 for \u00a31. Take Peso's. Not Dollars..................... Secondly as a foreword. Mosquito's. The resort is carved out of a jungle...They are there. they bite. That said there was no infestation. They fumigate the grounds regularly. My Mom's a mozzy magnet. She got bit 6 times in 2 weeks. We used repellent on a night with 50% deet, It worked. I took bug spray for the room. It worked. Prevention is better than cure. We didn't meet anyone who was covered in bites. Now the review........ I won't comment on the negative reviews out there other than to say a vacation is what you make it and that people seem to be more willing to report bad news rather than good. I suppose everyone has an a opinion based on their experience.......this is mine..... Each and every single person, without exception, we spoke to (and there was lots of em) sang praises for The Princess. That must give you an idea of the general perception of this place. As a side note: ...Between our group we have clocked up approx 60-70 foreign holidays. I have personally been to an array of Vacation properties including Sandals Resorts, Breezes, Riu, Sheraton's etc. Plus 5 star accomodations in Spain and Florida. I'm not bragging. I am merely pointing out that i have enough experience to compare. The resort is amazing!! It's remarkably, spotlessly clean. It's incredibly well maintained, the food is greeeat!!!. The staff are soooo friendly and polite. The drinks are as plentiful as you want them to be. The beach is fantastic and the pools are endless. All in all we could not pick fault with anything anywhere near major, The resort is huge....It truly is. 10 -12 minute walk from lobby to beach. Believe me, It's a pleasure.... If you have a problem walking for upto a maximum of 12 minutes at a time through beautiful landscaped gardens under the Mexican Sunshine with the option of stopping along the way for a cocktail (ot two) and everyone saying 'Hola, buenos dias' as you go, then perhaps look for a smaller property. If you have a problem with a resort complex big enough to enable you to have a different experience each day by varying where you sit within the comlex, but also the option of joining in the fun, meeting lots of great people and feeling like you belong - then look elsewhere. If you have a problem having so much choice of food to choose from that you can't possibly try everything in one go (or possibly 2 weeks!) you know what to do. If you have a problem visiting 3 buffet's, a poolside grill and upto 7 different restaurants with the possibility you may not enjoy every single thing you order due to personal preference, i would suggest you may need therapy. If you have a problem getting your head round the 1st come, 1st served policy for restaurant / shuttle bus and are unwilling to accept disappointment in this area then either look elsewhere or get in early. The Hotel was almost full to capacity during our 2nd week...(We selected a different eating time / restaurant when what we requested was unavailable. On one occasion everything was booked up. We ate in the buffet.....Not a problem. ) Be aware...The bus gets booked up early, ecpecially for the 10am run. A taxi into Playa is 135 peso's. (USA $13.50). We took a taxi in and the free 6pm shuttle back. Seemed like there was always space for the 6pm return. (i guess most get a taxi back earlier than 6pm) The shuttle bus IS NOT A GIMMICK! it's a full sized luxury coach. It is not full every day so sometimes it's running below capacity. I imagine if demand outstrips supply day after day after day then Princess management will perhaps put on an extra run. All in all we would very, very highly recommend GRP to anyone. Ideal for couples, mixed groups and families. It's child friendly with kids clubs, shallow pools and babysitter service for a small charge. The majority of guests during our stay were couples of all ages. There were quite a number of disabled guests in wheelchair's. Its a wheelchair friendly resort. (Although the size of the resort and potential travelling distances around the place could be challenging perhaps?) On arrival check in was slick. Took about 10-15 minutes. I guess we timed it right. Had we had a long line we would have taken a comfortable seat in the lobby bar right opposite check-in, ordered some delicious cocktails. (late night arrival would be different i guess). and wait for the line to go down. The porter gave us directions and took our bags to our room. The room took a bit of finding but we expected that so it wasn't a problem. TOP TIP. View layout map. Get a handle on the resort layout before you arrive. (link below) http://www.playa.info/playa-del-carmen-forum/attachments/all-inclusive-big-resorts/7683d1209234181-grand-riviera-princess-resort-map-grand-sunset-princess-map1.jpg We were room 8114, Block 8, 1st floor. 3 mins from reception / lobby bar, 3 minutes from buffets and majority of a-la cartes restaurants, 3 minutes from the pools, 6-7 minutes from the beach. A good position towards the lobby end of the resort. This meant we passed the restaurant booking desk, shuttle bus desk and concierge etc on a regular basis. Block 8 or 7 i would recommend for these reasons.... Opened the door to the room. WOW! We were Junior Deluxe. (we were given a free upgrade - BONUS!) Good sized room, huge bed, bathroom was stunning. Doulbe vanity sinks, whirlpool bath and a shower big enough for two. Drinks in the fridge. Very clean from top to bottom. Net curtains and moquito sliding screen. We were impressed. TOP TIP: Don't expect to be upgraded. We were lucky. People we met were 'demanding' to be upgraded but they were told there were no rooms available. They felt disappointment. Accept what you are given or pre-upgrade before you travel. The balcony view was limited. We looked onto the gardens. Palm trees, manicured lawns and an array of colourful plants. Private and well shaded. No problemo Seniors! The room was cleaned meticulously everyday. We got towel art ranging from swans to turtles nearly every day. (we were lucky i guess, others we spoke to didn't get this, regardless of standard of accomodation) We never actually met our maid but we tipped her every third day 100 peso's. We were very happy with her contribution to our vacation. Our fridge was re-stocked everyday with soda and beer. Fantastic. No spirits. We never requested any. Not a problem. The nearest bar was 3 minutes away and they let you take drinks back to your room. We got cleaned up and had a wander around the complex at dusk before dinner. 1st impressions were excellente! We got up at 6am next day to catch Sunrise on the beach. It was a memorable experience. (see photo 1) I'll break each section down into bite sized chunks now starting at the beach. The beach. Sea was easily warm enough to swim. Some days it was rough, great for messing around in the waves. Some days calm and aqua blue, crystal clear. Near white sand. Very clean. Pleanty of sunbeds. Mostly close together which made for a socially friendly experience. We met some fantastic folks on the beach. Beachbar and wairtress service on the beach. A moderate tip (20-50peso's) ensured a regular flow of drinks brought to your lounger. However tips are certainly not obligitory but they are very much appreciated. Lifeguards on duty. Volleyball court, horseshoes, french bowls, massage beds, watersports stand. The further left or right you went from the centre of the beach the more availabilty for sunbeds and less tightly packed together. If you want to be next to the action and bar expect to strugge for a bed. The majority of others like it there too! (we always got one though, any time of day). There were rocks in the sea but not too bad at all. I took water shoes with me but never used them. Waste of money. TOP TIP:. Take some bread and sausages (yes, sausages) from the buffet and feed the fish in the ocean. Fantastic!!! 30 yards over the bridge to the pools there are restrooms, showers and a beach / gift shop which was reasonably priced. Across from here was the pool grill. 10-30am till 4.30pm. Burgers, hotdogs, chicken wings, salad bar. Simple food but well prepared. One day they were out of hotdogs. It was 4pm and i guess they must have served 2000-3000 hotdogs that day. We had a burger instead. Some loud mouthed idiots were shouting 'where's the hotdogs!!, they said there was hotdogs!!' in a rude manner to the chef. No need at all. I guess they felt they were better than him and tried to be-little him. All they ended up doing was looking like fools. Thie beach end of the resort is the Platinum area. These guests seemed to have priority over others but they paid for it so that's fair. We had a stroll past. I couldn't see the point from the outside but those guests i spoke to who were platinum were very complimentary of the extra touches they got. I guess i can appreciate the extra quality for the extra money. That said we were more than happy with the standard of accomodation and the treatment we got in Junior / Junior deluxe Swimming Pools. Where do i start. There are acres of them. If you want music and fun and games try the main fun pool. That was our favourite. My Parents found it too noisy there so the went another pool over in the shade. They enjoyed the music as background music there. Another pool even further and there is peace and tranquility. Most of the pools are suitable for kids. There was a good sized dedicated childrens pool. There are thousands of sunbeds. Same rule applies as the beach. If you want a bed around the fun pool, or other prime locations you may struggle. Get there early or improvise. The animation team did a great job during the day. Pool games include tequilla volleyball where the person responsible for losing the point takes a grape juice tequilla shot. Great fun!. Water polo was intense. Good exercise and great fun! It brought people together. a couple of games and you feel like a local and spend the rest of your day chatting with your fellow polo-farians. Silly games....Flip flop flinging contest, macho man contest to name a couple were great fun to watch and participate in too. The 'belly flop' forfeight for not winning was side splittingly funny to watch. Ouch!! The waitress service around the pools was excellent. There was even Manuel, the pool butler (nice touch!) who offered complimentary sun tan lotions and sunglasses cleaning service. No tip necessary but you'd be wrong not to drop him a dollar. (10-20 peso's) The walk through the pool area was beautiful. Along the way included 2 pool bars, towel exchange booth, 2 x restrooms, scuba diving desk (free lessons in the pool) leading to the main pathway to lobby / reception fringed by palm trees (rodeo drive stylee), manicured lawns, colourfull plants, the Iguana tree where the resisdent iguana was ever present. 3-4 minutes walk and your at the lobby. At this end of the resort were the Laguna Villa's. Reserve for the wealthier and more refined guests. Bit posh for my liking but i could appreciate the quality and exclusiveness they offered. Very, very nice indeed. The lobby. Huge, grand, sumptious, luxurious, spectacular, sparkingly clean. Here you will find the Shuttle pick up, taxi station, Reception, booking in / out desk, enquiries and help desk. You can change large notes into smaller denominations for tipping here. (most of the bars will do this too if you ask them nicely). Concierge office, (we needed band aids and they gave us some), anything you need just ask. Restrooms are huge, spectacular and spotleesly clean here, as they are everywhere else on the complex too. Lobby bar. Popular chill out bar open all day till midnight. Afternoon tea, cookies and snacks available. Great service. Often busy so you may have a short wait at the bar. Accept it. At all the bars i chose to wait my turn rather than jump in. Others wern't so gracious. (or plain rude!) This was slightly annoying but i'd rather keep my dignity than upset others who have waited patiently. If only these 'others' had adopted this attitude it would have made a more polite atmosphere. That's human nature i suppose. He who shouts loudest gets served first. Personally i get more self satisfaction by being polite to others rather than upsetting others for self gain. The bar staff didn't seem to want to upset anyone. They couldn't have worked any faster or harder. I take my hat off to all the bar staff!!!! and the waitress staff too. Guadeloupe gets an extra special mention. What an outstanding employee!!! A beautiful person! Behind the main lobby bar was the booking desks for restaurants and shuttle. The Tapas restaurant and Piano bar were here too. We tried the Piano bar but it was dead at the time. Spoke to some guests who had been in and they said it was great. We hit it at the wrong time. Along from the lobby on the upper floor were the majority of the restaurants. Japanese, Mexican, The Grill, La Fluer international cuisine and the Italian. Further along and you were at Sunset Lobby which mirrored Riviera Lobby. Down the main stairs, surrounded by fountains and overlooking lagoons and chill out cabana's was the gift shop, behind the gift shop the resort golf cart style shuttle which ran every 15 mins or so catering for the less mobile, the weary, morbidly obese or downright lazy. Down '5th' Avenue there is a jewelrey store then pass the Disco leading to ''central plaza' WOW!! This Plaza is spectacular!. Beautiful fountains, tiled floors, comfy chairs. It's the hub of the resorts non pool / beach activities. Here you will fing Riviera and Sunset buffets. Sports bar, Gym, Spa and on the upper level the Theatre Last but not least the central plaza bar. Big up to Cecilia and Maria the friendly bar staff. These guys never, ever stop from start to finish and always wear a smile for you. Admirable to say the least. Be nice to them. The deserve it. Here you will find the evening entertainment. The resident singer and musician were fantastic. We never tired of hearing them. We never tired of watching guests dancing too. A wide range of songs both latin american and pop / rock / balads. Performing from 7pm till 11pm with regular interludes. During thier interludes that are various performers from fire jugglers to Mayan dancers. There are 2 x flambe liquer coffee stands offering complimentary tailored after dinner liquer coffees. Nice touch, try one, Awesome!! The theatre must have held upto 1000 people, Huge. The shows were ok. We found them a bit cheesy but other guests loved them. Mainly dance orientated shows. Personal preference. No complaints. They have to cater for a range of nationalities and languages so to expect an English speaking comedy act or something would be a bit arrogant. The sports bar open 24-7 for food and beverages. Nacho's, burgers and basket meals. Simple food catering for late night revelers. Big screen TV's showing sport. The pool tables and foozball tables were a bit worse for wear. We found it ok in there. The gym was good. Mainly cardio focussed but it was well equipped. The spa. Had a walk thru but no treatments. It looked fantastic!! The disco was brilliant! For a hotel disco this is the best i've witnessed. Open at 10-30 til 2pm. Hit it at 11pm for maximum enjoyment. It's loud, quite big, great sound / lighting system. Also with waitress service (Hi again Guadeluope. ''Buenos Nochas'') Large dancefloor with everyone seemingly willing to get up and dance. (even my old folks aged 65 and 69!!) what a laugh. Food: Sunset / Riviera Buffet. Awesome. Food ranging from American / oriental / spanish / mexican / seafood / steaks / Fruits / salads / breads and pastries / deserts / omolate / egg chef etc etc. Basically everything you could possibly want. Very clean and fresh. Breakfast, lunch and Dinner. Crystal the meeter and greeter. She was lovely and we had some good fun and banter with her. (Hi Crystal from 'Bambino'). Great service although at busy times not always instant. Good coffee (regardless of other reviews!) always hot and fresh. La tortuga buffet. Never went there but heard great reports about it. Ala cartes. They are big and decorated nicely. Fantastic service across the board. Faultless. Miso. Japanese. We did the Tapenyaki style. Sat at the hotplate and they put on a great show. 5 out of 5 Le Fleur international. Awesome. Best meal we had. 6 out of 5 stars Mexican. Loads of food. Make sure your hungry. 4.5 out of 5 stars Itilian: Awesome lamb loin madalions. 4.5 ot of 5 stars Hacienda grill. Guess we hit it on a bad night. Was ok thouygh 3 out of 5 stars. Tapas: Not enough food so we topped up at the buffet. Flamenco dancing show was very good. 2.5 out of 5 stars. La fondue. Didn't go there but we heard the deserts were to die for! Playa Del Carmen. What a beautiful place. 5th Avenue has charm, character and is funky too. Good for shopping but have your wits about you. Never pay full price if the price isn't marked. You will get asked to ''come into my shop''....''100% off''....''everything a dollar''....''i'm the barman from the Princess''....''I have what you need'' etc. Simply say No Gracias and walk on. They'll leave you alone. Trips are much cheaper to book in Playa. We went snorkelling in Cozumal for 250 peso's. If you do go to Cozumal it's cheaper to book car hire / snorkel trips either on the ferry or when you get off the ferry. Shop around for the best deal. In Playa, Chitzen Itza was $49. Hotel price was $99 each. My folks went to Chicken Pizza for $49 each and they said it was a fantastic tour. It included on coach refreshments, snorkelling in a cenote (freshwater lagoon) buffet lunch and it was fullly guided tour. They said the guide was fantastic and made the trip. Well worth the money, Recommendation for booking trips. Walk towards the beach where the bus drops you off. Past Bip Bips bar on the corner, still walking towards the beach and there is an excursion umbrella stand - before the Royal hotel.. Ceasar looked after us and i would recommend him highly for booking trips. Top tip.....Stay away from timeshare!!!!!! The beach in playa is beautiful. We spent a day at 'Deep Blue' beach bar. Great music. Great service. Great Modelo especial beer!!! Free sunbeds!. Another day at Blue Parrot. 50 peso's per sunbed with a towel provided. A beer was 350 peso's or a bucket of 5 beers (dos equis) for 100 peso's. That's a good deal. Always ask the price before sitting down. Cozumel. Snorkel Adventure tours. Excellent. Good shopping. Didn't get chance to go around the island so can't comment. Well worth a trip over though. Ferry costs 144 peso's each way. You don't have to go far to experience Mexico on a tourist level. Take the bus or Taxi. Go into Playa. Have walk around and soak up that holiday atmpsphere. Take a trip to Cozumel if you fancy but please don't come home having not done any of this. That would just be wrong. In summary: Our experience was 100% positive. From start to finish in every detail. You won't be disappointed unless something happens that you can't legislate for. The best advice i can give..... Treat others as you you would like to be treat yourself. It will come back to you. Be gracious and be humble. Learn a bit of the lingo. It goes a long way. Go with the right attitude and your expectations will be exceeded. Ours was. Thanks for reading this somewhat lenghty review. I hope this is helpful. Big, Big thankyou to all the staff at the Princess. You guys work tirelessly and are the most polite and pleasent race we've ever come across. Mucho Mucho Gracias. Hasta Luego Senior's..........Now for my top tips..... Reports of theft from hotel safe's..... I can see how it could happen. We didn't experience it personally but we met a couple of ladies from England on the way back to the airport who had a small amount of USD's ($50) taken from their safe. This is definately something the management should address. To say the staff are all theives is going a bit far. It would appear a small minority are giving this hotel bad reviews in this area which is a real shame. Put valuables in your suitcase and Lock your suitcase. We withdrew 3000 peso's at a time from the ATM and split it between me and my girlfriend and carried it with us. We didn't leave cash in the safe as we'd read the reviews on this problem. Speak to front desk if you have concerns. Report anything suspicious. We didn't have a problem but i guess it could happen? Take and spend peso's. Hold on to you small change for tips. However change is available at front desk or behind the bars Money. Withdraw cash from the ATM at the Scotiabank in playa. The hotel ATM offers a poor rate. Hotel ATM = 17 peso's for \u00a31. Scotiabank = 21 peso's for \u00a31 Bug spray and repellent. Take it, use it. Learn simple Spanish. Hello, goodbye. please, thankyou, how are you. Try to learn at least one new word every day. The locals are only too happy to help and they appreciate the effort. Get involved if you want to meet people. Water polo is the way forwards no matter what age you are. Sun screen. If you can find it at home buy the brand Reiman ''P10'' or ''P20''. Google it. Buy it, use it. It's the best out there. Water / sweat resistant once a day lotion. We used it once a day, every day and never burnt once!! (trust me on that one) ... Speak to reservations staff for bus and restaurants and find out what time you need to be there to reserve. If it's important to you to get what you want, when you want it. Be patient. Be friendly. Book trips in Playa Del Carmen. It's half the price. Shop on 30th Avenue. One block from ferry terminal away from the shore. It's at least half the price. Ask 'how much?' Before getting in a cab. Fix a price before your journey. Haggle if neccessary. Ask for 'specials' at beach bars and restaurants etc. Be nice to everyone you meet. Especially the staff. They are there to serve you. Not your servants. Take everything in your stride. Be positiove, stay positive. Don't be a diva or a stress head. You're on Vacation!!!! Spend time getting to know the complex. look for shortcuts. They are there. Try to take differnt routes. Be adventurous. We found one 3 days before leaving. It halved our walk to central plaza. If there's one tip worth taking this is it.......Don't overload your plate at the Buffets. STICK TO A THEME A DAY IF POSSIBLE. If not you will wear your taste buds out and go off your food. (i know from experience) Now that would be a shame. I imagine the negative comments about the buffet being 'samey' are from those who have piled their plates high and blown their appetite. Would you put meat / fish / burgers / nacho's and cream cake on the same plate at home? (i hope not!-lol). At the central plaza bar the restrooms are shared with the buffet's. To avoid a wait at the bar during busy times, take your glass with you, go thru the restroom entrance then into the buffet. Self serve beer, wine and soda's. Fill your boots!!! (crafty eh??) Tip where appropriate, Not cos you have to but because you want to show your appreciation for good service. Get up and head down the beach for sunrise. One of the highlight's of our vacation. Take your camera!! Enjoy and cherish every minute of your vacation, Go with the flo, roll with the punches, leave the rat race at home.!!!!!!!

Arrival: We arrived late evening. We were second in a fairly long line of 20 couples checking in, with only 1 desk clerk attending. Check-in was short and sweet, no cocktails. Luggage was sent to the room for us and we were instructed to take trolley to room. Sports bar only food service open for late arrivals (nachos, club sandwich, hamburgers). Room: We had booked junior suite but discovered we had been upgraded to junior suite deluxe (includes jacuzzi tub in bathroom, which we enjoyed). Patio door lock didn't lock and our room opened to an adjoining, vacant room. We returned to front desk for assistance, and doors were immediately fixed. Room was very clean, very comfortable bed, stocked fridge, working safe, lots of hot water, soundproof. We loved our room and had no problem with theft. We were on 2nd floor of 6000 block closest to beach on Riviera side. Restaurants and Bars: We ate primarily at 2 buffets closer to beach for breakfast and lunch. Nice views of pools and foilage, mimosas every morning to start your day. Food selection good, something for everyone. Lots of fresh fruit, vegetables and wonderful ice cream at all buffets. Great capuccinos available at coffee bars (attached to swim-up bars). Outdoor barbecque located next to pool on way to beach was very popular if you were still hungry in late afternoon. Dinner buffets offered immense variety. We love seafood so we were always happy. Wonderful desserts everyday. We ate at Miso (Asian restaurant), food is grilled in front of 10 guests at a a time. Delicious, including starter suishi. Mexican was similar to what is available on buffet. Swiss is just cheese fondue with cooked meat, chicken or shrimp ending with a yummy chocolate fondue. Spanish Tapis restaurant was our favourite meal, wonderful presentation, and flamenco dancers while you eat. This resort has numerous bars, so you will never be lacking a drink. Beach service is provided if you don't want to walk to beach bar. Swim up bars, lobby bars, specialty coffee stations outside buffets after dinner. Sports bar is 24 hours. Good pre-mixed drink selection always at the ready and all bartenders were quick and experienced. Beach/Pools/Grounds: Pools all salt water, numerous, pools at every turn, always a lounge to be found. Some pools do not have a ladder to enter, just a shallow end. Beach is beautiful, water clean, sand white; however, there are intermittent rocks in water, so stick to area where most people are. Recommend pool shoes. The Princess has one of the best beaches compared to some neighbouring hotels. Last comment on the beach would be that it is crowded. Lounges are literally touching each other, and there are hundreds. For peace recommend going to end near wedding gazebo. Best spot. Grounds are simply beautiful. Many paths to walk and stroll, spectacular lobbies (this hotel is actual twin hotels, with the Sunset on one side and it's mirror image the Riviera on the other side), foilage, trees, pools. Our room was closest to the beach so it was a 10 minute walk to lobby which we enjoyed simply for the beauty . Trolleys run throughout the resort 24 hours should you not wish to walk. 2 Notes of Caution:, marble floors very slippy when it rains. We saw many guests bandaged up, and I had several close calls. Secondly, at 5:30 each evening an employee on a very noisy yellow ATV drives around resort and sprays insecticide in great abundance, including guests walking and those on trolleys. Stick to the middle path if you are walking at this time. Lots of palapas on the beach, and similar structures near lobby over water. Wonderful place to sit in evening with a drink and relax. There are no signs at this resort labelling the theatre room, disco or restaurants. This makes if difficult when searching for the restaurant you made reservations at. Signage would help, especially with theatre, which is tricky to get up to on second floor. Activities: Nightly animation shows in room upstairs overlooking exterior courtyard between two lobbies. Room was supercooled to the point of being uncomfortable as were many restaurants, bring sweater. We enjoyed live music after dinner in outdoor courtyard bars (between 2 buffet restaurants). Market square was set up one evening for souvenir hunters, as well as fire show and acrobatics. Disco starts at 11 and is very loud. It is located on Riviera side, downstairs. Activities by main pool and beach include salsa lessons, stretching, yoga, volleyball, horseshoes. You can do as little or as much as you want, enjoy. Service: We always tipped. On the whole service was good, but it seemed to be hit or miss at times. And the restaurants seem to have an issue with sitting you in high-traffic areas or next to the bussing station rather than overlooking the pretty pool. We had to speak up and ask to be seated in a different area of restaurant many times. Pool boy circulating with sunscreen and sunglass cleaning is nice touch. Departure: Check-out is at noon, and they do mean noon, as your card will no longer work in the door. Locked Luggage room is provided at reception and courtesy showers for guests that have had to vacate their rooms. Other comments: Would not recommend to anyone with mobility issues, although resort is equipped throughout for wheelchairs, with elevators and ramps, may be too much walking for an elderly person. We completely enjoyed our week, not alot of kids at this resort the first week of February, so we liked that considering we had left ours at home.

First of all, the wedding planners Patty and Sandra are amazing. I would highly recommend getting married in this resort or just go there for some R&R. As for the wedding, the resort is very accommodating. The gazebo on the beach is gorgeous and the flower arrangements and chairs beautiful. They are very well organized. Dinner reception is more of a simple affair with a semi-private area. Nonetheless, the service was impeccable. The resort itself is immaculate. Most of our family and friends stayed in the Platinum suites. This is well worth the money for the upgrade. The private pool area, the room service and all the extra amenities are great. There are 2 jacuzzis in the Platinum suites...one in the bathroom and one on the balcony. FYI- there are very few Platinum rooms with ocean views so if you want to reserve those, they cost extra. My husband and I got upgraded and we stayed in one of the Villas. It's adult only and is perfect for couples who need a little quiet time. Beware the open shower. Keep the doors close whenever possible. Otherwise the mosquitos will come into the room and surprise you. They are thirsty. We also have friends who stay in the Junior Suites as well as Junior Deluxe Suites...all say that their rooms are beautiful. So you can't go wrong. The resort is very large so prepared to walk. There are many pools and private seating areas to suit those who want to party or relax with some privacy. The only thing that the resort can do better is the food. There are many restaurants and selections. You will never starve and there are always things you can eat but while we were there we found that the food (especially the fish and the soup) too salty. If it was not for the food factor, I would rate this a 5 star resort. As for the theft factor/reviews, we were a bit apprehensive. However we advised all our guests to do due dilgence such as 1) leave valuables at home 2) always use the safe and ensure that it's securely locked...and we are happy to say that everything was accounted for.

We flew in last night from the Princess where we spent a week on the Riviera side. There really is no difference between the Riviera Princess and the Sunset princess. They divide the property in two, Sunset and Riviera. You can use either or side during your stay. The first bad review I was reading was that the property was huge and took 20 minutes to walk to the beach...that's a bit of a stretch. Yes the property is huge but with that comes lots of perks. The walk is about 10 minutes from end to end...if you are too exhausted to do that there is a shuttle to take you to the beach, we never took it because the walk was beautiful! The grounds are impectable! The grounds staff was always perfecting the lush property, and cleaning the pool. You will never see a piece of litter or a cigarette butt on the grounds. Along your walk to the beach there are numerous bars and I think 8 pools...a lot of them interconnect which was really cool. Some rooms had swim up entrances. The beach is lovely. We walked an hour in either direction to see what near by hotels and beaches were like. I have to say the Princess had the nicest beach. A lot of the other hotels near by had coral reef everywhere and lots of rocks. You wouldnt really be able to swim in those parts. The beach at the princess did have some rocks the first couple feet in the water but after that is was smooth. It was very shallow and you could walk out quite a distance and you were only up to your waist. The food and drinks at the hotel were quite good. I am definetly a foodie and was worried that the food would be terrible as it sometimes is in the carribean. The buffets were good, always lots of variety. Breakfast was great, omelete station, fresh breads, french toast, nice fluffy pancakes, tons of fresh fruit, nice crispy bacon, and a variety of sausage, then lots of mexican cuisine. One night the dinner buffet did and asian theme and had lots of sushi which was nice, broke it up. If you can book at the a la carte restaurants then I suggest you do, they were quite good. We ate at the mexican (good), \"Miso\" the asian (awesome), and the seafood, \"Los Olas\" (ok, service a bit slow). Unfortunately we didnt get to try the others because we were out doing excursions and did a night in Playa Del Carmen. If you go into Playa Del Carmen for dinner and want a really awesome Mexican restaurant...try La Parilla. Order the guacomole and the Sesame Chicken fajitas, Delicious! At the hotel they make delicious drinks and have premium booze. The mojitos were better that the ones they make in cuba, not too sweet, not too sour. We had a junior suite (standard room), it was very nice. It was spacious and done up with modern fixtures. The bathroom was very cool and had a very large shower with extra large shower head. Everyday the house keeping staff restocked the ammenities, insect replellent wipes, shower cap, soap, shampoo/shower gel, bar fridge. The tv had lots of american tv channels. The entertainment at the hotel was fabulous. The nightly shows in the market at 8:30 pm were great, flame throwers, acrobats, cirque de solei style dancers, mariachi bands, and then the shows in the theatre at 9:30 pm were very well done. Very professional style shows, not the cheesy type you'd expect. Every night there was a female singer and her partner who played guitar at the bar inbetween the two buffet restaurants, they were fantastic. They really got the crowd off their seats, every night was a big dance party. We checked out the disco a couple nights...it was pretty good. The dj played all the current music.

I am not the type of person who would typically write a personal opinion/review, but I felt compelled to advise fellow travellers of my experince with this property. For me I would only give this property a 3.5 star rating. We were 4 middle-aged guys on a winter golf getaway. We booked 2 upgraded Platinum suite rooms for which you are suppose to receive additional services, such as a complimentary massage, premium liquors etc. This was not the case. I was told that there were no times available for my massage. There were times available next week, the staff knowing that your vacation is over and you have gone home. The shuttle service from the Platinum building to the main building is almost 1 kilometer away. The shuttle service stops at 11pm, so if your at the main building, you end up having to walk back, and it is a hike. I have never experinced a hotel that stops it,s shuttle service when most of the bars are still open. The specialty restaurants were not impressive at all! In fact they were half empty all the time, when we were told that they were fully booked. Most of the food was sub-standard and even served cold at certain restaurants. I have read quite a few of these posted reviews and there is a lot of positives stated by previous guests of this property. The reason being is that they had not experinced what incident occurred with myself and one of my freinds who was residing in the next room to ours, that being an invasion of your privacey. From my understanding, there is an ongoing common problem that exists at this hotel. \"THE STAFF ARE THEIVES\" I had my Camera stollen from the room as well as my freind had his I-Pod stollen from his room. Another quest had $160 taken out his pants that were hung up in the closet area. Reports were filled out by myself as a courtesy , but that is all the concierge did for us. Not once did they follow up with me or my friend to forward any update. I found that the staff would say anything just to make like they were really trying to help, but it is all a game with them. They really don't care about your or your enjoyment. All they want in your dollar. I found the waiters and restuarant staff really delivered sub-standard service. I could go on about the service, but why waste my time. I learned a valuable lesson here. I will never book a Princess Property again, and probably never visit the Mayan Riviera area again.

We love this resort so much that this was our second stay, once for our Honeymoon in May of 2008 and this time 02/01/10 - 02/05/10, and we're actually in the process of planning our family reunion in May of 2011. Each time we've stayed in a Junior Deluxe Suite with pool access. Definitely worth the money , but only if you are on the Riviera side (where all the sun is). We tried to upgrade this time but the resort was overbooked and platinum was unavailable. Resort is definitely a 5 star! Super clean, very well landscaped & maintained. Staff is amazing! Especially Felix at the party pool bar & Mario at the pottery cart. Leave a $5 bill in the fridge with a note stating what you want & it'll be there! We left money under our pillow for the maid to make pillow animals but she didn't :( however the room was always clean! Bring lysol for your sheets, they can be a little musty. As for the sewer smell from the bathroom, simply plug the tub and run a couple inches of water in it & leave it. Also, run the shower if the smell comes back. It will go right away. To help with the bathroom flooding,take one of the hand towels and wrap it around the corner of the shower/toilet and it will help to slow the water from leaking out of the shower. Be ready to walk at this resort because it is quite large and still expanding. No fear, the construction isn't loud or in the way. All these negative complaints are rediculous, I am very picky, and yes I'll admit it, hard to please. But this resort is so amazing that I feel like royalty here. The night life isn't for young adults that want to party hard. This is definitely for more of the family or romance travelers. However the resort is working with a couple of bars in Playa del Carmen and offers a bar hopping package, which we didn't attend. Although I did hear rave reviews, especially about Coco. Never had a problem with theft, we did not use the safe. We put all of our valuables into one of our pieces of luggage and put a lock on it. As for excursions, we went through our transfer company, Lomas Travel. We did the Alltournatives Mayan Adventure (which I absolutely recommend) it had everything in 1 & a snorkle Mayan adventure. Please, feel free to message me I would love to share my experiences or calm your fears! If you're thinking about this resort, do it! I promise you it will be the most amazing vacation you've ever taken!", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cA solid 4 1/2 star\u201d", "Author": "Jim19Ontario", "ReviewID": "UR55217221", "Content": "Like several other recent reviewers, we were a little concerned - usually you can read between the lines on bad reviews and can tell whether the reviewer is being too uptight - in this case, you could see that some people had legitimate issues.

Of 18 trips, 14 have been to all inclusives in Mexico,Cuba, and the D.R. From 3 star to 4-1/2. This place was rated 5 and I believe it was worth it. We bought a last minute sell-off for less than half of the regular rate. Although that made it an excellent value, it did not change my objectivity. The rooms were large, clean, and not musty. Plenty of hot water, no plumbing problems and no rusty fixtures. Bathroom always stocked with towels and incidentals: shampoo, tissues, combs, etc. They checked with us every day to see if we needed anything extra. There were 4 buffets, although one was closed, 7 a la cartes, 10 bars, and 12 pools, and more lounge chairs than I have ever seen. I am a picky eater practically living on salads at some resorts. No problem here. Three meals daily and enjoyed every one. Plenty of variety and options. Buffet food sometimes is not real hot or fresh, but hell that happens here in Canada too. Fruit was always fresh and tasty. Good ice cream. Even the coffee wan't too bad. People who complain about weak drinks should go there. Premium brands like Absolue and Bacardi, and anything you want from shots of tequila to martinis. Even doubles if you ask. The resort was super clean and the best maintained resort I've seen. The service was unbeleivable. Excellent!. Sure, sometimes you need to wait a few minutes for a waiter or a bell-boy. but when they serve you they are always friendly and accomodating. People who complain about service at this resort must not have been to the same one I'm talking about. There are things I would change, things I didn't like, but that's me, not the resort.

My mother in law was sick my sister was sick and I was sick, all with gastro issues. My brother in law got a very bad ear infection while we were there which he is still on medication for. To top all that off my 4 year old daughter became very ill a week after our return. In the hospital where she has been for the past 2 weeks the infectious disease specialist is \"quite certain that we picked this bug up on our trip\". Also when we tried to let the concierge know that our kids were sick the first time, he was sympethetic but said no one else had reported any gastro illnesses. My mother inlaw spoke with him also with out letting him know we were refering to the same children and he said the same thing\" sorry madam but no one eslse has any complaints.\" By the pool we met two other families with sick kids at night just like us. My kids also recieved the H1N1 shot befor we went to Mexico. I know that this could happen any where to anyone, but it happened to us, alot of us. We are still trying to recover from our \"vacation\". So I would not recommend this hotel to any one, which breaks my heart because the employees are so friendly, helpful and hard working.

But I have very little negative things to say about this place. Check in: There were only 4 of us on the bus ride over so check in was super quick. We arrived around noon and our room wasn\u2019t ready until 3, which was kind of upsetting but we thankfully packed shorts and swimming gear in our carry on. There is a separate check in for Laguna Suites and Platinum. Also, for check out, the concierge in Platinum can print your boarding pass off 24 hours in advance of your departure. DO THIS! Saves so much time at the airport. Cleanliness: This resort is so clean and well manicured daily that I can\u2019t believe anyone would complain about the cleanliness. There was one day (out of 12) where our room hadn\u2019t been made by 3pm, and usually it was made before 11am. The entire grounds are spectacular. Not much more to say about that. Rooms: Our room was on the second floor and we had a partial ocean view. The rooms were spacious and the housekeeping did a great job for the most part. If you don\u2019t tip them, don\u2019t expect anything spectacular. The days we tipped we had towel art and a fully stocked mini bar \u2026 and the days we forgot the bed was made but they seemed to do a less thorough job in the bathroom. Cash is king down there and this is something I\u2019ve noticed in all the resorts we have traveled to. The only negative about the rooms is there was an awful smell coming from the toilets around the entire resort, and in our room. We believe it is caused by the septic system but some days (when we didn\u2019t tip and the maid didn\u2019t put cleaner or bleach in the toilet) it was unbearable. We ended up dousing the head of one of our towel art creatures in perfume and keeping it on the toilet tank. Seemed to do the trick! Food & Restaurants: Don\u2019t waste time at the Grill. It was awful! Our favourites were Mama Mia (Italian\u2026 we ate here twice), La Fondue, Tapas (Spanish restaurant with Flamenco dancers and a Spanish guitar player) and Miso (Japanese). The service was pretty good all around. If you\u2019re nice to them, they will be nice to you. The buffets weren\u2019t awesome\u2026 we only ate dinner in the buffet once and it was average. It annoyed me that they didn\u2019t serve any Mexican food at all! The a la carte Mexican restaurant was bland too. We ate breakfast and lunch in the buffet closest to the Platinum lounge every day, and they mainly had the same selection. We loved the omelets guy! A piece of advice is to be creative with your sauces and what you put in to your food. Remember you can pretty much get them to cook up whatever you want. They have a grill located at the main pool area that serves chicken burgers, hamburgers, hot dogs and chicken wings daily. It was fabulous! The line gets a bit long around noon but for the most part it\u2019s a quick line. We had the opportunity to eat at Thai Beach which is a restaurant on the resort not included in the all inclusive. However, staying in Platinum gave us one free dinner there. The curried vegetable pasta was AMAZING! I highly recommend. Bars: We made sure the bartenders at our favourite spots knew our names and we tipped well. We never had a problem with service. I know a lot of people go to all inclusive resorts and feel like they don\u2019t have to tip because it\u2019s \u201call included\u201d\u2026 but let me tell you something. These workers have tips factored in to their wages, whether they make them or not. So tip your servers! The disco was empty and they didn\u2019t really play a great selection of music. Sports bar was an okay place to hang out (they have pool tables and foosball). We mostly hung out around the main courtyard. If you want a bar experience, go to Coco Bongos or Carlos and Charlies in Playa Del Carmen. Beach: it\u2019s rocky in the ocean so be careful! They did a great job keeping the sand clean. There was an awful smell on the beach the whole time we were there\u2026 I believe it\u2019s caused from rotting seaweed due to the winds and poor weather they were having. Platinum and Laguna Suite guests have their own roped off area on the beach, where you can get clean towels and full drink service. Entertainment: Piano bar was awesome but not clearly advertised. It is located beside the Tapas restaurant. The main courtyard has a live band and a dance floor and they too were very talented. The shows in the theatre, in my opinion, were weak. When we went to the Barcelo in Mexico they had professional performers doing broadway musicals (singing AND playing AND dancing) and this resort had people dancing and lip syncing to pre recorded music. Most of the shows were boring for us. We only ended up going to 3 shows before calling it quits. BEWARE: Theft is a huge concern on this resort. They take a little bit each day, so I\u2019ve heard from several travelers in our area who were victim to it. They will rummage through your belongings too so be smart. I\u2019ve had several of my friends tell me after I came back that they themselves stayed at this resort and had been robbed, or people they knew were robbed on this resort. They will not reimburse you and all the contacts they provide you with to get reimbursed do not respond to your calls or emails. My advice is to find a unique hiding spot \u2013 which you may contact me privately for some suggestions. It sucks that you can\u2019t rely on a safe these days! We had several staff enter our room unannounced and it was very suspicious. We spent most of the afternoon on our balcony and realized that too many people have access to your room. We made sure to take (and repeat) the names of anyone who entered so they would know we knew exactly who they are and what area they worked in. We felt it would be a crime deterrent. It did bother me that we had to take such drastic measures here. Language barrier was a bit of a problem. A lot of the staff do not speak or understand English. I suggest printing off a \u2018cheat sheet\u2019 on the net for Spanish words and try and make the effort to communicate with them. We\u2019re in their country after all! Overall we felt this resort was a great, relaxing getaway from the winter blues. For the price, I have been to much better resorts in this area and probably wouldn't come back to this one.

We experienced some truly quality time, met some fun people and enjoyed certain aspects of the resort, for sure. We have vacationed quite a bit and have a lot to compare to which brings some validity to this review ( 10 different resorts in Mexico alone). I have never written a review on a resort before and after our stay at the Princess, I am ashamed that I have not sang the praises of some of the resorts we have had the pleasure of being guests at. That said, I feel an obligation to share our experience so that the readers of this review can be informed and either choose another resort to spend their precious time and hard earned vacation money at or go knowing what to expect. I will try to include both positive and not so positive aspects for you to help you discern for yourself if this resort is a good vacation choice. CHECK IN: We have most always had impressive welcomes, this one was by far the most disappointing. Some of you may not find this important but it tends to set the mood for the start of our vacations and makes the experience memorable. We were given a watered down lemonade \"welcome\" drink with little enthusiasm. The check in was a bit confused as it sometimes can be. They had our two rooms in separate buildings and we had requested side by side as one of our daughters was a minor. It took some time to sort out but eventually they rectified it for us. As we were waiting for things to be sorted out there were guests complaining about their stay at the front desk! (we came to understand why as our vacation unfolded) ROOMS: We stayed in a junior deluxe suite, the rooms that they sent us to were quite lovely, bathroom was spacious and the beds were super comfortable., the pillows were rock hard though. Our patio door (in both of the rooms, on the GROUND floor) DID NOT STAY LOCKED!!, with a little bit of a strong nudge it would just pop open!!!! We did not discover this until about the 4th day of our stay after we requested. We were supposed to get turn down service nightly, we had 4 nights out of our 14 night stay and towel art on the bed 1 day only. Our fridge was stocked regularly and we had plenty of water daily. The cleaning was hit and miss, the bed was made everyday, often with clean sheets but our sinks were often missed. We had an incident where one of our daughters were ill and we required clean linens at about 10:00 p.m, we called house keeping and they were very prompt and very friendly. Our room was centrally located and we found it easy to get to all areas of the resort and enjoyed the scenic walks. FOOD & RESTAURANTS: The buffets are very cafeteria styled, no Mexican feeling at all! We found the food in the buffets to be decent, not as good as some of our experiences and certainly not 5 star quality, but we enjoyed it. The food was not the Mexican experience I was hoping for, even the guacamole was bland but we certainly did not starve and there were many nummy choices :). For the first 4 days we were at the Princess, we could not get coffee or mimosas in the buffet (a vacation tradition for us...disappointing). For the remainder of the vacation, coffee was not available after breakfast in the buffet or any of the ala cartes (not even specialty coffees). As well, we could not order anything other than wine or beer in the buffets, cocktails were only served in the ala carte restaurants. We found that the food in the buffet was luke warm by the time we reached our table because all of the restaurants were extremely COLD!!!. It was FREEZING, especially the second week of our stay when the weather was not the nicest, they did not adjust the temperature inside the restaurants and social areas. We bought blankets from the shop in the lobby and wore them to dine, even the ala cartes...not even kidding! We related our concerns to the concierge and were brushed off. There were many guests that followed the lead and purchased blankets, others wore coats! With not even a coffee to warm up, we would often eat as quickly as possible and get out..... The restaurants decor was overall very unimaginative and not inviting. The service generally was the WORST we have ever experienced :(((. (PLEASE note that this statement is an overall rating and that there were a few sweet souls that made our day with their smiles, friendly demeanors and helpfulness!). In one of the ala cartes, we waited forever to get a waiter to out table and then even longer to get our food. To add insult to injury, we ordered drinks, had to remind our waiter a few times and then after about 30 minutes my husband left the restaurant, went to an outside bar, got drinks and carried them back to our table!!!! The staff made no comment and when we were ready for another drink, my husband made another trip....no apology, no attempt to serve us! IN CONTRAST, we dined at the fondue restaurant and although the food was not the greatest the service was amazing, we returned to this venue just to repeat the experience with our waiter:) No beach dinners available and no beach BBQ either With the Deluxe junior suite, you can book a ala carte every night if you wish, nice option SNACK BAR: There was one at one pool the pools that served fresh chicken breasts and hamburgers which were very good! The line ups were long though as this was the only snack bar serving all the pools. There were times during the day when food was not available except at the sports bar, so if you missed the scheduled buffet times, you were out of luck. the sports bar had terrible service, we waited in line for a hamburger and fries for about 20 minutes, waited another 15 or 20 to get it and then it was stone cold. On another occasion we ordered a grilled cheese and it was a pretty sad story, we left hungry. Not a big deal, just not worthy of a 5 star rating for sure. When the weather was unpleasant, people were looking for somewhere to go inside when the buffet was closed (the bar areas were all open air and very cold and you could not get any food in any of them), so they went to the sports bar. This little place probably accommodated 75-100 people max and there were well over a thousand guests! Lots of unhappy vacationers. NEW YEARS EVE GALA: A Wonderful, memorable experience! Everyone seemed to be eager to make this a great evening, the meal was elegant, service was exceptional and the champagne was plentiful:). BARS: Pretty good overall, not the best service again. The cappuccinos were amazing! We often had ours with a cream liqueur, Baileys was not available but whatever they substituted with was delicious all the same:). They carried good vodkas and other hard liquor, there was corona on tap and Modella in the rooms. The pool bars would usually make blended drinks that were very good, the lobby bar at the Sunset used the pre -made shush from the machine which is not nearly as appealing. We did not use the swim up bars but we did not hear anyone complain, so I assume they are good as well. There was a piano bar but we stopped several times and there was never anyone playing and it was too cold to stay for a drink. The disco had a good DJ GROUNDS: The Princess is a beautiful resort, the grounds are meticulous and the pools are numerous well kept. There are several quaint sitting areas just off of the lobby and we lounged in these often to have a nice drink or to play some cards. The vegetation is well groomed and will continue to be more beautiful as they mature. BEACH: The sand is very nice, but not well maintained. There were literally cigarette butts on every square foot of this beach,,,,disgusting! We were there when the resort was busy so maybe there were more beach chairs than normal but they were so spaced so close together that it was very uncomfortable and even difficult to move around them. Except in one isolated area, which was beautiful, the ocean was rocky going in. Many of the beaches in the Mayan have this, it didn't bother us much but the filthy water near the rocky areas did! It was murky and smelled foul. We heard people say that they thought it was sewer but my husband thought it was a result of the seaweed not being cleared in the mornings and there was rotting debris collecting there. This beach could be one of the prettiest if it was just cared for properly. ENTERTAINMENT: Pretty bad actually. There were a couple of shows that they put on in the courtyard that were not bad but we happened upon them by mistake. The resort does not do a good job of informing the guests about features. The theater was almost to cold to sit in, honestly I ached from being so cold! The chairs are comfortable and there is lots of leg room but it is not tiered seating so if you don't get a seat closer to the front, it is difficult to see much. Mostly lip-synced musicals with mediocre dancing. There was usually a live band in the evening in the courtyard bar and that was quite enjoyable. We only saw a Mariachi band a couple of times during the full 2 weeks, which was most unusual and when we did, they were strictly performers, nothing fun or personal. There was entertainment at the main pool, pretty lame in comparison to every other resort we have ever stayed at. SPA: We spent a day at the spa facility which we paid extra for, they displayed a fruit tray and a selection of juices. The fruit did not get replenished the entire day and lots of the jets were not working in the pool. The staff were very attentive with towels for the lounge chairs however and were replacing and straightening towels covering the chairs regularly . We did not book any spa services. We did not hear good things about the massages in the spa but people seemed very happy with the massages at the beach. INCIDENTALS: Most of the staff speaks poor English, shame on me for not speaking Spanish when visiting their country, but I do feel that some of the service related problems stem from that. *It certainly did not feel like we were in a Mexican resort, I left feeling like we really missed out * Not much to do, when we had rainy days, we left the resort and went into the bars at Playa just to experience the fun factor and get friendly service! *The resort played Christmas music up until three days before we left (Jan. 12th) . I love Christmas music but this was not ever upbeat and was extremely repetitive. When they changed it, they some Zen type of music, very boring!!!!! * for the entire 2 weeks the hand dryers did not work in any of the bathrooms outside of the main building...no towels either * We encountered many staff throughout that were just plain rude to us. We are honestly not arrogant travelers, we choose Mexico as often as we do because we love the Mexican people. All I can say is that I suspect the staff is not treated well at this resort because they are not happy and the behavior we encountered is really not characteristic. We even recognized a server that we knew from the Iberostar. We were so excited we ran over to give him a hug. He was happy to see us and he made our dining experience special but he was not his jovial self....it made me very sad. * I always look forward to the tropical floral arrangements in the lobby and throughout the resort....the arrangements look lovely in the photos but they are all PLASTIC! 5 star???? *Management truly does not care about your concerns and most attempts you make to be heard will be an exercise in futility. *I know some of this may be sounding picky but as isolated incidences they don't mean a lot, as a build up of disappointments, they negatively affected our stay. SECURITY: We felt that the grounds were paroled very well in the evening and we felt safe with our daughters. I saved this part for the last because I did not want it to get lost in this long review. We had MONEY STOLEN from the safes in both of our rooms!!!!! Please listen, we didn't when we read the reviews from travelers on this site. We thought that maybe it was an exaggeration, a mistake or a few isolated instances......not the case. We came back to our room on New Years Eve to find our safe wide open. We were disturbed by it but thought we would give the benefit of the doubt...maybe we were just excited about the gala and forgot to close it. A few days later, our clothing had been rummaged through, nothing missing. Our daughters came to us upset and said they were missing money from the safe. We checked ours and discovered that we were missing cash. We always take small bills for tipping and we had not touched the reserve in the safe yet as I had enough in my purse from arrival. We had not gone shopping or on any excursions yet, so the girls had not touched their cash either. We were both missing small bills, a person probably would not have even noticed normally. In total we lost $81.00 U.S. Not enough to fight to get back but the point of it needed to be raised with management. They came and did an investigation, going through our safe, checking codes with an electronic gadget...they said we would have the results in 24 hours. We had not heard in 2 days and we began to insist on speaking with someone......3 days later, after much insistence on our part, the concierge met with us and told us that their investigation had revealed no one accessed the safes but ourselves. We told him that we didn't care if we got the money back, it was not important to us but we did want the resort to acknowledge the fact that they have a problem and resolve the issue. We told him about the reviews we had read on Trip Adviser and about the numerous other guests we had met during our stay whom had been stolen from. Guests had clothing, sunglasses and jewelry taken from their rooms and jewelry & money missing from their safes... without sharing our experience, we probably had 7 different people relate their stories of theft to us. We said to the concierge that we knew they had heard other complaints and he said there was nothing they could do or were willing to do. Our daughters had a maintenance man enter their room unannounced while they were sleeping in one morning. No knock, he used his key and when he saw them in bed he left abruptly, he had no reason to be there. DISTURBING! The management was unconcerned and non-nonchalant about the issues. we were told that we could go into Playa to fill out a report with the police. we had already spent considerable time with the resort staff over issues that we did not want to waste any more of our vacation, so we did not pursue this. We spoke to our Sunwing representative on several occasions and let them know what was happening, again more wasted time! We begged to be transferred to another resort, but they charge full price to do it, no discounts at all! we would have wasted another full day. We took a cab and visited another resort in the area, purchased a day pass and enjoyed the incredible service and got a taste of what we were missing. They felt badly about the experience we were having and made sure we had fun! They were even willing to help us transfer but our daughter was not quite 18 and they had a strict adult policy. We appreciated their hospitality, it was a high light! We would return to Mexico again, our experiences are not what we have known to be typical, quite the contrary...... but we would never return to the Princess.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful property\u201d", "Author": "unotequilaporfavor", "ReviewID": "UR53941383", "Content": "GRP is a massive hotel, so plan on doing a lot of walking if you go.

The hotel does have shuttles running every 15 mins. around the property for those who find the walking too strenuos. We tried the French and Mexican a la cartes and enjoyed them. No complaints about the brekkie, lunch or supper buffets. My only suggestion to the hotel would be to provide alternative beer choices to the horrible Corona they had on tap, yuk!

Platinum upgrade - AWESOME!\u201d", "Author": "letmecount123", "ReviewID": "UR53906511", "Content": "My mother and I travelled to this resort from January 9-16. We stayed in the Platinum suites on the Riveria side and had a fabulous time!! Maybe I'm not a well travelled person, but everything was more than adequate for us. We arrived about an hour prior to check in, but the fellow at the front desk served us champagne and called down to see if our room was ready. Turns out the room was ready, so we left our bags to be shuttled down for us (as the platinum suites are the furthest away from the lobby) and then took a seperate shuttle ourselves down to the room. When we arrived at the room, everything was perfect except that the mini-bar had yet to be stocked. We popped over to the platinum lounge for a few drinks and met a few people... the server/bartender Miguel was hilarious! Ivan and Edgar were also great. :) They always remembered what we were drinking and called us by name once we informed him what they were. Anything we needed we could get from visiting or calling the concierge in the lounge as well. The free internet was also much appreciated and easily accessible. Sometimes there would be a few minute wait (only 4 computers) but never long. We only went to the supper buffet the first night, and the food was all right. We had been up since 5am that morning and had a long day, so the food kind of tasted mostly the same but it was probably just us. Also never made it to the lunch buffets... usually just snacked on nachos and sandwiches available in the platinum lounge. Breakfast buffet at Tortuga (closest to platinum suites and beach) was always good. Never much of a line for fresh made eggs or omelettes. Never a wait to be seated. Champagne and OJ, yum! Always offered coffee. There was another breakfast/lunch buffet directly across on the sunset side that we never made it to as well... not sure if a lot of people were aware of these buffets or not or if most went all the way up to the lobby to eat. Pools were immaculate. There were always people out skimming and cleaning. It was cooler when we were there, so didn't see a lot of people in them but did try a few out for myself and temperature was comfortable, especially on the warm days! Platinum pool was more of a quiet area with lots of padded loungers and shaded beds, so not much of a party area but very nice to relax and chat with friends we made down there. Beach was nice until you got in... could walk a long ways out without getting deep so couldn't really swim and it was definitely rocky... again, wouldn't have been a problem if it was deep enough to swim but with the waves it was hard to ever get a sure footing. We only went in once and then stuck more or less to the pools. The beach was very clean... servers always cleaning up cups/straws, etc. Most of the loungers were quite close together but we never had a problem finding a few chairs together away from others who were settled in. First time I've ever HAD service on the beach, so certainly won't complain about it. We took large go-cups (about 700mL) so we would take full drinks down with us and then order another every time the server went by. Cups never reached empty that way! Not as environmentally friendly as we would have liked as they still brought plastic cups with each trip, but we saw very very few people with re-usable cups in the first place. Can't comment on the night shows...never made it to any. A la cartes were all very good. Received very prompt and friendly service at all that we went to (La Fleur: thank you Ernesto! Very good! - Mexican: Good also! Thanks to Luis. - Seafood: Mostly good, but my fish was definitely cripsy and overdone :( . Only place we had semi-poor service was in the Fondue... and we came to conclude that poor Moises was probably just having a rough day. We didn't get in until 9 and it was getting late for them, I'm sure. The food was excellent though! One of the best was probably the Thai Beach. We received a complimentary dinner there with the platinum upgrade (not the full Thai menu, but a few still VERY GOOD options). My mother love love loved her steak and recommended it to everyone we talked to for the rest of the trip. The fish was also very good but don't eat the garnish! It tastes like pine needles, haha. The wine was excellent (white). The tequila was TOO plentiful though! We had to start giving our shots to the next table as the servers were far too generous! Very good experience right on the beach in the open air. Very likely worth the money if someone wanted to go but did not have the upgrade. As for bars: We did check out the lobby bar, sports bar, and the open air bar across from the theatre. Service could be scarce if it was busy, but never long of a wait unless there was a wedding party snuggled up to the bar itself. Only real complaint was smokers EVERYWHERE which is no fault of the hotel... Not entirely sure why it's necessary to chainsmoke your entire vacation... had to find a new location a few times due to inability to breathe in certain places. Would have been nice if there were a few more 24 hour bars besides the sports bar (which was enclosed) and if they had been closer to the beach side, but oh well...we got lots of rest that way! I honestly have no idea what people are complaining about the service... we had excellent service the whole time (except for the Fondue experience, of course). We called the concierge to have our bags picked up upon departure and they were waiting for us at the front while we had a few more drinks. I don't know if I said it enough, but the platinum upgrade was VERY VERY worth it. We had 4-5 bottles of liquor in the room which when tucked into a suitcase would magically re-appear! We didn't bother buying any duty free because we just took home what was left in the room. There was no need to worry about beach towels... available freely at the platinum lounge, pool, and beach area. As many as you needed!! No towel card! Free 24 room service! Yes, the eggs were a bit cold when they arrived but considering they are coming from the lobby to the complete other side of the resort it was till a great option if you wanted a slow start to the day with coffee in the room. Burgers and fries and 2 am! yum! Free 30 minute massage at the spa... also very good! Very nice ambiance in there for sure! Rooms were always clean. Turn down service was a nice touch, but I guess a bit uneccessary... I was a little bit nervous about all the people going in and out of the room all day (housekeeping, mini bar, turn down, etc.) but we never had anything stolen or out of place. We unfortunately weren't very good tippers to the housekeepers as we kept running out of smalls bills, but they still came every day and turn down service was only missed once or twice. It was a bit of a walk from the lobby to the platinum suites... if your room was anywhere along the way it certainly wouldn't have been as far! It certainly wasn't uncomfortable or too long though... I'm sure I would have put on 10lb without the quick jaunt! Besides, the grounds were GORGEOUS! Very immaculately kept. not so much as a stray cigarette butt! For those that really don't want to walk, there IS a shuttle from one side to the other but it's not much faster (electric golf carts = LESS NOISY for those with rooms on the path). I realize this is getting a bit long, but I really wanted to describe my full experience as I'm having trouble seeing how all these other reviewers were having so many problems...

We are always thankful for the opportunity to get away and always focus on the positive experiences rather than the negative. Also, I believe when you travel outside the country you must understand that the standards are much different than in the U.S. WITH THAT SAID, THIS PLACE IS RIDICULOUS. I'm not going to go into long explanations but I will give highlights. Service was rude and lacking. Evening meals outside of buffet require reservation which you must stand in line for hours to acquire. Even with standing in line, we only received one reservation for the whole week. The other four nights we had to eat at the buffet because the restaurants only seat 20-30 people per night because they did not have enough staff to support larger capacity. My husband discussed this with the property manager and was told \"TOO BAD\". While the resort really is gorgeous, THE ROOM WAS FILTHY. Had to request maid service twice to clean a dirty bathtub when we arrived. First time I've ever gone to Mexico and couldn't eat mexican food. The only mexican food available was at a single restaurant which of course was booked. No mexican food on the buffet other than nacho cheese. If you decide to visit this resort, make sure you get a room in the middle because it is a mile hike from the beach to the front desk/bars/restaurants/large portion of rooms. All service areas were understaffed. Items stolen from our SAFE in the room. Beach was pretty but rocky once you are in the water. Entertainment was actually pretty good in the evenings. We saw firedancers and native presentations. It was actually pretty cool. Of course, the only reason we found it was because we heard the beating of the drums. Couldn't find postings or flyers of daily activities. Never found the snorkel shop. Oh well. Pools were very nice and appeared clean. Bars were very cool once you waited for a bartender to make your drink. Order two at a time. With all that said, I guess we should be thankful we checked out ALIVE. On a ride to the beach on one of the carts we crashed into a maintenance cart at full speed!!!! It went from full speed to dead stop instantly and almost flipped. SERIOUSLY, I'M NOT KIDDING. There were several other people on the cart and thankfully no one was injured but we were all very fortunate. WE NEVER RECEIVED A SINGLE CALL TO OUR ROOM TO MAKE SURE WE WERE OKAY OR AN APOLOGY FROM ANY EMPLOYEE MUCH LESS MANAGER OF THE RESORT.

This resort is beautiful and grand. We actually booked the sunset, but were put in the riviera side. It is one resort, sharing common a la carte & buffet restaurants; water sports; beach lounges and all other services. They do have their own lobbys and buffet restaurants, but you can eat and use either side. We stayed in the Platinum suites which was great, we had extras such as a jacuzzi on the balcony, access to all a la cartes including one dinner at the Thai Beach Club restaurant. Making reservations was very easy with the concierge in the platinum lounge. We did not have to account for a beach towel, they were plentiful just for the taking in the platinum lounge and you didn't have to return them, you just left them on your lounge. Platinum guests had free 24 hour room service included and free internet. The bar in the platinum lounge also had premium alcohol for eg. Tanqueray Gin and Grand Marnier. In the a la carte restaurants the Grand Marnier they served was from Mexico and was more like Triple Sec. We had 7 great a la carte dinners, unfortunately there is no a la carte place for breakfast or lunch. The buffet we went to for breakfast and lunch was never really crowded and the drink service was pretty good. The buffet food was good and tons of options, great salad makings, lots of fruits and hot dishes and a pasta station. The only drawback was that the only option at the grill station was a hamburger or hotdog. Unfortunately the red wine was on tap and terrible, even at the platinum lounge. The odd time the lobby bar had bottled wine and it was not bad, but not good either. The white wine was not much better and the dry sparkling wine was inferior, even if a new bottle was opened it was not far off of being flat. I should say that we are not wine conosieurs and have never been to a resort where the wine was so bad. (THIS WAS REALLY THE ONLY COMPLAINT THAT WE HAD & IS THE ONLY REASON WE WOULD NOT RETURN TO THIS RESORT) It was a dissapointment that we could have a fantastic italian dinner and could enjoy a glass of wine with it. The grounds was immaculate and beautiful. We never made it to the night entertainment, so I can't comment. The beach was quite nice and drink service on the beach was a nice touch. You get drink service regardless of your accomodation. This resort had a very nice spa, which we spent a day at because the weather was cool and rainy. The cost for spending a day in the spa which included a hot tub, sauna, steamroom and great pool with all kinds of hydrotherapy jets was $22.00 USD per person per day. We have stayed at other resorts on the Mayan where the spa was included, but apparently this spa is not owned by the hotel, hence the fee. In summation, this is a nice resort & if you are not a wine drinker then I would recommend it. It is good value for your money.

CHECK-IN The people at the front desk were not very friendly, but I've found at most all-inclusives they aren't anyway. - pretty standard. It was our honeymoon and they had a special deal we booked, that was free on condition of showing our marriage certificate. They didn't care whatsoever about that at all. Didn't upgrade us, and to boot gave us a room with 2 double beds on our first night of our honeymoon! WTF!? - anyway we went back to have them exchange that and the same guy at the front desk said come back tomorrow and check because they were full - again standard from my experiences. The next day they did accomidate us with a rooom with a king bed, but again nothing special for the honeymoon. The gentleman was not pleased about helping us, I didn't not like him, nor did he like us. ROOM Despit our complications the first night, the rooms were absolutley gorgeous! I've stayed at 2 other all-inclusives in Mexico, and this was by far the nicest room I've stayed in. The bathrooms were HUGE and gorgeous! (thinking about it now, we may have had an upgrade because I'm not sure everyone's bathroom was the same) we had a huge jacuzzi tub that opend up to the whole room, a glass shower, two sinks and a seperate door for the toilette. Anyway I remember we had a minor flaw, something like the TV remote not working, but it obviously wasn't a big deal if I don't remember exactly what it was. GROUNDS Again, beautiful! The only thing I would say is that, I think this hotel is WAY too big. I usually really like bigger resorts, because I like to walk, and that way you work off all the food you ate that week, and don't end up gaining much weight, or nothing at all. But I found this resort to be just rediculously huge. Not a big deal with the trains that charter you around, but it was sometimes hard to get on one, that wasn't full... or if they were around.. all though we made friends with Alberto, who is one of the drivers, he was great! POOLS I remember that there didn't seem to be a lot of options the days we were at the pool (it unfortunatley rained most of the time we were there..probably 4/5 out of the 7 days we were there.) the one pool was full with a wedding goup, that were obviously drunk...(not a big deal, my husband and I are 23, and like to party too) but they were just obnoxious! and it got to the point where they didn't care anyone else was there, and I was ready to punch someone out....and I'm much of a lady if I do say so myself. BEACH We spent I think 1 or 2 days on the beach, when we didn't feel like being around the obnixious wedding party. We are mostly pool people. I love the beach but my husband wont swim in the ocean. It was gorgeous, like most beaches in Mexico! The water was warm but I remember seeing lots of jellyfish - seems to be like anywhere else though, just dont think about it. The sand seemed pretty clean too...easy to find chairs, no complaints there. BARS We had no problems getting drinks at the bars. I like pretty much like everything, but when I go away I really enjoy fruity blended drinks. This place I found inconsitent with they way drinks were made. I like fresh fruit, and some bartenders didn't like when I ask for it. Most of them were very nice. Also they served premium liquor and when I asked for a rum (white bacardi) and diet... they didn't like that either. - we never made it to the disco, I think it was too far from our room, and because it rained a lot, it was upsetting getting dressed up, to go out into the rain, and wash it all away. FOOD The food was average for mexico. I have had better, but by no means will you go starving. The pizza's were really good, and my husband was obsessed with the chicken nuggets and fresh bread. The Japenese resteraunt was my favourite. We had the grill in front of us, which is always entertaining. Way too much food prepared for the table though. I think there were heaps of left over's on everyone's plates. If you like sushi, I had some of the best sashimi in my life there. (you have to like raw fish) some people thought I was crazy! lol. Same standards with the buffets between breakfast and lunch and lunch and dinner.. you only have the snack bar to eat at which was one buffet by the pool (I think) and for sure the sports bar.. they only had hamburers hot dogs and sandwiches which were OK...but they had the best chips, salsa and guacamole!!! mmm sooo good!!!! TOURS We did go on a tour. It was a river safari tour and snorkel. We were bused about an hour out to cancun, (with pick ups at other locations) where you drove your own 2 person speed boat out to the biggest reef in mexico which was nice... not GREAT snorkeling... and definately wasn't \"real\" per say... the guides just sprinkle food all around you so the fish come by you, they are too scared otherwise and wont see much without that. It was an ok trip for the money, i think we paid $45/$50 a person, so it wasn't too bad - it was only a half day too so that was nice, you don't have to spend all day off your resort. I like doing culture things more like Tulum, and Cozumel, but I hate the traveling part. There's always a price to pay with site seeing though. - one other thing about our trip... when you get to the destination for snorkeling, it's out in the middle of the ocean. If your not in the water you stay in your boat. the water is VERY choppy and therefore can see some people getting sea sick very easily! - my husband doesn't like ocean's so he wasn't in the water much, luckily he does'nt get sea sick. SUMMARY Everything was prety good. A year and a half prior to this trip my then boyfriend purposed to me in Mexico and for our honeymoon I think we expected to capture that same moment, and feelings which we didn't really accomplish. I think the worst part was the weather. I have stayed at the Iberostar Playa Del Mar, and the Occidental Grand Xcaret (where we got engaged) and preferred both of those over the princess! I dont' want to say this hotel was bad because it was far from that, but compared to the other two resorts, I don't think I would recomend this one over them, so I'm going to say \"no, I would not reccomend this resort to a friend\" Hope this helped!

It takes about 7 minutes to walk from the lobby to the beach. The grounds and property to this hotel (actually there are two twin hotels) are well-maintained and clean. The staff was pleasant and polite. The beach is beautiful but you need to go out early and mark your lounge chairs with beach towels if you want to have a spot. There are no facilities (no restrooms, no restaurants/snack bars/eatery of any kind) on the beach. The beach bar (more like a shack) was deficient and people had to wait in long lines to get a drink. There\u2019s a small snack bar \u201cgrill\u201d located next to the pool closest to the beach on the Sunset side that could not meet the demand. Again, there was a long \"wait\" for service. My partner waited close to half an hour for burgers. Securing restaurant reservations each evening for dinner was arduous and time consuming. We had to pay extra to have dinner at \u201cLe Fleur\u201d and were very disappointed with the food and wine. We were served \u201cvino a la machina\u201d that is, wine on tap that was worse than the wine they served at the buffet restaurants. We were even more upset when we saw the deplorably short and overpriced wine list. The food was unimaginative and bland. We made a complaint in writing at the Concierge desk and asked repeatedly for someone from management to contact us but no one had the courtesy of acknowledging our complaint. The breakfast buffet was all right but then again you had to wait in line if you wanted eggs or an omelette. Getting a clean table was a bit of a challenge some mornings as the buffet restaurants were clearly understaffed. All in all, yes, the Grand Riviera Princess is beautiful and the staff is courteous and hard-working. However the hotel has to correct the waiting problem and hiring more people sounds like a good idea to make it work. Other constructive comments: I would recommend that they install a larger \u201cgrill\u201d, buy quality wine for guests that do not drink beer or hard liquor.

This resort was recommended by friends who have stayed at the Riviera Princess. American Express did a first-class job booking the trip for all of us, and the personnel at the resort made sure our every need was met. We went with the all-inclusive plan. The food is plentiful and tasty. Our experience at La Fleur was the only disappointment, but all the other eating experiences more than made up for it. The rooms are very large and clean. As with any resort near water, there is always a faint mustiness, which was fairly well-controlled at this resort. The housekeeping staff does a first-rate job. Our rooms were junior suites. There were no swim-up junior suites available when we checked in, but our second level balcony rooms overlooked the gorgeous pool - it just couldn't be any better. The picture with my review is the view from our balcony... We para-sailed, sailed the Hobie cats, beached and spent hours in the Mayan sun at the pool. The girls had spa manicures and pedicures which were pricey but nice. The swim-up bars were generally overly boisterous, but the lovely server who took care of our every wish poolside was quietly fabulous. The poolside grill was a fun way to have lunch other than the buffet, with grilled chicken, hamburgers and hotdogs. Roving photographers (just like the cruise lines) taking pictures and poolside dance classes were fun too. The music throughout the day was a bit loud and sometimes too lyrically graphic for kids, but hopefully they were listening to the beat and not the lyrics! We had a theft poolside where a beachbag and expensive pareo were taken. We reported it to the desk and they did not charge us for the Princess's beach towel which was also taken. It was unfortunate, but in no way reflects on the resort. People are people, unfortunately. I wanted to lose my passport so I could stay longer, but we left after 5 days feeling rested, pampered and relaxed. We will definitely come to Playa del Carmen again and again. We loved the area and the resort was the perfect blend of not too fancy, not too expensive and gave us memories to last a lifetime. To any traveller not used to Mexico, be careful at the Cancun Airport. Know where you are going (or look like you do) and don't let the representatives sell you or pressure you into anything on the way to your transportation. Make your arrangements at your resort!

Reading the reviews prior to my trip, I was a bit apprehensive but I am glad they did not make me change my mind. Bring: Mosquito repellent, you get some in the room but it\u2019s not enough. Trust me. Airline: Skyservice did not impress me whatsoever, the staff was pleasant but the food was not. Also our flight time was changed and thus delayed us half a day, which was upsetting. Rooms: I requested a room on the top floor with my agent and was extremely disappointed when the concierge had informed us that the agent did not add the request and we found ourselves on the bottom floor. The following day the concierge not only gave us a room on the top floor but also upgraded our room for our two-week stay. A la Carte restaurant: The servers was curious, helpful and very attentive to both my partner and me. The food was excellent in each and every a la carte restaurant, even the new Spanish one that we attended on its grand opening. Entertainment: Not a dull moment, be sure to see the fire show! Also if you are going to coco bongo BOOK WITH THE HOTEL (entrainment crew), the reason being is that the hotel offers free transportation for the same amount of money that your representative would offer. Tue. is ladies night (30 US) Reg. 50 Us. Dinks included. Go Sea-dooing off the resort it\u2019s cheaper, we went to Playa Del Carmen. THE BEACH: Rocky: yes, a bit pebbly. Smelly: Not a bit (perhaps the seaweed after a storm but otherwise it\u2019s cleared by the staff in no time). In all honesty, I think the beach depends on the weather. The first week there was plenty of seaweed in the water but a one-day storm cleared it up and the water was aqua blue and clear the next morning. Staff: Could not ask for better service. Everyone said hello to us, even the maintenance crew that did not speak English. There was only one bartender who was not pleasant and we just didn\u2019t go to him and I think he liked it that way. Everyone is entitled to be grumpy once in a while. (VIEW PIC!!!!!!!!!!!!) Just an Aside: The staff there was great but unfortunately, it is the handful of tourists that come to Mexico with their ignorance in one hand and their arrogance in the other.

We were at the resort from December 30th to January 6th and travelled with another couple. ** For the traveller looking for 5 star service as per United States/Canadian standards, pay the extra $$ and choose a 5 diamond resort, such as the Grand Velas** Check in was fairly quick when we arrived around 6:30 pm; there was a large family with many questions ahead of us, so the process was slowed. We were in the Platinum suites, so we were given a lovely glass of champagne to get off to a great start. Dulce was very sweet and friendly, tried to understand English and went over the map of the resort to help us get our bearings. Yes, there is a language barrier, but the staff will work with you to understand what you are asking for. Our luggage arrived at our room at almost the same time we arrived! The room was beautiful, clean and very spacious. While I definitely noticed a musty smell, I had packed a mini \"Glade Ultra\" and a few sprays quickly took care of that. In the shower stall, there is a soap tray, but there was not space for shampoo, so I kept the bottle on the floor. There is not a soap tray at the sinks either, but my husband turned one of the ashtrays over and that took care of that. The amenities included soaps, shampoo, mouthwash, shoe shine kit, sewing kit, shaving kit, dental kit, shower cap, bug spray wipes, kleenex tissues. There is a flat-screen television, several bottles of alcohol, a dried fruit and nut tray, a mexican figure to take home, a beach bag to take home, pop/water/juice/beer/shots in the fridge. There are no drawers in the room - just hangers in the closet (10 or so) and an extra shelf below the safe and along the top of the closet. There is also an umbrella for your use. Maid service was generally late in the afternoon for us - a couple times it was so late in the day, the turndown service took care of it all. The bed linens were CHANGED daily and the towels were replenished daily. The maids were friendly and took good care of our room. Platinum Concierge is mainly for booking a La Carte restaurant reservations (they have a copy of all the menus there to help you choose), but they would try to handle special requests and had fresh beach towels available. You need to go to them to get your free 30 minute massage vouchers to take to the spa - it is not waiting for you in your room. The lounge was roomy with 4 computers with free internet, a snack station, drinks, washrooms, a small library, seating areas and beverage service to the pool! The pool is small, but we appreciated the wind protection as most days of our trip were rather cool and windy (Take a heavy sweater, just in case - I only took light sweaters and payed for it in the colder than normal temperatures!!). The palapa beds and cushiony loungers were lovely! The trolley service runs every 15 minutes or so. For us, the Platinum service was worth the extra money. Overall, a nice service from friendly staff. Food was quite good at the buffets with a lot of variety. My favourite a La Carte was La Fleur (International cuisine) - the beef tenderloin with chocolate souffle was soooo delicious! Everyone has different tastes in terms of food/drink, so I will leave it up to you to decide for yourself. There is coffee brought to your table at breakfast - but sometimes, we waited for milk...not a problem to me, but some guests were very displeased. There is a coffee machine at the buffets, so you can self-serve at lunch and dinner. The beach was large with powdery, white sand. As many have stated, so many people put towels down to hold loungers and then never use them! While capacity was not that high and loungers were fairly easy to come by, I can see how this would be frustrating when the resort is full. I did not swim in the ocean or pools, simply because the weather was bad during most of our time there, but my husband had no issues. 99% of the staff was very friendly. They usually initiated the \"hola's\" as they passed by with smiles, but we were happy to do the same. They work so hard from very early in the morning to very late at night and still smile and talk to the guests that are willing to stop and chat. I was very embarassed by how some guests treated the staff and tended to tip them a little more to try to make up for the abuse they sometimes suffer. Guests with children - please look after your own children! The vast majority of them were great, but there were a few groups of little ones running around screaming in the buffets and the Platinum lounge. I almost tripped over one of the kids when they ran into me and he could have been injured if I had ended up spilling hot food on him. Everyone is on vacation, including the kids and parents, but your children are still your responsibility. The resort is huge with the Sunset running along one side and the Riviera along the other. I quite enjoyed the walk from one end to the other. If mobility is an issue, this may not be the resort for you, unless you are not concerned with the occassional wait for the trolley service. There was at least one show each night, but we missed most of it as it was not of interest, or we were having a late dinner. There is also a casino night, a vendor night, a house band playing nightly, a flaming coffee bar, a miriachi band twice weekly and a weekly acrobatics show in the common area between the buffet restaurants. Saw the tail end of \"Grease\" and it was lip-synching to the original soundtrack, but I love that movie and found what I saw of the show entertaining. The Areito disco had some people there and the music was really good, but nothing much was going on when we were there...likely picked up as people loosened up at the end of the night and started to dance! In terms of the price we paid for this trip, I found way better deals after we booked the trip, but we decided to book early to ensure we all travelled together. Another lesson learned! Pack your \"chill\" and just go enjoy yourself! Were there issues while we there - absolutely! Did it ruin our vacation - not a chance! I did not have to cook, clean or work for a week and was surrounded by gorgeous, lush grounds, so there was nothing for me to complain about!! Overall, we had a great time at this resort.

I had made the mistake of reading all the reviews before going and was getting extremely worried about it as i had organised it. Check in was easy, no problems. We had booked Junior Suites as it was the cheapest and we hardly spend any time in our room when we're away, but we were upgraded to Junior Suite Deluxe on arrival so had a lovely jacuzzi in our room which we were not expecting. Also the room itself was much bigger than I have stayed in before and the bed was huge (although the pillows were like rocks). All I can say is that there must be some lazy people out there. Yes the resort is big and you have to walk everywhere, but come on, nothing was too far. We had rooms the furthest from the beach and it still only took us about 6-7 mins to walk, a beautiful walk at that. One of the friends who came with us is disabled and has a false leg and he had NO problems getting around or getting in and out of the pools. The only problems he had was that when the floor was wet it could be very slippery. The food was good and the buffett restaurants had plenty of choice and seemed to cater for everyone. The only thing the men in our group did not like was the whole pig that had been cut up and everything was in there, teeth and all. He was named 'chainsaw pig' as he looked like someone had just started chopping into him and left him. There was also a 'baseball bat duck' one night. It looked like the duck had been cooked and then someone beat the thing to a pulp! Luckily I am vegetarian so didn't have to eat it. The men were well and truly put off and couldn't touch it, which must have been bad!! Apart from that food was great and there are plenty of A La Carte restaurants to choose from. I agree with an earlier review that outside of the buffett/ restaurant times all you can get is burgers or hot dogs or Nachos which was no good for me being veggie and to be honest our group got fed up not being able to choose what they wanted for a snack as we have been able to in other resorts. The beach is lovely, but the sea was quite rocky and you needed shoes to go in as we saw a couple of people that had cut their feet. The beach could get busy, but we actually enjoyed lazing round the pool and some days we practically had a whole area of the pool to ourselves which was great. The staff at reception are not very helpful and do not seem bothered if people are having a good stay or not. We heard a few people complaining about different things and the staff just looked at them with such an attitude. I'm just glad we had no problems during our stay. Our friends had a problem with their safe as it would not lock, but someone came within half an hour and changed the battery and it worked fine. Also their tv was not working and another guy came and exchanged it about 10 minutes later so they had no hassle. We never had to wait long at the bars for drinks, but what did make us laugh was that your drink never tasted the same each time you ordered it. Even down to a cup of coffee, I had one coffee with milk every lunchtime from the same bar and it was never made the same and always tasted different! I don't know how, but that was the case with some of the cocktails too. Ha! The nightlife in resort wasn't much to write hom about and a couple of ngihts we went into Playa for a meal and a few drinks. We did watch the fire show in resort which was ok, apart from they kept dropping everything! The shows were far too cabaret for me, I can't stand anything cheesy like that, but all the kids seemed to enjoy it. They had a night market in resort once a week which was nice to walk around but a bit expensive. You could get exactly the same things in town, but much cheaper if you haggle a little. We went into Playa Del Carmen a few times which is about a 10 minute ride away. You can book a free shuttle bus into town from the hotel but they only go twice a day and there is only one pick up back in the evening. There was a sign at the hotel that always read thea the bus was full 'today and tomorrow', but when I actually asked at the desk there was plenty of room for the 4 of us. A few times we just got a taxi into town. Playa Del Carmen has a beautiful beach if you wanted a change of scenery and shopping is good. People do no tend to bother you too much if you are polite. We had a day trip to Cozumel Island which was lovely. The ferry ride was not too long and they had a band to keep you entertained on your journey. Just be prepared that as soon as you get off of the ferry people will not leave you alone. You will have about 20 people ask if you want to hire scooters/ jeeps/ boats etc before you've eve got off of the jetty. We also did a half day speed boat trip which was so cool. You get a 2-seater speedboat to ride and fllow the guide on the sea/ through mangroves and stop at a reef for a bit of snorkelling. The guide really lets you get the speed up too which was excellent! They rip you off with the price of the photo's they take of you, but we've come to expect that anywhere we go in Mexico now!!! We also did a half day trip to Tulum which as worth it. It is not as good as a visit to Chichenitza (which we did on a previous stay in Mexico), but well worth a visit. The only problem was that people wanted money for everything. If you stood too long looking at something they would ask for a tip, if you took a picture of something they wanted a tip. It really got on our nerves after a while as it took away the enjoyment of the day. We thoroughly enjoyed our 2-week holiday.

The grounds were beautiful, well maintained. There was walking involved, but at night it was serene walking to dinner on the lighted pathways. 2. The rooms were great. We had the swim up rooms. I'm not sure how we are going anywhere again without swim up rooms. You could go right from your deck to the pool. The pools were interconnected with the main pool and you could go almost anywhere in the water without getting on the sidewalks. 3. The beds were really firm. Too firm for us, but our friends liked it. So I think it's personal preference. Our friends shower leaked. Ours did not. It's hit or miss. 4. Service was great. Leave a tip in the refrigerator and your favorite drinks will materialize every morning. Leave a tip for the maid, you'll get towel art sometime during the week, a clean room everyday, and supplies restocked. Drink service from the bar was consistent. All of the staff was pleasant and friendly. 5. Security was great. Very low key, but obviously present. Made it nice to let the girls hang around without us constantly being in tow.

Buffet; went only in the morning, 8 choices of yogourt, fresh & syrup fruit, brioche, all kind of fresh bread, croissant which I was very satisfy with. Also good selection of breakfast hot food. Coffee, very good when ever you get one, the service is slow & poor, they don't served you automatically, you have to raise your hand and sometime to get up and go and ask for your coffe. This was a negative point. Good system for A La Carte restaurant, you don't have to wait in line early in the morning, to make your reservation. Desk open all day long. Restaurant:: All good, my top one, Italian (bruschetta, tomatoes and goat cheese) veal scaloppini excellent.. in any restaurant the red wine, vino tinto is the worst I never tasted. Japaneese good and fun. Spain also good, Flamingo show in extra. Avoid THE FONDUE, in no way what a Fondue is suppose to be. Beach: We all know that Cuba has the nicest one.

The clients picked the property. This is my 2nd career, prior to becoming a TA was a Hospital Plant Operation's Directions for 20 years. On this site many folks commented on having a foul smell in there rooms, These folks were correct. Our room 7016 was quite bad. The two rooms my clients had had no odor so I can't say what % of the rooms have this problem. I asked many staff about this and the problem seems to be widespread. I did a study of our room and it's systems and the grounds around our room. After reviewing my findings I implemented my finding in our room and it was a success, Within a hour or so the fumes were gone ( I did leave open the front and patio doors to quicken the air exchange.) After closing the doors and letting the hotels HVAC systems supply the room with air and exhuast it was fine for the rest of our stay except for the one time I return there settings back to where they had them and P-U once again. Changed it back and all was fine. I'm glad I always travel with a Swiss Army multi-tool in my checked in luggage. I trid and tried to meet with the property manager, two of them by written letters to him or her and the best I could do was get an asst. by the name of Gina. I even explained to them that this could be a very possible health situation for people. I spelled out some of the health risks they could be subjecting people to that can make humans sick and worse than that if you get my drift.

I have never been to an all inclusive and after reading some of the reviews on here also wondered what my friend \"the bride\" was getting us into. The Grand Princess far exceeded my expectations. Perfection does not even describe the grounds and cleanliness of this hotel. Constant care by the amazing staff keeps this place looking gorgeous 24-7. I still can not believe how shiny and clean this resort is considering its size! The food, wow! The buffets were amazing lots to choose from, I lost weight to look good in a bathing suit and pretty much gained it all back within the first day!! We stayed in Platinum and had free room service which I took advantage of every morning, I highly recommend the Mexicana...yummy! We ate at Mamma Mia, Le Fondue, La Hacienda and La sol. All were amazing, they let you book 2 days in advance and we never had problems with accomodating our large group nor did the staff seem in anyway upset by the size of our group. In fact they were very accomodating and extremly friendly. Our rooms were constantly cared for, very clean and the fridge re-stocked. We did leave small tips each day which is something I would expect to do anyways. Nothing from anyone in our group was stolen from our room or our safes. If you are worried about stashing cash in your safe (which I wouldn't do anyways no matter where in the world I was) use the ATM in the hotel lobby to get out what you need instead of having valuables in your room. Theft can happen anywhere! I was very concerned when I was told this was a big resort and after reading the complaints on here about the walking distance I was wondering just how big this place was. Please!!! You would have to be crazy to think its hard to walk around. Our room was in the Platinum Riviera side which is at the beach and is furthest from the main lobby. There is a shuttle that constantly runs from the Platinum Lobby to the Main lobby every 15 minutes (all day & all night) BUT COME ON, seriously we walked it 2-3 times a day. No longer then a 5-10 minute walk up past the beautiful pools and manicured walkways. My friends wedding was stunning, staff was proffesional and they allowed for the bridal parties to come into Platinum so that we could all get ready together (most of our group stayed in the swim-ups). The swim-up rooms were great, we all loved using the water chairs. The pool bar kept the drinks flowing our way thanks to our wonderful server Jaqueline. The beach was busy but we had no problem finding our own little spot for our group and once more were well taken care of by our server Elizabeth. The Disco was great for letting loose and the 30 minute massage we got with our Platinum room was worth the extra cost on its own. Another couple from our group paid for the beach massage and said it was fabulous. We left our 1 year old at home but this resort is very child friendly. For older kids they have a kids club and we watched the staff with the kids and they were great, I would bring my daughter here anytime. The concierge, bellboys and lobby clerks all help to make you feel well taken care of and were very, very helpful. We did venture off the resort to set up a trip to Chichen Itza, there was a little booth set up on the beach for what I think was called Pyramid tours(?) that was also great and I would recommend trying to locate this company for any day trips. All and all I say a BIG congrats to the employees of the Grand Princess, you are doing a wonderful job!! You were all so friendly and fun!! Thank you all so much for making this such a memorable holiday and I am already recommending this resort to friends.

I lost a lot of hair and sleep before leaving because of some of the reviews we read on this site before going. I\u2019m writing this for all of those other brides out there worrying for absolutely NO REASON! EVERYONE was blown away!!!!!!!!! It could not have been any better. Brandon\u2019s family, us and another couple all stayed in Platinum which was beautiful and made you feel very very taken care of. The rest stayed in swim up rooms and one couple was even upgraded after I offered to pay and was never actually charged for the upgrade! Walking into the resort, the first impression GEORGEOUS! The lobby was stunning and the grounds were the nicest I\u2019ve ever seen! (We travel a lot!) I didn't see one piece of GRASS out of place let alone a cigarette butt and trust me no one hates smoking more than me! My guests from Ontario (my family and friends about 16 of them)had their flight delayed for 12 hours!!!!! They were to get to the resort at 10pm and we waited and waited and waited of course I became very upset knowing my father was terrified of flying to begin with, the resort did what they could to make me feel better and made a lot of calls they finally made it to the resort at 1030am the next morning ,exhausted and not overly happy. 10 minutes in the resort they had forgotten all about the trip from hell. As I mentioned all of my Ontario family and friends other than one couple in Platinum were on the bottom floor swim up all rooms were beautiful , spotless and had cute little towel animals most mornings, my parents had the most impressive maybe because my mother had brought coloring books and crayons for the cleaning ladies children. My uncle even had a thank you note asking for requests for his bar fridge! LOL! (Those must have been good tips!) The food incredible, buffet was great ribs mmmmmmmmmm, desserts too good some of our guests were very worried about having to try \"different food\" but it was great because not only did they have great \"normal food\" ha ha they had yummy Mexican for them to experiment with. The a la carte restaurants were soooooo good!!!!!! The night before the wedding we all went for the wedding dinner (you get a dinner with the wedding but I decided to go into Playa for the wedding day dinner and used the resorts for the night before) we went to the Mexican restaurant the service was outstanding!!!! Some of the food could have been a bit hotter but we did have 27 people not mention we were 20 minutes late. The beach was crowded in most areas but was very spacious at the end opposite the bar. The beach was spotless and some of the entry points were very rocky but we found that in front of the beach bar it was all sand and nice to walk out. The staff AMAZING! Fernando is the man!!!!! Houdini was not happy unless you were drinking and trust me be careful the drinks are not what we came to expect from all inclusive\u2026they actually have booze \u2026A LOT of booze! For you brides\u2026the wedding could NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PERFECT! I was worried before we left because it didn\u2019t always seem they were on top of it but as soon as I met Sandra in person my worries were gone she is a wonderful person! The gazebo was stunning!!!! I would recommend it over the Yuppa on the beach the ceremony perfect Fernando made it very special. We then went into Playa de Carmen for dinner WOW! I highly highly recommend Ajua restaurant Stephanie was great the food people are still going on about and she organized a 10 piece mariachi band to play our first song on the beautiful cobble stone street. It was a dream. We finished the night off at the resort disco so much fun! I never bother writing comments like this and never this long!

The best way to answer that is to state what we found there on a two week stay. The most annoying item is their so called \u201cPlatinum Treatment\u201d The maids consistently upset both my wife and myself with the following items: Theft of personal items in the bathroom, taking robes that were issued and not replacing them (client is responsible for missing items), Taking towels from our washroom because a new client moved into the next suite and they didn\u2019t have any in stock. Doing the bed turn down at 5pm (my nap time), not providing service that we expected fore the extra Platinum Upgrade price. Also for Platinum, I didn't expect cockroaches (See pictures) The Concierge Service was useless! My wife continually had to complain about the supply group not leaving diet drinks due to my diabetes. The room phone quit working and was taken to the Concierge to have replaced. Two days later and several phone calls to the manager and back to the Concierge we finally got a replacement. When the maid took the two robes from the room, the Concierge finally got someone to replace them. Only to find that the replacements were for midgets! It took another day to get this item sorted out. Don\u2019t try to call management, it took near to 90 minutes to get a manager on the hotel phone and after talking to him he passed the buck to the Concierge!!! In general the food was okay, nothing that I would write home about. However, I\u2019ll give one point. This hotel serves shrimp a couple of days a week (RIU last year stopped serving them and it really upset me (in polite language) for the price paid at their 5 star hotels. Now I'll take the bonus point away \"This is the first hotel That I've been to that doesn't serve coffee or for that matter allow it in the dinner buffett (NO I\"M NOT KIDDING!!!). One issue that really upset me was a waiter that told my sister to lick her spoon rather that issue a new one on a normal request. This I found totally deplorable!!! In general: The hotel complex is overly large for a decent all inclusive, the transportation is poor for the Platinum clients (constantly pushed out of the way by regular customers even though the Platinum clients have waited since the previous transport left). The beach for Platinum is a joke. The loungers are so close together that you can\u2019t move, the beach is the worst area on the complex, stones etc. under the water. Beach for the regulars is better. Bar service pampering is provided, but the serving staff tends to hide in the shade more than serving clients (even with tips). Pools are another matter. The main pools near the Platinum area are nearly impossible to get out of for people with mobility handicaps and those of us in our golden years. There are two pools (one has a single ladder to get out with and the other maybe a prayer if you are lucky\u2026). There is one walk up bar for the two pools. I must reiterate again everything is a long walk! Including getting to the bar, washrooms, and lunch buffets. There was only one door in and the same one out. (Beware if there is a fire, the other doors were locked!!!). This was our first Air Canada Vacation and the way I feel, probably my last. I guess I don\u2019t have to add whether we enjoyed the trip and as stated \u201cwould I go there again\u201d. We\u2019ll leave that to you. I will further clarify my position. My wife and I are retired. We take on average three holidays per year (In Canadian Winter months) In the summer we boat on a 32 ft. motor yacht. When I pay for pampering, I expect pampering.

First- We arrived at Cancun airport and our bags were not there. We were instructed to fill out a form and our bags would be delivered to our resort. The bags were delivered the next morning minus our IPOD, I phone charger, DVD's, New bottle of Armani perfume, my shoes, lots of clothes and all 6 pair of underwear! The theft occured at the airport as the Mexicana lock tags were still in place and I had to cut them off to open the bags. The police are shady and criminals themselves. The american embassy was not helpful and acted like this happened all the time. Now we are home we are sorting out the situation. Don't pack valuables in your suitcase, you will never see them again! Now to the resort- Check in- Easy, quick, offered champayne. Room- We stayed in the Laguna Villa and it was gorgeous! Huge bed, Huge 2 seater jacuzzi, and the mayan shower was amazing. I never wanted to leave the shower. We left the note on the door \"do not disturb\" at all times as I would rather make my own bed then worry about anymore theft while on vacation. I had read all previous reviews. Food- Amazing! I don't know why people are complaining about the buffet. It was great and the salad bar was divine, the vinigrette dressing is the best ever! We were both impressed with the buffet. You get your own drinks from a fountain including wine and beer. We only had time to try 3 restraunts, the Thai was great and included one night since were Laguna, but I did feel like they acted as if we were there for something free even though we paid a ton for Laguna and one night includes Thai beach. Oh well, the food was amazing and overlooking the beach was great. The other restraunts we tried were La Hacienda, fabulous! and Mama Mia also fabulous. They are 4 course meals! The food overall was excellent. Entertainment- Amazing, I loved the acrobats and the fire show. We missed the Marachi band sadly. Entertainment was everynight begining at 830 and there were 2 shows. A must see! Oh, and they have Mayan flaming coffee in the plaza where entertainment is everynight! A must! Beach- Amaxing! Chrystal blue water, you can see the bottom of the beach all the way out. Rocky places in some areas, but nothing like other reviews stated. We didn't even have water shoes and we had a blast! If you stay platinum or laguna the private beach is the Thai beach area with big beach beds just for you! It was awesome, but the manager Jairo is an a## and I am writing the manager about him. He was just rude and cocky. I was going to buy food there but decided against it when he was such an a## to me. Just so you know, the Thai beach is included for lounging on the beach if you are platinum or laguna. You can't take drinks in you must buy drinks if you want one. You don't have to buy drinks to lounge on the beach bed! That's included in your stay. Don't buy scuba or snorkle trips from the outside salesmen in the lobby, they will rip you off. Your discount is with the resort diveshop by the party pool. 35 dollar snorkle was the best part of my vacation. I was afraid at first and the divers stayed right by me and so nice. One even dove under with my camera to take a picture of a sea turtle. My boyfriend loved his scuba dive and it was only 55 dollars including lesson in the pool!! That was the best day of our vacation. You have to snorkle and dive with the resort dive shop!! My boyfriend recieved a wonderful massage on the beach and the girl tried to steal his money.

My husband and I travelled with our 2year old and 5 year old. We got an incredible deal from Westjet vacations so even after reading some negative reviews I decided that for the money I was willing to risk it. The resort really is huge and you really will walk a lot. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. CLEANLINESS: The common areas were incredibly clean. The buffets and bars were as clean as any I have ever been to. The pool areas were well maintained. The beach was a little dirty but it is a beach. Our room was cleaned adequately but nothing over the top. CHECK IN/OUT: Both were quick and painless. I was hoping to upgrade our room from the Junior Suite the Junior deluxe but decided for the extra $210 US that it wasn't worth it for us. FOOD: We only ate at the buffets as a real restaurant with 2 small kids is never very fun. The food was good the service ranged from poor to excellent just depending on your server. There was always something good to eat and we didn't experience any ill effects from the food. The beach only had hotdogs which meant going to a buffet for lunch. My husband packed shorts to the beach and changed for lunch. The kids and I just wore coverups. You do need a coverup to go into the buffets as well as sandals. DRINKS: As I said we were travelling with our kids so we didn't do too much of that. When we did the drinks were reasonably strong and we didn't have to wait long at the bar. BEACH: Lovely beach. The chairs were a little close together but how much room to you really need? There was always room for our kids to play in the sand in the shade or sun. We always went out in the morning before breakfast and stuck our towels on a couple of chairs (usually around 8:30-9). It would have been pretty slim pickins if we hadn't. The beach bar often had quite a line up but it moved quickly and I just kept an eye on it and went when the line was smaller. There is a large sand bar and make the playing in the waves a lot of fun with children ( I had fun too)! POOLS: We tended to hit the pool closest to the beach. It was nice with a swim up bar and was quietish. We never went to the main pool but it always seemed busy and people seemed to be having fun. KIDS CLUB: My 5 year old isn't one for strangers so she spent very little time there. It seemed quite well run and there was always a well posted itinerary of the days activities. The evening kids club seemed like a fabulous idea and we would have taken advantage of some dinners alone if but our 2 year old was too young for it. We did, however, take the girls to the mini disco a few times and they had a blast. ROOMS: We stayed in a Junior Suite. It was fine. The TV worked, the beds were comfy and the shower leaked like mad! We figured out to keep our beach towels to soak up the flood so we didn't have to use our shower towels. It worked and prevented the flood. We were on the main floor, which was nice with the kids but left us unable to use our patio due the the mosquitos. It seemed to be the only place that we had any problems with them. I imagine that higher up it wouldn't have been a problem. ENTERTAINMENT: We only ever saw the \"preshow\" in the main square but they were fun shows. 9:30 for the main show was just too late for our kids. The \"Animation\" team seemed to have lots going on, but we were on a family vacation so we didn't participate in anything. We had a really good time and had no realy complaints about the property or the staff. Is it a Canadian 5 star hotel, no, but last time I check there were no white sand beaches to sun myself on in Canada in December ;).

We started leaving $1US in the fridge, and got extra of everything. I am paranoid with security. We never left anything that wouldn't be missed to us, out. Every time we left our room, we put things away in our luggage- LOCKED- and left nothing in the safe. I know it's a hassle at times to carry all your cash/cards/passports.. better safe then sorry. Put them in ziplock bags, into your purse/bag/pouch, if your around water, or just planning to go in only knee deep. Security didn't look so secure to me, but we had no problems. Remember your surroundings, and the people around you. What you considered fun, may not be great to others. The main buffet by front lobby was alright. It had same things everyday, breakfast, lunch and dinner. The buffets by the beaches were better, and added new stuff every day, and better service. Sunset/Riviera, it didn't matter which side you stayed on. Same food, service. It was all a hit or miss. Drinks at buffet, if they didn't bring or ask us, we just got it ourselves. It was much quicker, no fuss, no big deal. We tried some a la cartes. That too was a hit or miss. Some in our group liked it, others didn't. All about one's taste. We did not like Le Fleur, Mamma Mia we loved. We booked that place twice. Everyone found something that they liked. The beach was beautiful. We always found beach chairs, depending on the time of the day. Obviously you'll find rocks at the bottom of the water, you won't know till you step in. Didn't find any issues with this. Buy water shoes to be on the safe side, or just stick to the pools. We went on excursions to Ek Balam and Xcaret. Beautiful experience, awesome time. Don't just lie on the beach everyday. Take some time out, and experience their culture and history. We also went into Playa Del Carmen. Great place to bargain, and to see more of their culture.

It's clean, pools are great, room (laguna villa) is beautiful. People who complain about walking are lazy, or drunk or old or what i don't know. It's big yes, but it's 5 minutes to everywhere unless you're crawling or using a walker..maybe 10 minutes with kids..it's no big deal! buffets are bad! Anything beef is aweful, so over cooked and chewy, bacon is deep fried and nasty. You won't starve but it's nothing to get excited about. Homemade icecream is AMAZING! but that's about it at the buffet to look forward too. Ala carts are all pretty good. LeFluer has fantastic steak, melt in your mouth called beef filet with chocolate sufle (spell?), we ate there twice. Beach doesn't have rocks, unless you go look for them. Honestly, the place is beautiful and clean, buffets are bad which is too bad BUT the biggest thing and the deal breaker to us is the theft. We read here before we left about theft and theft out of your room safe so we were for warned. We counted our money, made note of what bills we had and sure enough, $20 dollar bill was gone the second day while we were at the beach. We let it go and didn't say anything. Second day, another $20 bill was taken..no jewelry or iphone or anything like that, just money. We made a formal complaint and never heard another thing about it..nothing! For us it was very up-setting to be stolen from. It wasn't the money, it was the fact that we were nothing more than an easy target, walking piggie banks. It ruined our trip eventhough we tried not to let it. It was sureal sitting in their fancy french restaurant where the waiters have white gloves and they're giving this air of sophistication while back in your room they are raiding your safe and ransacking your room. I would never go there again because of this. We were told by 2 staff members there that it's security doing the stealing from safes as they are the only ones that have the codes. I think back to the murders at the Barcelo 2 years ago where the couple got their throats slit. I truly believe they were marked by security as people having lots of cash in their safe, probably stole out of there and knew that. I think they came back to steal more but they were asleep in the room and they got murdered. It took a year or so but they did arrest a \"security guard\". You are nothing more than an easy target at this resort. I truly believe that at least 90% of the toursits get stolen from but don't even know it. They take small amounts so you don't notice, but you ARE OR WILL BE STOLEN FROM AT THIS RESORT...DON'T KID YOURSELF!!! Count your money or better yet, don't leave it in your safe..BETTER YET...DON'T GO THERE...DON'T BE A VICTIM!! The only way this will stop is if we take our tourism dollars elsewhere.

All in all the trip was enjoyable, but there are some definite downsides to this resort. For starters this resort is incredibly huge - - for those people who complained about the size of it in other reviews I completely agree. Anyone not bothered by the sheer size of this place and the distance to get literally anywhere in the resort was probably drunk or an olympic athlete. Check-in was quick and painless, but we found it difficult to find our room and the map was a little confusing. The rooms were nice and were cleaned daily, however it was obvious that these rooms were built with haste and with little attention to detail and quality. The buffet was fine. Most people should find something that will satisfy them. We ate at most of the a la cartes while we were there and they were hit and miss. We like the mexican and the Italian the best, but whether at the buffet or the a la cartes the service was terribly lacking. In my opinion, this is where the hotel failed the most. The service when available was excellent, but there were far too few staff to accomodate that many guests. The wait staff do an amazing job, but can only look after so many people properly. Most of the staff were almost running from table to table to keep up. The pools were everywhere and you could always find one that suited your mood, whether you wanted to watch the activites or just quietly nap in a palapa poolside there was never a problem. The beach was nice but had an unpleasant odor most of the time and the water was choppy the entire week we were there, but there are so many beaches available nearby that it wasn't a major concern for us. I would recommend Akumel beach for a day trip and Lucy's for lunch afterwards. For the most part this was a pleasant vacation and it is what you make of it, but the size of this resort and the lack of service will have me looking for better accomodations in the future.", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cStay elswhere\u201d", "Author": "TravelholicCalgary", "ReviewID": "UR51474719", "Content": "This resort is poorly laid out, Too much walking around the resort to get anywhere.

( and by the way, rooms are identical either on Sunset or Riviera side.....The only difference - Apple Vacations sells Sunset only, Funjet - Riviera only...But it's the same hotel, same rooms....) It's our second time at Princess. We returned because last year I was in love with this resort.....It is a very beautiful place...and it's very sad that it is in the hands of a very poor management. This time I was disgussed. Everything was worse this time. 1) A year ago, maids were busy making those cute towel animals which we got every single day last year. This year - maids were busy snooping around your luggage and stealing your stuff !!! My jewerly got STOLLEN from my make-up bag, which were buried deep inside my clothes in my luggage !!! I was totally astonished and mad when I noticed that. My vacation was ruined right then. I file reports with concierge and I did went to Play de Carmen and file a police report. But......no results..... Hotel tells it's not responsible at all. Do you think it would be safe if I would to put it in the safe deposit box ?? NO WAY !!! We heard about two different cases about the money stollen from the safe, just in the short time while we were standing near the concierge room. They just don't care about their reputation, they have maids who are stealing from the guests, and they think It's not their problem. ??? They didn't even felt bad about it....no gift basket, no champagne....nothing. Even though they were mentioned something about it.. But at the end it seems like I have to beg for it ??? I got nothing from them. Thanks a lot, Princess. 2) Whoever we had to deal in the front desk was either unfriendly or just plain rude, one exception - Sajid. He helped us to get a better room in the very beginning of our vacation. At first we got a room with broken refrigerator, broken toilet, etc. Stale smell in the room pointed that nobody was there for months. And this was the room for the RETURNING GUESTS ?? 3) First two nights we just couldn't make reservations at restaurants , they were fully booked ! So, we ate at the buffet. This year buffet was very repetitive, same food every night. And every morning and lunch. In the morning, it was hard to get a cup of coffee, not enough waiters. Specialty restaurants not much better....Just better service. I hated LaFondue this time. Japanese was o'k...But I did \"catch\" food poisoning next morning. Was it breakfast buffet or Japanese - ??? well, nobody knows. I didn't eat nothing for two days after that. Coudn't stand the smell of their food. 4) Water at the beach was very dirty !! They don't bother to clean it, like it's done at other resorts. Bunch of weeds and junk in the water and on the sand..... 5) There were huge cockroaches in the room, coming from vents, etc. Uggh..... So, let me tell you this. Only when you experiencing some problems------ only then you will see their customer service skills, which by the way they don't have ! Their customer service sucks !! Those people who drink non-stop and only sit by the bar in the main pool from the sunrise to the sunset don't have any idea what's going on around them. Only they can give you these happy reviews, which are very misleading. People that are sober at least for a while during the day can tell you numerous problems about this hotel. Also, it depends if it's your lucky days and vacation. I was lucky my first time with Princess, BUT was rudely awakened second time.

Nice hotel but things to consider: - the resort is HUGE, walking time from either of the two lobbies to the beach is at least 15 minutes (we timed it). We are 30 years old and in good shape and it was alot of walking for us. An example of the walking was when we arrived we walked 10 minutes to our room to find out that the key to our room did not work, we had to walk 10 minutes back to the front desk, they gave us another key and did not do anything for the inconvenience, and we walked 10 minutes again back to our room. - poor customer service, we requested an upgrade, was told it was not available and told to check back the next day. The next day we checked back and they said a request was never put in for us and that they would put it in and we were to check back the next day. Next day, no available and after wasting hours of walking and checking back we gave up. They did not do anything for the inconvenience. - Bring comfortable shoes, dressy outfits (we were not expecting this), and mosquito spray. - Taxi to Playa Del Carmen is $13USD each way. Taxis try to charge you more and ALWAYS have correct change because if you give them $20 USD they will say they have no change. - DISHONESTY is everywhere: There is a huge sign at the front desk that says \" we plead with you to use credit card and not cash for room upgrades etc.). And we asked a bartender to make change for a $20US bill so we could tip and he only gave us $16USD back and acted like it was correct and refused to make proper change. - Although it is all inclusive and you can drink as much as you want, be prepared to WAIT IN LINE at every bar. Usually taking 10 minutes to get a couple of drinks or a pack of matches. Waitresses only come around every 30 minutes even if you tip them. we went up to a bar and waited for 10 minutes and they turned the lights off and said they were closed without serving us. -Entire hotel is SMOKING, dont go there if you like fresh air. There wasn't a spot where people werent smoking. I felt like I smoked a pack a day and I am a non smoker. - The pools were very nice but very dirty. You couldn't really tell during the day because of the sun and all the people, however at night there was a distinct film on top of the water and lots of plastic cups, straws etc at the bottom of all the pools. - The beach was nice, sand was fine, soft and white. The water was ok, however there was a distinct spot just off the beach from the hotel that was dark brown, very cloudy and had a terrible odor, almost like it was a septic field from the hotel. We stuck to the pools. - Vacation guides tell you that you have to attend an orientation in order to recieve your return transfer to the airport. You do not have to attend, they only try to sell you adventure packages. They even called a few days later and said we needed to pick the transfers up by 5pm that day - fales - they noticed we had not booked any tours and wanted to try to sell to us again. We finally asked for the transfers the last day and they printed out a slip of paper which no one asked for when we returned to the airport. - Restaurants - Mexican, nothing special, Oriental, best meal of the week, Steak House - terrible/awful/gross, Buffet, not too bad mediocre for lunch and breakfast, Italian, good. Snacks available at the sports bar (burgers and fries only) when the buffets and restaurants are closed which is often. Check out - again terrible customer service: Ensure you check out BEFORE noon by physically going to the lobby with your rooms keys and towel cards. We \"checked out\" by leaving our room at 10am and put our bags in a friends room as we arranged the day before to have a late check out until 4pm in that room. When we went to enter the room at 1pm the key we were told would work until 4pm did not work, thus a 15 minute walk to the front desk, where they gave me another key. I mentioned that we had already checked out of our other room at 10am and they said no you didnt because you didnt come to the front desk (we just vacated the room and left the keys in there), and charged us $10 for the additional hour from 12 non to 1pm for a room we had vacated at 10am. I was in my bathing suit and did not have $10 on me so I asked if they could add the $10 charge (that was ridiculous anyways) to the room we had a late check out on - they said no and said I had to go and get $10 now or they would continue chrarging $10 every hour until we \"checked out\". I walked 15 minutes back to get $10 and 15 minutes beck to officially \"check out\" of the room we vacated at 10am. Ridiculous! - Chair saving: People have a warped sense that it is ok to throw a towel on a chair by the pool or on the beach and leave it there for hours claiming that chair as theirs and \"saved\" until they return. After days of watching towels sit on chairs in prime sun spots for 6+ hours with no one coming to sit there, we moved a few towels and sat in the chairs. This was fine once, someone did return after 4 hours and made a few comments. The second time we did this at the beach, with a security guard standing right there, a non english speaking steriod raging foreigner came up to our group screaming and throwing chairs (empty and occupied), threatening males and females with his fist, throwing our belongings around etc. Ruined our day completely as we felt very unsafe. - Feeling Unsafe: Security is a JOKE. See above. Also, our bus pulled up to take 30 persons back to the airport, we checked out our late check out room and another couple we knew did the same, however, upon requesting check out they were told that they had broken a statue and had to pay $20USD cash before they would be allowed to leave the hotel. They did not break anything and we asked for proof. The hotel staff said they had pictures of them breaking a statue, we asked ot see them as this was impossible as we did not break anything, they showed pictures of a broken statue, but not one picture of any of us. They refused to pay and they would not let them on the bus, so they tried to get in a taxi and hotel security told the taxis not to take them. They were threatened that they were not allowed to leave the hotel until they paid and there is a locked gate that security patrols at the entrance to the hotel - so feeling completely helpless they had to pay and were allowed to leave with us.

Aparrently this has been ongoing but we not made aware of this.by Thomson.They moved us to another room the next day, We could still hear them but at least our balcony didn't face it!. They rang to see if it was ready it was, we moved our stuff and when we arrived it wasn't. but we thought no worries and left our cases to vome back later. But things just got worse and worse I won't go into the minor things ie understaffed and luke warm food at the buffet not what you expect of 5 star but hey we're in Mexico and on holiday !!! We can wait longer or get our own or just work around the stuff which wasn't warm on the buffet. What got us most was the noise and the amount of very loud drunk people in the day..............we were in block 8 a long way from the pools and we could still hear the music from the pool. Some of it loud dance music and the VERY VERY drunk people with no volume control on cocktails from 10.00am onwards. Now we are no kill joys and like to party to on holiday don't get me wrong ,but after seeing a 60 year old fall into the pool legless at about 11.30am..........................not for us its like Ibiza for the over 30's !!!! We tried several times to sit places but it was still really bad. The beach was rather busy and you could just about find somewhere there. But the beds are so close to each other it was like being in Spain. We really really tried to adjust but got to the stage where we were both so so miserable we went to our rep with the pages from our brochure to show her what we'd booked and what we'd got !!! We had to pay to move and are taking it up with Thomson now home. To the lovely Seasea suites friendly, great service with a smile, good food and a proper mexican welcome.

The outside lights on every patio automatically turn on and off so no control if you want light after a certain time of night. When we arrived Nov. 13 the resort was not full and it was nice not to have to fight the crowds for beach chairs or deal with the people that think lines are for everyone else, not them! We were upgraded no charge to a junior deluxe suite, close to the lobby but a good hike to the beach. Appreciated the king size bed and the beautiful bathroom, nicest room we have had for the money. I believe when you travel there are certain discomforts one must endure, if you want everything like home then maybe you should stay there, so my next comments are just observations on improvements and the way we would have liked things. Week two the resort got quite busy, if you wern't at the beach by 6:00 a.m. then you were pretty much out of luck for a palapa spot, really frustrating as it is a long walk and alot of those saved spots wern't even used, one person would take 20 towels and save huge blocks of space for their friends then they went back and forth between the pool and the beach. Hours would go by with all these saved but unavailable spots just sitting there. I wish they had the one hour rule at this resort but it is so big probably impossible to police. Also just a hotdog cart at the beach no casual snack situation, you had to go to a buffet restaurant and wait to be seated, a little too formal all the time. The staff were very overtaxed just clearing and serving drinks. Not too happy about it either! They were preparing to open another brand new wing of rooms, not sure how this will work as week two was almost unbearably busy for their existing infrastructure. The sports bar has potential but there is no music and it is full of kids, not cool for us forty somethings who don't want the disco and the lobby bar is a bit sedate and closes at 11:30 , no choice but to go to your room so this was disappointing. Don't mind kids but when your kids are screaming and disturbing people late at night then maybe it's time to put them to bed! We really enjoyed the Ala Carte restaurants, the buffet food was good but it was just nice to have service, note to all who like red wine, this was really the worst I've had anywhere, brown sludgy smelly had to have come out of a huge vat, it put me off wine for a few days, solution? One of our very nice waiters in the italian restaurant told us we could bring our own and pay corkage, we did this and everyone was happy, great wine store in Playa! The champagne was excellent however. All in all a good vacation, would go to a smaller resort next time with a more personal feel but if you like big resorts you won't be disappointed. Note to all, with the H1 N1 going around you would think people would wash after using washroom, not the case here, then straight to the food at the buffet, gross and disgusting!", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Trip!!\u201d", "Author": "Loonychick", "ReviewID": "UR50530597", "Content": "We stayed at the GRP from Nov 7-14th 2009. First I have to say...Do NOT listen to the negative reviews! In my opinion, the ones who are doing the complaining, probably complain about everything in life. I mean really, staying at an absolutely beautiful resort in the Mayan Riviera...what is there to complain about. We had no problems at check-in. We were told where our rooms were and that our bags would be delivered to our doors. So we went to our rooms and within 5 minutes, our bags were brought. The room was amazing! We were supposed to be in a junior suite and were upgraded to a Deluxe Junior Suite with a jacuzzi (which was fabulous!) We were in 7205 facing the outside of the resort (towards Cancun). We had a beautiful view of the sun rising over the ocean each morning. The pools were fantastic. I read one person complaining that they had to wait at the bar for 5 minutes for a drink...so! We just stayed at our chairs and a very nice waitress brought us our drinks...and kept them coming. Always with a smile. When we did go to the bar, you just wait your turn and order 2 drinks. The mudslides were great and so were the Blue Hawaii's. YUM! There were mosquitos at night, but apparently I was the only one in our group that got bit. But hey, I'm from Northern Ontario...their mosquitos were nothing compared to ours. They provide Bug Wipes in your room that they replace for you every day..use them if you are bothered by bugs. I also read in someones review that their room was never cleaned...whatever. Maybe that person didn't leave a tip. They don't make very much money so a tip is greatly apprecitated. Thehousekeeping staff were fantastic during our stay. Our room was always done at some point during the day...I don't know when because I was out enjoying my vacation rather than sitting in my room waiting for the maid. Our room was very clean and the nicest room we've stayed in on a vacation. The lighting was nice and the marble everywhere was stunning. As for the people complaining about their shower leaking into their bathroom...put a towel down. Not rocket science. I completely have to argue with anyone who would complain about the buffets. I have got to be the pickiest eater I know, and there was always so much selection that my plate was full every meal. They even had a beautiful ice sculpture with fresh shrimp and clams for the seafood lovers. They had build your own omelette station at breakfasst and a build your own pasta station where the chef would prepare the food in front of you once you loaded up your plate with what you wanted in your pasta dish. My husband enjoyed this very much. The deserts were decadent. As for the drinks, they don't serve blender drinks in the buffets but I would always pick one (or two) up at the bar on the way in and for the beer lovers, the Corona is self serve in the buffets on tap. Pretty much any mans dream. haha They also had different shooters and tequilas to try set up buffet style as you walked in for dinner. Also we were always asked if we wanted coffee, tea, water, wine. No problems ever! All the buffets were great. Also there was always a buffet open near the lobby for supper, sometimes both the Sunset and Riviera buffets. They are almost right beside each other so if one wasn't open, the other one was. The only a la Carte that we went to was Mama Mia's and the lasagna was to die for! They made whatever drinks we wanted there too. Our waiter was great! The lobby bar seemed to be where we hung out before supper in the evenings. Marina (Flower) was the best waitress. You can't miss her awesome personality. She kept the Kamikase's coming on our last night! The bartenders were okay, but we pretty much sat at a table and the waitresses were much nicer to talk to and deal with. Never an issue there either. They do go around the outside of the resort around 6:30 pm each day fogging for mosquitos. Very stinky...but if it bothers you, just don't go there at that time. simple solution. We never had a \"towel card\". We simply brought our huge beach towels down to the towel hut in the middle of the resort when we needed it changed and they did. No problem. Sometimes there weren't any towels left if we waited too long, but that's our fault, not theirs. The grounds were immaculate and stunning. Zero complaints there. It's not a twenty minute walk from the lobby to the beach...maybe ten..at the most...unless you're a turtle. And who cares, it's such a beautiful walk, with beautiful statues lining the pathways and picturesque foliage along the way. We never went to the disco...just a few of the shows. They were okay. Not my thing or maybe I was just tired, but the Grease show was cute. Lip Syncing, but entertaining. If you book with Signature, Abraham might be your rep. He was so great. He helped us out when one tour forgot to pick us up. Got our money back and spent a great day at the beach instead. It worked out for the best because we had a blast that day. If you need a cab, ask for Edwin CAB #1063. He was great. He was like our own private tour guide. I would highly reccommend him also. If you aren't a partier, then you might not like the party pool. We stopped by and watched some of the entertainment, but for the most part stuck to the quieter ends of the pool. It says there are 12 pools. It's hard to say where one ends and the next begins. Wraps around the resort. You can pretty much swim all the way around, although there are some bridges you couldn't swim under. The loungers for the swim up suites were nice. Although we didn't have a swim up suite, we tried a few out from the vacant rooms. I wouldn't pay the extra money for those suites though when you can use the empty ones for free. hehe All in all I would definately go back. We are debating whether to go back here in the spring or possibly back to Xcaret where we went last year. Both were fantastic in their own different ways. If you are an easy going person and just want to enjoy a nice Mayan Riviera vacation...stay here. You won't be disappointed. There were some rocks on the beach...but Hurricane Ida brushed the resort the first couple of days we were there...and I'm still not complaining. But wearing watershoes is my best advice. At least when there are waves and you can't see the rocks rolling in. One complaint I will make is this. If you are bringing your young children..put them to bed at night. We saw one lady reaming out the cook at the Sports Bar at midnight one night because her daughters sandwhich wasn't ready and she was hungry.. Here's a tip..feed her at dinner time and put her to bed at a decent time. It's not the cook's fault that you don't have enough sense to feed your child before midnight. The little girl was a trooper, but Mom needed a slap. Also there were a few couples who allowed their eight to nine year old kids to take over the pool tables on the same night in the sports BAR ( I am emphasizing Bar for a reason) If they wanted to stay out late at night and hang out in bars why are they bringing their children with them? I'm sure they don't do that in their home towns. Toddlers passing out in their strollers because their parents don't know when to put them to bed drove me nuts.. poor kids. Anyways...Great resort...awesome vacation..great staff, great food, awesome service..don't listen to the bad reviews!

The beach and ocean are important to us so we were looking for a nice beach where you were not afraid to go in and step on rocks suddenly while swimming or step in a huge hole. I read the reviews and do take them with a grain of salt so expected it to be a bit rocky when you first go in but not when you are already far in and the bad part was that the water was not clear so you never knew what to expect when trying to stand somewhere. Now you could walk about 10 minutes to another resort for clear less rocky water but who wants to do that every time you want to swim when you are on vacation. If you are looking to have your kids stay at the kids club for some specific entertainment during the day then this is not the place for you. The staff did have activities on the beach and pool which my kids participated in but I did not leave them alone and in the evening there is a kid\u2019s disco which my kids liked to go to. So the kids had a nice time but this was not the kind of kids club I was expecting. The reviews on service are true and are a bit hit or miss but once you find the restaurant or buffet with the good service then we just kept going to those places. The reception desk service was not good as they were not happy to change anything on the reservation when we first checked. If you have trouble walking up steps then make sure you book the ground or second floor or ask to have a room near an elevator since there are so few for the large buildings. So you end up walking too far to the elevator when would be much faster just to climb up those steps. We enjoyed the food at the buffet and the restaurants. This is not gourmet but it was just fine for a family vacation. The evening entertainment was ok but not close to other shows we have seen at the other Riviera Maya resorts.

We brought lots of sunscreen, we never had to use it. We didn't bring bug spray and went thru two bottles, we were eaten alive, so that was not very nice. I'd have to agree that the service was terrible, at the buffet, restaurants and pretty much everywhere else, that was very disappointing. The fondue restaurant was great on our 1st visit, disappointing on our second. The Italian had good food, crappy service. The Japanese was good, make sure you book the Hibatchi. The weather did not co-operate, rained 5 out of 7 days, but we still enjoyed the pools and beach. The resort is big and walking to get anywhere is a must, we did not mind though. The upgrade to Platinum was $30 pp/pn, so for $120/night is just was not worth it. If you take a laptop DO NOT pay for the connection, it never really worked and not worth $50 US for three days of crappy service. You can use the internet cafe but it was pricey, $10 US for 30 mins. We heard many complaints while we were there, and they had many staffing issues. With all the rain we found so many leaks, holes in ceiling, etc... the structure certainly would not pass any safety codes in Canada, kinda scary! The grounds were beautiful and clean. The swim-up bars were rarely open :( I don't know if it was just our timing but there was no good snorkelling off the beach. It would be nice to have better food options after 10pm, the Sports Bar food was terrible. Room service was not included and we were not about to pay for it. We rented a car from Playa, the hotel was double the price. We did Tulum (Coba was better but still a good tour), Hidden Worlds (highly recommend) and Akumal. I would encourage anyone going down to please take donations to Akumal to the Hekab Be Biblioteca, google it. They are is desparate need of school supplies, clothing, etc... If you want the free shuttle to Playa you must book the day ahead and it books VERY quickly...we took a cab. The kids/teens club was not operating during our visit, so I cannot comment but after seeing the staff there, I would not have left my kids anyhow.

We had originally booked a one week stay but because of some problems with our booking, Westjet sent us out two days earlier AND upgraded our whole family of 6 to Platinum. Having read most of the reviews on this site I will try to share only my views that differ from what you have read below. First of all, I would like to make it clear that Sunset and Riviera are the same resort and share all the same ammenities. They are just two different names for the two sides of the resort. Sunset was closed during slow season but opened up while we were there. I am surprised that none of the previous reviewers mentioned Hurrican Ida. While she went through far south of the GRP we definitely felt her presence. The skies were dark gray for the first four days of our vacation and it rained off and on all day. Our platinum suites faced the ocean and had full walk out balconies that were lovely to sit out on and have a bath (platinum suites have jacuzzis on their decks!) but we were on the ground floor so as the rain water accumulated on the deck it began to spill into our rooms! There are drain spouts on the 2nd and 3rd floors that empty right onto our space so there was a lot of water. We never called the cleaning ladies about this problem. I don't think they could have done anything about it. The decks should have been built so that the water drained AWAY from the rooms. We put towels down in front of the glass doors every day. Eventually the sun came out and we had no more problems with water in our rooms but the musty smell was there for the entire stay. I talked to a lady in the rooms above us and they had no problem with leaks so you may want to consider staying on an upper floor. Also, much of the view of the beach is blocked by bushes if you are on the ground floor. The Platinum was nice. We enjoyed the private lounge the most. We had our own concierge to book restaurants anytime and our own bartender and snack bar. The bar in that lounge only served premium liquours, whereas in the rest of the resort you had to ask specifically for a name brand. We were a family of 6 so we would never have paid for platinum. If you have a tight budget you will have a very nice holiday here even without Platinum, however you should really consider getting Platinum if you are going to be staying here during any of the really busy seasons. We didn't really need the private beach or pool (the platinum pool is very little) because the resort was very quiet while we were there but it might be nice when the resort is crowded. The Platinum lounge also has free internet which our kids enjoyed during the thunderstorms but was not really necessary. We brought water shoes because of the advise on this site but when we got there I wondered why we had bothered. There were very few rocks. However, after the storm went through it was a different story - rocks everywhere! I noticed that several other resorts along the beach had sand bags in the water. I guess that was to keep the waves from tearing up the beach and bringing in the rocks. Those sandbags were a real eyesore. I would rather have a beautiful beach and a few rocks. Bring your watershoes along to play it safe. We bought ours at Walmart. We also brought along a few cheap airmattresses and they were really fun for riding the waves although I did burn my back terribly after only an hour. We never figured out where the boogie boards were kept. Then again, we never asked. The food was delicious everywhere. I encourage you to try everything even if it looks weird or has a strange name. It was all great. I decided to try the 'oats and milk' (porridge) one morning and then I had it everyday afterwards! It was delicious and was really easy on my poor overworked tummy. We also ate the salsa, guacamole and chips everyday. The soups at the buffets were also outstanding. I noticed this at the resort we stayed at last year and it was the same here. Some of the combinations at the restuarants were a little strange but they were all good. For example, at 'Le Fleur' I had the best beefsteak (I think it was tenderloin) that I have ever eaten but it was served with a chocolate cupcake! After I had been to a few restuarants I asked the waiter what most people liked the best before I ordered and he was happy to point that out to me. My husband and boys went to the buffett for dinner one night while my daughter and I went to the Japanese restuarant alone. They said the buffett was very, very busy! The wine is not good anywhere but all the drinks are wonderful. I was really amazed at how many fancy drinks the bartenders had to make. We went to Xel-ha. Unfortunately, it rained most of the day that we were there but I'm sure it would be a fabulous in the sunshine. The food there was really wonderful and a great deal when travelling with a big family. We also went on a tour of Tulum/Coba. It was fascinating. Tulum was very hot as it is out in the open but there is a beautiful beach there. If I went back I would take the public transit, pack a lunch and spend a whole day. I think admission is only $5. Coba was amazing. It is in the jungle - very nice and shady. Surprisingly enough, there were no mosquitos there. I wish I would have read about Mexican history before I went. I plan to do so now. The guides were very well informed but they were switiching back and forth between English and Spanish so I think we missed a bit. They were more than happy to answer our questions later. We love Mexico. Our favourite thing about Mexico is the people. On and off the resort we found the Mexicans to be exceptionally friendly and gracious. We went to Mass in Playa del Carmen on Sunday and were warmly welcomed there. We felt like family. Whenever we went on tours we were always picked up and dropped off right on time. I would go back in a minute. I would try to get a room as close to the beach as possible to limit the walking a little, and I would pack water shoes and a couple of extra towels. Don't be tempted to take the cheap booze in your rooms home. There is much better stuff at the duty free and you are only allowed 1.5 L per adult.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cI would go back tomorrow, for another week in paradise.\u201d", "Author": "Syl", "ReviewID": "UR49353835", "Content": "GENERAL REVIEW I am not a complainer and am writing this review to balance the negative comments that have been made! This is my 5th AI (Cuba, Dominican all 4.5*-5*) and it was by far the best. A week in paradise, catered to by cheerful competant staff, on an impeccably kept resort, in a culturally rich spot. Enjoyed every minute of it, and would go back tomorrow. ARRIVAL We met up with our TMR bus and arrived at the hotel late in the evening. After a 45 min ride to the resort (only one other stop) we were checked through quite efficiently. Room was ready (JNR Deluxe Suite) and our luggage was sent there, while we took the Chariot (small tram service) While the main buffet was closed, a bar with 24 hour food was open and more than willing serve us both drinks and food at 1:30am. Good: Efficient, no waits. Bad: They COULD escort you to your room, but the tram driver was more than happy to direct us. ROOM Just like in the pics. Marble floors, view of the pools and palm trees, new marble/granite bathrooms with jaccuzi and large stone shower. Decadent. Large safe. Wide screen TV. Fridge that was replenished daily. Free bottle of tequila. The rooms in building 6 are closest to the beach without being in 'platinum'. Next time, I would book platinum purely for it's location and perks. Good: Comfortable bed, no insects, beautiful luxurious bathroom, spectacular view Bad: Not quite enough drawer space . Could use some more hooks/racks in bathroom for wet towels. Obviously a smoking room, so a vague smell of smoke when you walk in. FOOD: I thoroughly enjoyed the main buffet, but found that the buffets that are open for breakfast/lunch down near the beach are even better. There is a wide variety of Mexican food (what a treat) plus american food for the less adventuresome. The a la Carte restaurants were very good, and you can try a new one every night. You must book a day or two in advance. Our favourites were the Japanese grill, Miso, and the Mexican restaurant. We heard the Italian was excellent as well. Tip. The servers are worth it, and it certainly makes a difference. Good: Buffets were well stocked, and great quality. VERY flavourful, many choices. Combination of ready cooked food, pasta bar where they will make you your meal as you wait, and desserts that actually taste good (unlike Cuba) Service was fast and very attentive. Starting my day with a Mimosa is something I will miss! Bad: I ate too much. Seriously? NO complaints, and I am a chef. Oh wait. Horrible wine ;o) so order mixed drinks instead.... BEACH Stunningly beautiful. Very walkable, lots of room to set up for the day. Water was a little rough, but a hurricane had just blown through the day we came. On the beach you can get a massage (20$ for 30 min), take out non motorized equipment, or shop. You are NOT constantly accosted by people selling stuff, which is nice. Good: walking beach, clean, lots of beach chairs, tables with shade Bad: rocks in the water so walk carefully, use mosquito repellent if you are out late afternoon Excursions: We did the Rio Secreta, underground caves. Very non touristy and breathtaking. Only discovered in 2006, and they are trying to keep it as 'untouched' as possible. Not for the faint hearted as it involves wading, swimming, walking, crouching throughout the cavernous trail. Tulum was also a good excursion to some Mayan Ruins, although next time I think I would do Coba. Playa del Carmen: if you are a shopper, a people watcher, or just want to have fun at a tequila bar, Playa has it all. The shop owners are a little pushy, but as two women we never felt threatened or in any danger at all. Be careful! If you have spent a week at the resort remember while you are 'off resort' that you have to be careful what you eat! I had coconut at a fruit stand, and am still paying the price two days later!! MISC TIPS/QUIRKS - Tip. It puts a smile on their faces, and improves the service and the drinks! - Some things are done in 'mexican time'. If they say an excusion will have you back at the hotel at 3, that could mean 5.... -Bring and USE mosquito spray, especially at dusk. -Be prepared to walk. It is a large resort. But the walks are stunning. Enjoy them. -The walkways can be VERY slippery when wet. -Book Platinum. It seems it is worth it. To upgrade once you get there is 425$/person, so MUCH more expensive than booking right from the start. For those who care: Cells and Internet - if you need your laptop, you can get wireless for the week for 69$ - I'm with Bell Mobility, and had full coverage by calling them first. I will go back.

First the Bad: Food in the buffet - not very good. No variety, same thing everyday. Nothing was warm and at breakfast, how can you ruin bacon? They can, it was way overcooked. To much fried food, always cold. Look out if it rains- the floors are very, very slippery. Some people fell, saw one young girl that looked like she had a concussion after falling on the sidewalk. Takes about 20 minutes to walk from the front of the resort to the beach. There is only one small shack type beach bar for such a large resort- one day I waited in line for 40 minutes just to get two cerveczas. Only one bartender on duty. No snacks on the beach in the afternoon other than a hot dog/hamburger cart. On the one day we wanted a snack it had allready shut down. MOSQUITOS - I can't tell you how many times I was bit. I would wake up at night scratching my feet. How horrible to shower before going out for supper and instead of spraying on a splash of perfume to have to douse yourself with mosquito spray! Also at any time of the day or night, they go through the grounds spraying those horrible chemicals to breath in, I just feel sorry for the worker who has to do that wearing no breathing apparatus. The Good The grounds are beautiful, very well kept. The rooms are large and are kept very clean, although maid service was never at the same time, sometime in the morning, other times late in the afternoon. No towel art. You can go to the ala-carts every night which was a blessing as the food there was much better then the buffet, but you can only book two days in advance. There was a really nice coffee bar set up each night where you can order special coffees with different liquor, was very good. Staff were friendly but spread thin and did the best they could. We tipped alot and I don't think it mattered either way, there just were not enough of them. The Broadway Show & Mexican show in the theatre were very good, others were not as good. As a side note: If you get a chance while sitting around in the lobby in the evening, have your shoes shined by Miguel. He does a very good job and works for tips. Come on people, help him out.

We travelled with a group of 12 with ages ranging from 7-65. I am a travel agent and have travelled a fair bit, including stays at many 4-5 star all inclusives including 2 previous in the Mayan Riviera. I will start by saying that this resort is definitely the most beautiful and has the best beach that I have stayed at. The location is the best, not too far from the airport (40 min) and close to Playa del Carmen (10-15min). I am a firm believer that life is what you make it and if you want to have a great time then you will. That being said, I do feel that this resort has quite a few operational issues that do need to be addressed and remedied. Check-In: Arrived around 7pm to a very small line-up. The process was very slow and my personal service took approx 30 minutes. The employee checking me in was not friendly or helpful. I was not told / explained any information about the resort at all. I had booked 2 rooms for my family of 5; 2 adults, 3 children ages 15, 12 and 7. I had requested via my tour operator and emailed the resort directly and asked for 2 rooms with a connecting door as I know for a fact that there are quite a few connecting rooms at this property. We did not get this request met, I was told to check tomorrow and when I did I was told the same thing again and I got tired of checking as after a few days moving rooms is really not that appealing. This was a big disappointment to me. I think with a little foresight and planning families could be better accommodated. I spoke to a few couples who were put in rooms with connecting doors and were quite unhappy as there is a noise issue with those doors (can hear everything in other room). With a little pre planning couples could be placed in regular rooms first saving those connecting rooms for groups travelling together and large families booking more than 1 room. This is one small detail where all involved would be much happier. Rooms: This is a very large resort and the room layout is confusing, numbers go down and then they go up. We were pointed in the direction of our rooms, but not escorted via employee or trolley. Luckily, we had relatives already there to show us the way or I would have been lost. We were in building number 8, closest to the lobby. Unless you have platinum I would suggest that building 6 is the most desirable as it is more central to pools and beach. Besides the connecting door we had requested 1 room with a King and 1 room with 2 beds. I do not think this resort has many 2 bedded rooms as I spoke to many families and all were given just 1 king bed. I called the front desk upon arrival and requested cots. They were set up within 30 minutes and were standard twin size beds so really quite comfortable. The rooms are very large and the bathroom is very nice and well set-up. Bathroom amenities included shoe shine cloth, comb, shampoo (no conditioner), insect wipes, sewing kit, shower cap, body scrubber and small tissue package. We did have a few minor issues with fridge, air conditioning but these were fixed within minutes of requesting service. Room also has large balcony. You need to insert your room key into a small device upon entering as this activates your electricity. I like the environmental advantage to this, the only pain is that every time you leave your room your clock goes out and needs to be reset. Mini Bar was stocked daily with water, beer, pepsi, 7-up and Orange Pop. Safe is complimentary and uses a 4 digit code of your choice. The closet is large with lots of room for storage. They are working to open a new section across from building 8. It looks almost ready, but if you are going right away we were woken up on several mornings at 7am from construction noise. Resort amenities: Lots of pools, one is the main activity pool with the DJ set-up playing music and games all day. There are also several quieter pools and kiddie pools. Several of the pools have the swim up bars (sometimes open sometimes not). This resort works with the towel card system, you get the card and exchange it for a towel, problem is that they do not have enough towels so 7 out of 10 times that you try and get a towel they do not have any! The gym is quite big for a resort and has lots of equipment to get a good work-out. They also offer Yoga and Spinning Classes for a fee ($10 I think). I did not figure this out until the last day or would have signed up. There is also archery, tennis, basketball, rifle shooting, water polo, beach volleyball, pottery painting and more. The resort offers a ton of activities but unfortunately, they are not well advertised or listed so they are underutilized due to guests not being aware of their existence. This is really unfortunate. Massages are offered on the beach everyday 30 minutes $20 or 60 minutes $40. This is very reasonable and they were always busy. You can just walk up or set an appointment time. I had one and it was fantastic. We did not use the kids club as when we went to check it out it was closed. We found out on the last day the club was open on the Sunset Side. Had we been given an info sheet with activities and times for events at check-in I am sure we would have utilized the kids services at some point. The bus service to Playa books 1 day in advance and was always full when we tried to book. We paid for a taxi $14 each way. As other reviews have stated the walkways / floors at this resort are very dangerous and slippery. I cannot count the number of times that I almost slipped and fell. I saw several people fall and hurt themselves. Bring shoes with very good grip on the bottom. I do not recommend this property for anyone with reduced mobility as there is a ton of walking to get anywhere and shuttle service is very limited. The beach is very large, soft sand, and plenty of loungers and palapas for shade. There are no sand bags at this resort as it is a bit sheltered. There can be pretty good waves, but we enjoy this. You can walk out a long way into the ocean and still touch. There is also drink service at the beach. Public washrooms are large, clean and conveniently located throughout the property. Mosquitos are very bad, the worst I have ever seen and have been to the Mayan in November before. Bring Bug Spray and apply it around 4pm as the sun starts to drop. The entertainment at 8:30pm most nights in the central courtyard by the main buffets is excellent. The shows in the theater at 9:30pm are standard resort entertainment, lip singing and dancing. Internet is available in the lobby or downstairs by the sports bar $10 for 30 minutes. Bring a pen and paper as when you log off you are given a very long code that you can use later to utilize your remaining minutes. Food: 2 large buffets at the lobby end (only 1 opens for dinner?) and 2 by the pools and near the beach for breakfast and lunch. We found the service and food better at the beach buffet. The food selection was very repetitive day to day and did not have as much selection as the other resorts we have stayed at. Food tasted really good just did not find as much variety. Service in the buffets was very inconsistent, sometimes excellent other times could not even get a glass of water or plates cleared. They have many a la cartes and I highly recommend them. You can book for the current day and for the next day in advance. There is no limit on the number of a la cartes you can visit, just depends on how organized you are in setting up the reservations! We ate at the Grill and Italian and both were very good. Others in our group ate at the Seafood and found it very good as well. Sports Bar is the only 24 hour option and serves burgers, hotdogs and nachos. They also have table soccer and pool. Summary: It is my opinion that many employees have recently been hired on as the demand and occupancy levels have increased for the winter season. It appeared that much of the resort (Sunset side) has been closed for an extended period. As a result, the resort seemed brand new again with what seemed to be a lot of confusion in the staff and made for very inconsistent, slow service. The main issues that the resort needs to address in my opinion: \u2022 Training of staff to ensure consistent high level service \u2022 Hire additional staff to meet demand, bar, buffet, and restaurant staff seem very overworked \u2022 Transport Guests to their room on trolley car as many people get lost in the dark \u2022 Buy more pool towels \u2022 Resurface walk ways to prevent injury \u2022 Rotate the Buffet Food and Introduce Theme Nights \u2022 Publish a weekly newsletter or add it to the TV so that guests can see all of the options / activities offered with times and details. \u2022 Put the Customer First, the answer should not always be sorry, no, or come back tomorrow. Fix the problems right away to create a repeat customer and encourage referrals. As I said in the beginning, this resort is very beautiful and if you want to have a great trip then you certainly will. I would have a hard time coming back here due to the service issues, but the location really cannot be beat.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cParadise\u201d", "Author": "MyleneTendler", "ReviewID": "UR49179436", "Content": "We stayed at the GRP from Nov 5 to12th and we loved it!

The resort is big but it only took us about 5-6 min from the front lobby to our room which was the last before the beach (building 5). There is a shuttle that goes from the lobby to the platinum which we used a few times. The food was delicious. Many buffets to satisfy our hunger and one was even opened until 23hrs at night. The sports bar was open 24hrs and we could get food there as well. There are many pools and we thought they were well maintained. 3 swim up bars which were not all opened during our stay but the bar behind it was so we could easily get a drink. Service was good except at the buffets. Many times we had to grab our drinks ourselves but really not a big deal as we have to grab our food anyway. The beach is pretty rocky. I would definitely bring shoes on my next trip. The sand is soft but as you get in the ocean the rocks are pretty painful. Lots of chairs available any time during the day. A must see: 5th ave in Playa del Carmen. There is a free shuttle that leaves at 12 noon and bring you back around 6pm. You have to reserve 1 day in advance but well worth the trip. We took a cab and went in the evening. The cab ride was 13 usd to go adn 14 usd to get back. We felt really safe.

There is a fair walk from the reception to the beach but if you, like us, are lucky enough to have a room in the middle of the resort you are not far away from both. When designing the resort the builders obviously took into account the distance to the beach and tried to make the walk as pleasing to the eye as possible. The rooms were comfortable and clean upon our arrival but they did not stay this way. The maid service is frankly appalling, we stayed for 12 nights and the room didn\u2019t receive a proper clean the entire time we were there. We complained to reception that the bathroom hadn\u2019t been cleaned at all, when the maid came she just laughed at the state of the place and gave everything a quick wipe over, which is such a shame as the common areas are kept immaculately clean. Half way through the week our toilet over flowed due to a faulty ball-cock, and flooded our bathroom. We rang reception but it was over an hour before anyone arrived, by which time we had fixed the toilet and used the towels to soak up the water before it could spread into the bedroom. When the maid arrived she give the bathroom a quick mop but left the soaking wet towels in the bath and despite us asking for the towels to be changed at reception we didn\u2019t get nay clean ones until the next day so we were left 24 hours without so much as a hand towel. We also had constant problems with trying to get the fridge restocked and more coffee. We asked at reception everyday for coffee as we hadn\u2019t received any since the first day and for the fridge to be refilled and were assured that these things should be done daily but it took us a week before we got anything put in the fridge and we are still waiting for the coffee. The times of the room cleaning are completely unfathomable also, one day we had the maid waiting for us to leave at 9am, the next we were waiting for our room to be cleaned at 5.30pm (not very good when you are booked in a restaurant for 6pm.) The a la cart restaurants served excellent food and on the whole the service was friendly and fast. don\u2019t make the same mistake we did and order beef Carpaccio in the Italian, its strips of raw beef. We booked into the a la carts as many nights as possible because the buffet was awful. We stayed in a resort not far from the Princess in April, which was supposed to be a lower standard but they beat the Princess\u2019s buffet hands down. The selection was extremely poor and the standard wasn\u2019t anything to write home about. We stopped eating in there after one of our part bit into a burger that wasn\u2019t just undercooked, it was still stone cold in the middle. The majority of the staff are friendly and welcoming, Annabell is a dream, she really went out of her way to make our holiday as enjoyable as possible but a few of the waiters and barmen are only interested in looking after the people who give them a tip with every drink. I agree with tipping but if you are going to be expected to give $2 with every drink you order you might as well go self catering. The excursions\u2019 are definitely worth going on. We went snorkelling in underground and open cenotes, cliff diving and snorkelling in Acumel Lagoon to see the turtles and tropical fish which was an experience of a life time. You need to be a strong swimmer for the lagoon though. All in all I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone to cancel if they had booked the Princess but make sure you get the desk early to book a restaurant every night and probably pack some cleaning stuff and you will be fine.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cHad a good time!\u201d", "Author": "Chicagokris", "ReviewID": "UR49010166", "Content": "Warning, this is very long! We arrived on Sunday, Nov 1st at about 2:00 PM. We had requested a king bed and to be close to our friends who traveled with us. We easily got both. We were in swim up rooms 6044 and 6045, right next to each other and they were ready! Our luggage was taken down to the room for us and we decided to walk down but had been offered a ride in the trolley. Well, it was quite a walk in our airplane clothes, but once we got to the room it was fine. It was clean and quite large. The refrigerator had 2 beers, 2 seven ups, one orange soda, one \"light\" pepsi, one regular Pepsi, one Club soda and 3 large bottles of water. There were 4 bath towels, 4 hand towels, 2 bath mats, (one by tub and one by shower)-but no wash cloths. Toiletries included 2 small bottles of shampoo/body wash combo, a bar of soap, 2 mosquito wipes, a comb, shoe polisher, small pack of tissues, and a body puff. They refilled all of these on a daily basis. The mosquito wipe was practically worthless, though. It was only big enough to wipe one leg and foot! For the most part, the room was kept clean. One day we only got 2 bath towels, one day we didnt get any mats, one day just 2 hand towels. So although it wasnt a big deal, that service was pretty spotty. There are 3 buffet areas here. 2 main ones, very close to each other near the main lobby's. One for Sunset, one for Riviera. The Sunset sid of the hotel was closed while we were there, except for the Platinum suites. One night the Sunset buffet was open and one night the Riviera buffet was open. One of these 2 were both open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A third buffet was located down near the beach, but was not open for dinner, just breakfast and lunch. This area was turned into 2 ala carte restaurants at night. One was La Fleur which they billed as a Swiss. It was fondue and for the most part was pretty good, although, service was a little spotty. The other restaurants we ate in were Mamma Mia, which was excellent and La Hacienda, which I thought was also excellent. Reservations do have to be made in the lobby. They open at 7 AM and one day we got there about 10 AM and couldnt get any! So we had to have the buffet again that night. The buffets are the only places open for lunch. There is a sports bar where you can get a hot dog, hamburger or Nachos, but we never used it. We went there in the evening to watch some of the World Series and it was quite dead. (however the resort itself was quite empty until Thursday). There is an internet room next door to the sports bar, but the cost was $20 (US) for 30 minutes access. The other internet was located near the lobby, but when we tried it there, the whole room was dark and the front desk didnt seem to have any answers as to why or when it would be fixed. The bars---there was an outdoor bar downstairs from the lobby which had entertainment. Service was slow, and the mosquitos were out. There was a bar in the lobby-same deal. Sometimes slow service and pretty much outdoor at night, the mosquitos got to you. Each pool area had a bar. However, the bar at the main pool was closed on Wednesday, after it rained. Even though there were people sitting out and in the water-I couldnt figure out why they kept it closed....and down on the beach, there wasnt a soul there, but the beach bar was open! Go figure. This was after a major rain storm and the entire beach was empty-but the water was warm and my friend and I just floated in peace and quiet. NO sun, but pleasant warm water. So, all in all, the food was fine. (I liked the beach buffet better for breakfast) The bars were ok, but service could be quite slow if they were busy. This resort is quite long.distance wise. It is a lengthy walk from the beach area to the lobby-not necessarily too long, but at night, when the mosquitos were out in full force, it was uncomfortable. So we usually took the trolly up to the lobby. We usually didnt have to wait too long, but sometimes not all 4 of us could fit, so someone would have to wait, or walk. Thats because the first stop coming back was from the Platinum rooms and it would sometimes get full there. There was only one trolley running until Thursday night. It seemed like there were quite a few check ins on Thursday, so another trolley was added. this helped speed things a long a little bit. The resort does need to work on its people skills. I know that it is in a foreign country, but the communication leaves a lot to be desired. The front desk clerks spoke English, but sometimes it seemed as if they didnt want to understand you if you had a complaint, so that they didnt have to address the issue. The maids, custodial staff, and most bus boys just looked at you with a smile if you tried to ask for something. So, for the most part our stay here was quite fine. It really is a nice, pretty, well maintained resort. Most of the other complaints that I have read about here are true. Mainly, mosquitos at night were bad, floors were horrible! The most dangerous, slippery, marble floors in a resort that caters to water activities and alcohol drinks. Add in a few raindrops, and people were sliding all over. Granted, none of these things ruined our vacation. We actually had a great time, and you will too, if you dont stress the small stuff. If you are booked here already, you will certainly enjoy it.", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Myrtle Beach SC - USA", "Title": "\u201cGrand Princess, Playa del Carmen exceeded expectations\u201d", "Author": "Murrell89", "ReviewID": "UR48211161", "Content": "THE GRAND RIVIERA (& Sunset) PRINCESS in Playa del Carmen exceeded all our expectations based on the brochure, on-line info, reviews, and our travel agent. Our six days there Oct. 19-26, 2009 were superb. We definitely plan to return. We have traveled to eight Caribbean islands, 6 countries, and many cities and this is the best yet. Only the Acapulco Princess comes close. We are a retired couple, aged 65, who loved this place and the people. Service was great all around. If you wanted it, and didn\u2019t see it, just ask! Admittedly, we had a PLATNIUM SUITE upgrade via BOOKIT.COM which largely accounts for our excitement about the resort. Also, the lack of a crowd and children guests made a big POSITIVE difference to us (due to the off-season). The younger set likely will like a bigger crowd and more \u201cnight life.\u201d We do NOT like crowds or lines and this resort apparently is crowded in-season. The huge Platinum Suites (\"club\") lobby was great for socializing. Notable for us were: this private lobby with 24-hr concierge, private bar, bartender (7am-11pm), premium drinks etc., hors d'oeuvres (am-pm), computers, beautiful decor, private pool & beach with butler-served free drinks. The thatch-roofed cabanas were great for pure lying-out resting (no backs for sit up); shade abounds at all pools and the beach. Pools were \u201ceverywhere.\u201d The grounds were beautiful and very well kept. Our shuttle was on time, every abt. every 10 min. The staff was courteous and helpful. Platinum staff standouts were: Concierge, William; Bar, Romiro; breakfast, Ricardo (at PC club area). The free computer use and direct, on-time shuttle service was great. Shuttle is very important at this LARGE facility. There was nightly entertainment by the resort staff; it was good, but not great. The food was very good as was presentation. Crowds were small at the six restaurants that we chose; we did not eat at the seafood specialty place. The Le Fleur Restaurant had one of the best beef filets that I\u2019ve ever had. Each restaurant had limited menu choices (mostly 2 each for appetizers, soups, and 3 entries). Variety is achieved by choosing different themed restaurants each night (i.e., Italian, fish, steaks, etc). NOTE that the dress code IS enforced at dinner. We had no problem with this, as \u201cdress\u201d is casual .. read the brochure info. Advance reservations are required for dinner, via the concierges. Security was good, but not obtrusive. There were no fights, troublesome drunks, loudness, etc. What can be improved? Signage in general and the slick marble floors when wet were dangerous. Our key concerns were the mosquitoes and a few bugs that ventured into the room (normal in tropical climates). Bring lots of STRONG insect repellent \u2026 we did and had no bites. Again, we look forward to a return visit to \u201cthe Grand Princess Resort.", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, Wales", "Title": "\u201cLovely relaxing hotel\u201d", "Author": "imacmarky", "ReviewID": "UR48162312", "Content": "The hotel is rated 5-star but I would rate it at 4 stars.

We stayed in the Villa Laguna and were very impressed. The room was immaculate, complete with a jacuzzi tub and a beautiful outdoor shower. The air conditioning and fan saved us many days from the heat. There was a private pool for the villa laguna guests which where we spent most of our time. There were beautiful cabanas and comfy wooden lounge chairs. The bartender made the best drinks in the whole resort and during slow times he would come and bring you your drinks. There was free room service but nobody mentioned it to us until afew days before we left. We also both had a free 30 minute massage, manicure, pedicure and facial every week you stayed, I was very excited for my appointment at 9:30(which was written on a card for me to remember) but when i showed up I was told my massage was at 9:00. I rescheduled it for 2:30 that day and when I finally got the appointment it was a huge dissapointment. The massage was so soft and the facial, manicure and pedicure was nothing more than a salt scrub, my husband opted for a massage 10 minutes longer and gave up the other stuff and he was severly disspointed as well. We never ever went back for the free massage the next week, this was by far the most dissapointing part of the resort BUT it was free so we both had a few drinks and forgot about it. We found we were more pool people than beach people but we did go to the beach a few times and it was very nice. One day I had a great massage on the beach for $40. The water was rocky like all the other reviews said. All the restaurants were okay, the italian being the best and the mexican being the worst. They were understaffed and that was obvious at dinner and at the bars. We had a free dinner at the Thai restaurant and were disspointed, we were given a seperate menu with two meal options, vegetarian and meat and the choices were poor. Other people around us had wonderful meals with many options. Again the meal was free and we just went to the buffet afterwardso how angry can you get? They worked hard for their meger pay so we tipped often. I found the desserts were very dissapointing except the ice cream, they were very bland although they all looked great, they definetly were not worth eating. I believe the booze was watered down because I always asked for more booze and barely could feel or taste it. We do not party and read fair warning about the night shows so we never even bothered checking out the theatre or the disco. The gym was nice although the cardio equipment was placed looking at a bare wall and the music was poor.", "Date": "October 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you paid for!\u201d", "Author": "jlance1212", "ReviewID": "UR47957646", "Content": "Came to the resort for the Swim up rooms! When we got there the front desk advised us they \"upgraded\" us to the Platinum area. At first I was very upset as that was the reason I had chosen the hotel. They allowed us to go and view the Platinum area and then decide, although not sure if swim up was even available. This was solely due to them closing off the SUNSET side of the hotel and only using the RIVERA SIDE. They said they were only at 30% capacity. The building looked the same but when i asked someone at the resort...they said SUNSET was better. The strange part we saw NOBODY ever swimming by their swim up room all week and only in the Main pools...which there were many. PLATINUM UPGRADE - Not sure I would pay for it however we did have our our pool and private cabana's and cushioned lounge chairs. THey also have pool service for drinks. You have your own conseirgne in the platinum area to make your reservations for dinner for you....but when we went to do some trips...he said it was better to do them up front with BEST DAY TRAVEL. Another advantage of Platinum vs swim up was a shuttle service via large golf cart type vehicles than ran all day long. IF you were in swim up you couldnt just walk out of your room but rather walk all the way around the building and the golf cart didnt stop for other areas of the resorts....only Platinum area. ROOM KEYS - they are also control the lights and all electric in the room! Very energy efficient. Room key stays in there the whole time your in the room and you cant leave the lights all on when you leave. INTERNET - if you need it....they have 4 in the PLAATINUM lounge for free. The rest of the hotels must pay, POOLS - were all very clean and well maintained - LOTS of places to sit - never had to worry about reserving them in the morning! Now they said we were the last week of off season so not sure how it will be next week, GROUNDS - Very Nice and always out there working on it. BEACH - lots of chairs. SPECIAL area for PLATINUM and had someone to serve you drinks out there. Water has small waves so snorkeling right there would be impossble. FOOD/RESTUARANTS - Althought they mention lots of Resturants are there.....ONLY 1-2 Opened each night. Small portions and about 5 choices to choose from and NOTHING to write home about! Couldnt make more than 2 nights in advance. Stayed at the Platinum buffet for Breakfast. and lunch as the main buffets were so far. Husband and brother in law enjoyed the seafood resturants. Usually you Buffets arent as good as resturants, however totally opposite here! At least throught the conseirgne we could see the menus and make our decision to hit the buffer or not. STAFF AND HOUSEKEEPING - Very Nice and ALWAYS said hello when you went by them ~ NEVER a problem. Kept the rooms stocked with bathroom necessities. They had about 3-4 tiny bottle in the refrig. and lg bottle of wiskey, and 3 pint sizes bottles of run and tequila on the counter. Soda in Refrig. re-stocked daily. ALWAYS left them a few dollar tips everyday! ENTERTAINMENT - Typical musical entertainment numbers.... no need to waste your time. XEL-HA and Tulum trip - 118.00 usd at the resort so if you can do cheaper online...then do so. this includes transportation to and from so include that cost if taking a cab. No need to bring towels with you. SUGGEST you wear your swim suits as the first stop is Tulum and you cant walk down to the water after the tour to go in the water....Never mentioned this a we were not dressed but would have LOVED to go on this beach and in this water! BEAUTIFUL AREA! ALL FOOD and DRINKS are included and you go in the morning and return in the evening so make later reservations for dinner. Would suggest water shoes as the grounds are dirt. Take the shuttle to top of river and sloat your way down! The bus driver and tour guide try and sell you underwater camera and ECO-FRIENDLY sun screen for 12 dollars a bottle and tell you its cheaper. When you first get to Tulum they tell you they are giving you a BATHROOM break for the ladies....what they dont tell you the bathrooms are right inside a JEWELRY STORE....with HUNGRY SALESPEOPLE ready to help you!!!! The Myan jewelry is big in that store and a few smaller souvenier shops just outside... THEY WILL GO LOWER IN PRICE. familoy bought a baseball hat that the top zips off to be a visor....nice but 15.00 she paid for it. I walked up 1 minute later and bought same hat and a big beach bag for 20.00 for both. Keep walking away...they will come lower PLay del Carmen - $10-$14 USD taxi ride. Lots of stores....bars....etc. They are REALLY EAGER to sell you something and just about beg you to come in. DOnt say yes to the 1st person as the next few stores have the same stuff. Almost worth 2 smal trips as its alot to see there. Lots of taxi's to get you to and from hotel which is about 15 - 20 min ride. Stayed at Rui Palace which is closer to Playa...(walking distance) MUCH better food. Actually the reort is much nicer and ALL resturants were good and buffet was fabulous!

In many ways this resort is the best we've been, on par in other ways and below in a few areas. Where does it beat the others??? THE ROOMS are very nice and very spacious and better than any others we've stayed in . Our original standard room was more than adequate, spacious, well equipped and clean. However the standard rooms lack privacy due to being on the ground floor with an overlooked balcony area. For this reason we enquired about an upgrade which gave us a 2nd floor pool and sea view balcony and the biggest hot tub we have ever had in a room. It was overall a nicer room so we thought it worth the small cost to upgrade. THE BEACH is the best we've seen due to it being closer to Playa Del Carmen, as I understand it the closer you get the better the beach. It is the first time I have been able to snorkel from the resort in crystal clear water although it was only clear about a third of the time and the rest of the time it was too murky to see very far. My GF is scared stiff of the sea but even she enjoyed herself for the first time due to the fact that you can stand on the bottom even after going 100m or so into the sea. The sand is fine, does not get too hot and is easy to walk on bare foot with no stones etc. the first couple of feet into the sea is stoney but the rest is fine. In my opinion pool shoes are not worth bothering with. THE DISCO as a facility was head and shoulders above any of the other mexico resorts I have been to. It was a place we went to nearly every evening only to be let down by the fact that the resort was so under occupied that it had a maximum of 20 people inside at any one time and often less than 10. This was a real shame as I believe the Disco would have made the evenings far more entertaining as the music and lights were really very very good but useless without an atmosphere which can only be created by a crowd of people enjoying themselves. THE GYM. This was very well equipped, very clean with plenty of advice on hand if you need it. Fidel the instructor was very helpful and friendly. Where is it on par??? THE POOLS. Lots of them, nice temperature, very clean, lots of beds in the shade and in the sun all as you would expect from this sort of resort. THE BUILDINGS. All very nice, nothing looked shabby or in need of repair. Lots of modern touches which create a very nice feeling of a modern hotel. Although due to the size of this resort you do sometimes get the feeling of being in a fancy shopping centre as the resort lacks the personal touch you would get from a smaller or more normal sized resort. THE GROUNDS. Very well kept and much nicer than they look in the pictures. Always lots of workers working tirelessly to keep them this way The not so good bits. THE FOOD. Whilst not bad it was not as good as the other places we've been. The breakfast and lunch were buffet only and whilst the food was ok it was never amazing and got a bit boring for a 2 week stay. The evening al'cartes were better and I had some very nice meals but they fell slightly below what I was used to. My GF who is a vegetarian agreed but never went hungry. The real let down was the desserts. There were plenty of them and they looked great but they had no taste and were pointless in eating. Drinks were good and plentiful. THE ATMOSPHERE. This place was seriously dead. It was well under 10% full from what I could see. This resulted in only 2 or 3 resteraunts being open on any one evening and lots of facilities being closed. This was a real shame as I think this place could be real good fun if it was all open as it should be with enough people to create an atmosphere. It also was very frustrating as you could only book restaurants two days in advance from one place in the lobby. We went early every day but really struggled to get decent seating times, its was either 6pm or 9pm which considering the resort was so empty was really frustrating. We think that the good times were kept for Platinum guests. THE SERVICE. This was the biggest let down. Whilst on the whole the staff who were there were helpful and polite they were simply far far too stretched. The hotel has got rid of so many staff due to it being so empty but the amount of staff in the restaurants was shocking. They were literally running around and were so stressed whilst taking your order that it really ruined the dinning expirience. I felt so sorry for the staff and dont blame them individually for the poor service but the managment of this hotel need to understand that the staff make the resort and from what I understand they get paid next to nothing so why have they scrimped so much on such an important part of the holiday. On several evenings the staff were actually physically running around the restaurant trying to service their tables whilst the managers swanned around giving them a hard time. It meant that on some occassions we were not even offered drinks with our meal and didn't want to complain because you could see the staff were really trying their best! The staff did not time to be freindly and have a chat like in all of the other restorts we went to and they did come accross as being un-friendly. NO FREE ROOM SERVICE. This is the only resort not to offer free room service. I think it might have been free for the Platinum guests, however, I heard a lot of people saying that the platinum upgrade was not worth the huge extra cost! The rooms were the same size as the ones we had and were only decorated slightly differently, they did have better views but as there were mosquitos you couldn't sit on your balcony anyway! THE SIZE OF THE PLACE. This place is MASSIVE. The walk from our room to the main part of the hotel was about 1 mile. We are very fit and dont mind the walk but a mile? This would have been a real issue for some and they dont have carts running up and down the main strectch. The SPA area we decided not to use as it didn't look very appealing. We did visit it and found that the treatements were very very overpriced. I would expect to pay a fair bit in a nice hotel and have done in the past but I really felt the prices here were too much to justify. The evening ENTERTAINMENT was absolutely appalling and the worst we have seen. It basically consisted of the same staff every night dancing in a theatre to a different theme. We walked out after half an hour, we went back the next night to try another and left during that too. The staff were miming to songs and it was really really boring. In my opinion they should have outside entertainers coming in every night. The theatre itself was impressive and they could do alot more with the shows. The hotel did have a band on every night in the main open air bar, however, it was the same band every night and although they were good again it was the same music which was very tiresome! In all honesty this is one of the main reasons we will not return to the resort, as we were really very bored in the evenings, the hotel did run taxis to Coco Bongos in Playa del Carmen most nights (night club) but thats not really our scene and it cost about 50usd per person. We spent a bit of time in the sports lounge which had two pool tables which you normally had to fight to get a shot of and they had board games and a few table fusballs. I would imagine at peak time this place will be a nightmare! The RESTAURANTS the actual decoration of the restaurants compared to the other resort we have visited I think was a bit poor. The were all boxes with some decoration and they reminded me of an Amercan Mall, all glass fronted with absolutely no character! In other resorts were were treated likely royalty in the restaurants from the minute you walk in, however, as mentioned above, the staffing was so poor in these ones, we did not have good experiences from the bar staff to the welcome people - very disappointing! The actual food was ok, our favourite restaurant was the italian Mamma Mia where the food was nice but certainly not as good as any of the other resorts we have been to! Oh one other thing - remember to take mosquito guard! I went out on the first night without any one and got eaten alive. We did wear protection for the rest of the holiday and were fine but you definately need to wear protection and we saw a lot of people with nasty looking bites! This is a good place to go if you get a good deal like we did, we always make the most of our holidays and did enjoy this one but I certainly would not pay top dollar to stay here! If you want really good food and service i would recommend El Dorado Royale. For excellent evening entertainement, good food and service go to Excellence Punta Cana. For an excellent spa good service and good food - Blue Bay Grand Esmeralda. I would say go to this resort if you want a good beach, spacious, modern and nice rooms and lovely surroundings.", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cexcellent service and staff!!\u201d", "Author": "li2000nks", "ReviewID": "UR47346660", "Content": "Was worried aabout the previous negative comments, all I can say is those comments seem trivial ie bad tasting coffee, come on!

The best food was at the ala cartes - the Japanese restuarant was a delicous event! The service was excellent considering the resort seems to be a little under-staffed. Two drink servers by the pool is not enough for a resort that size, having said that, the servers that were working were terrific (and so were the drinks!). The snack food at the beach is not something you would want to have twice. If I were to make a recommendation to anyone it would be to book platinum - the rooms, the location, the private bar, pool and consierge made our holiday the most memorable in 23 years. The beaches don't compare to Punta Cana, but the hurricanes didn't help the situation.

There were a couple things about the hotel that were a little disappointing but nothing to say that it was an awful hotel Yes the service is a little slow but there is a language barrier and very busy all I can say is you are on holidays and you have all the time in the world what does it matter if they take any extra couple minutes before you get your drink or whatever you are waiting for. The service at the platinum pool and beach were a little slow but really it is like 10 steps to each bar not a big deal at all. The beach is beautiful a little rocky but again no big deal. The food was good a very big selection you can almost always find something to eat and the deserts are great! The al a carte selection of restaurants was great so many to choose from, make sure if you are in the platinum that you take advantage of the Thai restaurant because it is the best, every one was so unsure if that was included in the package because it isn\u2019t for just regular rooms but it is for platinum rooms so make sure to book it your first day so that you can get in! We never had any problems with our safe just make sure you hold the door closed well you punch in your number or it wouldn\u2019t latch, but if it doesn\u2019t latch it will beep like crazy till you close it properly.

The room was nice but was not what we paid for. The cleaning of the room was often inconsistent and we had to request things like soap and towels a few times. Not a big deal but you do find yourself waiting around for more than an hour for your service. We had an outdoor jacuzzi but it was only cleaned once during our two weeks so we didn't really use it. We were surprised that they sprayed the room for \"mosquitos\" once a week. After the first spray we found a very large, dead cockroach on the floor. Clearly mosquito is a codeword for cockroach at Princess. The Sunset side is actually a part of this resort. It was closed so the Sunset people were housed at the Riviera side. There was supposed to be a private buffet for the platinum upgrade but anyone was permitted to eat there. This brought waves of chaos and poor service - we often weren't able to get a beverage with breakfast or lunch because the service staff were too busy trying to clean dirty tables for the guests. The food was okay - not a great but not bad either. We were able to book a la cartes from the platinum lounge which was nice. The gym was excellent - very clean and machines were current. Nicely air conditioned. There were tons of screaming and misbehaved children at this resort. Definitely a negative. People tend to avoid the children friendly areas with their screaming bundles of joy and it takes away from the people who value serenity. I definetly will look for an adult only resort after this. The platinum pool was nice - it was smaller so it tended to be busy. The bartenders were excellent and often brought drinks out to the pool area for you. We tipped often because they really deserved it. We were surprised that nobody else tipped them during the day. We found the pool water got really grimy as the week progressed. You could see scum on the top and a couple of times our sunglasses got coated in it which was really gross. We just avoided the water on those days and went somewhere else. Be careful of the people who use the plantinum pool as a toilet. We were appalled to see a couple of disgusting ladies walk into the pool each time they needed to relieve themselves instead of walking to the bathroom which is just a few feet away. About the disgusting company that collects at the pool - we are Canadian and we were ashamed of this group of Canadians that used the pool as a toilet during our stay. We found that this group stuck together while we were there and were loud, obnoxious and generally uncouth. You always have these people around but it was quite shameful. About tipping - we found that very few people did it. That's really a shame as the staff works hard and they deserve something. We found that we got pretty good service overall and the tipping helped a little. The nightly shows at this resort were the worst I've ever seen. Even Cuba did a better job and that isn't saying much. The manager likes to perform in the show and she is quite possibly the worst performer that the world has ever seen. It's actually quite funny. We watched all of the shows for something to do but they really need to get some talent in there. I don't think the show added or took away from our stay but I hope they fix this. Public bathrooms - disgusting - the absolute worst I've ever seen. The bathrooms in the lobby were the worst of the public washrooms. Often only one stall was useable. I've seen things in these washrooms that I wish to never see again. Overall, the resort was nice enough - I was really disappointed to have been placed in the platinum area instead of the Villa because we were looking for the privacy and intimacy. If we had paid for a standard room we would have loved this resort. There was tons of value in that package.

I dont mind tipping but I dont expect to tip to get good service at a 5 star resort... I would of course have no problem tipping afterwards! The a la carte resturants were excellent with the Italian and Grill being the best. If your planning any trips I would recommend a trip to Coba (Mayan Village) and also the night out the Cancun. A trip into Playa Del Carmen is also worth it being about $15 in a taxi. Quite a few of the reviews complain about the size of the hotel grounds... not sure what there is to complain about its quite big but if you dont want to work then there is a free shuttle bus that takes you from one end of the resort to the other every 20 minutes..

Check in was a little slow due to the number of people that arrived with us but Reception tried to make it as smooth as possible, once checked in we were given a map with our room marked on it and you then tell the bell boys what room and they arrange to deliver your luggage to the room. Arrived at the room - we had a junior suite, and it was a lovely big spacious room with a huge walk in shower and very private balcony. Everything is provided in the room, a coffee percolator restocked daily with coffee, shower gel, mosquito wipes (would take your own though as we didn't find them to be effective), tissues, shoe shiners, exfoliators etc. You are also given Towel Cards which you exchange for beach/pool towels at the towel hut - we always returned them at the end of each day so we didn't have to take wet towels back to the room and got clean fresh ones the next day. Pool areas are huge and as the hotel was only 40% full we never had a problem finding a sunbed where ever we wanted. 2 swim up pool bars which had great service, you could have a noisy pool with entertainment and music or choose a quieter one - what ever you prefer. Beach - wow, white sand, turquoise sea, what more can you ask for. The sea is lovely and warm and is teeming with fish. It is a little rocky but once you get past this, it is endless soft sand. Beach Bar - again fantastic service, the only thing was the lack of chairs and tables to sit at - I am not keen on drinking and eating at the sunbed! If you are located at the lobby end of the hotel, which we were, it is probably a 10 minute walk to the beach through the grounds which we didn't mind in the slightest - there are two pool bars to stop at on the way. There is a 'wagon' type train that will take you if you prefer. Food - For all you people who have complained about this, what the hell do you eat at home??? If you have a junior suite as we had you can eat in the following: choice of two buffet restuarants with an absolutely excellent choice of food. A LA CARTES: Mexican, Grill, Italian, Seafood & La Fondue, all absolutely great with really good waiter service. Providing you book in advance you can eat A La Carte every night as there are no restrictions or limits - our favourite was the italian which we returned to 3 times, recommend the Veal Steak............ If you have upgraded to Platinum then you also get an Oriental (the Tepanyaki was not open during our stay due to the lack of guests) and an international a la carte included but if you haven't upgraded you can pay to eat in them for the equavilent of about \u00a320. There is a free bus into Playa Del Carmen every day which leaves the hotel at midday and returns at 6pm but you need to remember to book yourself onto to this the day before you go. If you don't then a taxi costs about \u00a37.50 - the prices are set and there is no need to haggle, they will all charge you the same. Mexico is really suffering at the moment with a lack of tourists so although I am sure that Playa Del Carmen could offer a fantastic night out there wasn't enough people about to make the most of it whilst we were there. There is lots to do trip wise, we swam with whale sharks which was amazing, visited the Mayan Ruins, scuba diving, Cenotes etc, take a look in town at the excursions they are far cheaper than through your holiday company for the same thing. Entertainment at the hotel - there is a nightly show in the theatre, a nightly event in the courtyard - for example a mexican market or fire eaters etc, something different every night. There is also a live band every night in the courtyard bar but beware they played the same set every night. The sports bar, open 24 hours a day offers some respite as it is air conditioned and if you are pining for the football you can catch it here. Finally for the party animals that haven't had enough there is a night club open until 2.30am. I can't recommend this hotel enough, the standard offered is fantastic and for everyone that has moaned I would suggest that you stay at home in the future!!!!!", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cMore than I could have imagined!\u201d", "Author": "Hcrenan", "ReviewID": "UR40427818", "Content": "After stalking the reviews on tripadvisor.com for the past 3 weeks, I now feel obligued to write one myself.

Neither one of us are \"hard to please\" people, but after reading the reviews, we decided to just have an open mind and still have a relaxing vacation. Everything was absolutely amazing about this resort! The check-in process went very smoothly and then we enjoyed a beautiful walk to our room, only waiting a matter of 2 minutes before our luggage arrived. We stayed in one of the Deluxe Junior Suites that had a swim up patio into the main pool. It was gorgeous! We definitely wanted to enjoy a lot of the pool activities, so we were so fortunate to have such great access to the pool! The bartenders and servers were awesome - they would do anything you asked them to! If I wanted my drink a certain way or with an extra shot, they would definitely accomodate. The beaches were gorgeous! Yes, they are a little rocky right when you walk in, but it becomes sandy smooth after a short walk. My favorite part of the beach was the massages! They had about 5 massage tables set up under a cabana and they did 1/2 hour massages for $20 and hour massages for $40 - quite the steal! And the best part of it all was that they knew what they were doing! I went down to the beach every morning and enjoyed a massage. The grounds of the hotel were so beautiful - most of the pictures we took are of the unique statues and the beautiful gardens. We enjoyed Miso and Mamma Mia the best and the buffet was also pretty good. Again, we are not very picky on food and they had a wide variety to please most people. We were also very fortunate that the hotel was maybe at 20% capacity that weekend - most kids were already back in school so it was a lot of adult groups, a wedding party and several couples from all over the world.

We also waited over an hour to get our suitcases delivered. WE didn't find out until day 3 that there is a open air golf like caddy that carries 9 people at a time that runs every 10 minutes. You need it. It is a beautiful hotel, the gardens and grounds are immaculate, however it is a long walk to anywhere and the heat is awful.. Especially if you are hungry and know that you've got that long walk before you even eat and then you you have to do it again after you have eaten in the boiling heat. There is no shade whatsoever along the paths and no seats anywhere to sit and get out of the sun. Room: We had a deluxe junior suite and it was brilliant complete with very large walk in shower and huge jacuzzi bath (tip - don;t put the bubble bath in until AFTER you have half filled it). If you read the leaflets, they clearly say that if you want your towels changed, leave teh dirty towels on the floor. We left dirty towels every morning and they were always replaced. No complaints about that at all. Food was so varied and first class and the good thing was a microwave so that you heat up your food. You know sometimes when you put the food on your plate and then have to queue up for something - by the time you get back to your table to eat, the food has gone cold. So the microwave was really good. Only real moan about was the butter - sorry margerine. It was awful and we couldn't eat it. WE ended up getting a taxi into Puerto Del Carman and bought some Butter (Lurpak). Kept in our fridge and took it with us to breakfast so we could have proper toast with proper butter mmmm heaven. English Yorkshire tea bags with English milk would have been perfect, but we were in Mexico so knew that this wouldn;t happen. The coffee was OK especially with coffee mate, but you had to ask for the coffee mate. I really do not understand anyone who could moan about the food here - there are enough restaurants to choose from and we found all of teh staff very pleasant and nice. Always ready with a hola and a smile. Maybe the complainers should try a smile first and see how differently others will treat them. Beach is gorgeous, though there are some large stones.rocks but you can go around them. So many pools to choose from, loud with action, quiet, no children, with children etc. Lots of showers around by the beach and pools. towels are provided - not stated in brochure so you don't have take your own. tHAT'S MORE ROOM FOR MORE SHOES FOR THE LADIES! Lots of A La Carte restuarants, mexican and Italian we found to be the best. NOTE; MEN HAVE TO WEAR LONG TROUSERS AND COVERED IN SHOES (TRAINERS ARE OK)- DOES NOT TELL YOU THIS IN THE BROCHURE AND MANY PEOPLE WERE PAYING TO GET A TAXI TO WAL MART (Asda) TO BUY A CHEAP PAIR OF TROUSERS.The grill was very disappointing. Drinks - well so many, as well as those not on the printed list like B52's and all sorts of wonderful names from USA and Canada. Try a Miami Vice or a lime Daiquiri! Another little special touch were the mexican speciality coffees served as you wait after your meal outside - very good. I have 3 things to mention that make this holiday 99% rather than 100%. Firstly the walking and the fact that no-one told us about the cart. Secondly not much atmoshphere at night around the place and lastly it is a good 15 minutes to Playa Del Carmen and is $12 US dollars there and $12 US dollars to get back plus tips. Not cheap really. It's no good getting the free coach it runs at Noon and picks you up at 6.00pm. Useless as it too hot to walk around the shops etc in 100 degrees for 6 hours. There are only so many mexican hats shops etc that you can look at - seen the first 5, seen them all. Would be better to have a free bus in the evenings as well. Playe Del Carmen rocks at night - great place, but expensive if you do it more than a couple of times as you have to allow for buying drinks, food and taxis. Had a great lobster and special Mayan Coffee - amazing and very good value for money! All in all a great holiday, very nice hotel, good service, good food and drink.

We were staying in a Junior Suit and wanted to upgrade but there were no available rooms so we settled in where we were. When we arrived in the room (very pleasant, clean, spacious) we found an invite to 'Honeymoon Cocktails' next to the sports bar at 5pm. Not having very much time, we put all the money in the safe - checked it was locked - had a quick wash and went out at 4.45 to go to the meeting. We got a bit lost and never did find the meeting room near the sports bar, so went for a meal and a drink and returned to our room at 7.30pm. We found that our combination for the safe wasn't working. In the morning, I asked reception to send someone up to the room to open it. Ten minutes later, they turned up with a machine with a USB attachment and opened the safe with it. It was then we discovered that ALL of our holiday money (wedding presents from friends and family) had been stolen. We then had our room and belongings thoroughly searched by security. We then had to wait for two hours for someone to come up to the room to 'read' the safe and door to find out who has entered. This would give them a printout of times the safe and door were opened. I spoke to the security guys and concierge and filled in a report and was assured that the culprit would be found and the problem resolve. For two days, every morning - I went to the concierge and there was no news. Our lovely Thompson rep, Darren, tried his best to help us and assisted us in moving to a Junior Delux room (not a much better room, but I felt more comfortable having been moved away from the other room). On the second morning, we met two other couples who had been stolen from, staying in our same building. On the third morning the security guy was called in to speak to me with the concierge. They told us that they had found the employee that had been in our room and that they had been fired as this was not the first time.It was at that point the concierge told us that as far as they were concerned, I had left the safe open at 5.13. I knew what time I had left the room and that this was impossible - and suggested that the thief had opened it at this time after we had left. They told me I was wrong - and conveniently - their insurance did not cover the loss when the safe was left open by a guest - I knew we had left half an hour before this time - but after a short debate I decided to just try to forget about it and try to make the most of the 9 days we had left. I was very upset. During our stay - we saw two couples being rather too 'intimate' toegther in the pool - without being too graphic. Other guests had words with them reminding them that they (nor their children) wanted to see! The buildings and gardens in this hotel are beautiful - the food was pretty good (especially the Italian restaurant) and we greatly enjoyed our visit to the Thai Beach Restaurant (not included for us - but \u00a3110 for champagne and four courses so not complaining). Booking for these restaurants is at a desk behind the lobby bar - took us a while to find this out! The concierge is not the person to see to book for the restaurants. I just feel let down that this should have been a special holiday for both of us. Without this horrible experience I would have reccommended this hotel.

There were some complaints about the air conditioning in the platinum rooms--our room stayed anywhere between 20-22 degrees--perfect and we did not expect any lower in an area where the outside temperature is over 40 degrees!!! People complained that the showers leaked onto the bathroom floor--we placed a towel where the shower leaked and voila, problem fixed!!!! No big deal!!! We received our welcome drink upon arrival--some people complained they hadn't. Honestly, if we had not received it we would not have cared as the bar is right across from the reception area!!!! We had a private area at the beach for the platinum guests and there was a butler service everyday serving us drinks all day long. Some people complained they did not receive this service--it is literally a 20 second walk to the bar on the beach so who cares if we didn't have service????!!!!! We had plenty of towels in the rooms. We had no problems with anyone going through our suitcases in the rooms or stealing, breaking the safe, etc... The buffet had an excellent selection and do not understand people who complained about there not being enough selection for breakfast-there were a multitide of salads, bread, yogurt, fruit, cold cut meat, cheese, cereal, eggs, pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausages, etc, etc.. The only downfall was that the breakfast and lunch buffet did not change from day to day so after 4-5 days, we would have liked something different. Again, no big deal. The a la carte restaurants were excellent--we especially liked the Thai and Japanese (there are 3 areas to the Japanese restaurant and we chose the one where they cook your meal in front of you (as a show)). All of the restaurants were great. The beach area had a lot of rocks but we knew this and brought shoes to wear in the water and we were fine. The service was great and the staff was very friendly. We tipped well and again it was worth it. We had brought many gifts for the cleaning lady and gave her 2 $ everyday in addition--in exchange, she made us some beautiful decorations on a daily basis with towels. We gave 1 $ a day to the butler on the beach. We gave 2$ for dinner to the waiter. We randomly gave 1$ a day to anyone who gave us good service. Overall, we had an excellent time. We would definitely return again. We were lucky enough to be able to take this vacation that we would never complain. People who complain so much should perhaps spend a day in the life of those who are not so fortunate.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glos, UK", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel - Wonderful Holiday\u201d", "Author": "VanessaGlos_UK", "ReviewID": "UR38327239", "Content": "The Hotel is impressive.

For dinner we ate at the Italian restaurant, Japanese hibachi, the Mexican, and the grill. the hibachi was my absolute favorite but the other were all extremely delicious! we honestly both had such a wonderful time, the hotel is big but if people stopped complaining on how far the walk to everything was and actually looked around and enjoyed the immaculate gardening the walks were actually really enjoyable!! i dont know how it is with kids but as couple it's a really pleasant place to go : )", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Holiday!!!\u201d", "Author": "teachit1", "ReviewID": "UR38183637", "Content": "We just got back from 10 nights at this hotel; stayed with our 11 and 14 year old boys and had a GREAT time. I had to write because I read so many negative reviews and was very worried about what kind of place I had gotten us all into. Turns out everything was great. Our room was in the 7-block -- about half way between the beach and lobby. We did request 2 double beds, but ended up with 1 king and a cot, so our 11 year old slept on the couch (by the way, it is not a pull-out sofa), but he said it was just fine (and he is a big kid). Roomservice set up a sheet and blanket on it for him daily. My 14 yr old who loves to sleep, said the cot was VERY comfortable! Our bathroom was huge with a separate room for toilet, which is always nice when you're sharing with a family :) Big shower stall -- no problems with water running out of it (I read that in someone's review). Large counter, two sinks. Not sure what the problem with the size of the whole resort is with people, but it took us maybe 5 minutes to walk to either the beach or the lobby, and we definitely strolled. Our balcony faced the outside of the resort and at first we thought we would like facing inside with the pools etc. but we actually liked the privacy of our balcony because there is very little traffic/people on the outside. The balcony faced the kids club pool, but we never saw anyone there the whole time (mind you, we weren't sitting out there during the day!)-- there are indoor rooms with games/video games etc for the kids club too. Our boys never went because they are not into that sort of thing. They hung out a lot at the pools and actually met other boys their age that they plan on connecting with through Facebook etc. The pools were beautiful; some party pools, some quieter ones. Lots of chairs in sun and shade. Several outdoor showers to rinse off in (the pools are salt water) The bartenders were great at the bar pools. The beach was nice; yes it is rocky in the water, so bring water shoes. No big deal. The sand is beautiful and white. The food was great. We ate a lot at the buffets and didn't tire of them; the selection was huge. We ate at several of the restaurants and the Mexican one was absolutely delicious. You just have to book the day before or the day of for reservations. The only food outside is at the beach and you can only get a hotdog. OUr room was cleaned daily and the fridge was restocked no problem. One day I left a note with an empty water bottle requesting 5 full ones, and also left $3, and everyday we had lots of water left. Tips are great, but I didn't notice any difference on the days we forgot to leave one. These folks don't make piles of money, so I wanted to leave tips just to be nice -- it is the service industry after all. All of the wait staff, bartenders, bell man etc. were always very friendly and very appreciative when we did give them a tip. We actually brought along $50 in one dollar bills so that we always had tipping money. The only thing I would suggest is to bring some pretzels, nuts ect if you like to snack in your room because the bags of chips in the gift shop are about $5 each. The breakfast buffets are open from 7-10:30, lunch from 12:30-3:30 and dinner from 5-10 or 11. I could be a little off with the times, but you get the idea. There is also a small sports bar with 3 pool tables, big screen tv, darts where you could get fries, burger etc during the afternon if you somehow missed the lunch buffet. I did see someone complain in one review about not getting tea/coffee after dinner in the buffets. There is a great outdoor lounge in the courtyard by the buffet restaurants that served great coffee, tea, special coffee, lattes etc. and you didn't have to have it in a styrofoam cup, only if you were taking it to go. Each night there was entertainment in the outdoor lounge also -- mariachi band, circus/fire acts, a really fun casino night etc. We didn't go to the disco so I can't comment on that. I also read lots of reviews about mosquitos, but my family never got bit once because we didnt see even one! Overall we had a wonderful time. Feel free to contact me if you have any other questions. I would totally recommend this place.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat Holiday\u201d", "Author": "DartEngland", "ReviewID": "UR38181270", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews about this hotel I was getting slightly worried. I didn't need to be. This is a great hotel and the staff are very polite and helpful. We had a junior deluxe suite with a whirlpool bath overlooking one of the swimming pools. Although we were by the pool with noisy entertainment it did not bother us as we kept our doors closed with the air conditioning on. There is also a mosquito screen that can be pulled over if you wanted to keep the doors open. Although we did get bitten several times by mosquitos it was something we expected being in Mexico and something we just put up with rather than moaning about it. We thought the buffet restaurants had a good choice of food and actually preferred them to the a la carte restaurant. We also thought the buffet staff were more attentive than the al carte staff. It was my birthday while we were away and my husband arranged for some flowers to be delivered to me which were beautiful red roses (arranged with the concierge at reception). The one downside was that he arranged with the conceige who books the a la carte restaurants to have a birthday cake for me at Mama Mia restaurant. He said he would pay extra for this but it never arrived at the restaurant. The waiter was also quite rude as he walked away half way through taking my order. We complained to the manager and walked out and went back to the buffet restaurant where we had better service. The pools here are excellent - there is plenty of choice if you want to sit someone quieter or nearer the entertainment and we never had any trouble gettiing a sunbed. This is a large hotel and it is quite a long walk from the reception to the beach - probably not great for people to don't like walking in the heat. If you are in swimwear jump under one of the showers - you will be dry by the time you reach the end of your walk but it keeps you coooler.

Check in was quick and bell boy took suitcases straight to the room for us. It takes ten minutes to walk the whole distance from lobby to the beach (all rooms are in between these two points) but there is a shuttle bus that runs up and down all day and night so if walking is a problem, then get the free bus everywhere!!! We were upgraded from junior suite to junior suite deluxe (for free but not sure why so asked no questions lol) which meant we got 7 of the a la carte restaurants not just 5 and we got jacuzzi in our room which was amazing and good fun!!! The International (French) was the best as Fillet Steak and Lamb was gorgeous, however ALL the restaurants were fantastic, even the two buffet diners. You cannot get bored as you can book the restaurants as many times as you want!!! Which is fantastic for all incl with no added costs!! The beach is perfect. White sands, turquoise ocean, always sun beds available in shade or sun. The pools are endless, with either quiet relaxing ones or a fun pool with music and games. There is so much room to pick your own favorite place etc At night there is the main bar with a band that plays every night (apart from thurs when there is a craft market) and they are quite entertaining.

My companions included a co-worker, her daughters (teens and 20's) and their friends. Overall, a very enjoyable experience, which would have been perfect, if given an orientation upon arrival. The resort is extremely large and has many activities and ammenities which could be enjoyed more if you knew they were available. The food was great, with lots of variety for all. Plenty of choices on the buffets and the theme resteraunts were especially enjoyable. MISO is a must do as are La Mama Mia and La Hacienda. Service at the other eateries was a little hit or miss, but overall a great dining experience. I stayed in a Platinum Suite and had no problems that have been reported by some of the other visitors. The room was immaculate, the bar always well stocked and we were even provided with extra drinks when requested. It was also nice to have your own private pool and bar with tapas. The one drawback, which we should have been informed of on arrival, is that your other guests if staying in another area of the hotel are not allowed in your Platinum Suite, even if they are your family..........I thought that was a bit obsurd. Most of the staff was extremely friendly, but of course, a few sour apples......you get that every where, so I don't hold that against a pretty great overall experience. I would also like to mention that I'm a scuba diver and my fellow travelers were not. Thus being said, I did not take all of my dive gear or make plans to do any diving. I was plesantly surprised to have SEA PRO DIVERS on site with a shop on the beach in front of the hotel. I stopped by and spoke to Christopher and Peter and arranged one day of diving, I ended up by jumping in for 7 dives on my short stay. They were extremely professional and helpful. They have something for all divers and look to accomodate your needs. They do instruction as well as facilitate the more advanced diver to see that you have an enjoyable time. They try not to repeat a dive site if you accompany them on more than one trip. Dive packages are arranged and are a good value, they include your gear which is a real bonus if you decide just to do a spur of the moment dive. I had a couple of rip roaring drift dives and saw a huge school of tarpon, giant morrays and spotted eals, rays and turtles.......also nice coral and small fish. They are not a big operation, so don't look for a big boat with a head and air conditioned cabins. Just a big thanks to Peter and the crew for the fun and I hope to get back there and maybe do the day trip to Cozumel and a repeat to the Cenotes.", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, suburbs", "Title": "\u201cNothing But the Truth......From the \"burbs\" of Chicago\u201d", "Author": "goldringlets", "ReviewID": "UR37296119", "Content": "My sister and I were at the Princess Riviera from 8/4 thru 8/9/09 Upon arriving to the Cancun Airport (we landed approximately 1:30pmCST) we went thru customs and immagration. (which took about 1.5 hours) We were able to locate the Lomas Travel representative,without incident. The drive to the Resort took approx 25-30 mins.(In the Lomas Travel Leisure van) When we got to the Resort, we were introduced to Luis and Pablo, Lomas Travel representatives. they informed us to meet them back in the lobby between 6-6:30pm to introduce us to the many attractions. We registered with the Platinum services and YES we did receive Champagne and the check -in process went very smooth. Since we had time we decided to walk to our room, and YES if you are unable to walk or have any illness that prohibits you from walking then it would definitely not be advisable. It was 100+ degrees with 100 % humidity. so it was HOT HOT HOT and sweaty but IT's MEJICO !!! We located our room, no problem. There are signs EVERYWHERE, so I dont understand why people stated they had difficulty locating their rooms. The platinum rooms are very close to the ocean and all of the swimming pools so it was very nice. Also the platinum side has a private pool with private butler service and a private concierge. I found the concierges that we dealt with, were very pleasant and assisted us in making every reservation for the '\"restaurants\". Also getting beach towels were never a problem. There was never an issue with poolside and ocean-side lounge chairs, There were plenty all over. As far as the selections for dinner, I went to LeFondue, Las Olas(Seafood), Asian(Hibachi) and the Thai Beach Club. The Fondue was my least favorite. and the Thai Beach Club would have been very good but you eat outside, and the mosquitoes that evening were horrific( but its the tropics and its hot and muggy, so what can one expect.) You are offered insect repellent wipes. Also they are inside the rooms. I stopped using perfume after my first day !!!! The shuttle service from the Platinum side to the main Lobby took approximately 6 mins and of course the more people that are on board it does run slower. but it DOES come around approximately every 15 mins. That is all the shuttle bus does, goes back and forth all day long. All of the restaurants, including the breakfast and lunch buffets are very close to the platinum side. The breakfast and lunch buffets are very good, food was good, wait staff very attentive. (What more can you offer for breakfast I read many reviews about not having enough variety. Eggs cereal, juices breakfast meats, bread, waffles and pancakes there you have it. For lunch again, lunch stuff.) I didnt have the opportunity to have the dinner buffets, so I can't comment I also found that tipping helped alot.( I tipped the wait staff two dollars every moring and every afternoon the next day I never had a problem with getting coffee, mimosas etc) When I am in the US, and I eat out for breakfast, lunch and dinner, I tip the wait staff and when I am in a bar, I tip the bartender, for good service ( Made sense to do the same there.) I also tipped the cleaning people I would do the same in the US. at a resort(Hotel) As far as anything missing in my room, NEVER . and of course I did not leave money, expensive jewelry or cameras in plain sight, \"sticky fingers\" are universal !!!! My money, passport , and ID's were always in the safe, and it was not broken into. So enough about the good here is the bad..... Beach shoes are a MUST !!!! The Ocean is rocky for approximately 100feet ( I have a size six shoe he-he-he) The showers in the rooms are pitched wrong so there is ALOT of water in the bathroom floor after taking a shower. Okay so put extra towels down !!!! Also Parents, if you are going to have the children in the ADULT swim-up pool bars please watch your children, so they do not occupy every bar stool so that ADULTS can not sit down at the bar for an alcoholic beverage.

Ping pong only offered once/day for an hour, required to leave $10 deposit to play when wasn't the \"official\" time.

I can't say enough good about this hotel! It's an absolutely beautiful establishment and combined with the Grand Sunset Princess (just the other side of the resort) this resort is huge. I'll start with from the time we landed in the airport. After we arrived in the Cancun airport we were escorted to a large air conditioned coach bus going to the resort. The reps at the airport are very friendly and make sure you get on the right bus in order to get to your hotel. Corona's on the bus ride to the resort (for a small fee) which took about 45 mins as we had to drop off at other hotels first, but the ride was very entertaining. Once we arrived at the hotel itself, it probably took about 15 mins in total to get checked in (painless), and we were in the bottom class as far as rooms go (Junior Suite). We stayed in building # 7 on the 3rd floor which was pretty much the middle of the resort, so an equal distance to all the restaurants, looby or beach. The porter met us at our room about 10 mins after we got there with our luggage and was extremly friendly. Our room was very spacious with a king size bed and a futon couch, double sinks in the bathroom and a stand up shower. we also had a balcony, in which i can say we throughly used. Every night we would get several drinks and walk back to the room and sit on the balcony to soak in the warm mexican nights. Bring bug spray with you however because there are mosquitos and small biting insects out especially at night. Our safe was locked shut, so we had to call to get someone to open it up for us. I didn't take my jewelry with me or anything really expensive since we were told that thefts do happen since we are in a very poor country. We were also told if we brought stuff like tooothpaste,toothbrushes and small US $1 that if we left these types of things for our housekeeping staff, that they would ensure our room was well looked after in every aspect, and it most definately was. The house keeping staff do not speak or understand english very well if at all, so we left them a note with pictures drawn on it to convey our messages and they always made sure we had what we needed! My husband happened to come in the first full day we were there to change when one of the housekeepers was there and he showed her the note with our little pictures and pointed to the small gifts of toiletries and money we had left her, and she actually cried and hugged my husband because she was so appreciative towards our little gesture to her. Our room was kept the best I've ever seen. I absolutely can't complain on the room factor at all. The food at the buffet was bountiful and had a selection I would say for everyone's tastes. It didn't matter which large buffet you ate at as there were 3 on property. 2 up near the lobby entrance and 1 down near the beach. All of them were also air conditioned and dress code wasn't in effect. You could wear a bathing suit and beach cover up as long as you weren't soaking wet. The A La Carte restaurants (as we learned) were a little differently operated. You needed to make your reservation at the restaurant directly from the hours of 8AM - 1PM and after that you could then make reservations through the concierge desk up until 3:30PM. If you tried to go to the restaurant the night of to sit you would be turned away if you didn't have a reservation even if the restaurant wasn't busy. You can only make reservation for the day of and the following day so make sure to do so, so you won't miss out. We loved the Italian restaurant the best of all the ones we tried. We heard the Japanese was good, but we didn't make it there as there was a surchrge for us due to the room class we were in, so we decided to skip it. Some of the restaurants served small portions, but in this case we would just go to the buffet or snack bar if we were still hungry. The 24hr snack bar/sports lounge was great since this was the only place after 12AM that served drinks and food. The main pool area of the hotel had a great atmosphere and got everybody of alll ages involved. Lots of fun music and activities to do or you could just chill out by the pool bar if you wanted to. The pool bar was always busy, but Jose always kept the drinks coming and for only one person (there were sometimes 2 on the bar) he handled the crowd with ease. Order a few drinks at a time or bring a large cooler cup with you, as the drinks are in very small plastic cups. The disco at the resort was also a lively place to be after about 12AM if you cared to stay up that late. Our travel rep Wendy through Signature Vacations was fantastic!!!! We booked excursions for almost the entire week, and enjoyed all of them throughly! We especially liked the Dolphin Discovery Excursion and the swimming in the Cenote caves and with the Sea turtles at Akumal Beach the best. We also visited one of the Mayan Ruins in Coba where we were able to climb the actual temple, unlike in Tulum or Chichen Itza . What an experience that was! Wendy gave us the low down of all the excursions and which ones were the best and most worth our time & money. We only wish we had more time in Mexico, because we had booked so many wonderful excursions that we didn't have enough downtime to relax too. I suggest 10- days t0 2 weeks as there is so much to see and do while you're in and around the area. We were approximately a 10 minute cab drive into the town of Playa del Carmen, where there was lots to do, see and plenty of places to shop around for pretty much anything you wanted. If you venture into town we highly recommend going on the boat over to the island of Cozumel for the day. We rented a scooter and toured the entire island in a few hours. the people here are very friendly. Cabs cost on average about $15 to go into town and there are plenty of cabs to choose from. They also go through security checkpoints so safety was not an issue for us. At no time did either of us feel unsafe or threatened while we were outside of the resort. It's all common sense anyhow. Don't overly dress up, don't wear alot of flashy jewelry and most of all try not to draw attention to yourself. Some vendors will hassel you, but again this is to be expected and you just have to say no and walk away or haggle with the price if you've found something you just have to have. For those who don't want to venture outside of the resort there is a market night where the hotel hosts different vendors and you can do your souvenier shopping here. There are also lots of different gift shops on site with fairly reasonable prices for a resort. The wedding we attended I have to say was very disorganized and seemed to be a bit rushed. I'm not sure if the fault of this was on the couple or the resort or a combination of the two. It was pretty but i feel it could've and probably should've been a smoother process than it was. Thankfully our destination wedding in St. Thomas USVI, was nothing like this adn what a relief because if I had to base it on their wedding it would've soured my tastes to having a destination wedding. We met another couple at the hotel who turn out to only live about an 9 hr drive from us and have since become good friends. Their wedding (so we were told) was amazing and couldn't have gone any better, so I'd have to say it was probably the lack of the other couples involvement that made theirs seem less organized and less desirable. The beach is beautiful but there were some rocks on the ocean floor, so you must be careful when venturing out not to step on them. We were told this was a result of the recent hurricane that had passed through the area and had disturbed the coral reef. On our last day we weren't leaving for the airport until 12AM (the following morning). Check out was by noon, however your all inclusive benifits lasted until we actually left the property on our coach bus back to the airport. We were simply told to just keep our bracelets on so that we could eat, drink and use the facilities for the day. They had showers with ample amounts of towels just off the main lobby so you could freshen up before you left to go home and the porters would put your bags in storage for the day since you no longer had a room to go to. This again was a super bonus and made our trip complete simply because we weren't having to wait around in the lobby all day with nothing to do or eat. The staff at this hotel make it a 5* and if I was ever to return to this area of Mexico again I would definately consider going back to this hotel. Our trip was fantastic with lots of hot weather, good food and lots of entertainment. I would tell anyone out there that this is a top notch resort at a reasonable price range. There are some things I could complain about, but to me they are minor issues and everything isn't perfect all the time. The good times by far outway anything bad i could say about this place.

The group\u2019s demands were top shelf (premium) drinks and that they would serve 24/7. Looking at our options the Grand Riviera Princess seemed the perfect place. Arrived (Thurs) in our room (platinum suite 5207) and it was very nice, just a bit hot, even though AC was on. Reported AC problem and they sent maintenance to fix it. Maintenance man said it should be cool in 30-45 minutes. Two hours later room is hotter than before. Went to front desk and said they would try to move us. When got back form Playa del Carmen at 4am, they upgraded us to a Villa. Never asked for upgrade just wanted a room with a working AC and don\u2019t know if you can call it an upgrade since the Villas are farther from beach (so NO beach view). In the morning (Friday) while checking out the room I noticed a lot of cockroaches (even killed one by toilet), worms and spider webs. Called concierge and she explained that those rooms haven\u2019t been used since the swine flu outbreak had hurt tourism. I understood just asked to make sure my room got cleaned. After being all day and night out by pool and restaurants-bars getting horrible service we decided to call it a day. Arrived at room and it was still unmade. Called housecleaning and they told me they would do it that very instant, after 30 minutes of waiting feel asleep. Got call at 9am Saturday morning from front desk (Claudia) asking if room had been done, told them no, they apologized and said it would make sure it was done. Also called concierge (Mauricio) and reported that our toilet would flush. Left all day, Playa Mamitas and Kool recommend both, got back and room was done only to notice that the cockroach was still by toilet and toilet still wasn\u2019t working. To make a long story short, I left on Monday and toilet was still broken and cockroach was still by toilet and our bathroom was never cleaned, even after 2 room cleaning services. Other negatives: As a platinum guest you get night service were you get bed made, mint-chocolate on your pillow, well that was never done. Premium drinks were only available at platinum pool (no music) and platinum bar, which were just 4 tables with chairs and no music. During all of my stay, they never stocked the room mini-bar. When arrived it only had 1 can of club soda. Restaurants: I have stayed in other all-inclusive hotels before, so don\u2019t expect a lot from the food. Food is a little better in the a-la-cart restaurants, made reservations for two of them (La Vaqueria & Thai Beach Club Restaurant). La Vaqueria half of our group showed 15 minutes late and they wouldn\u2019t give us service, even though the other half had just been seated and hadn\u2019t even ordered drinks. After talking to the manager, he said we would to me a favor and make an exception. JAJA. Well seemed the waiter didn\u2019t like me talking to the manager and he didn\u2019t want to take our order, even insulted my girlfriend. Angers raised, another waiter took over our table. Note: Restaurant was 20% full. Thai Restaurant, we arrived early and restaurant was empty. The 12 of us had the restaurant to ourselves which we thought it would be great. My girlfriend got served an hour later after taking our order, 35 minutes later I just canceled my order got full from air and taking bites and pieces of her plate. They still brought my plate 5 minutes later, didn\u2019t even touch it and still got charged for it. The worst of all was at check-out when tried complain about my stay. Front desk sent me to concierge and filled out complaint form. Waited for 3 hours to talk to manager (concierge manager and front desk manager) and no one had the courage to face me. The concierge told me that they would wave my 22 dollar Thai charge, only if I would sign a disclosure. They were trying to buy me off with 22 dollars. All I ever wanted was an apology in person, not a phone. I would have been satisfied with that and any excuse (understaffed, still training employees, hotel still new working out the bugs, etc). I never asked for anything, didn\u2019t want my money back nor free nights, all I wanted was to see what they were willing to do, as a worldwide hotel resort, for a hotel guest not to leave the resort with a bad image. What ever happened to customer satisfaction? Overall: Hotel is nice and location is great. Platinum suites have a balcony Jacuzzi. Villas have a huge Jacuzzi and an outside shower. Some employees and very serviceable and friendly, a friend left his Blackberry by the pool; it turned out in the lost & found. Most of them rather not even give you service, even if you tip, they just seem tried or just frustrated. Food is eatable, but don\u2019t expect anything out of the ordinary. Drinks are watered down, even if have the platinum, can\u2019t get premium drinks in any restaurant or bar, just your suites lobby. I DON\u2019T recommend anyone stay at the Grand Riviera or Sunset Princess, it\u2019s a waste of hard earned money.

Despite what you\u2019re about to read we did have a lovely holiday but there are a few things which you may like to now before visiting the Grand Riviera Princess. The hotel is quite a large resort which is very clean and well maintained - staff work really hard always doing gardens and repainting. The grounds of the resort are very pretty. Food: Good choice of food in buffet with themed nights eg seafood, Chinese, Mexican. We discovered that we could use a la carte restaurants for breakfast or for lunch, still the buffet style but gives choice of venue. We ate at the Miso Tepanyaki - had the best night. It was fab - great entertainment and wonderful food. Was my son's 8th birthday and they made him a personalised cake - also didn't charge the $29 for him. We paid to go there again a few evenings later. Also tried La Hacienda Mexican and Mama Mia Italian which were lovely. La Fondue was OK but we weren't too excited about the cheese sauce (chocolate fondue was great!) Excursions: Went to Delphinus - highly recommend. Had a great time. They try and sell you a DVD for $69 and photos for $25 each (complete package $170) which we think is a bit over the top. Looked into doing Xplor. This is $129 US per adult and half price for kids - again over priced. As was hotel spa - $99 US for massage. We opted for massages on beach for $20 US for half an hour or $40 US for an hour which were great. Service: Service from housekeeping we found to be a bit hit & miss. Often didn't change towels or when they did we only had two hand towels to use for 3 of us showering (heard that there was a problem with washer or dryer). Also had 3 of us sharing a large king size bed for a week despite requests for bedding for sofa bed to be made up for our son. They finally got round to setting up a separate bed after a week, after spending almost an hour at the reception desk at midnight (after being promised it would be done \u201cin 10 minutes\u201d at 5pm). They did give us a bottle of tequila to compensate! The reception staff not great - a couple were helpful but some don't give a toss and will tell you anything just so that you go away. For example they told us we could use Pesos to pay for the internet but when we tried it wasn't possible (we didn't have US dollars), so we went back to reception to ask for US dollars but were told they couldn't provide any to us and that we would need to go into town to get some (approx \u00a310 each way in a taxi). Why have internet service in a Mexican hotel only accessible if you have US dollars only with no means to exchange to us dollars? My husband visited reception for a third time and asked again, not quite as calmly as previously, and was given US dollars. Disappointing that we'd had to make three journeys to reception and, yet again, get angry to get something done. Also, tipping didn\u2019t make too much difference to the service. Kids Club staff were fabulous. They were by far the best of all staff there. Our son joined their activities in for a couple of hours in afternoon. They were so friendly and always remembered his name, even if they saw him outside of the activities. The last day they saw him they gave him a personalised certificate to thank him for being good. I'd recommend them without hesitation. General: We found the first week that there were plenty of spare pool & beach beds around even ones which were shaded huts, although the resort got much busier during the second week The main pool got pretty busy in the afternoons. The water is dirty as everyone sits around the pool bar, spilling drinks and leaving empty cups in there. It got really loud and rowdy with drinking games in the afternoon - we didn't feel this was appropriate in a family resort. Some people may like their kids watching drunk adults falling over and simulating sex, but we'd prefer our 8-year old not to. The resort is large enough to choose other, quieter pools so that's what we did. Although be careful of the odd \"wasted\" person in the buffet! One afternoon I had to report \"domestic violence\" situation to security where some bloke was clearly drunk, swearing his head off at his wife and young daughter, punching walls. Some people clearly get a little over excited with their All Inclusive packages!? We also found a used condom by one of the quieter pools one morning - nice! Evenings at the resort were pleasant \u2013 presumably a lot of people head into Playa del Carmen. My son loved the shows. We have never been to an All Inclusive resort before and sadly (without wanting to sound like a killjoy), following this experience we won\u2019t be doing so again! I didn\u2019t realise how fat and greedy people are and how out of control people get \u2013 it\u2019s embarrassing. We were also disappointed that our holiday didn\u2019t feel \u201cMexican\u201d. It seems that they are trying too hard to please their Canadian/American clientele and losing their identity as a result.

I spent a great deal of time reviewing them before booking our 5 day trip with 2 other couples. Many of the things that were mentioned I totally agree with...FOR INSTANCE. If you are disabled, slow, bad feet or just lazy this IS NOT the resort for you!!!! We all are barely in our 30's and after day 2 we were tired of walking....SERIOUSLY. This place has to be 3/4 of a mile long from lobby to beach. Even staying in the middle of the resort was too much for me, and I would like to think i am somewhat in shape. The mosquitos were CRAZY!!!!!! At the front of the resort they have stagnant water in the landscaping that I believe what breeds them. You WILL get bit up, unless you have some sort of insect repellent. I think this is something that needs addressed quickly by the resort, as I seen literally hundreds of people in the 5 days walk by me with bite marks on them. I personally had about 20-25 bite marks on me. Not fun,, especially when trying to come back with minimal tan lines. The beach is quite rocky for the first 20-30 feet, then smooths out a bit. But you can walk out almost a 1/4 before the water comes above your waiste!! The time schedules for things was really wacky!!!! I also believe that the resort needs to take more time in explaining things to you when you first check in. Perhaps even sending someone with you to your room (a good 10-15 min walk) explaining the buffet times, the restaurant check in procedures, the pool hours and etc. The buffet closes periodically for transitions to next meals...and of course if you dont know the times you may walk in 100 degree heat for 15 mins to get there to only find out its closed for an hour and a half! Also, the pool bars close at like 6pm, and the pools close at 8pm... which we cant figure out for the life of us why?? We arrived on saturday at 6pm, by the time we checked in, got to our room, got our luggage delivered and found out the buffet was closed. We decided to take a dip in the pool, only to find out it was closed??? Maybe this doesnt sound so bad, but when you realize that there are about 10-13 pools at this place... there is not much else to do after 8pm until the entertainment starts at 9:30. But after you see the entertainment, you'll quickly rrealize you have nothing to do after 8pm PERIOD. Rooms were clean, nice, updated, pools were nice, landscaping was amazing. You constantly see people cleaning, painting, picking up garbage, landscaping...etc Service was ok..... if you were on one of the pools on the outskirts you hardly ever saw a waitress. So you had to get your own drinks. I will conclude by saying this.... Mexico is not what it used to be. They are now \"hep to the game\" and severely over price everything, even in the city. Nothing is a good deal anymore, and they dont even want to haggle anymore. The resort prices for things was out of this world. Even beach activities were ridiculus. Jet skiing for a half hour was $60 i pay less than that here! Also, although we had an all inclusive, the lobster is included in the dinner prices. Its $45 extra for about 8oz tail.... I pay less than that here too. Room service was NOT included!! Over all.... A good time, relaxing, fun time... I would recommend to younger kids or families and make sure they take insect repellent!!

Overall we had a nice vacation but there were several things that should be improved on to make this resort a true 5 star experience. I will start with the negatives and then list the positives Negatives: Arrival: We arrived at 8:00 a.m. The front desk staff refused to assign us rooms until after 3:00 p.m as this was their \"policy\". The resort was not even 50% full, so there were lots of empty rooms but they refused to give us one earlier than 3:00. We were forced to wait in the heat with all of our valuables. We did not want to leave cameras, laptops, travel documents, purses, etc. with the rest of our luggage because they just left our other bags sitting outside at the entrance near the bellboys until our rooms were available. So we were forced to cart our other stuff around until 3:00. Also, while waiting for a room we decided to go to one of the pools but they had no towels at any of the towel huts. So, we took the very long walk back to the lobby to ask for towels and were told \"sorry, no towels\". It seemed like any time you asked the front desk staff for anything, the answer was usually \"sorry\" or \"not possible\". They also did not explain where anything was or what activities were available, etc. We were left to figure everything out on our own. They did not even give us a resort map until we got our room keys after 3:00. Pool and Pool deck: These areas were not cleaned regularly. The dirt on the pool deck stuck to your feet and ended up in the pool. These areas should have been washed daily. Money exchange: Be sure to take lots of one dollar bills if you plan to tip the staff. When I asked to change large bills for ones, they refused. Instead they wanted to convert them to pesos at a very bad exchange rate. To get small bills I had to wander around from the bars to the bellboys and ask them to trade for ones which they often said they did not have. What happened to the ones that I saw people tipping them with? Rooms/Towels: Sometimes they took the old towels and did not replace them with new ones. I asked a maid for towels and was told \"sorry, no towels\". I called the front desk for towels and an hour later, still no towels. I ended up wandering around until I found a couple of maids in a supply room with a small stack of towels. They were very reluctant to give me two of these towels. The next day, when we actually got three clean towels in our room, I hid one in a suitcase so that we would have one when we needed it if they ran out again. They really need to improve their laundry and distribution system. If you expect towel art, which is not really a huge deal for me, you will probably be disappointed. We never had towel art. We had turn down service only once and so I am not sure if this should have been expected or not. Restaurant Service: The service in the restaurants was hit and miss. Sometimes it was good but more often plates were not cleared, water glasses refilled, drinks offered, etc. They did not seem to have enough staff to serve the number of guests (and the resort was not even full). Positives: Bar Staff: The bar staff was excellent. They worked hard and were always friendly. Tips were appreciated as that is their main source of income. I did not mind giving tips for drink service since the service was very good. Food: Overall the food was mostly good. Sometimes the cooked items were too salty though, especially the fish. The soups and salads were better than the hot items. We only at at one al a carte (Miso - the Japanese restaurant). That was fun and the food was quite good. The sushi was excellent. The main problem was that the buffets only served breakfast until 10:30 and then closed until 12:30. Lunch was then only served until 3:00 and the buffets were closed until 6:00 p.m. There was no pool side food available, you had to dry off, get dressed and go to the restaurants. Rooms: The rooms were spacious. We had a junior deluxe suite with a pool view. We did not have a swim up since we had a child with us and they are for 18 and over only. Our room included bath robes and free room service which we used on a day when we left early for an excursion before the buffet opened. Room service was decent and on time. Our bed was a king. The mattress was a little too firm for me though. Also, we had to interruptions after we had gone to bed for the night. One night at about 3:00 am a bell boy came to our door with luggage which was not ours. Another night at about 12:00 a maid arrived at our door asking if we had requested towels. The mini bar was always re-filled. Entertainment: The pool entertainment (water polo, games, aerobics) was fun. The evening shows were o.k. but a little cheesy sometimes. Our daughter who is 10 did not use the kids club so I can not comment on that but we did hire one of the girls who works in the kids club to babysit her while we went to the Coco Bongo night club in Playa del Carmen one night. She did a great job. Overall we had a good time and a fun vacation. We probably would not choose this resort again. It was too large, we prefer smaller resorts. If it was at full occupancy, it would be very difficult to get a deck chair by the pools (especially one with some shade). Also, with full occupancy the buffets would be way to busy and overwhelmed. They are not big enough for the size of the resort. The service was sometimes good but not always consistent, especially the front desk service. The beach was nice, but the water was rocky, a little murky and fairly wavy. It was not a resort where you could really snorkel right from the shore. Hopefully this helps if you are trying to decide where to book your next vacation.

Out of the 9 years and 9 different hotels, I only really have been disappointed twice and this place was one of them. We were there between June 28th to July 12. To start with, checking in was okay, no cool drink was offered like we noticed it was offered to others but once we checked in, the bell hop advised us that we needed to take the shuttle bus to our room and our luggage would be there. We stood for 20 mins waiting for the shuttle but then decided to just find our room on our own. It turned out to be a 3 min walk. Yes the grounds are beautiful and I would say this resort is a medium size resort. Didn't find the walking around long or things far. I have been to bigger resorts (Iberostar, Barcel\u00f3 etc) and those are large resorts. We found the buffet to be better at lunch then at diner and ate at most of the restaurants. We didn't however like the Le Fleur (French) restaurant. The maid service was okay but our supplies were not always replenished. Our room was nice (swim up room) but only got to enjoy it between 8:00 am to 10:00 am as other travelers would came to our pool and used it with their kids. We were told by our agent that no one under the age of 18 were allowed in the pool and it was reserved only for those who had the swim up rooms. Every kid on that resort was at our pool and their parents were no were to be seen to watch over them. One morning while taken a nap on our balcony, we were woken up buy two young boys (around the age of 14) hoping from one balcony to the other and running along the dividing walls to jump into the pool. I advised them that not only is this dangerous but not permitted as this is a private area and they should not even been in this pool. I reminded them that there are 7 other pools that they can run around and splash and be load in...the boys apologized and went on their way....only to repeat the same thing the next day. We also encountered some vandalism the first few days we were there. Missing bathing suits, towels thrown on the floor etc. So don't leave anything on the balcony over night. (This was before the issue with the two boys). The beach was ok and have been to better. We also found that the staff at the gift shop to have attitudes as if we were bothering them. Also we were often ignored or were invisible while wait to order a drink. The live band were good but played the same songs every night. Not much else to do at night and found that we were bored on this vacation. Unlike the other resorts we went too. We caught two shows and left after 20 mins. Not much to say about them. Would we go back, yes if the price was dirt cheap. At least we know what to expect. Had nothing stolen as claimed by some guest so we were lucky. One suggestion, if you want to go into Playa Del Carmen, take a cab ($13.50 US or $135 pesos) and go for 9:00 am and stay until 12:00 as that's when the heat gets you.", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cInconsistent service, average quality but overall decent stay.\u201d", "Author": "fun2roam", "ReviewID": "UR35625652", "Content": "I went down with my wife and some friends for a friend's destination wedding and booked the Platinum Suite at the Riviera side of the resort for 4 nights, 5 days. Upon arrival we expected a complimentary champagne as noted on the website, and instead were given lemonade. Okay, bad economy, I get it. When we got to our room we noticed the air conditioning wasn't very cool and the refrigerator was not even cold, and the jacuzzi tubs were kinda dirty. Again, the economy, and the weather was hot, so we found ways around that. Our shower leaked water to the adjacent bathroom stall, which is solved by placing a towel to soak up the water. The fridge was warm because it was boxed in a cabinet so the laws of thermodynamics kept the warm air in which negated its ability to cool anything, keeping the cabinet door open for a few hrs we notice the canned drinks started to get colder. Air conditioning was tolerable and we augmented it by running the ceiling fans all day. Bedsheets and pillowcases have minor bloodstains and spots but not to the point of being gross. Not 5 star resort quality, but okay enough to be fairly nice. For mosquitos we brought natural citronella, lemongrass and eucalyptus based sprays which we put on every few hours which was very effective. Natural meant we could spray it on around us near the bed and on our bodies even to sleep. I killed the only 2 mosquitos in the room the first night and found a salamander/gecko in my room which nicely took care of any other little bugs. Also brought a citronella candle lit while we slept to ward off any strays that come out from under the sofa and bed after lights are out. I wrote a note in broken spanish for the service person (mostly men-maids) to not open the windows. So the only times my wife and I got bit were from not applying our bug sprays often enough after dark. Other friends got bit badly, but preparation is key. Food and Service was actually fine. The Riviera platinum buffets (La Tortuga/Negresco) were okay, good selection and edible, but don't expect gourmet. Service for drinks were slow but not impossible to get. They work hard, so appreciate them and smile, try a little cheerful greeting, a few spanish phrases, and tip a few bucks and it goes a long way to getting drinks refilled and your table cleared. Our friends also tried the International Buffet in the main Lobby building and the crab claws were good. No one got sick from the food luckily at the buffets. A la carte restaurants we tried were La Fleur, La Vaqueria (aka The Grill), and La Hacienda. They all taste average, and from the same kitchen, just different preparation, but again, it wasn't horrible. If you are in a group you MUST book together in advance and negotiate for parties larger than 6 ppl. Otherwise you will get seated separately and they will not accomodate. It's all inclusive! So there are rules, you bought into them so just play by it and you'll be fine. Having platinum privileges definitely pays off for us. The plat concierge was very helpful in booking restaurants and arranging spa appointments, and we were able to enjoy endless flows of snacks, pina coladas, ice cream and guac/salsa all day and into the night. Towels weren't a problem, as I wake early every morning around 8am to grab towels and place them on the beach chairs under a shady tiki hut which I used for lounging by the water all day long. Service gals would come by around once every half hour asking for your order. As for the \"shuttle\", glorified golf carts that run inconsistently, so it is often better to walk to your restaurants instead of waiting for it and end up being late and getting an earful from the maitre-d. Thai Beach Club? Waste of time and money so don't bother. It was on the Sunset Side and my wife was harrassed for not wearing her platinum bracelet and turned her away so she had to come back to the room to get it. Forgiven but not forgotten. The housekeeping needs to improve. We got half-moist and musty sheets to sleep in and our 2nd night the cold water stopped running in our room so no toilet water to flush. Luckily I used the ice bucket to refill the tank and called the concierge, and by the next morning all is fixed. But the musty sheets kept coming. Activities: we paid for jetskis and parasailing which was fun, but kinda on the expensive side. What the heck, we're there to have some fun so we did it. The beach was not fine smooth sand but with water shoes you can venture into the shallows over the rocky outcroppings, my friend's gf got scrapped by wearing just flip flops. Spa 30 mins? More like 20 mins of \"appetiser\" massage rather than a short, serious session. We also went to Ekbalam and Chitchen Itza to see Mayan pyramids and that was a very HOT but worthwhile outing. Nighttime shows were lame and we didn't go into town but during our stay there was a nighttime flea market set up in the resort, selling the same stuff as items we saw at tourist areas. Gift shop is a bit pricey, but not unreasonable. Hotel was charging by 11.50 pesos to the dollar while outside was 12.50-13.00. Leaving was not great. Our group had baggage picked up at the platinum lounge 40 mins before our van arrived, but it was not delivered to the lobby until 10 mins after our van was scheduled to depart (almost 1 hr). We could have rolled our luggage ourselves to the lobby in 15 mins. Do it yourself. Summary: had a decent time but did find things we were disappointed about for such a pretty resort. The staff at the Riviera platinum lounge were superb, but strict at the restaurants host desk. Service staff for dining and bars try hard, and deserve a tip. Bell-boy staff and check-in folks were rude and could care less about making you a happy customer. Overall I would and had come once, but would try elsewhere next time to compare service. I don't fault the individuals, rather the management and lack of proper training and motivation in an all inclusive environment. Hospitality, sometimes comes at a price only those seeking it are willing to afford.

Me and My boyfriend left on July 11th for 8 days. The hotel itself is wonderful looking, lots of manicured gardens, giant statues, large pools, ect. There are some issue's with this hotel though and I will break it down. We booked a junior deluxe suite and when we arrived to my disappointment it over looked a large barren dirt patch in the woods with barrels of fence tied up. Although I noticed almost every other suite in the hotel offered a better view I guess we were unlucky. We asked to move to a better suite and were ready to tip or pay for it but never got any response. Also there was a large blood splatter on our comforter, we again asked the room service to change the comforter and tipped them over 5 American dollars a day. To my surprise I figured out they were only flipping the comforter to hide the splatter.Ew!! The Air conditioner was also broken, it was 27 degrees in our room and we felt sick and had to make homemade ice packs!! Of course we went to the front desk and asked several times to have it fixed but no-one moved a finger. Also a rather large cockroach was living in the bathroom, I put it outside. So the room sucked but we got over it. One other problem I will mention before getting to the positive is we were down near the platinum suites so it was a very hot long walk to the lobby. There was a shuttle but It had no set schedule so we missed it allot. Don't bother to get the busboys to take your luggage on the last day to the lobby they also didn't show up and we had to race to the front in the hot sun with all our luggage. I have been to this side of Mexico 2 years ago and we stayed at the Grand Sirenis hotel. I have to say that it tops this hotel in almost every way...except the buffet. The buffet at Grand Princess was surprisingly alright. I only eat fish and not meat and I found plenty to eat. My boyfriend thought the buffet was fabulous, the service was excellent in all the restaurants and bars! We ate at all the fancy dinners and they were all pretty good. My boyfriend loved Le Fleur and I like the Fondue. Japanese was alright too, I am from Vancouver BC and we have the best sushi so that is a compliment. The house wine was vinegar tasting in flavor and the margaritas were from a machine and too sweet, but hey, they are free and you get an assortment of booze in your room to kick it up a notch. Oh we went to the Thai restaurant too, it was only ok food but a great view! It cost us $75 Us for two meals and four drinks not bad I guess. The Beach was very good, bring water shoes tho I did and had a great time there. The pools are action packed with plenty of swim up bars music ect. I prefer the beach but I did have a few swims in the less busy area and I always found a shady chair or coverage at both the pool or the beach which is good I'm very fair. They have a live band every night for entertainment and a night club thing that was entertaining and they had great dancers! Our favorite thing was to rent a car on-site through Europe Car. We busted out of the confines of the hotel walls and drove to Chichen Itza. The car was hilarious no power steering or radio and little doughnut tires. We cruised the local highway past Tulum through Valladolid and onto Chichen Itza. What an amazing drive full culture. We also went to Grand Cenote located on the Coba highway just off of Tulum. It was amazing and cheap you have to do this even if you are not a great swimmer there are lots of places not over your head. We drove to Playa Del Carmen of course, and accidentally stumbled upon El Meca ruins in Cancun area they were gorgeous!! The road leading out of Grand Princess hotel is over a mile long so It was hard to walk in the sun to get to the highway which we did at Grand Sirenis and then caught the collectivo everywhere so just rent a car it is a good deal! We also went to Xcarlet this time and did the underground river tour twice, that was fun. We've been to Xe-Ha and the Tulum ruins before and I liked it better. As far as travels go... If you haven't seen the Coba ruins do it! they are old and natural with vines and twisted trees just beautiful. Anyhow the hotel would off been great If we had a different room with AC and clean bedding. I'm sure that 90 percent get a great room and are very pleased. the beach, buffet, entertainment and most the service was all great, Go and have a great time!", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis Mo", "Title": "\u201cMediocre\u201d", "Author": "Green0406", "ReviewID": "UR35574354", "Content": "My wife and I along with 3 other couples stayed at the Princess for 5 days in mid July 09.

I would not conisder my group high maintenance, but some of the workers acted as though we were bothering them. Room service was hard pressed. We had to practically beg for bath towels and even with that, most of our group still went 2-3 days without. The buildings and landscaping were very well kept, no complaints there. You do have to make reservations at restaurant, which I am not a fan of, but the food was average. The Italian restaurant \"Momma Mia\" did have delicious veal.

The main buffet restaurants were huge and the food was well stocked and replenished quickly - food can be a bit repetitive but that's to be expected when eating in the same place for 2 weeks. Plenty of choice but maybe not quite so much for vegetarians. The A La Carte restaurants were lovely and each decorated according to theme - was pleasantly surprised to find you can use these as often as you like but do have to be pre-booked which was easy to do. The hard working entertainments team put on shows every night (this is after working all day too!) apart from 2 nights when you would have entertainment from outside - again a little repetitive after 2 weeks but worth seeing once Not having done this type of holiday before one of the best bits for me was being able to get a sun bed no matter what time of day you went out! Plenty of swim up bars that served every drink under the sun as well as waitresses coming around the sun beds to take drink orders if getting in the pool was too much!.

The bar staff was great and the drinks actually had alcohol in them. We found that light tipping went a long way everywhere. We also tipped our maid service and the room was awesome everyday....very clean. The resort was large, but it was vacation and we did not hate the strolls back and forth. It is vacation and you should be able to enjoy yourself and take in the environment. There was plenty to do on the resort without ever having to leave for the day and night. There was a great open bar with live music almost every night that we really enjoyed. We did do the ATV jungle tour and it was a lot of fun and was worth it. We also did deep sea fishing, but I think it was a little over rated. It was reasonably priced and we all caught something, but it seemed like a long four hours. Make sure you get an interior view if possible. The pool scene was great. There were lots of huts and chairs. The pool and ocean both had lots of space and private areas.

We flew out of Ohare and stopped in Mexico City, let me tell you, there were quite a few people there that did look pretty sick so we stayed very far away from them. I didn't see one person in Riviera Maya that was sick though, only in Mexico City. So if you can stay away from there. After arriving at Cancun we were greeted by our transportation American Express. There were 9 with us and 2 at the hotel already from the previous day. I was worried that we were going to be put on a big bus and have to make lots of stops, but instead we had a van that fit us all comfortably and he zipped us to our resort right away. The trip from the airport to the resort was only 20 min. The Hotel- On our arrival the outside grounds are beautiful and we were all very excited. We requested an early check months in advanced since we would be arriving around 10:30am and I figured with the decrease of people being there, that would not be a problem, but it was. The resort was only at 65% capacity and not one of the 5 rooms was ready, I thought this was a little inconvenient. I went and spoke with the conceire and he told me that we could be in the room in about an hour, so we waited in the lobby bar enjoyed the the scenery and in about an hour our room was ready. We were all happy with that. The Rooms-All of us except 2 couples booked in the platinum rooms. We were in 5103. Rooms were just how they looked online and had plenty of room. We had a king size bed and it was pretty comfortable. Closets are good size and the bathroom is beautiful. There is a hair dryer in the bathroom but if you have thick or long hair, it will take forever for you to dry your hair, so I recommend you bring your own and don't forget something to keep the frizz down. As soon as I blow dried my hair and flat ironed it, I would say after about 15min outside you could barely tell all the work I put into my hair, so after the first day of that, I pretty much wore my hair in a ponytail. Okay back to the room, shower was nice, there is an overhead rain shower in there but not a lot of water pressure and then you have a handheld sprayer, which is good if you have sunburn so you can keep the water pressure away from those sensitive areas. We had no problem with the water leaking out, but we put a towel down just in case. We only used the tub one time and it wasn't bad. The patio was very nice and spacious but the view wasn't the best, we could see the ocean but it was far away and we were not directly in front of it. We noticed that the lower level floors have an extension on them that have 2 reclining chairs off their patio. My grandma stayed in 5017 and she had a nice view plus the extended area. There was the welcome liquor upon our arrival with some snacks. The fridge was full and stocked every day. I would say after the 3rd day of being there though our fridge stopped working and nothing was cold, but we barely used it anyways so it really didn't matter. The air conditioning could have been colder but it wasn't uncomfortable or anything like that. You can set it to 2 settings, one in Fahrenheit and the other is Celsius. We had it is F and set it at 64 degrees, it never dropped down below 71. The ceiling fans do help out though. You do have to have a key card in for some power to work so we just left one in all the time. I noticed sometimes when the maids would come that they would just pull it out a little to stop the power but that really only was for the lights and ceiling fans so it didn't really matter. The safe was great, we never had a problem with anyone taking anything and we put all our valuables in there. There are bugs here and very big ones at that. We had this huge freaky looking thing in our room one day and we just shoed it out, but the mosquitoes are quite horrible. When the maids come to clean the room, they leave the doors open, well there is tons of water all around the Platinum area so this is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. I would go to bed and wake up with more that what I had before I went to sleep. I just tried to stay covered as much as possible, there is really nothing you can do except bring maybe a mosquito repellent candle or something, I didn't want to smell like off went I went to bed. TV was good, there were quite a few channels, most in Spanish but there were some movie channels in English that we watched sometimes before we went to bed. Also room service was good, not too much of a selection, but they did have some good food and it only took about 20-35 min for the food to arrive. Platinum Lounge-The lounge was great, well worth the extra money by far. You can make reservations anytime of the day you want for as many days in advanced as you want. Our other friends staying in Junior Suites could only make their reservations for one day in advanced and only at a certain block of time in the day. Also our towels were just there laying outside by the platinum pool for you to take, you didn't have to give them a towel card and you can just leave them wherever and get a new one the next day. That was a plus for me. Also there are 4 computers there with internet access in case you need to check something. There is also a bar area that has food all throughout the day and night and this is quite good when the buffets are closed and you need a snack. The lounge itself is beautifully decorated and is air conditioned, so when you are waiting for the trolley to come to pick you up for dinner you can wait in there if you like instead of the heat. Transportation-the walk from the lobby to the platinum area is .9 of a mile, so it is a pretty good hike. We did walk it a few times because we got tired of waiting for the trolley, but by the time the trolley came by and went and picked up people, the walk being so long it passed us up, so I would say be patient and wait for it if you don't want to walk because it is much faster than walking even if you have to wait 10 min for it. Wear mosquitoes spray, the bugs are just horrible, they are everywhere and follow you as you are moving on the trolley, this is no joke, they will get you. lol. Pools-Loved the pools, there are just so many different areas to swim in, we mostly stayed in by the activity pool, where they water polo, tequila volleyball, water aerobics, and entertainment. One thing that I really liked is that they had a dj and he played really good music throughout the day. It was more upbeat stuff, like beyonce, gwen stefani, areosmith, pretty good stuff and I loved that part. The actual temp of the water is very warm; I wish it was about 10 degrees cooler at least. The water seems to be as warm as the air, and there is no refreshing feel in the water unless you get in the shade. Bars-There are lots of bars on the property and everyone works very hard. The drinks are very good and everyone was very friendly. Restaurants-We ate at the specialty restaurants everyday. By far the Mexican one was the best. We also enjoyed the Miso, but make sure you request to have a chef cook in front of you or the menu will be different if you sit just in the restaurant. We also tried the international, and I\u2019m a very picky eater so please remember that, the international was just so so. Other people in my group did like it somewhat, but I do recommend something else. Our friends in the Junior Suite tried the French restaurant and they liked it a lot. We did try the Thai beach restaurant and it was very good. The restaurant was amazing and you sit right next to the beach. Mama Mia was very good and I do recommend trying that one. We did not eat at the buffets for dinner, but we did do lunch and breakfast there and they had so much to offer, there was something for everyone. Entertainment-There were different shows each night in the theater and most of them were musicals, so I'm not a big fan of those so we usually went to the sports bar to play pool and get some drinks. We also played card games. They also have fuss ball and TVs with like espn on, so it wasn't bad in there. They also have the open air area where they have bands playing, but the mosquitoes were so bad we had to leave. The disco at night was good, they played lots of American music and some Mexican, but it was mostly good dance music that would hear back in the states like 50 Cent, Daddy Yankee, Lil John, ect. It didn't get to crowded and you had lots of room to dance around. The closed theater was nice because it was air conditioned and had so many chairs available, but I wish they would of had better shows. Excursions-We only did the tulum extreme excursion which included a tour at the ruins in tulum, which was beautiful, just breathtaking, then we did repelling down a 82ft high platform, that was awesome, then we did the zip lines, 3 of them which each one getting higher and longer, that was so much fun, and last but not least was swimming in the cenotes. You cannot wear fins, and there is no point to bring a water camera because it is too dark that the pics will not come out. It is very beautiful though. The swimming is only about 30 min, and I wish it were longer. The water is only about 75 degrees F, it was cold at first, but you got use to it right away and I wish the pools were that temp. This is pretty much an all day thing, you leave at 8am and don't get back till around 4pm. It was $86 U.S dollars per person, normally $96 but you can talk them down to $86. The give you drinks and at the end you get to eat a pretty good lunch. Then back to the hotel which is about an 1hr and 20 min drive. We also took a van to Playa de Carmen to shop around, and it was hot. Lots of shops and you can talk them down easily. They had some stores like Senor Frogs that you cannot bargain down, but you know right away by looking at the store if they are negotiable or not. Overall-This is a huge resort and they have lots to offer, not bad for the money you pay. It does have just some minor things that could be fixed, but overall I would give this resort a B.

Ist off, thanks to all those who reviewed previously. I leaned on your advice before choosing a resort. This was my first \"all-inclusive\" experience so I do not have a baseline to compare with. However, I do travel extensively on business. We stayed in the Platinum section and it was well worth it! Private bar with butler, fresh fruit, guacamole and salsa, appetizers every day. There are 4 internet terminals to use if you need to stay connected. The Platinum concierge is there 24-7 to help with reservations, questions, etc. The private pool was great too... felt like we had the place to ourselves. If you go platinum, ask for rooms from 5015 to 5021. We were on the 1st floor and had an ocean view (51xx for the 2nd floor, 52xx for the 3rd. The beach is separated from the hotel by a federally protected mangrove. There is a bridge just outside the platinum building that takes you to the sand in less than a minute! I was a bit concerned about the reviews claiming the food was sub par. We enjoyed both the buffets as well as the gourmet restaurants. The selection and variety was great, truly something for everyone. The staff was great too. Everyone was friendly and greeted us with a smile. Some of the restaurant workers did go at their own pace. We waited for drinks now and again but nothing to get upset about. The only unpleasant person there was the transportation concierge from Best Day Travel. She was a bit of a rattlesnake. The free shuttle into Playa Del Carmen leaves at 10:00 AM and 12:00 Noon. Only one pickup at 6:00 but we always returned by taxi as it was only $13. If you plan to see Tulum, take the free shuttle to Playa, then buy a bus ticket to Tulum. The ADO Mexican bus was very nice and dirt cheap. We took a cab back from Tulum and only paid $40. At Tulum there are a number of tour guides; look for Mosiah from Mosiah Tours. He was great fun and had tremendous knowledge about the Mayans. As for the gourmet restaurants: Miso - Teppan Grill was best so we went twice. The traditional Japanese menu was only so-so. La Hacienda - Fancied up Mexican dishes. Good but not any better than the Mexican offered in the buffets. Other guests told us that the French and Swiss were mediocre so we passed. We did not dine at the steakhouse or the Italian outlet. The Beach: Great sand, great loungers and beautiful water. The beach extends out some 100+ yards before it gets deep. fun to swim and float in but perhaps a bit tame for a hard-core boogie boarder. We routinely saw fish swimming around us in the shallows. It was cool. Wave runners are $65/30 mins. All non motorized play is free... boogie boards, snorkels, fins & masks, cayaks, and even a catamaran sailboat if you know what you are doing. We walked north up the beach to the next resort and their sand was bad with plenty of rocks. I woke up early to see the sunrise and was surprised to see a uniformed crew of groundskeepers there to rake up the seaweed. The grounds throughout the resort were immaculate. My only complaint is that they serve pepsi and not Coke products! If you are sitting on the fence about this place don't hesitate... GO GO GO.

The food in nearly every circumstance was pretty awful. They've got some rules in place that are really laughable. Here's one example. If you go to eat at the Asian restaurant, they offer 2 menus, one for sushi, the other for cooked food. Everyone at your table must order from one menu though. So, if someone at your table wants sushi, then they have to sit at a different table, even if that table is directly next to yours??? The service overall can be painful.

A huge complex with two hotels with amazing grounds that have pristine upkeep. The food so far has been great and there are enough resteraunts and pools to keep you busy for days. I am staying in the platinum suite which is beautiful and roomy but that is where the niceness ends. One woman I spoke with had her money taken out of her wallet that sat in her suitcase by one of the maids. Nothing was done to help her. We tried to give a $20 deposit for a cable and they refused to take it because it had a little tear in it. The workers seem lethargica and angry if you ask them for anything. I got up to ask for water at lunch. The woman told me to sit down and she would go get me some. Went into the kitchen, got some and then did not come back. Stood at her station laughing with her co workers. when I went back up to get water she looked at me like I was bothering her. I went to walk my daughter into my room and was told by a guard quite rudely she could not go to my room as she was not platiunum. I was thinking of upgrading her but she wanted to see the room. The man was going to physically restrain her from coming up for two minutes. What could have resolved this was maybe a five minute orientation at check in so we would know the rules. They spend more time enforcing their rules then watching for the staff that is stealing from their guests. Pool closes eight o clock sharp and they have guards enforcing it. I made reservations for the mexican resteraunt. The power went out in my daughters rooms and it took an hour for them to fix it. They were twenty minutes late because of this and were chastised by the maitre de being told they were lucky they did not cancel them because they were busy. The place had only five tables with people at it. This is like a concentration camp with the staff being harsh and critical if we wander outside the lines. Again, give us an orientation so we know what is what. For a place that has 50% occupancy, during a recession and the swine flu crisis you would think they would want to create a happy vacation feeling instead of treating us like children the entire time. I have been to Puerto Vallarta twice for vacation and the workers seem to enjoy what they are doing. I spend 6 days a week waiting on people and helping their experience be a fantastic one and I saved my money a long time to have a pampered fun vacation. I will not go here again.

The recession and the swine flu have impacted on the resort pretty badly, running at barely 60% capacity according to our travel rep. The positive impact for customers was plenty of space around the pool (you could get a section to yourself) and down on the beach. There was a choice of pools where you could opt for a quieter area or go to a more lively pool with music, games and pool bar. The beach was very nice as well with plenty of sun lounges and area in the sea for swimmers only. I was very pleased with our bedroom, big bed and even a bigger bathroom with two basins. The resort is tailored mainly to the American market, which as a British tourist, did have positive and negative points. The food was good on the whole. No complaints, we used the buffet restaurant usually. Although there were Mexican dishes available, I wished they did more effort to offer them instead of catering for the American taste bud. Tipping the staff was something we had to get used to do, to housekeeping, waitresses etc. It would have been something that we wouldn\u2019t have done (especially when it involves tipping housekeeping) if we hadn\u2019t checked ahead. Because of the all-inclusive package, beer and cocktails was available on tap (As a Brit, I found hard to get used to a self-service beer tap in the buffet restaurant!). If the resort was mainly used by British and/other European tourist, I would personally fear that it might cause problems. But I didn\u2019t see any kind of those issues at the resort. All in all, we had a good time at this very nice resort. Positive Points: 1. A lovely beach. Plenty of sun beds, shade, bar with waiting service. There were security and plenty of staff so you could feel safe about leaving your items on the beach when you went for a swim. 2. Staff were great, friendly and helpful. 3. Good rooms, very comfortable with air-con and fan. The bed was huge, so plenty of space to move around. 4. The resort was very well kept, the grass was always cut and hedges and plant looked regularly pruned. The pools were very clean. Negative points: 1. the themed restaurants were a bit of letdown. We tried one or two and we were let down. I don\u2019t think the resort really has understood the Fondue concept. My hope that at least they could be trusted in cooking the local dishes, but our experience at the Mexican restaurant was mixed (although the tomato soup I had was very good) 2. Lack of transportation to the Playa De Carmen. There was a very limited bus service to the local town. Would have appreciated a regular bus service, even if we had to pay a few dollars/pesos each way. Advice 1. For Brits, tip well and tip regularly. For the waiters, usually a dollar per serving. Two dollars for the housekeeping and a dollar towards the minibar. 2. If you want to some really good Mexican food and do some gift shopping, head to Playa da Carmen where you will be spoiled for choice.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NC", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay here!!!!\u201d", "Author": "dberg71", "ReviewID": "UR34245491", "Content": "My friend and I decided on this resort based on the recommendation of our travel agent.

I had done the all-inclusive vacation thing once before, 11 years ago, in Acapulco, and I swore I would never do it again. However, our time at the GRP totally changed my opinion of all-inclusive vacation packages. The grounds of the GRP are amazing. They are extremely well-manicured, and everything is just maintained so well. The beach is phenomenal (beautiful sand and water, lots of lounge chairs--in sun and shade, and good service from the wait staff), and the pools are also great, with both sunny and shaded areas. The buffets had a great variety of tasty food, and the staff was always friendly. Indeed, staff members frequently greeted us with a friendly \"hola\" as we walked about the resort. Be sure to try some of the a la carte restaurants, too. We booked both Miso (Japanese hibachi restaurant) and La Hacienda (Mexican food). Both restaurants were good, but we definitely preferred Miso and the skills of our chef, Eduardo. During our stay, we made an excursion to see the ancient Mayan ruins of Tulum, which was just a short bus-ride away. The excursion was totally coordinated by Lomas Travel, which has a location at the resort, and it only cost $35/person, which we thought was very reasonable. We also made a trip into the town of Playa del Carmen one evening for shopping and dinner. Although there are buses that run from the resort to town for free, we took a taxi to and from, which cost about $12 USD each way (which was the price regardless of whether one person or four people were traveling). The town of PdC is amazing! We were all so impressed! Be sure to check out 5th Avenue, which is bustling with activity, and is full of shops, restaurants, and hotels. We had a fantastic dinner at Ula Gula (located on 5th Ave. at 10th St.), which had wonderful seafood, chicken, and beef dishes. Everything at Ula Gula was wonderful, but the best thing had to be the molten chocolate cake they served in a tiny cappuccino cup. Souffle-like on top, with molten chocolate below, it was to die for. I'm tempted to return to PdC just to have another taste of that delicious molten cake! If I had to come up with a complaint, I think the quality of the bedding could be improved a bit. The sheets were a bit rough on a couple of the nights of our stay (sheets seemed to be \"pilling\"), and on the last night of our stay, the sheets smelled a little musty--like they had sat in the washer too long before being put into the dryer.

I needed to right this review We traveled with our teenage daughter and another family with a teenage daughter. The food was good and the drinks were the same as any other all-inclusive resort, when you could find somebody to get you one. When we went the resort it was relatively new and they did not have the staff to serve all the people at the pool or the beach. That was one big down fall even if you tipped the waiter or waitress did not come around. I read Trip Advisor and try to take the comments with a grain of salt and know that a person or resort cannot please everyone. With this in mind, I read that the water in the some showers leaked out into the bathroom, the water does not grain fast enough and the shower floods. I took my chances and guess what, we got one of these rooms. When I called the front desk they sent a maintenance person and he told me he could not fix it and we would be moved. We were there for seven days and were not moved by the fifth day I gave up, but after I fell with the water on the marble floor, I called the manager and he was a JERK!, he did not care and did not try to make it right. That was our experience with the room and management. We have traveled to Mexico almost twice a year for ten years and normally we go back to the same three resorts but thought we would try something new, WE WILL NEVER WASTE OUR MONEY HERE AGAIN! I believe the service should start with the manager, but obviously the service reflects management. The food was good and there was a big variety, but the resort advertises they have room service, they do, but at a fee, the hotel charges you to deliver the room service, this was the FIRST all-inclusive resort that we have stayed at that charged for room service, maybe somebody out there has had to pay but we haven't. The resort is very big and it is a long distance to walk from the front to the beach or if you have a room in the last building by the beach. All in all, the resort is nice and new but the service and management is something that needs work. I would not stay there again because of this, we spend alot of money on our vacations and look forward to them. I don't want to have drama while I am there.

We took one day trip to the Coba ruins (magnificent) and then onto zip-lining, rappelling, kayaking and swimming in a cenote. I highly recommend this trip! There's a lot packed into one day - but it's so worth it! Also, a couple of days into Playa for some shopping, which I enjoyed, and didn't find the guys too pushy! There isn't a lot of shade in Playa tho - so wear a hat!! Or stop into a place for a beverage to cool off a little. The rest of the vacation was enjoyed pool or ocean side! Soaking up the sun, relaxation and overall great time! I must also say, that the direct pool access from our room was a real treat and we enjoyed most afternoons there.

We found the airport at Cancun a bit off-putting. First of all, my husband's luggage arrived within 15 minutes of waiting at the luggage carousel. However, mine was one of the last to be \"de-planed\" (about 30 minutes later) - I thought it was lost. After that, we were diverted by who we thought was a Transat Holidays' rep but we discovered turned out to be someone trying to get us to take tours (I think). Then, we had a difficult time trying to find our transportation. I expected a nice bus, but we were instead crammed in a minibus. Our bus ride to the resort was scary - the driver was a bit of a maniac! When we got to the resort, we were dropped off at the Sunset side and told we had to go to the Grand Riviera side. Due to the sheer enormity of the resort, we had some difficulty even finding the other side, but eventually did and check in was quick. Things got better after that though. We stayed in a deluxe juniour suite and it was beautiful, spacious and clean. The bathroom was wonderful with the jacuzzi tub, double sinks and separate shower and toilet stalls. The only thing I could say is that the water definitely does seep out the shower door so we shoved a towel outside the door to stop the leakage. We had difficulty getting clean towels on a daily basis. Some days we would get two towels and one facecloth, other days one towel, etcl. Communication with the maid staff was also difficult. I tried to use my basic Spanish but didn't fare too well. The buffets (both the Grand Riviera and Sunset sides) were very good. We could always find something good to eat. It did tend to be quite crowded during the dinner hour but the resort was almost at capacity we were told. We at three of the a la carte restaurants. The Mexican was very disappointing, both with service and the food. Our server appeared to be new and her superior was constantly hovering and berating her in front of us. The Japanese was our favourite - great service and good food. The International was also quite nice. Our server was excellent and the food was delicious. We didn't go to the beach often because it was extremely difficult to get a chair and the ground was rocky in the water. We hung around the pools mostly. They were very clean but the water was really quite cool. As far as the swim-up bar at the main pool, it was sometimes difficult getting service because the barmen had to wait on both the pool side and the land side. Also, there were \"regulars\" who hung around the swim-up side and tended to get all the attention. The only thing I can TRULY complain of about this hotel (other than the weather which was very cool with rain a couple of times) is that it does not seem to have much of a \"soul\". The decor in the restaurants is quite bland - basically boxes with tables and little decoration. Yes, the hotel is spotless and beautiful but it is lacking in any genuine warmth. I think this is probably due to the sheer size of it. It wasn't very welcoming. Would I go back there? I don't think so. It is just a little bit too large. I would go back to the Mayan Riviera but to a smaller, more intimate (and adults only) resort.", "Date": "May 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Nova Scotia", "Title": "\u201cNice Resort - but would not go back..\u201d", "Author": "NovaScotiaBeachBabes", "ReviewID": "UR29457038", "Content": "Beautiful well kept resorts - lots of walking.

The beach was rocky and difficult getting in but the ocean water and the fish swimming around you were beautiful.

The pools seemed to be very busy during the day and extremely hot around the pool. Hard to get a chair until later in the day. We never experienced a problem booking the A La Carte restaurants and the buffet had tons to choose from - you would have to be an extremely picky eater not to find anything.

The flaming Coffee bar was a huge hit everynight and worth the wait in line, entertainment every night and lots of beach weddings to watch throughout the day. The lobby bar was my favorite and we had excellent service by my fave bar tenders, Enienco, Lucas and Anthony - THANKS for making our nights fun.. I would definitely recommend taking a trip into Playa Del Carmen at night, great little restaurants, lots of shopping, you can even by a Corona and walk down the street shopping...

So if you're going already, here are some important tips: 1. BUY WATER SHOES FOR THE OCEAN. I can't stress it enough; you're feet will get cut up by the rock when entering the water and about 20 - 30 feet out. Sandy ocean bottoms are out there, but you have to go a ways to find them. Water was really nice, warm, and only up to 4 feet about 100 feet out. Waves are pretty much non-existent, so if you're looking for relatively calm, here it is... 2. UPGRADE TO PLATINUM. We got a great platinum (area /hotel rooms near the beach) upgrade thru our travel agent and really liked the spacious room. 3. DON'T STAY HERE IF YOU'RE NOT INTO WALKING. Many a 'Large Marge' complained about having to walk long distances. Boo - hoo. Get out there and enjoy the weather... it's fantastic. And start an exercise regime, you lazy marys... 4. MAKE ALL OF YOUR RESERVATIONS FOR THE NICE RESTAURANTS IN ONE SITTING WITH THE CONCIERGE IF POSSIBLE. You will avoid mucho headache-o. Italian one was the nicest; Japanese one was ok. Mexican one s*cked. We own a restaurant and I was always looking at food portions, service, etc. TIP THE WAITER 3 BUCKS WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AND YOU WILL RECEIVE STELLAR SERVICE. That red wine will make you feel great after about 3 glasses... 4A. DON'T ORDER ROOM SERVICE IF YOU ARE IN PLATINUM. It took 1.5 hours to get two cheeseburgers and a couple of warm beers. Bad bad bad... 5. BEACH VOLLEYBALL WAS AWESOME. Get ready to tan your butt off... it's nice on the beach. 6. YES, THERE ARE BUGS AT THIS RESORT. Wear protection and you should be fine at night... you're in Mexico. There are bugs there. 7. MAKE SURE YOU ARE TALKING TO AT LEAST 18 YEAR OLDS AT THE RESORT'S NIGHTCLUB, NOT 16 YEAR OLDS. My wife and I went out dancing one night at their cheesy disco and oversaw a poor schmuck and his pal trying to pick up these three girls who looked about 19 or 20. It was kinda funny; one of the girl's brothers came up to them and told them to lay off, letting these guys know they were only 16 years old. Mexican prisons are bad. Don't go. 8. SLEEP OUT UNDER THE STARS. Absolutely beautiful. My 1 year old daughter could not sleep one night, so I took her for a walk. We ended up lying down on one of the Platinum pool beds and just looking up at the stars. 72 degrees with a very minor breeze and a blanket. Put her right to sleep. Breathtaking. 9. DON'T BREATHE IN THE NIGHT AIR IF THEY ARE BURNING CROPS NEXT DOOR TO THE RESORT. This kinda sucked for us. One night, there was a smell of trees or shrubs or something burning (no, unfortunately, not that stuff) and it made us cough. 10. BREATHE IT IN. Screw it, you're in Mexico!

I went with family and friends. There were 8 of us total. 4 adults and 3 children (ages 10, 14 and 15). The resort itself is beautiful and kept clean but poorly constructed in some areas. For instance, every time we took showers, the water from the shower stall would run into the toilet stall. The resort is HUGE so bring your walking shoes or you will have swollen ankles and sore feet like me. The maid service seemed fine. They cleaned our room daily. And I saw a lot of reviews about people\u2019s things being stolen. We used the safe and it did not get broken into and none of the things we left around the room were taken either. I\u2019m not a beach person so I can\u2019t really speak too much about the beach. The pool was nice, no complaints about that. We ordered room service a couple of times and that was fine. I only ate at 2 of the restaurants that you needed reservations for. La Vaqueria and The Mexican restaurant (I can\u2019t remember the name of it right now). La Vaqueria was really good. We all enjoyed that meal. Unfortunately that was the only good meal we had the entire 5 days there. The lunch and dinner buffets were gross! Breakfast was always good. You can\u2019t really mess up an omelet, hash browns or a waffle, which is what I ate every morning. The service at the buffet was horrible. We were seated day after day with no glasses for water and no silverware. And when one of us asked the server about water, he pointed to the fountain where you could get your own water. Meanwhile, they are serving water, beer and wine to everyone else but never once coming over to us to see if we wanted anything to drink. My nephew got sick one of the days we were there. We\u2019re not quite sure from what but we suspect it was the burgers or the milk. We took him to the \u201cdoctor\u201d they have on the premises. And I use the term doctor loosely. He did not speak English very well, ok, no surprises there. And after examining him for only 5 minutes, he diagnoses him with appendicitis and tried to get us to take him to the hospital in Mexico. And this service is not free of course. He wanted 1650 pesos (roughly $127 USD) for his services. What a rip off! When my nephew woke up in the morning he was fine. It was obviously food poisoning!

Building craftsmanship wasn\u2019t perfect although it never is many places and I don\u2019t mind if my marble grout line isn\u2019t all straight. It has a modern feel. The check in and check out were quick and easy. We had 4 rooms and requested to be near each other as well as a couple of extra beds and a crib and all requests were met (hotel made no guarantees though). We did have to remind housekeeping staff an hour after arrival about the extra beds as they were not in the rooms yet. These arrived shortly after. Plenty of pools spread out throughout the property. The area is large but manageable. They do provide golf carts that run behind the Riviera side back and forth all day. The staff is courteous and friendly. We had 4 rooms and none of us was missing any property although we did use the safe for valuables. The beach was pretty. We had windy days creating small waves but it was shallow and not dangerous (for those 10 and older). A few rocks entering the water but not many. Water shoes helpful but not absolutely necessary. Food at the buffets was plentiful, not gourmet but good and something for everyone. Lots of fruits at breakfast and lunch. A la carte restaurants were mediocre. We tried the Italian, the seafood and the Grill. The Grill was awful (menu looks good but what you get is burnt and tasteless), the Italian and seafood just acceptable with a good fried red snapper and dessert at Las Olas for dinner. It is a pain you have to make your reservation in person and hotel doesn\u2019t allow them by phone. Drinks were very good. Sergio at the pool bar by las Olas makes the best Mojito\u2019s. Good service around the pool and beach. There are a few waiters that will come around and take your drink order if you don\u2019t want (or can\u2019t) get up and get them yourself. Entertainment - I didn\u2019t catch all the night shows but part of the circus act I saw was good. The band in the main plaza played music geared to an older audience, late 50\u2019s perhaps. I am 46 (immature 46) and I still like to dance but not to their music. I tried the disco, which only starts at 10:30pm but perhaps they were catering to a 20 something crowed as their music was unrecognizable to me (keep in mind I do like contemporary stuff as I have a 12 yr old girl). It wasn\u2019t a big deal to me though, after a kahlua with rum I was ready to sleep. Pool and beach chair reserving situation is RIDICULOUS. One can\u2019t get a chair in the shade past 7:30 am. I never thought I would have to join the chair grabbers but our group had small children and by the third day I had to become part of the culture (2 early risers in our group did). I did see many chairs reserved and unoccupied for several hours. That should not be. NO COFFEE WITH DESSERT \u2013I had a big issue with the lack of coffee at dinner time. I am used to having my dessert with coffee. Well, none of the restaurants!!! serve coffee after dinner. There are 2 small coffee carafes in the main plaza area where one can get a cup of coffee at night but the one time I tried to get one, both carafes were empty!! No Soap holder in my shower \u2013 I know this is minor but the first day I noticed that there was no soap holder in the shower. It felt kind of gross to put my soap on the shower floor. I know the hotel was fairly new but surely they had to provide a place for your soap therefore I wrote a note to housekeeping requesting one. It was never answered. I checked our other rooms and some of them did have a flimsy holder so I figured ours had broken off. After a couple of days I put the soap bar on top of my conditioner bottle (a big bottle I had to purchase locally) and it took care of problem. No room service included in Jr. Suite. There is a charge for Room Service in the Jr. Suite category. This was not a major inconvenience but once the divers in our group arrived at hotel before restaurants were open for dinner and they had to wait 45min at the sports bar (only place opened 24hrs) for food. No hair conditioner or lotion provided in rooms. First time I stay at a hotel that does not provide these. Hotel did provide shoe polish sponge and combs, none of which I needed. We went to local Wal-Mart and purchased some. Mosquitoes \u2013 I think the unusual breeze days kept the mosquitoes away during the day in most areas of hotel. Be careful in the bathroom right next to beach. This one is not air-conditioned and next to the stagnant water under the bridge to the beach and in this bathroom I saw many mosquitoes. Would I go back? Absolutely \u2013 It hit the spot. Relaxation--- and everything else was minor. AND NO ONE GOT SICK. Best advice: traveling cups for keeping drinks cold.

This is only our second all-inclusive resort stay. We stayed at the Grand Riviera Princess from April 19 to April 24 2009. We were very pleased with all aspects of this resort. Here are the details: Cancun Airport, be advised, when leaving the airport, to your left will be some commercial tourist operators, that are simply trying to sell you timeshares. It looks official, especially since they are set-up in the airport. Keep walking outside and ask someone for your shuttle service. We used American Express Travel for our airport transportation. I can\u2019t say I was super impressed. The drive from the airport should have been 45 minutes, and after talking with others, that is how long it took them to arrive at the resort. However, we had to make 4 other drop-offs at 4 other resorts, so our travel time was an hour and a half. The return trip was 45 minutes. So, my advice, ask them how many drop-offs they have to make in between the airport and resort and request to get in a shuttle with 1 other drop-off. Once at the Grand Riviera Princess (about 4:00) the check-in was quick, as there was no line. The receptionist explained everything about the resort and we received written information. His English was good, so it was east to understand. As with any new resort, there is a bit of a learning curve, but he helped with the initial orientation. At this point, a little bit of a tip goes a long way. We stayed in room 9024, which was one of the Villas. There are 4 tiers of guests. Junior Suites, Junior Deluxe suites, Platinum and Villa. It seems to me, if you can get a Platinum room with an ocean view, those are nice rooms. The villas are nice as well. Rooms: Our room had an outdoor shower, an in-room Jacuzzi tub for two, sitting area, flat screen TV, walk-in closet and balcony overlooking a lagoon. The in-room safe worked fine with no problems. We tipped the maid 3 dollars a day and always received prompt, clean service. The minibar was stocked with beer, soda, water and juice. Upon arrival we were greeted by 5 bottle of liquor: vodka, rum, whiskey and two bottle of tequila. As well as a dried fruit platter. The only drawback to these rooms were that the mosquito\u2019s could get in through the gap in the door by the outdoor shower. We were very tolerant of this, as we both have done a ton of camping, but I think most would not. You will need to put on bug spray if you do not want to get bitten at night when you sleep. Otherwise the room was free of any other type of critters. Location/resort layout: The resort can be split in two ways. First you have the Sunset and the Riviera sides. Both sides are pretty identical and share all amenities. However, the Riviera side of the resort (the rooms that face inward) get late afternoon sun and the Sunset side rooms that face inward get early morning sun. The second way the resort can be split is the lobby end and the beach end. Most restaurants, all nighttime entertainment and the better evening bars are located near the lobby. The best pools and of course the beach action is located at the opposite end of the resort near the beach. There are pools and rooms in between all this as well. I\u2019ve read all the reviews that say it takes 15-20 minutes to walk the length of the resort and I\u2019d have to say that is an exaggeration. A normal person walking can do it in about 10 minutes. However, this may be a problem for older people or families with young children. It also presents a nuisance for those that want to quickly go back to their room and get something, as depending on where you are located, this could be difficult. We felt that having a room closer to the lobbies, was more convenient. We could grab breakfast, go to our room and head to the beach for the day. After dinner and entertainment, you could quickly go back to your room. The villas are closer to the lobby end and the platinum suites are next to the beach. The Junior and Deluxe suites run along the length of the resort. Beach: The beach is long, great for walking. The water is turquoise, blue and dark blue. The waves can get pretty big. Yes, the water is a bit rocky, but that depended upon where you went in. Some places it was not, others is was. Bring water shoes and you\u2019ll be fine. The beach faces east, great for sunrises! They have kayaks, jet ski, sailing (Hobie Cats) and other water sports. All of the non-powered activities are free, but for example, you can only reserve the sailing for an hour a day. Book it for the week, as it is popular. I recommend the first timeslot at 10:00. Winds were strong, but not too strong at this point, often increasing as the day went along. However, if you get the 10:00 timeslot you can usually get an extra 15 minutes of on-water time (starting at 9:45) without having to wait for someone to come in from sailing. There is also quite a bit of on-beach activities like aerobics, soccer, volleyball, etc\u2026 There are vendors and waitresses bringing you drinks as well. There were always plenty of chairs and hidden spots to set-up for the day. Food/Restaurants: The buffets were clean and the food was pretty good. Plenty to choose from. We always tipped our server $1, and the coffee kept coming. We did not get sick from any of the food, this is a good thing. We ate at the Mexican restaurant, the Western Grill, the Japanese Hibachi and the Italian Restaurant. You will need to make reservations. And must make them at least one day in advance, but we made ours for the whole week. The best was the Japanese Hibachi, (you must request this, as there are three menus), followed by the Italian which was also very good and then the Mexican and Grill. Skip the grill. We heard the seafood restaurant was excellent. We always tipped $10 if the service was good, and it always was. Recommendations: Tip often. We tipped our housekeeping $3/day, bartenders $1, waiters at the restaurant $10 and buffet servers $1. You will notice a difference. I also tipped the beachfront staff, the boat was always rigged a ready to go for me. We liked the lobby bar the best, and the pools closest to the beach. For those that want more action, the \u201cparty\u201d pool was always hopping. You need shoes and long pants for men for the restaurants, but most people dressed casually for the buffets. The nightly entertainment was okay, nothing spectacular. Don\u2019t expect Broadway. There were daily excursions and nightly excursions as well. You cannot get bored here, there is plenty to do. Would we recommend this resort, yes, would we go back, probably not, as we like to try new places. However, this will be our new standard for other resorts to meet and exceed. I can see why others may have complaints about this resort, especially as you compare different aspects of it to other resorts they have been to, but\u2026We found the staff in all areas to be friendly, attentive and helpful. This is a nice, clean and quiet restful resort.

Before booking we were not certain which resort to choose, as, we found that there are both good & bad reviews for this hotel, as well as for almost ANY other hotel, so, we took a chance, and we are GLAD THAT WE DID! The reality is this: this resort is not a perfect place, but, it is a GREAT place and it offers outstanding value (at least for us; we paid $1320 CDN each for 7 nights including direct flights at great times with Air Canada): the grounds are truly gorgeous, the security is top-notch, the buffet food was very good (we really did like the buffet and we found this to be a really big point; we also come from Montreal and we are used to good food, so, this is a pretty big statement!), the staff were really friendly, and the beach and pools were beautiful. On the negative side, we found the place to be a little bit too big (lots of walking), the a la carte restaurants were only \u201cOK\u201d, there is no food at the pools or beach other than (lousy) hot dogs, the drinks were not strong (we seemed to always have to ask for more booze in the drink!), and unless you asked, you got the cheap local alcohol, the house wine was bad (tasted not so great and almost no alcohol content!) and the entertainment was boring! Anyways, the truth is that \"the good did outweigh the bad\", and, as we were looking for a \u201crelaxing vacation\u201d and not a \u201cwild & crazy time\u201d, we were Ok with the low-quality entertainment. The hotel seemed great for both young and middle-aged couples (we are in mid-40\u2019s) but is maybe too big for seniors. It also seemed really good for families (there were many families, but, since there are 7 pools and the place is so big, you don\u2019t have to be near the noise of the kids!). I don\u2019t think though that it would be a great choice for singles, unless you are looking for a quiet time. OUR RATINGS: Resort Grounds: 5/5, Location: 5/5, Cleanliness: 5/5, Security: 5/5, Staff Friendliness: 5/5 , Pools: 5/5, Beach: 4.5/5, Animators: 2.5/5, Entertainment: 2.5/5, Disco: 4/5, Buffet: 4.5/5, A la Carte: 3/5, Sports Bar food: 3/5, Drinks: 3.5/5, House Wine: 2/5, Rooms: 4.5/5, Beds: 4.5/5, Overall Experience: 4.5/5 BUFFETS: We really enjoyed the food at the buffets! Breakfast had tons of choices with custom made omeletes & eggs plus all kinds of pancakes, French toast, bacon, ham, sausages, etc.. plus lots of other food including lunch-type items. Also lots of delicious fresh fruit every day! We had melon, cantaloupe and pineapple every morning. Tip the wait staff $1 and they treat you like royalty, but, even if you do not tip, they will certainly give great service! They were really nice staff. We found that the buffet at the front of the hotel seemed to have better service than the ones near the beach; also, although the breakfast hours were from 7-10:30 AM, even if you arrived at 10:29, they still were HAPPY to make you fresh eggs and they did NOT rush you out of there. The buffet near the beach DID close promptly at 10:30 however. The lunches had pastas, burgers, Mexican, soups, and tons of salad choices. We ALWAYS found yummy food. The ribs were outstanding too! Kids will also find lots to choose from including chicken nuggets, grilled cheese with ham, nachos,, fries, etc. Believe it or not, the dinners too were delicious. Every night they had custom-made-to-order pastas (you could add for example giant prawns etc..) as well as many different beef, pork, and chicken dishes. There were always Mexican choices too. The guacamole was good, and we seemed to always take some, but, it was nothing like the freshly made-at-our-table gaucamole that we had 1 night in Playa de Carmen. None the less, the food choices were plenty and the quality very good! At least for an all-inclusive buffet. BTW: I don't quite understand the need for room service, as, you cannot be hungry when you leave the buffet! Also, NO STOMACH PROBLEMS AT ALL!!!!! Now that's important! A la Carte Restaurants: We heard many complain that they had trouble getting reservations. We had NO trouble at all; we could go at 4 P.M. and book for the next 2 nights. We think this was because we had upgraded rooms which gave us priority! Sometimes we had to take a later reservation (8:45 or 9 or 9:15), but we didn\u2019t mind this as we like to relax before dinner and maybe have a few drinks and check out the entertainment. The sad part was it always seemed that there were empty tables at the restaurants so I think there is some sort of scam happening here. But if you do have an upgrade room, or, if you don't mind eating later, you will have no trouble getting a reservation. Just for the reservations it is worth paying for a deluxe suite! MISO ASIAN: was fabulous! LAS OLAS Seafood: was \u201cOK\u201d but not amazing, and is located where a breakfast/lunch buffet is held and not the nicest ambiance SWISS FONDUE: located next to LAS OLAS & we heard this was NOT very good at all! MEXICAN: was the same Mexican food as the buffet and the fajitas were not very good at all! You could have much better fajitas back home at The KEG, Moe\u2019s., Casey\u2019s, etc.! We think you should be able to get better Mexican in Mexico than in Canada? I don\u2019t know - are we asking for too much? LOL. VAQUERIA (grill): the lamb was delicious but my wife\u2019s chicken was NOT (and was tiny; we had to go to the buffet so she could get a pasta after eating there!) LA FLEUR: others told us it was very good! MAMA MIA: we never went, but others said it was good. There was so much pasta that was really delicious at the buffets, we didn't see the need to eat there. It seemed to be the busiest however and hardest to reserve. SPORTS BAR 24/7: A/C didn't seem to be strong enough, and the staff seemed less friendly and didn't really understand English. Hmmmm? They served nachos and gaucamole, but ran out every 5 minutes..and took 15 more to re-plenish it. Weird. You could also order decent burgers and grilled cheese with ham, both with fries but that was it. There was nothing else to eat. Maybe if you speak Spanish there might be...but who knows? I think they need to improve this place a little but at least it is open 24/7. Platinum rooms: These are located near the beach and offer 24 hour room service, private butlers, a private pool, and instant dinner reservations. This all sounds good and the people who stayed there liked it. We question the value though: they seem to be around $300-$450 extra per person, and for that money, you can have some fabulous dinners in Playa de Carmen! Although we certainly would NOT pay the extra for these rooms, others that we talked to told us they were glad that they did. Ok. VILLA LAGOON ROOMS: They looked beautiful, except the lagoon is either totally green in 1 section, or, totally dried up in the other section and smelled like dead fish! They seemed to be a total rip-off and definately not worth the extra $$$! POOLS: They are salt-water and nicer than swimming in chlorine! They are gorgeous! There is a wild & crazy one with swim-up bar, but the animators get boring as they do the same (boring) things every day. There are several quiet, more romantic pools. And absolutely NO problems finding a chaise lounger unless you want shade. You did have to wake up by 7-8 A.M. to get the ones with shade. No big deal. BTW: towels seem to be a problem; you are best to ask at the front desk if you can't get a towel at the towel hut, and, keep it for the week! BEACH: The beach was really nice and great for walking. Easy to get a chaise lounger. Great bar! Only complaint was that the only food was (lousy) hot dogs. You could walk for miles in either direction. Nice and sandy, although a little rocky in spots in the water. You can also get an amazing massage on the breach for $50/hr or $90 for 2 people! THE DETAILS: The resort is split into 2 wings; 1 side is the Grand Riviera, the other is the Grand Sunset. They look alike, but some say the rooms are nicer on the Riviera side? One thing to note is that if you have a pool-side room, the Sunset side gets the morning sun on the balcony and the Riviera side gets the afternoon sun on the balcony. We stayed on the Riviera side. We booked with Vacances TMR through www.ITRAVEL2000.com (great website) (NB: The TMR rep was hard to find, and, it seemed like Transat had the best set-up and a few extra perks, including the free use of 2 computers \u2013 a really nice perk!). We arrived at the check-in around 3 P.M., and, although we had only paid for a junior suite, we politely asked for an upgrade. We were told there was nothing available; I was about to see if giving a tip would help when all of the sudden, they found us a Deluxe Suite near the beach and gave it to us @ N/C! We were delighted! The resort is beautiful and it is huge \u2013 we thought that being close to the beach was a good thing. In reality, we found the walk to the room to be WAY too far, especially after drinking at night or going to the disco! Well, when we got to our room (6108), which was just getting made-up, we found that there was a really bad sewage smell inside the room. We had read a few reviews that talked about this, and, we thought that maybe all the rooms were like this? We looked outside the patio doors and saw that we had a view of ugly scrub brush, like an ugly forest. We looked at each other and said that we were not happy, upgrade or not! We were tired and decided to settle-in. Well, at 4 A.M. we were wide awake because of the smell and we were really unhappy! At breakfast we asked others if they had the same smell and they said that they didn\u2019t, so we decided that we cannot stay in this room and we went to the front desk and asked the concierge for the manager. They offered to help us and asked what the problem was; when we told them, they said that they would send maintenance to clean the air-conditioner. Well we said that there was no way that this would get rid of the smell and we demanded another room. They said that there were none; well, we sat there and again demanded that they find us one! They looked again. And, after about a 20 minute wait, the concierge came back and said that they will change us to another suite, pool-side, located in the center of the complex. Well, when we entered the room, we could not believe the difference! The room was the same, but, the view was really beautiful! The deluxe suites also have a 2-person jacuzzi tub, great shower, and they look beautiful! We were on the 2nd floor on top of the rooms that had swim-up access. Those rooms also looked amazing; how nice to just go onto the balcony and step into the pool 1st thing in the morning or just before going to sleep! Our room was 7111, and was located in the center of the complex. It was a much easier walk to the main buffet and the nightly entertainment, and, it was halfway to the beach. That was PERFECT! In summary, once we had our new room, we fell in love with the resort. Don\u2019t get stuck with a lousy room \u2013 ask for a better one! Demand it if you have to! If you can pay for a swim-up room, it is well worth it. If you can\u2019t get a beach towel go to the front desk! The resort is really pretty, the staff were really nice (if you tip the maid $1 you will get swans or similar left on your bed) and if you tip in the buffet ($1), well they will treat like kings & queens! Is the resort perfect? Nope.

Why other hotels in their situation either requested only the amount owed by Conquest or waived the payment completely??? Why other hotels offered free transfers to the airport when we were left to make our own arrangements?

The most important things to me are: Beach, Room Cleanliness and food - both quality and properly cooked, stored, etc. Beach was not a Cuban beach - but I know I won't get that quality of beach anywhere but Cuba & more exoctic (and expensive islands ie Turks & Cacois) - I had envisioned a beach full of boulders/rocks, totally unswimable - and was surprised to find a huge expanse of sandy, wavy beach. Going into it in some areas had sharp rocks which were more of a surprise if you weren't wearing water shoes but it was a few steps in and then you were on sand bars! Rooms - were clean and sanitized - no issues - just put a towel down by shower/toilet door and it will catch the water run-off...no biggy!! Doesn't mean it isn't a 5 star because of this little quirk! Food - buffet was perfectly good, tasty, hot/warm, and of a 5 star quality - there were many times that huge prawns were served, chicken wings, ribs, filet of sole, steak, etc. etc. - enough variety to satisfy all. They also had about 10 cakes, including cheesecake, mousse cakes, tortes...what I consider higher-end desserts - especially the cheesecake!!!! The a-la-cartes were ok - we ate at Miso and Mamma Mia - both were fine but we prefer selection of buffet, especially with kids that are picky eaters. We did not experience cold food - they were under heat lamps or on heat stove tops - so not sure how this was happening to others, unless they were taking a long time to select their items and getting back to their table... And the table wine was fine - was average - not horrible as some have stated...but they must be accustomed to $400 bottles of wine rather than the $30 bottles of wine I normally buy...so they would say it tasted horrible?!?!? Another concern I had was theft from reading other reviews. We used common sense, kept our valuables in safe and no problems - left suitcases open in room and nothing was taken - we had lots of new clothes with tags still on them and nothing went missing. The cleaning ladies were very friendly and I would imagine theft if probably not part of their culture so I couldn't even see one of them stealing something!!! We were asked approx. 5 times per day if we wanted a drink down at the beach - which is pretty good considering how many people were down there - I couldn't expect more service than that! The wait time at bar was minimal - no complaints again. We tipped but noticed that irrespective the service was the same, especially at the buffet. I didn't have the heart to leave the table without tipping but you'd be surprised how many people did. They all work hard there - it was very obvious..and they didn't hover around waiting for a tip - they just kept cleaning, setting tables, etc....but yet they were still very friendly and said Ola when making eye contact with anyone. Overall we had a good time, resort was 5 star - the service was the only thing that was lacking a little on few occasions (stress little and few occasions), was during rush times at buffet - but we were on vacation so no worries - I went up and got my own wine if I was desperate - not a big deal!!! The beach wasn't a true Cuban beach...so I gave it an overall 4 star rating because of this - but given how much we are paying in comparison to St. Lucia, I couldn't expect perfection - so the minor service issues were tolerable. For those who have listed a whole whack of complaints - I would not worry too much - they are expecting to be waited on hand and foot but at 1/4 of the price of what that level of service really costs... it would be like expecting a bmw quality vehicle but only willing to pay the price of a ford - it just doesn't work that way.

I figured that far in advance should secure our rooms together. When we arrived, 3 out of 4 rooms were together but we were told that they had overbooked and there was no 4th swim up room available. My wife and I were then upgraded to Platinum room on the sunset side of the resort for one night. Nice room but not what we asked for and we were located at the opposite end of the resort away from our friends. A swim up room became available the next day next to our friends and we were moved. Minor inconvienence as that was the only negative to our trip. If you are going to this resort, I highly recommend getting a swim up room. I have been to several all inclusive resorts and this feature is by far the best. The platinum and laguna suites are nice but they are just rooms. Swim up rooms give you your own personal pool right at your balcony. No more lugging your towel, bag, sunblock, etc. to a pool chair you had to reserve at 6 am. Everything you need (including your own bathroom) is right next to you. Other than this, everything else was the same as most other resorts including food, drinks, service.

Felt bad about this, as used more towels than we would have, and I know how precious our water is. Occasional sewer smell here and there, but have also experienced this at a Sandals and RIU resorts. The housekeeping was immaculate, tho I did feel the pools could have been cleaner, but to give them credit, they were out there every day scrubbing, and there is a LOT of pool area to cover.

There is no doubt plenty of attention was paid to the details when building this resort. I only wish the service and food were handled with similar care. My fiance and I like to eat healthy, i.e. avoid fried foods, eat organic when available, and stick with fresh ingredients. While dinner at the a la carte restaurants sufficed our needs somewhat (the Italian in particular), we didn\u2019t find the quality of the food matched the grandiose nature of the resort, it's architecture, well kept grounds, and nice beach. The breakfast food at the buffet wasn't very good. The eggs were either runny and/or just poor quality. The potatoes were deep fried and previously frozen. The bagels had little taste. The lunch food at the buffet was very similar. I looked forward to the authentic stuff but it was mostly fried tacos, fried taquitos, fried empanadas, and very tasteless quesadillas. The hamburgers reminded me of what I was served at my grade school cafeteria. The hot dogs were very poor quality (served on the beach as well). As for the authentic dishes, most of which contained pork, chicken or beef, we found most of them to be bland. For a Caribbean resort the seafood dishes were almost non-existent, and most were battered and fried. I could go on about the food. We tried just about everything (except for the fried food). There were some good dishes, mainly the sweets and salsa's, but 90% of the food didn't fall in line with the rest of the resort. Lastly, the service was good, not very good or great. I paid $10 for 30 minutes of internet in the pseudo business center and only received about 7 minutes until the computer froze. Since they outsourced the service it took almost 2 days and 5 contacts for the issue to be resolved. It wasn't worth the effort and could have been handled better. The bartenders were slow and not very well mannered. We did find the waiters to be good, except for one guy who apologized for being slow because he was sick:) I realize this resort may work for some but it wasn't for us, mainly because of the food.

The booking system for the restaurants is poor. If you aren't a platinum/villa guest, it was impossible for us to book into the Miso/cook before you gig. Our toilet clogged a few days in.

We arrived at mid-day on a Friday and had no delay at all checking in. Rooms were ready, clean, and welcoming. We stayed in a Junior Suite (Not Platinum) and we were pleased to see the very high quality of the rooms. Lots of marble, garden facing (nice and quiet) with a comfy king-sized bed and a huge patio, a jetted tub, and a shower that did not leak. Very contemporary furnishings as well. Nice robes and flip-flops were neatly folded on the bed. The beach is not nearly as tough as some will have you believe. I am somewhat of a beach snob myself and although there were some coral fragments and outcroppings in the water, there was also plenty of smooth sand and I never needed my water shoes. The water is a little murky from the waves, but it also shallow for quite a distance and there are some interesting fish around. If you walk about 10 minutes to the left the beach opens up nicely in front of the Grand Velas resort and is a nice place for a quiet walk. The food was better than I expected with decent variety in the buffets and no, it was not always cold. Also tried the Mama Mia, La Fleur, and Las Olas for a la carte. Again, not excellent, but not bad at all. The staff throughout the resort bust their butts to do a good job. I never once poassed anyone who worked there who did not look me in the eye and offer a sincere and cheerful 'Hola!' We were tipping at every opportunity and this never went unappreciated. I never saw any garbage on the actual premises except for some cigarette butts on the beach, but you can blame ignorant smokers for that eyesore and environmental hazard.

Nevertheless, being a little adventurous, and going out in faith, we decided to book our vacation and see this resort for ourselves. We travelled in early February 2009. Having returned now, we would recommend this resort in a heartbeat. And yes, we are planning to return. The transfer at the airport was smooth. We noticed the in-airport sales people were much less aggressive than the previous years we had been in Mexico. We boarded the bus and began our journey to the Grand Riviera Princess. The driver informed us we would be the first drop-off, about a 40 minute drive from the airport. That was music to our ears. When we pulled up to the resort gates, we were a little apprehensive, thinking \"What did we get ourselves into?\" The area immediately inside the gates looked either abandoned or under construction (reflecting our \"4\" in location rating). However, a few minutes later we pulled up to the breathtaking gates of the Grand Riviera Princess and Grand Sunset Princess resorts. These two resorts are essentially the same one resort sharing restaurants, beach, and facilities throughout. We unloaded and went to check in, a little early. Some of the reviews we had read commented much of poor service at this resort. While we experienced a pleasant staff during our stay and mostly courteous service. There was a hang up for our first few days which made it difficult to sink into the serene surroundings so sought-after for the wearied traveller. Let me point out that this has nothing to do with Grand Riviera Princess necessarily as it does with SUNQUEST. As I said, our check in was early but we inquired to see if our room was ready. They said it wasn't but asked for our documentation so they could give us a bracelet and we could at least enjoy a nice lunch on our arrival. We presented all the printouts we had received through our online booking with SUNQUEST (through itravel2000). At this point they asked us for a hotel voucher to confirm our booking with them. None of the documents we were provided through SUNQUEST were sufficient to confirm that we had booked our stay at this resort for the staff at the front desk. We went to the concierge who put us in touch with a SUNQUEST representative who continued to \"chew-out\" the lady at the front desk - to no avail. The check in clerk informed the SUNQUEST rep that they needed a hotel voucher to confirm our booking with Grand Riviera Princess. The check in clerk continued to ask us for a credit card imprint until the SUNQUEST rep faxed over a copy of the hotel voucher in order for us to be checked in and receive the bracelet for meals, etc. We provided this imprint which they said they would return the next day when they received the hotel voucher. Needless to say SUNQUEST failed to fax the voucher the first day. Failed again the second day. Failed again on Tuesday. Each day we spoke with the front desk to see if it arrived and each day they said, \"Try again tomorrow!\" Finally on Tuesday, we returned to the front desk and asked if they had the hotel voucher to which they said no. I informed them they were still holding on to the credit card imprint and was concerned that they still hadn't received anything from SUNQUEST to confirm our stay there. They returned the imprint and said they would get the required documents from SUNQUEST. In my opinion, this situation took an inexcusably long time to resolve with the blame landing squarely on SUNQUEST for failure to provide all necessary documents to check in. With this unpleasant encounter behind us, my wife and I continued to enjoy the hotel and all its amenities to the full. The room was gorgeous with modern fixtures and digital safe. The king bed was comfortable and the air conditioning was great! The pictures of the room say it all! The grounds of the resort were immaculate. The pools were very refreshing. Some were louder than others (Sunset side being the \"party\" pool) but very relaxing nonetheless for snow weary Canadians like ourselves. The food at the buffet restuarants was absolutely delicious with an endless amount of choice. We tried the a-la-cartes on a number of nights but found the choice and quality, not to mention the from-order-to-table delivery far superior at the buffets. Staying at the Grand Riviera we could eat at the Sunset restaurants as well. Both sides appeared to have similar quality and choice of foods. We had read about the beach conditions in many reviews so we took appropriate precautions for the rocky waters. The beach itself had beautiful sand with a lot of beach front considering other locations in the Riviera Maya have had significant deterioration/erosion. The water was refreshing but it did have many rocky patches which required the use of water shoes to avoid pain and injury. We were stunned with the beauty of the beach front and found the huts on the beach provided welcome relief from the sun at times. And to boot, a waitress would come around to take your drink orders. Other staff tried to recruit you for miscellaneous games and activities which was great if you're looking for that. There were a number of shows and activities each night in the main plaza shared between the Sunset and Grand Riviera. We found some were more entertaining than others and availed ourselves of those times. Being people of faith ourselves, we wondered how many like-minded others would take advantage of a time to express our faith and worship even while on vacation in a tropical paradise. If that's you, please feel free to express your interest and perhaps voice your interest in response to this post. Overall, we found the grounds breathtaking.

Having said that, I would not hesitate to recommend this resort to anyone looking for a 5 star at a bargain rate. The 2 main buffets are expansive and offer a variety of food for everyone. Although some of the food is repetitive, there are always a few new choices at every meal. We did not try any of the a la carte restaurants, as we preferred the flexibility that the buffets offered. The desserts (especially the cheesecake) are TO DIE FOR!!! The resort is very large and there is a fair amount of walking required to get from one side to the other. We stayed in a junior suite in building 7. I would recommend this location for anyone looking for a room closer to the quieter area of the resort. We could walk right out of our building to the pool, where there were always plenty of lounges available. The main bar is removed from this pool a little, so the atmosphere is much more relaxed. For those looking to cut loose, the \"party pool\" would be better suited. If you stay here though, expect to wait for a minute or two at the bar before you are served, and be advised that you may have to ask the waiters in the buffets for another drink or more coffee.

To make a long story short, my wife and I had no trouble having a great time here; and I'd say most people that go would only have a bad time if they were trying to have a bad time. However, with our specific group - as a wedding and a large party, I can't help but be pretty dissapointed overall, mainly with the service. I don't think I'd recommend this as a wedding destination. Reading earlier reviews, theres not much extra I can contribute, other than to echo some points. I'm pretty sure no one in my group has posted yet, so take this as another source reinforcing the same points. The bride and groom brought 30 people (~$50000) worth of business, and were promised an upgrade well in advance. Upon arrival, no upgrade, although rooms in platinum were available at full price. The service at check-in was quite poor, as even though the wedding couple were visibly quite dissapointed, the staff at the counter, who were not busy at the time (9pm), were unsympathetic. The situation was amended the next day, as someone (with significantly better customer service skills) saw to it they were upgraded, but from what I've heard, also indicated he wouldn't complain about being \"taken care of\" for the service. Overall a poor start. I've read complaints in previous reviews about wedding couples feeling they were being \"nickle and dimed\" with hidden charges. Ours felt just the same. I've heard that other resorts are more up-front about their charges, so this too was pretty disspointing. We also felt at a number of times, that the largeness of our group was somewhat of an inconvienience to them. One might think they'd be happy with more business, and the revenue that large groups bring to a hotel, and therefore go to the trouble of making it work for us, or even going above and beyond for us. Sure it takes some effort to move tables together, but shouldn't it be their goal to please the customers? Other complaints are fairly minor. Service on the whole was average, but then it was spring break, and the place was packed, so personally I didn't mind. I was unhappy that no bars are open very late anywhere near to the beaches. The disco/sports bar/ dinner bars are a long way from the beach. I found this annoying, and it isn't the case at a lot of other resorts, and never at smaller resorts. I like a drink on the beach at night. Sue me! Housekeeping was great, food was 4-starish, rooms were nice, drinks and bartenders were good. Some smells at various locations of the resort.... nothing too bad. Sports bar and disco were dissapointing, but again, no big deal - wasn't really the reason to go to Mexico. Finally, the beach, as reported, is not really for wading.", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely perfect!

It was between a couple different resorts in the Riviera Maya, and boy am I glad we chose this one! It is basically the Sunset and Riviera resorts both in one however with separate check-ins/reception desks and buffets (even though you could eat at whichever one you prefered). The service was exceptional, from the front desk to the entertainers to the chefs! The rooms were very modern and well decorated, sort of open concept look. Bathroom was large size with double sinks. The Room was imaculately clean from the second we walked in. No problems at all with the room. Free roomservice was included with our travel company which made making it to breakfast alot easier (for my brother at least). We had payed extra to get the swim-up balcony, very useful. Food was great, the buffets had the usual you'd find at any all-inclusive resort. However the resort had quite a few a la carte resturants (book them its worth it), Mexican and Italian were the best ones. Sports bar is 24hrs, with hamburger, hotdogs etc. The beach is very rocky so if your looking for a total beach vacation this is not for you, unless you bring water shoes. Rarely went to the beach but the resort is surrounded with connecting pools (which I believe are salt water). The entire resort was ALWAYS clean beyond belief! No cups or cigarette butts lying around. Nightlife at the club on resort was okay. If your looking to bust a move to some spanish music, your in the wrong place. If your looking for a good drunken night of typical north american music, you've struck gold! DJ does not take requests unfortunately. The entertainment staff organizes an outing for Senor Frogs (I believe it was $30 CDN) and Coco Bongo (I believe $50 CDN). Both outings are good, but Coco Bongo is a definite must-see! Plenty of shopping in Playa Del Carmen as well as shuttle services throughout the day. I regret not going on any excursions as they offer amazing ones. TAKE ADVANTAGE!!!

This is my 10th all inclusive vacation \u2013 all at 5 stars, and our third time in Playa del Carmen. I would strongly not recommend this resort for three reasons: Service, Beach and Groups are not welcomed. The service at this hotel is extremely poor. I don\u2019t hold the staff responsible, as there is simply not enough of them to deal with the number of guests. We had service issues in the restaurants, with the concierge, and the maid service. Unlike most resorts, where there is a significant management presence, greeting you and ensuring things are running smoothly throughout the resort, we did not see any managers the entire week. For more details please read below. The beach is the most crowded I have been too, and I am not talking about the number of people. There are three rows of palapas which are very close together, coupled with the lounge chairs that are inches apart. It is very difficult to walk between the chairs to get through the rows to get to the beach. There is approx. 2-3 more rows of lounge chairs closer to the beach area. The beach area needs to be cleaned and quite frankly guests need to pick up after themselves. There are cigarette butts everywhere, and lots of empty water bottles and empty plastic cups. You certainly don\u2019t feel like you are staying at a 5 star ocean front resort\u2026 There is a good 40-50 feet of rocks (not pebbles) in the water before you reach a sandy area. The water is quite murky and you can only see the beautiful turquoise in the horizon. Once you pass all the rocks, you still need to be very careful as you encounter large rocks in the sandy area too. As well, the ocean floor is quite soft, almost muddy in certain areas. Water shoes are a must for everyone. The children cannot run in and out of the water and play in the waves. Even with water shoes, everyone is tip toeing there way in to avoid the rocks. So if you are beach people I would not recommend this hotel at all. Groups not welcomed I say groups are not welcome because they could not accommodate us at check-in. As well when we arrived at the buffet and we told them we were 19, they almost cringed. Even on the 2nd night when we were literally the first ones there and had to wait for the doors to open, we were told they could not join the tables, the best they could do was give us two tables side by side. This is not a huge deal, but we always travel with several families, ranging from groups of 14 to 29 and were made to feel welcomed. In Cuba the first night we arrived at the buffet and told them we were 16 they quickly put a table of 16 together. They then asked us if we would be coming around the same time every night, which we were, and so they told us they would reserve the table for the week. Super nice. At the GRP they sat us together on the last night, and put us directly on the buffet floor facing the salad bar in front of the washroom, convenient yes, but you feel like your on display! LOL!!! At the miso they sat us at two tables again in front of the washroom. At the Italian they sat us at the back in front of the partition used by the waiters to access the kitchen. So ya kind get the feeling that they don\u2019t really like having big groups!!! Additional information: Check-In: Although the entire group booked on the Riviera side, and we emailed in advance hoping to be reasonably co-located due to the size of the resort, they were unable to accommodate us. Two families were in building 6 (closer to the beach), 2 in building 8 (close to the lobby) and two of us were told that the Riviera side was overbooked, so they put us on the Sunset side in building 8 (closer to the beach). We were one of the families moved to the Sunset side, and having seen rooms on both sides, there is absolutely no difference. We received a free upgrade for a swim-up room since they could not accommodate us on the Riviera side. I thought we were off to a good start, despite a bit disappointed that our group was so spread out. Note: by mid afternoon the sunset swim up rooms are quite shaded so if you want a room in the sun in the afternoon you need to book your swim up on the riviera side. Grounds and Room The resort is very beautiful, and yes very large, approx. 8 minutes to walk from the lobby to the beach on the centre path, which divides the Sunset and Riviera sides of the resort. The walk along the centre path is quite pleasant, the grounds are spectacular and they have beautiful statues all along the path. Trolleys are available behind the riviera and sunset side, but hardly worth walking over and waiting. We only used the trolley once for the pleasure of our 7 year old. The deluxe jr suites are quite spacious with a large terrace. Modern, flat screen tv and large washroom with a Jacuzzi tub. Our shower did leak as was mentioned in other reviews. We rolled up a large bath towel as the floor is slippery when wet. Our friends in building 6 did not have this problem, so seems to be a hit and miss. Pools There are several types of pools throughout the property \u2013 sports pool, party pool, pools with swim-up bars, and quieter pools, so something for everyone. Lots of chairs and some palapas, but as per most resorts these are gone by 7 a.m. Maid Service Maid service is extremely unreliable. Not their fault, simply not enough staff. We left our room everyday by 9 a.m. and did not return until 4 p.m. So plenty of time to clean. The first day we returned at 4:30 p.m. and our room had not yet been cleaned. We tracked down one of the cleaning women and was able to get us clean towels for our showers. We told her that it was getting late so not to bother coming to clean. The next day at 4:30 p.m. room was not cleaned, she was cleaning next door, so we asked for clean towels again and asked if she could come at 5:30 p.m. since we had to get ready for a 6 p.m. dinner reservation. I also mentioned that we are out of our room from 9 to 4 so if she could clean during that time that would be great. I handed her $6 US and to be clear not a language issue as I understand Spanish and can speak it reasonably well. The next day room was cleaned early \u2013 great! The following day 5:30 pm. not cleaned again and this went on until we checked out. So out of 7 days only twice they came during the day, the rest of the time they came while we were at dinner! As for cleanliness, we keep our room very tidy so not a lot to do, but the level of cleaning is minimal. An empty plastic water bottle which did not fit into the small garbage can stayed on the dresser for days. I finally put it on the floor near the garbage can and it was picked up. One morning my son spilt a bit of milk on his sheets, I decided to remove the sheets so they could be changed. When I removed the sheets, the mattress cover had multiple stains \u2013 no need to describe the kind - anyhow I gave the hotel the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was a clean mattress cover but simply permanently stained. After touching the spots it was clear that the mattress cover had simply not been changed after the last guests checked-out. Needless to say I removed it as well. Restaurant Service \u2013 Incredibly bad\u2026 Buffet Restaurant closest to the beach on Riviera side - The food at the breakfast and lunch buffet is good. Lots of choices of prepared food and if that doesn\u2019t tickle your fancy, there is the egg/omelette station in the a.m. and pasta bar at lunch. It is not the best resort buffet food I have had, but it is ok. The big issue again is the lack service. Doesn\u2019t matter what time you go or how empty it might be, you have difficulty finding a table that is set for 4. There is no designated hostess for a restaurant that serves a good 250 people. So the waitress covering the section closest to the door is trying to play hostess and direct you to an appropriate table while also trying to wait on tables in her section. If you just go and find your own table, they are not too pleased. If the tables are set they are only partially set \u2013 missing coffee cups, spoons, napkins you name it, something is missing. One morning at 9:30 we could not find a table set for 4, so we grabbed one table. The four of us sat down and the bus boy came and set it for 2. He then walked away and started setting up empty tables. I mentioned to him that we were 4 and he looks at me and says \u201csi ok\u201d. Finishes the empty table before coming back to ours\u2026. basic common sense lacking. Again if a manager was around to provide guidance I doubt these things would happen. The most incredible situation I saw at the lunch buffet was when a young man approached the bus boy station to ask for a spoon. For some odd reason there is a spoon shortage at this resort, at a table for 4, there is usually not more than 2 spoons. Anyhow the bus boy signalled him to sit down and he would bring him a spoon. Not a word of lie, he reached into the clear plastic bin where they discard the dirty utensils, grabs a dirty spoon, then reaches for the chemical spray they use to clean the tables, sprays the dirty spoon and then grabs a rag to wipe it clean. I jumped up and told him not to bring him that spoon. He asked me where I was sitting and then told me to \u201cgo sit down\u201d. The crazy thing was that when I told the bus boy not to serve that spoon, he reached into the drawer and grabbed a clean one!!! I was really disturbed by what I saw, so I decided to try and find a manager, but was told there wasn\u2019t one \u201choy (today)\u201d. The hostess/waitress directed me to one of the more senior waiters who proceeded to tell me I was wrong all utensils are washed in the kitchen. When I reiterated that I saw him do it, I was told \u201cok senora\u201d. Total brush off. Note: As for the sewer smell that was mentioned in other reviews, very accurate. This is why the buffet nearest to the beach on the riviera side is always busier than the one on the sunset side. Note: There is no outside grill or beach restaurant. So this is a big of drag since you need to dry off, put shorts on etc\u2026 and then walk over the bridge from the beach to get to an enclosed a/c restaurant. Be nice if you could just grab a bite at the beach. We ate at the buffet lobby restaurant most nights. Again service is very slow. No one is expecting a white glove service when you are at the buffet, but basic service such a refilling your glass and removing dirty dishes is the minimum. On our 2nd night we were at a table for 10, no waiter or bus boy was coming by, so we started stacking our dirty dishes in the middle of our round table. By the time we were finally able to track someone there was a good 15 dirty plates stacked up. In all my years of going to resorts I have never experienced such a lack a service. Again no manager in site. On the other nights we were there, it was marginally better, but not much\u2026 \u00c0 la cartes We tried the Italian (Mamma Mia) an the Japanese (El Miso). The Italian: lasagna was very good as was the veal in balsamic reduction, the gnocchi and cannelloni were not very good. Despite the warning by the waiter not to touch the plates as they were hot, both my husband and our friend\u2019s cannelloni were cold and yet the lasagna was piping hot. Service however was much better. El Miso: Because we were a large group they did not allow us to order from the menu. They provided us with suishi \u2013 3 pieces each \u2013 quite good, wonton soup \u2013 very good, and the choice of chicken padtai or a beef stir fry \u2013 both pretty good. Service was better than buffet but not as good as the Italian. Concierge There was a mix up with the two dinner reservations I made from Canada. They had booked them for the wrong week, which ended up being my mistake because I had provided the wrong dates. He did not know that at the time and neither did I. When we arrived at the restaurant they of course had no reservation. We went to see the concierge and explained that the tickets we were for the wrong week. He proceeded to tell me that it was a different concierge that had issued the wrong dates, so it was not his fault. I explained that I knew that, but how could he fix it. He said there was nothing he could do. I told him I realized that with a group of 19 he obviously could not do anything for that evening, but could he had at least fix the reservation for the Thursday night and possibly compensate us by giving us a reservation for another evening. He was very reluctant but finally agreed. This took over 30 minutes to sort out and print new tickets. When he printed them off, he grabbed the highlighter and starts highlighting the dates and tells my mother and I \u201cnow pay attention!\u201d . I could not believe it, my mother and I actually broke-out laughing! I\u2019m sure people are reading this, and thinking we must have been rude, but we were not. Anyone who has travelled knows that in these Caribbean countries you need to be very pleasant and friendly in hopes of getting good service. Clearly this didn\u2019t work here!!! Signage The hotel could also improve their signage. The bathrooms are not well marked and neither is the building to get your beach towels. I also did not see any signage for where to catch the trolley. Mini Disco/Teen Disco We did not leave our young ones at the kids\u2019s club, but we did go with them to the mini disco which takes place at 8 p.m. every night. It is pretty short, from about 8 to 8:45 p.m., but the kids love it. Our teenage boys were disappointed that there was no teen disco as advertised. They went to see the concierge who was equally unhelpful with them. He told them it starts at 9 p.m. they went 3-4 times and it was never opened. Shows We saw a couple of them, there were entertaining, not always appropriate for young kids. Conclusion We still managed to have a good week, and the weather was great. If you don\u2019t care abut the beach and they would improve the service the resort could have potential.

Overall impressions: beautiful resort, but MASSIVE. this is not the place for anyone with mobility problems. we loved the selection of pools, bars and restaurants and thought our room was very nice, especially the massive jacuzzi tub that we made good use of. Food: buffets - average all-inclusive fare. nothing too exciting, some items that were very good, others were not well executed (overcooked meat etc). we did like that there was a fair amount of mexican food in the buffets... sometimes at all-inclusives you can't even tell what country you're in. one random comment - the butter tasted really weird to me here. i hated the taste of it. a la cartes - we ate at 3. the italian (mama mia), the sushi restaurant and the mexican restaurant (this was the wedding reception meal). they were all okay... but nothing extraordinary. the italian was the best of the 3. one strange little quirk about the japanese restaurant... apparently there's 3 menus inside, and when you make your reso, you select either sushi, tepanyaki or a la carte. we didn't really understand, and were caught a bit off guard to only be able to order off the sushi menu. not a huge deal, but we felt really bad for the server because most other tables that were told this were yelling at him. room service - ordered one morning, it came quickly and was tasty... both of us ordered the mexican style eggs (two eggs on tortillas with salsa, beans etc on the side) but one of the orders had one egg that was undercooked (the white was still clear around the yolk) so we avoided that egg. coffee was served with hot milk, which we loved. overall - no sickness from eating the food. but we were bored as hell by the buffet by the end of the trip. Bars/Nightlife: there's so many bars here, your glass will never be empty. huge huge plus for our group. we spent days at the pool bars and nights in the lobby bar... moving to the sports bar (open 24 hours) or disco when it got late. we really enjoyed the lobby bar, it was a great \"hub\" in the evening. we met loads of new people and made tons of vacation friends. the disco, as i'm sure you can imagine was pretty lame... but there was always at least a few people in it... so if dancing is your thing, you'd have fun. Rooms: new looking and spacious. we loved our jacuzzi tub. no complaints on the room... it was what we expected from the pictures. we had room 6106. which meant we were close to the beach and the pools we liked most... but were about a 15 minute walk from the lobby. so good location during the day, not so good at night. but we're young and mobile so it wasn't a big deal for us. there's also a little \"tram\" that runs along the back of the resort that you can hitch a ride on. we often walked the back path to get to and from the lobby, and if we got picked up on the way - great... if not, no biggie. Pools: the best. so many to choose from... salt water or fresh water. pool bars everywhere... great water temp - felt a bit cold at first, but was just perfect under the hot sun. Beach: average for that area of the world... water was nice, shore line a bit rocky/seaweedy. lots of chairs available. i've seen nicer beaches in the caribbean. Wedding: this is where the resort lost points for me. the wedding itself was in a beautiful location in the gazebo on the beach... flowers were stunning and decor perfect... but this hotel was a nightmare for the bride and groom to deal with. they were totally nickle & dime'd to death for everything. they paid extra for the wedding package (i get that, it's reasonable and to be expected) and then had to pay extra for two guests that came to the wedding from off the resort ($77 USD per person for 6 hours) and had to pay extra to have a \"reception dinner\" in an a la carte. that's the charge that steamed me. we're already staying at the resort ALL INCLUSIVE. why do we have to pay extra to eat for one meal. the only difference between us all eating on our own like we would have every other night and the reception dinner was the fact that our tables were together. no special food... in fact, they restricted the regular menu for us for the reception. it was a total scam IMO. the other bone of contention was that the bride & groom were promised an upgrade for their stay. obviously, they paid thousands of dollars extra for the wedding package and dinner... and they brought over $50,000 in business to the resort. not only did they not receive their upgrade, but they were given the run around and kept being told to \"come back to the front desk in an hour\", \"come back tomorrow\" etc. finally after 4 days of this, they gave up. and to rub salt in their wounds, half of the wedding party was upgraded for free without asking... and we met two ladies that had been given the honeymoon suite as an upgrade, but changed rooms back to the regular because the honeymoon suite only had one bed. the front desk staff blamed the wedding coordinator, the wedding coordinator blamed the hotel staff... it was a bit of a nightmare for the bride & groom. very disappointing for someone to have to deal with on their big day. Staff: the aforementioned wedding stuff were the only staff problems we encountered. besides that we generally found the staff to be reasonably prompt, polite and available when you needed them. it was a stark contrast for us from previous trips to jamaica where nothing would get done without tips... here it seemed like tipping didn't make a difference to the level of service at all. maybe that's just the difference between mexico and jamaica? Other: we hooked up with a private driver on one day that was totally amazing. his name is Carlos and we found him through Eventure Tours. he made our entire trip so much better. he drove us to local spots, for roadside eats, up to Tulum and into Akumel. i can not recommend him enough... and as soon as i find where i put his business card, i'll post his number in the forum.

We typically are self-sufficient travelers and this was our first all-inclusive experience. I'm not sure if we got a better than average deal, but the upgrade to the Laguna Villa was worth it, if for nothing else than the private pool. It was MUCH more relaxed and quiet than the rest of the pools on the property and the beach. The room itself was comfortable and spacious, with a nice balcony overlooking a man-made lagoon. The only draw-back is that the villas are the farthest rooms from the beach (though they are also much more quiet, and the closest to the main building with restaurants, the gym, the spa, etc.). I can't say enough positive things about the pool area and the staff; it was all wonderful. The service (reception, room service, housekeeping, concierge, bartenders, restaurants) was decent, though not exemplary. The gym was marginal at best, which was a disappointment for us (we go to the gym daily for weightlifting and cardio). The room service food was not very good; if I had paid separately for it I would have been more unhappy (room service was included in our upgrade). Similarly, the buffets were not as good as I expected, though I was able to put together a healthy meal with some effort. The a la carte restaurants seemed to have better food, but still not what I would consider to be among the better restaurants I have visited. Also, the resort has only coffee from an on-demand machine during the day and only at outdoor stations in the evenings; I would prefer a cafe or coffee shop on premises with expanded, higher quality offerings. The resort is located some distance from other amenities (such as shopping, cultural activities), so if you want to be able to walk to outside restaurants and such, chose a different resort. If you are happy to stay within the resort most of the time, the GRP was nice with the upgrade. Our only unresolved complaint is that a spa package was included in our upgraded room price, but no appointments were available during our entire stay. We checked every day for cancellations, but to no avail, so we paid for services never rendered. When we asked about compensation, the staff told us repeatedly that our only recourse was to work through our booking agent. This issue is still outstanding...we'll see if anything gets resolved.

We booked our trip with James Travel Points out of Boulder, Colorado. Christie was a great help in deciding which resort to visit. This hotel is absolutely breath taking! It is less than 2 years old, and looked liked they were expanding. If it rains, you can actually walk the open corridors on each side of the hotel and get to the beach DRY. Definitely for couples, families or groups. No spring breakers! Some tips if you go: 1. Get up early and reserve your chairs around th pool with your towel (everyone does it). I mean early (like 6am) then go back to bed or the 7am breakfast... they fill up fast. 2. Each morning you are required to stand in line in order to make a reservation at the Ala Carte restaurants for the following evening. Get there at 8:30am ... it's a very slow process. If you don't like to wait, the buffets are just as good, if not better. P.S. If you try to pull a move and slip in with no reservation... good luck! It like breaking into Fort Knox (we tried!) 3. If you ever feel confused by getting different information from the employees, don't worry... it's not you. It's the language/culture barrier. \"Yes\" means, \"I have no idea what you just said.\" 4. Don't worry when you see on the room service menue that hamburgers cost $110.00 (it's pesos). 5. PLEASE book a massage at the Spa. OMG! Call ahead of time to book the morning hours because they fill up fast. 6. If you like excursions into town or to see the caves, book through your travel agent. 7. Don't forget your sunscreen beacuse it's $18.00 USD in the gift shop. 8. After all is said and done, we highly recommend going here!!!

We went with another couple and all of us had a great time. The resort is beautifully kept with manicured gardens and attractive walkways and places to sit and relax throughout. There are several pool areas and there were ALWAYS plenty of available lounge chairs both around the pools and at the beach. The beach is lovely but rocky and difficult to walk very far into the water so most of our swimming took place in the pool that ran along our Swim-Up Suite. The rooms are very nice; spacious with lots of marble everywhere. Our mini bar was kept well stocked daily and the housekeeping was excellent. We found the bed to be quite comfortable and our shower did not leak into the washroom as others have mentioned. The staff are friendly and professional. I would suggest figuring out how much you want to spend in tipping before you get there if it is your first time. We seemed to be tipping everyone for everything the first couple of days because we weren't sure what was appropriate. We all thought the food was very good. The buffet offers a wide variety of fresh fruit and salad veggies as well as lots of hot food to choose from. There is always a chef available to make you an omelet or eggs of your choice at breakfast or pasta at dinner. I ate the chips and guacamole every day - it was delicious! The Japanese restaurant is terrific. We ordered room service a few times which was very good although once an order for lunch never arrived (not a big deal - the buffet was still open). We did not expect to be treated like royalty nor did we expect everything to be perfect. Based on the reviews we read about this resort we were a little nervous but experienced nothing but fun, sun and relaxation in a beautiful setting.

We read some of the reviews before we booked and must say we were a little concerned about what we would fine! Having traveled many times in the Caribbean and Europe we felt that going with a new hotel (which we had also done before) was a good idea and a 5* we should be OK. The hotel was very clean, the staff were really help full, at no point did we experience any of the horror stories we had read on line. We were late getting to the hotel but the staff were very accommodating and showed us to the restaurant to eat. We booked in and found our room without any trouble and the luggage arrived within 5 mins. Wow what a room, clean, very modern and we had only booked a Junior Suite not an up-grade, I am some what picky about hotel rooms and this could not be faulted. The rest of the holiday just got better and better\u2026..does the hotel have a few teething troubles yes, as all new hotels do\u2026the pluming being one of them, but again not enough to trouble us or cause any concerns. The bar staff were fantastic and if you give them the common cutesy they deserve they will treat you like Kings and Queens. We met many Canadian on the resort some we will keep in touch with but enjoyed chatting with all of them. The food was the ONLY thing that was a little disappointing but again only because it was not very hot. I love to eat fruit and cheese, salads etc so I have very happy with the selection. We eat at the Sea Food Restaurant twice and had great food\u2026the salmon was awesome, the Mexican which was OK and the Italian which was the best out on the once we eat at. We also did not encounter any bugs what so ever and mosquitoes normally love me. So would I recommend this place YES. Things to know: 1)Take water shoes if you want to swim in the Ocean 2)Pool water is a little on the cool side 3)Resort is quite large so if walking is not your thing, this may not be a good choice for you. 4)Take a large \u201cBubba\u201d (can get them at Canadian Tire, its a large travel mug) for your beer if you are a beer drinker they serve been in small glasses 5)Must try the Moohettos they are great (it\u2019s a drink) 6)Must go to Playa Del Carmen on an evening it\u2019s great for shopping 7)Take your own music for on the beach 8)We also took nuts and snacks for on the beach as they do not have any BBQ\u2019s etc so no food served at the beach. 9)Great burgers in the Sports Bar, 24hrs a day!

We travelled from Winnipeg, Canada and met our friends whom travelled from California.We are in our late 30's and this is our 4th all-inclusive resort that we have vacationed at. We did our research prior to booking, and were looking for a great hotel at a reasonable price. The previous year we stayed in Cncun, and really enjoyed ourselves, however it was spring break and the resort was filled with teenagers. Therefore we decide to return, but to The Mayan area. Beach : Beautiful sand, and views, but the rocks are a deterent in the ocean. The chairs are really packed tightly together. Reserve your chair by about 8 am. Food : Overall would say the food was adequate. Ate breakfast & lunch daily at the buffets, as well as one dinner. Short staffed, slow to get beverages, cutlery and often times had to bus our own tables. We ate at 5 a la carte restaurants. Fondue, Grille, Italian, Mexican and twice at the Japanese for 6 dinners. Our first time at the Japanese restaurant we ordered off the a la carte menu which we enjoyed. However, we later learned that at the time of booking your reservation you had a choice of booking from three seperate menus (a la carte, teppenyaki or sushi).This was not communicated to us. Therfore we returned a few nights later and tried the sushi menu. Rooms : We stayed in a junior deluxe suite, and our friends stayed in a platinum room. We thought the rooms were very nice, modern, large, and great bathroom with jacuuzi tub, double sinks, shower. No problems with shower leaking. We had lots of concerns about theft as we had read a number of reviews stating people had money and items taken from rooms, and safe. We fortunately had no issues. Our package included turn down service at night, and they also gave you fresh towels. Entertainment : Didn't attend any shows so can't comment. They had live music in one of the lounge areas every night until 11 Pm. After that the disco was open and the sports Bar. The disco had a realy neat decor, but the music was not our style. It was European Techno. The DJ didn't draw a large crowd to the dance floor with the music, and probably would have been more succesful if he changed it to some current top 40 or Hip Hop.We spent a few evenings in the lobby bar having drinks and headed out to Playa Del Carmen after that. Facilties : The hotel was beautiful with marble everywhere, statues lined along the walkways, well kept grounds. Lots of walking to get around but also had the option of using the shuttle. Service : The service at this resort is definetly not 5 star. The staff were not accomodating to requests. All food and beverage related staffing appeared to be understaffed. Being a person who doesn't eat red meat or fish, I encountered difficulties at the a la carte restaurants at this resort, I have been accomodated at other all inclusives with no problems. This resort needs to really focus on customer service as a main priority . Overall : Had a great time with our friends. We enjoyed our week in the hot sun where the biggest desicion you have to make for a week is what cocktail to order. We recommend taking the free shuttle into Playa Del Carmen or a taxi. Went to two night clubs for drinks and dancing and had a great time ! We also went in the day and walked around 5th avenue, and surrounding areas. I personally felt that due to the large size and poor customer service it made teh resort somewhat impersonal.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "lama001", "Title": "\u201cWorth the Sale Price....Not the List Price\u201d", "Author": "lama001", "ReviewID": "UR26582599", "Content": "My mother and I (25 and 50) just returned from a week long stay at this resort mid-March. We found it online at what we thought was a good deal, read some reviews and booked with our travel agent despite her knowing nothing about the resort. In the end I am glad that we didn't pay the price listed in brochures, as I would have been disappointed. Here's why.... Grounds: Very Beautiful. No complaints here. The staff works extremly hard to keep the place immaculate and it really shows. Huge though. By the end of the week, it gets very annoying to have to hike from near the lobby to the beach to reserve a spot back to the lobby for breakfast. I am a very active, in shape person too. Rooms: We had a juinor suite. Fairly large, new and clean. The issue was the shower. Floods. A lot. Even after very short showers, spaced atleast half an hour apart, it continued to flood the entire bathroom floor and where the toilet was. Tiried everything. Called the front desk and they did try to fix it a bit rather quickly, but it did nothing. Another couple told us they had that problem on the Riviera side, but not on the Sunset. Maid was good, tipped her VERY generously every day (keeping in mind we are very neat). Ran out of small bills on our second last day so no tip, and was going to make up for it the next day but the room was barely cleaned. Soaking wet towels from the shower floods remained and it was not nice to shower in a grimey shower. Food: Restraunts were good by Mexican standards. I like to eat very healthy and with a little creativity, no probelm. Wine is terrible in the buffets, really watered down so grab a glass from the nearest bar and bring it in with you. Drinks otherwise were good. Many frozen ones were from the slushy machines and they just add booze, so I was a little disapointed there, but with so many guests what can you expect. Went into Playa del Carmen twice for dinner -- would have eaten there every night if I could have! So many unique places to eat. Beach: Very nice. Felt a little like sardines though all packed together. No privacy at all. Go to the far right and there aren't as many people. Its a hike to get a drink or to the washroom though. Waitress came around maybe once a day. I felt bad for her....they had like two waitressess to serve all those people. Need to get there by 8am to get a decent seat, which I find obnoxious but when in Rome.... There are a few rocks you have to climb over to get into the water, its not nice but it didn't really bother me. I went for a walk to the next resort over to the right and their beach was even worse, I think its just true of the area. Service: Here is my issue...it was mediocre at best. I would honestly be half way through my breakfast most days before someone would offer me coffee. Even when it wasn't busy! Tried to help myself one day to help them out and I got yelled at! I felt ignored 90% of the time in the buffets. For example one day my mom asked the waiter very nicely for a spoon because for some reason they hide them. He rudely told her to sit down at her table, proceeded to clean off two tables walked directly back to where she had asked him, pulled out a spoon and brought it over. I just didn't get it. I want to believe that that many people cannot be rude, it had to be something with way the place is run. They need to step it up. Big time. My mom and I have been to about 10 different all-inclusives (some with better, some with less ratings) and this was by far the worst service we have ever recieved. Entertainment: Great. They did a really good job here. Bottom line, Princess needs to step it up and iron out their kinks ASAP or else I feel this place is going to get a bad reputation, not the one it deserves. I would not recommend this place at its full price, there are so many different places in the same price range that I KNOW have better service. Otherwise though, we did enjoy ourselves. And trust me I am not one of those people who complains about much....ever!!

(Also, there is a huge flight of stairs to and from the lobby to the ground level.) We were generally happy with the service, although the poor staff in the buffets were run off their feet. They are so busy clearing then setting up the tables that they had little time for topping up your coffee (if you got any to begin with). The buffet was excellent. I don't see how it could have been better. It was a surprise that coffee was only available after breakfast - not lunch or dinner. However, you get used to going outside the buffet to the mobile stands where you can have flaming coffees, etc. Also, the plaza bar is right there as well. - The showers are definitely a challenge. Just fold your bath mat and lay it across the front of the shower door and that prevents the water from leaking into the bathroom and hallway. The problem is that you go through a heck of a lot of towels. - We preferred the two buffets (for breakfast and lunch) that were closer to the beach. (These two buffets turn into al la cartes in the evening.) Nice view of the pools, whereas the other buffets don't have much ambience. Some tips: - Take along a library or similar card instead of a room key to insert next to your light switch (this way one of you don't have to go out without a room key). Otherwise, the power is turned off which means no air conditioning while you're not in your room. (Of course, if the power goes off each time you leave the room, you need to keep resetting your alarm clock...rather frustrating.) - We had no complaints whatsoever about the room, mattress, bed linens, etc. - Beach towels are available on the main walkway to the beach in a small building which only advertises fishing outings, etc., and mentions nothing about towels. - On the same walkway, there are two buildings interspersed down the walkway which do not indicate that they are bathrooms. Signage could definitely be improved! - Speaking of signage, we were looking for the Tequila Bar because it served cappacinos. Staff would point vaguely and say \"Tequila Bar,\" but again, no signage! (Very poor signage throughout complex except building/room numbers.) - There are evidently air mattresses available free at the gym (located across the plaza from the buffets next to the spa). If you see air mattresses around the pool, they could be hotel-owned because there's nothing on them to indicate one way or the other. - We had no problem with the shuttles from the hotel to Playa del Carmen. Someone had mentioned that they push timeshares on this shuttle. We didn't find this to be the case at all, and we went a few times. - The walk from the hotel to the highway is longer than most people would want to undertake, so take the shuttle or join with another coupld and take a taxi. - The ocean floor is atrocious: dips, humps and rocks, even after you've walked a fair distance. I used water shoes but they didn't help a lot; I was always losing my balance. Someone said that if you walked to the right along the beach, it was less rocky, although the beach area is messy and there's no lifeguard. (Also, even though you walk a long way, the depth is only knee deep most of the time. - Because of the above, we used the pools. They were lovely. - Oh, yes, elevators: There is evidently one around the corner from the Riviera bar which is in the lobby. I suppose the idea is to get on the elevator there, push the button for your floor number, then walk to whichever building your room is on. (There are no elevators anywhere else that we could find.) - There is an ice bucket in the room but because we walked to our building along the outside walkway, we didn't come across any ice machines. (You'd probably come across one if you used the elevator method, but you'd have to take your ice bucket with you to the elevator in the lobby.) - If you book a spa appointment, you can also use the pool, hot tuband sauna at no extra charge before your appointment. - You can book starting at 8 a.m. at either of the restaurants - you don't have go go to the one you want to make the reservation at. Also, if you're not an early riser, you can book at the Concierge's office from 1 - 3 p.m. We didn't have any problem getting what we wanted for the next day by booking with the Concierge's office (who are very helpful, by the way).", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort.

Our room was a deluxe junior suite in which you get when you book through Air Transat. The room was amazing and we had an awesoe view of the pool area. The room was always kept clean and the maid always decorated it with various animals ade fro the towels and even left chocolates on the bed. We could not have asked for better service. Buffets/A la Cartes: There was a wide variety of food at the buffets and due to the size of the resort, there were many buffets to choose from. My boyfriend didn't enjoy the food but he is a very picky eater but still managed to find something that he liked. We only booked 2 a la cartes. The Grill and the Fondue. The only issue with them was that if you are 10mins late, they cancel your reservations, one couple that was with us was late and they did not allow them to join us in the restaurant. I had the salmon and the other 3 had the chicken and we had no complaints. The Fondue was enjoyed by all and the service was fantastic. Beach/Pools: We spent most of our time on the beach as it was really hot and the wind was nice. The water is really rocky so if you enjoying swimming in the ocean I would recommend water shoes but I only went in the water to cool off so it was fine. The entertainment was around the main pool and was okay. We enjoyed the beer drinking contest and had a lot of fun on that day. All pools are salt water pools and they all inter link with each other if you would enjoy swimming around them. Entertainment: There was entertainment every evening 8:30 between the main buffets and then main entertainment in the theatre at 9:30.

We were also suppose to get a free 1/2 massage which were were told was only during certain times and on certain days - first available was the day after we were leaving.

Out of all the resorts I have ever stayed at- this was the worst.....We laugh about it now ( at one point we thought someone is punking us b/c this can't be real) They won't see us back ever again!", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cSlightly over rated but definitely trying to improve\u201d", "Author": "DND_Calgary01", "ReviewID": "UR25959892", "Content": "Resort: Overall Rating 4+ but seemingly trying to improve - maybe next year it will be 5* We stayed Feb 15-mar 1, 2009 - Platinum Suite - The resort & grounds including lobby and all the pools are absolutely gorgeous. Definitely 5-Star on the \u201coutside\u201d and very well maintained. - Riviera Platinum Suites \u2013 Building 5 is closest to the beach on the LHS & Sunset Platinum on the RHS. 10-12 minute leisurely walk through beautiful grounds to the lobby or take the resort transportation up. Runs every 10 minutes along the rear pathway and takes 4-5 minutes. - When we got there we requested an ocean view and was advised that it would cost an additional $50 USD per night. I indicated that there was no mention of this in the brochures nor was it shown on their posted rate list behind their check-in counter. Staff reply was to see the reservation manger - who was not available. However, our room was on the top floor and did have a partial ocean view and a view of the Platinum and other pool areas which was lit up and beautiful at night, plus it faced west for the sunsets, so it worked out better than staring at the ocean with not much to see. No complaints with the view. The balcony with its Jacuzzi \u2013 which we used a couple of times - was quite private. - The Platinum Suite was smaller than envisaged, not much of a closet \u2013 we had to live out of our suitcases for the most part. There was a large bathroom with double sinks, Jacuzzi tub & large shower. - Room decor was not really upscale, typical room decor. There was a 32\u2019 TV but with relatively poor picture quality and very few English programs except in the daytime. Anything we watched (Letterman) had large subtitles underneath which we could not get rid of. However, we didn\u2019t go there for the TV. - Bathroom had mild \u201cseptic\u201d type smell on occasion. But, no brown water at any time from the taps or Jacuzzi. - Our air-conditioning wouldn\u2019t go above 16-17 degrees even though I set it at 22. I called the concierge but maintenance couldn\u2019t fix. We got around this at bedtime by turning the AC off and turning the ceiling fan on to L2. No biggie. - Also the shower drain was slightly higher than other part of the floor, so some of the water had a tendency to drain towards the door. We got around this by placing a towel along the outside edge of the door and \u2018sweeping\u2019 the water back towards the drain with our feet. Quite entertaining at times. - All floors throughout the complex are marble tiled SO VERY SLIPPERY WHEN WET. We met 2-3 people who slipped and got injured while we were there. DO NOT RUN. - Riviera Building Platinum Concierge service (Moises & ?) and the Beach Concierge service (Alex & Alphonso) were great. Couldn\u2019t ask for better. Always willing to help. - No security concerns or issues Restaurants: - Food could have been better \u2013 not much selection at the a la cartes. - The best restaurants were the Asian \u2013 Miso (the A La Carte & Hibachi/Tepenyaki Grill were great), Le Fleur \u2013 International (Filet Mignon, chocolate mousse dessert) , Mexican - La Hacienda (chicken fajitas & salad) were also VG. - We also enjoyed the food at the Riviera and Negresco buffets both for breakfast and the occasional lunch. Food could have been warmer but plenty to select from. - We didn\u2019t enjoy our meals at the Italian \u2013 Mama Mia nor The Grill \u2013 La Vaqueria restaurants. The pasta at Mama Mia was pretty good but the veal was iffy. I had the pork rib at The Grille and I could hardly eat it. Diane had the chicken and said it was okay - I left hungry. The Lamb is probably the best choice. - Wine quality in all the restaurants left a lot to be desired. The sparkling (champagne) was better than the white which in turn was better than the red. Quality of wine seemed to vary from restaurant to restaurant. - Negresco (except for the Platinum dinner once a week) & La Tortuga (same building) were not open in the evening for Dinner while we were there. - We didn\u2019t try the Swiss \u2013 La Fondue nor the Seafood \u2013 Las Olas restaurants which are located on the Sunset side across from the Negresco / Tortuga complex. - Overall I would rate the food as maximum 3.5 Star, with the Asian - Miso being a 5-Star for sure. - A La carte Restaurant decor was nice but a bit bland, no real theme to the restaurant but the Riviera & Sunset Buffets were very nice. Also there seemed to be a staff shortage at times. But service was pretty good overall. - In the evening at centre court there is live music and a couple of gals making speciality coffees, like Spanish Coffee \u2013 a must try. Free and VG. - At 9:30 PM each evening there is a live 45-60 minute show in the Theatre upstairs. - Dress Code: Woman seemed to wear pretty much anything. Men \u2013 long pants (including jeans) at the \u201ca la cartes\u201d. I telephoned the resort prior to leaving to check on what was meant by their \u201cclosed toe shoe\u201d policy and was advised to bring dress Shoes. However, we saw men wearing running shoes & sandals on various occasions. Most did wear leather closed toe type sport shoes though. - Lastly, we never had a problem booking any a la carte reservations. On occasion we had to defer our 1st choice to the following night and went with our 2nd choice for the current night. I recommend booking two nights at a time via the concierge. Tipping for \u201c2\u201d of us: - Maid service = $2 USD except 1 day at end of the week = $5 USD - In Room Bar service = $1 USD per day whether we used it or not. Mostly we did not. - Beach bar waitress service = $1 USD per order - Buffet = $1 USD when / if we had a dedicated server. This may not have been fair since on our last day someone mentioned tips were pooled. - A La Carte restaurants = $5 USD - Specialty Coffee gal - $1 USD per order - Platinum Building Concierge = $10 USD per stay. (Reservations, etc) - Taxi = $1 or 2$ USD per trip to Playa Del Carmen - Bus to PDC / Tour = $1 or 2$ USD per trip - The above seemed to be adequate and appreciated. Beach: - There are plenty of chaises and Palapas on the beach for everyone. However, if you want a Palapa I\u2019d advise getting down before 8:00 AM and reserving one by placing a towel over the chair and placing some personal items, like water shoes, suntan lotion on the shelf of the Palapa or chaise. Then go for a quick breakfast or a walk along the beach. - The beach itself is quite nice and appears very safe. One can walk out at least 30-50M and the water will still only be chest high. - There is rope with floating balls on it to mark the safe swimming boundary. I recommend bringing water shoes as there are rocks / coral in spots. - Also one could bring a snorkel and mask as there are plenty of fish \u2013 like angel fish - around. We saw at least 50 on one occasion as a man was dropping breadcrumbs in the water and they were darting around him to grab the food. We saw various quantities each time we were in the water, they seemed to follow you around. Probably looking for food stirred up by our walking. - We were never bothered by vendors during the 2 weeks. Those that did meander over moved on after a simple \u201cNo Gracias\u201d. - Beach Etiquette: As a courtesy people should be advised to pick-up / return their towels & garbage plus return their chaises to their original position after use. Trips / Other: - We went took the resort shuttle (large bus) to Playa Del Carmen one day (11:00 AM) and did some shopping on 5th Avenue before catching the return bus at 6:00 PM. Bus actually leaves at 9:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 12:30PM and 1:30 PM. i.e. If one takes an early bus one can come back on any of the other times. - Bargaining for jewellery is the word of the day, try to negotiate down to 25%-30% of their asking price. If you\u2019re lucky maybe even better, depending on what you\u2019re buying. Pay in $USD or by credit card. I personally don\u2019t recommend anyone converting money to Pesos. - Restaurants in PDC were pretty good. We ate lunch (400 Pesos with tip) at the Tequila Barrel restaurant on the day we took the bus in and later on in the week we took a taxi ($13 USD - $15 USD each way with Tip) to PDC and walked 5th Ave again then had dinner at Los Tulipanes (Tulips) Restaurant & Grill \u2013 large portions. 800 pesos (tip included) got us 3 glasses of wine (total), two dinner plate size appetizers and two filet mignon dinners. Food was pretty good. Good value. - PDC comes to life at night and seemed to have some pretty good restaurants, unfortunately we didn\u2019t get to try any others. - We booked a side trip ($118 USD PP) to Xel-Ha and Tulum through Best Day travel at the hotel. We were not too impressed with Xel-Ha. We did some snorkelling but the water in the \u201clake\u201d is kind of milky \u2013 supposedly from the interaction of fresh water from the cenotes and the ocean. Not much to see. Fish seem to collect in the lagoons adjacent to the boardwalk as there are fish feeding stations there. If you plan on snorkelling, bring your own gear if possible. We may have had a better time had we tried the river inner tube ride and/ or underground river \u2018cenote\u2019 excursion feature. - There is more to for the kids to do for sure. I talked to one gentleman who was there with his wife and 3 kids and he claimed all were disappointed. But everything is subjective. I talked to others on the bus who enjoyed it. The food a Xel-Ha was all inclusive and pretty good. - Tulum \u2013 Mayan Ruins & Royal Beach - were interesting and worth visiting. 2-2.5 Hour stop over Sunquest / Air Transat: - Air transportation was friendly and comfortable - Airbus A330 - Luggage allowance inadequate for a two week jaunt = Max 1 piece of luggage per person @ 20 Kg / 44 Lbs + 1 carry-on @ 5 Kg / 11 Lbs. Same for one week. - Over the weight you pay $5/ kg. We did not encounter anyone with penalty applications. - I E-mailed AirTransat and queried whether or not we could bring a tote bag with our shoes, lotions, etc which we would check in order to make room for more clothes and they indicated sorry NO exceptions. - As a result of their luggage policy we had to wash / rinse out articles of clothing at least 4 times. - We will definitely review travelling with AirTransat in the future as a result of this, if we can help it. - If you belonged to their \u2018Club\u201d, luggage entitlement increased to one 30 Kg / 66 Lb bag & a carry-on of 15 Kg / 33 Lbs per person respectively. So much for \u2018rules\u2019. - Also a person could bring all the diving gear they wanted (packed & identified as such separately) without charge. - During our stay we talked to various individuals from Quebec and found out they paid $600-700 (excluding PST) or approximately $1000/PP less than us Calgary folks for the same Platinum service. Seems a bit unfair, considering travel time was approximately the same.", "Date": "March 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "saskatoon saskatchewan canada", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful place, beautiful people!\u201d", "Author": "tropigirl9", "ReviewID": "UR25953617", "Content": "We felt happy and comfortable in this palace-like setting. Like most resorts, the landscaping gets exceptional attention, and the marble and tile work is very visually appeasing. The ambience is surprisingly relaxed given the magnitude of this resort, and we found there were no shortage of 'privacy nooks' anywhere. Whether you were close to the centre plaza, (where we always found a vacant lagoon palapa to enjoy), or at the beach, (where you could easily find your own private spot) we never felt the resort was at full capacity even though it was. We did not have a pool access room booked, but on arrival were accomodated happily. The hotel gave us a deal on the upgrade even though we would have been happy to pay full pop. The staff was warm and friendly. EVERY SINGLE ONE of them, no matter which department they worked in, smiled and gave a verbal greeting. One thing here...try using a local phrase or two, like learning simple greetings and polite phrases and you will see how much they appreciate it. We were given everything from hugs to extra beer in the fridge and exceptional service. The kind gentleman at room service called me by name and I liked that. The restaurants are fine but I did find we had to get our own drinks on occasion. So what? Right? I guess I was feeling 'at home' there. The beach is very pretty and very long. Sadly, there is refuse on the segments of beach that haven't been developed, but you can look the other way into the beautiful blue sea! On our daily walks we were treated to a viewing of the green on the 7th (I think) hole at the Mayakoba Classic; swam with tons of fish; and even followed a turtle for awhile (it was swimming along the shore in knee-deep water) until a fellow came off the beach to pick it up and hand it to me for a photo op! We did enjoy the diversity of the beach setting at the resort. You could be in the centre of a happy beach party, enjoying social time with new friends, or pulling your chair around the mangrove for a private siesta. There was always a volleyball game or horseshoes, and non-disruptive to the other guests. The massage was perfect- a mimosa and the sound of the ocean to accompany the on-point treatment was a grand way to end an afternoon. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Princess and would recommend it to others. Off topic, there is only one thing I feel needs comment: The smell of sewer gas in the lower floor rooms. I don't think Mexicans have used P-traps. This problem can easily be rectified by folding a wet towel and placing over the shower drain.

We have both been to Mexico before but neither of us have been to the Mayan Riviera. I have also been to a few other 4 and 5 star AI's in Dominican Republic and Cuba. We arrived late at night on a Friday, check-in was quick as there was only one other couple checking in at the same time as us. We were supposed to get a basic junior suite but were upgraded to a deluxe junior suite which was in building 8. At first I was a little bummed that we were not closer to the beach as I had requested something close to the beach or even an oceanview. We ended up loving that our building was actually right next to the main lobby/lobby bar/reception/restaurants etc. The deluxe room got us a jacuzzi in the bathroom, some extra square footage in our room, and 7 a la carte dinners instead of the basic 3. Hotel Location: We liked that our hotel was closer to the airport (supposed to be a 30 min drive) although the transfer bus ended up taking over an hour to get there. This was because there was a mix up with someone else's hotel on the bus and it took some time to figure it out and get the people to the right hotel. GRP is about 20 mins away from 5th ave in Playa del Carmen, about 45 mins from Tulum and about 35 mins from Akumal beach. Next time we travel to this area we may consider something closer to Playa del Carmen and surrounding locations in order to cut back on taxi costs and travel time. Service: Yes, it is true that service is lacking a little bit in the buffet restaurants. Another host or hostess and a few more servers would do the trick. Some days we did not see anyone who would come to seat us so we did what others did and sat ourselves. Sometimes we would not be offered any drinks when we sat down. No big deal to us - we just got up and got it ourselves. I can see how this would be something others would complain about but for us it was not an issue. Servers on the beach and by the pools was fine. They came around often and were quick. If we wanted something faster, we got up to get it. Bartenders work hard and try to get to you as quick as possible. The hotel was 100 % full while we were there so its understandable that we had to wait for service every once in a while. Service at a la cartes was fine. The bellboys at the front of the hotel are helpful getting you a taxi and organizing the pickups for the people going on excursions in the morning. Food: We only ended up going to 2 a la cartes instead of the 7. At past AI's I have been to, you book all of your a la cartes when you arrive, but at GRP you can only book a day in advance. We should have emailed ahead and booked them before arriving, which is what alot of people did, because oftentimes we would be on the beach in the morning and be too lazy to walk to the lobby to stand in line to book something. I would have liked to try a few other a la cartes but that was totally our fault. We did try the Mexican and the Steakhouse. I thought the salmon at the steakhouse was very good. The buffets have a great variety of foods, breakfast was probably my favorite and I also enjoyed the pasta bar. I didn't get bored with the food at the buffet but my boyfriend did grow a little tired of it towards the last few days. I had quesadillas and guacamole for breakfast a few times - yum! Beach: Is beautiful. Not the same as the beaches in Punta Cana, where I have been most recently, but still beautiful. Lovely sand, palmtrees everywhere, blue water. Beach chairs are close together, but we sat at either ends of the beach most days were it was less crowded. We did not mind the rocks in the water and used our flipflops in the water the few times we went in. We did some snorkeling outings such as to Paa Mul, Punta Venado and went to Akumal to swim with turtles and the beaches and water in these places were fantastic, calm, and great for swimming/snorkeling. I spent alot of time in the water in these places but not as much time in the water at the hotel, which was fine with me. I think my boyfriend would have enjoyed less rocks in the water at the hotel so he could have done more swimming, but the rocks did not deter us from going in if we really wanted to. Entertainment: We spent more time on the beach and at the quiet pools but we stopped to watch the games and dancing etc. by the party pool a few times. The staff is really great and funny and made us laugh. We went to a couple shows in the theatre, I think I have seen better performances in the DR but it was still great to watch. In the courtyard of the hotel, we sat and listened to the live band that played after dinner and then also watched the Mayan Show with the dancers one night. We missed the fire show on Wed night because of a time mix up on our part. On Thursday night we went to the market in the courtyard and bought some souveniers, I am not sure of the prices in comparison to 5th ave but I am sure they are higher at the hotel. Excursions: We did a speedboat/snorkeling tour with our tour operator which was great, and also did a half day tour to Tulum where we also got some free time to wander around and sit on the beach. If I were to visit Tulum again, I think I would rather go early on in the morning without a tour and before the masses of people arrive. I felt a little rushed and would have liked to have more time to walk around and relax. We also went to Playa del Carmen for dinner one night and to walk around for a bit but did not do any shopping there. I would recommend La Parilla and get the beef tacos there - so good! We also took a taxi to Akumal and swam with sea turtles all day, definitely a trip highlight. Rooms: Comfortable, spacious, clean, pretty. Definitely the most modern decor in a hotel room in the Caribbean that Ive seen yet. Beds were comfy, there were enough towels, mini bar was stocked daily, view was great from our balcony. Shower leaked into the toilet area but nothing a placed towel on the floor couldn't fix. There was shampoo, soap, kleenex, shoe shiner, a loofa, etc. in the bathroom. Though we were close to the lobby and lobby bar, noise was not a problem at night. You would hear people and some music, but if we wanted complete quiet we just had to shut the balcony door. A/C worked well although we didn't use very often. Ceiling fan switch is right beside the bed so that was nice. No problems with the safe at all, except we could see where the front part had been previously lifted and then glued back down again. This made me a little nervous at first but it ended up being fine. Lots of closet space and drawer space. TV was great, didn't watch much but had alot more English speaking channels and movies than other hotels Ive been to. In Conclusion: As everyone has also commented, the grounds are immaculate and gorgeous, the pictures do not do it justice. The hotel is so grand, clean, and I loved the crisp tropical look of the buildings. The grounds are big, but not confusing .. easy to get around and if you don't want to walk the 10 mins from lobby to beach, you can take the tram that goes back and forth along the sides of the hotel. Try and do a photoshoot on the beach with one of the hotel's photographers. We were approached by one while sitting on the beach one day and ended up having a full 45 min photoshoot which I thought was a lot of fun, I bought a couple pictures, pricey but worth it. They also walk around with a Toucan, Parrots and an Iguana for pictures. We had a great time, no major complaints at all. I would most definitely stay at this hotel again, except that I feel that there are many resorts to try and personally, I don't think I would go back to the same hotel again because I love to try new things and see new places. We met a lot of fellow Canadians at this hotel, most of which we found to be from Ontario. I recommend this hotel for families, couples, young and old, groups of singles, etc as we saw many different people of all types here.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort - A Great Holiday\u201d", "Author": "od7", "ReviewID": "UR25816399", "Content": "My family of 4 ( kids 12 & 14 ) went to this wonderful resort the last week of Jan 09.

By far, the largest resort we stayed at. While large, not overwhelming. Fairly easy to get a handle on where things are after 2nd day. The resort is majestic, well appointed furntiure and impeccable grounds. Gorgeous pools and sufficient room to find a comfortable chair around the pool. A little more challenging to get a great place at the beach though. Beach is good for Mayan area...rocky in some parts and moderately strong waves on occasion. Beach is ok-but does not make my favorite list. And now for the bad news: Buffets are noisy. For some reason, staff feel it is acceptable for guests hear them clean up the plates and place utensils....rattle -rattle -bang -bang-bing. Bad for the atmosphere. No outside restaurants. .I go south to enjoy the weather- why can't I get a quick lunch or breakfast in an outside restaurant??? The staff: Most can't communicate-even those that take your menu order!! Insufficient staff at buffets- they are regularly rushing to address the needs of customers. Unfortunately, we too as guests feel their pressure and unfortunately the staff is not able to spend a minimum quality of time with their guests. Need to keep an eye out and spot staff to ensure you can place a timely order for drinks. Enjoy your coffee or tea during lunch or supper?---it is NOT served at the restaurants or buffets!! You need to leave and go to the outside bar or coffee station and pick one up....but you can't take it into the restaurant and enjoy it with your dessert. Why, might you ask? To minimise time that clients occupy a place at the table.... Food? Well, morning buffets just barely make the cut on variety for a 5 star establishment. No fish products, minimal cheeses, short on desserts and chefs just cannot make eggs!!!...I am not picky on my eggs, in fact I am not a great egg fan. However, their eggs are the worse i ever had...time and time again..tooo bad. Oh, let me tell you about the pasta at the buffets. The chefs do not know how to prepare the pasta eighter. How is this possible? Well, they fry your vegetables to a minimum and then they take the pasta from the warm water, and while still dripping with water, place the pasta in the fry pan and dilute the taste...and then add a liquidy sauce--not a good idea. Reservations for a la carte restaurants? You can only reserve 1 day in advance. So, every other day, you spend about 60 min in line to make sure you get your restaurant choice and time. Is it worth it? Not really. But you sure as heck are not going to do buffets every night. And the food at these a la carte? Not that great. Mamma mia is terrible....try the gnocchi, try the lasagna, just not a 5 star plate. And the staff seem to want to keep you there for 1 h AND 45 minutes. They drag the experience. First time around you do not make a deal of it but after the 3rd and 4th night, you catch on and it becomes painfully long....ofcourse, you are not getting coffee or tea with your dessert....remember? you go outside to get it and cannot take it back inside. The Japanese restaurant was good though and the Tepanyke restaurants were excellent. Exquisite sushi. Wine is served in bulk not bottle. Red is awful. White is fair. Rose is good. Bar drinks: It is NOT Bailey's!! Crushed ice mixed drinks regularly just miss the mark. My overall impression is that the resort is understaffed. Most of the existing staff is underexperienced, especially at the buffet restaurants and some of a la carte restaurants. We chose this place because we got a great price for a new 5 star resort. So in fairness, I have not regrets. However, with regular pricing and considering the competition, it would be a challenge for me to recommend this establishment as a 5 star throughout. My hope is that they will address their staffing issues and food. Overall, my family had a safe and great 5 star experience in a magnificent , grand resort.

Rooms are exactly as described in brochures. Very impressed with our room. Appreciated the whirlpool tub after long flight. We had a great maid, left her $2.00 a day on the pillow. Our room was always clean and our maid replaced towels twice a day. (most likely because we tipped) Yes, the service staff will accept tips. Remember the wage they make is not the greatest. There is always a breeze in the eve, bring a light sweater or jacket. Remember if you want to go on the free shuttle to Play d Carmen - must book day before, get tickets in lobby.Came home feeling very relaxed and tanned. Would definately go back. (ps. this was not our 1st time to Mexico -have been at diff resorts multiple times in the last 10 yrs.) I would rate this Resort as a five star.

The Room We spent 7 nights at the Grand Riviera Princess the week of February 20 to the 27th and overall we had an excellent trip. We arrived around 10PM in the evening on a Friday and we were a group of six adults aged 25 to 40. We had all booked the Deluxe Swim-Up Suites but when we arrived, the two other couples got theirs but they had overbooked the swim-ups so they gave us a Platinum beachfront upgrade. Not a bad deal at all since we could hang out at our friends\u2019 swim-up during the day and enjoy our oceanview balcony Jacuzzi by night. The view of the ocean was truly something else. I\u2019ve read on here that there is no such thing as an ocean view room and that is simply not true. Our view was outstanding. We stayed in room 5111: If you can get it, do it. We brought a Febreze noticeable plug-in for the room and we really have no complaints of a musty smell in our room at all \u2013 even without the plug-in (Although our friend\u2019s did over in one of the swim-ups). By the way, a lot of people complain about left and scratched up safes\u2026. None of us experienced any type of theft whatsoever. We figure they sometimes have to break into the safes if people forget their combination. We were absolutely fine. (But a little paranoid due to a few frantic reviews). The Walk Like most reviewers have said, the grounds are breathtaking. You really don\u2019t realize just how beautiful they are until you get there. Our rooms were all the way practically on the beach and honestly, the walk to the front lobby for dinner each night is not that bad. I\u2019d say it\u2019s about a 5-to 8-minute walk. If you\u2019re an active person, it\u2019s nothing! And I did the walk in heels almost every night. If you wear heels on a regular, the marble is just fine. I would just say be careful of WET marble\u2026probably only in your room since the hotel\u2019s workers care for the floors throughout the resort meticulously. The Food on the Resort\u2026 and the City For the most part, the food was pretty good. The breakfast and lunch buffet does get a little repetitive but you just have to choose different foods each day. They do vary it a little though (i.e.: different pastas one day, different desserts another). As for the A La Cartes: The Miso Restaurant and the French Restaurant are definitely the best (Order the lamb at the French restaurant). The Fondu restaurant was really great too- and lots of fun- just a little on the rich side \u2013 lots of cheese and chocolate. The Mexican restaurant is horrible. All six of us agreed, so don\u2019t waste a dinner there. We went to Playa Del Carmen a couple nights for dinner (must-try: Madre Tierre. The lobster was delicious) and then try to have drinks at a little outdoor lounge called OM across from Blue Parrott. I highly recommend taking the short trip to Playa. SO many great places to eat & drink. The biggest, best margaritas in town are at Parilla\u2019s (pronounced: pa-ree-yas). We were the happiest drunks after just two each! Beach/Pool The beach is beautiful but trying to get in the water is a huge pain in the @ss. I\u2019m not exaggerating. If there was one reason I would not return to this resort it would be because of the state of the rocks when you\u2019re entering the ocean. It\u2019s very rocky and at times painful. If you don\u2019t swim in the ocean, you\u2019re just fine. You can try to swim over them too, that helps. But it\u2019s not a whole lot of fun trying to find a clear path to a sandbar. My boyfriend totally agreed and he\u2019s a big tough guy \u263a. The pools go on throughout the entire resort and there are a bunch of different places you can hang out. Never boring! There\u2019s a quiet pool, a party pool and then also peaceful pool-canales you can hang out next too. We tried \u2019em all! The waitresses walking around serving drinks are SO nice and friendly and I recommend you tip them well because the bartenders (for the most part) are not friendly. We found some that are on the beach, but others that aren\u2019t. Regardless if you tip or not. The animation team was extremely friendly when walking around the grounds and we went to watch the \u201cA Night on Broadway\u201d show on Wednesday night in the Theatre and it wasn\u2019t as bad as many reviewers have said. It was probably the best I\u2019ve seen out of all the resorts I\u2019ve been too. The \u2018Cats\u2019 number was precious. If you have children, your children can actually participate. That brings me to my point about families; this resort was full of young families and there are shallow wading pools and sunless little huts to take shelter under for your little ones. The animation team took great effort in making sure kids were entertained and having a great time by the pools during the day. I would definitely bring my kids to this resort one day (wink, wink hunny). We couldn\u2019t believe how many there were. But all in all, even though there were a lot of families there was a really good mix of people. Many our age, lots of families, some older. Overall a really mixed bag and a really wonderful time! Helpful tips: -Order your mojitos with Dark Bacardi or Havana club. So good! -Avoid the vodka, it tastes like rubbing alcohol. Stick with what Mexico is known for: Tequila, Mojitos & Beer. \u263a -Tip the waitresses on the beach and by the pool and she\u2019ll come by more often. (Also, they work their butts off!) -Count 11 huts to the left from the lifeguard on the beach and you\u2019ll find a relatively clear entry point into the ocean. -Wear a sweater in the discoth\u00e8que. It\u2019s freezing! -Bring an ipod dock for the beach that you can recharge at night in your hotel room. -Bring water shoes for the ocean. -Ask your cab driver for house music, they have some really good CDs!", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "leicester, UK", "Title": "\u201cAlot better Than Expected\u201d", "Author": "gazdkw", "ReviewID": "UR25395223", "Content": "My partner and I visited the grand princess riviera resort between 9-23 of feb. Like most people going to this resort we were very concerned after reading alot of negative feedback on here. The only thing i can say is that its total nonsense. FIRST THOUGHTS AND CHECKING IN Upon arrival to the resort we was greeted by a very friendly bell boy who took our luggage and said he would meet us at our rooms once we had checked in. Checking in was not long at all, roughly 20 mins and we was well informed on the resort and other important information. Once we arrived at our room we was met by the bell boy who had our luggage. He was very polite and friendly and he reported the missing bulb from our lamp and the missing beers from our fridge, this was sorted within 15 mins. RESORT ITSELF The resort is simply beautiful and very well maintained. This resort is very big and does take about 15 mins to walk from one end to the other (Main lobby to beach) however we are both under 30 and find walking no problem. There is a free shuttle that goes from one end to the other that you can get on and off at any point. Our room was clean/tidy and very comfortable. The showers do leak under the door towards the sink but we just put a towel down before we had a shower, common sense. In our welcome meeting with our thomson rep someone asked about the safe and why everyone on tripadvisor was saying they was being broken into etc etc. Our rep basically replied they are absolutely fine and every just keeps pulling the plastic back to see if its possible. We never used the safe as we had suitcases that locked so we kept our valuables locked in there. The pools are very nice however they are not heated. This wasn't a problem for us as it was full sun all day so the pools were not too cold. SERVICE First things first PLEASE!!! learn some basic spanish it really does help and they really appreciate it, but if you don't most of the staff have good english. The overall service was very good. Some of the bars can get quite busy (pool bars especially) so just bear in mind you might have to wait 10 mins or so to get served. We wasn't big drinkers during the day so we didn't go to them very often. There is quite a decent variety of drinks available, If you want the decent named spirits like absolute vodka, havanna club, decent tequila then you need to specify that when you order or else they will give you cheaper brand names. In the evening the lobby bar and main plaza all serve drinks up until 11 i think then the sports bar and nightclub are the place to carry on drinking. ENTERTAINMENT During the day there is entertainment going on around the complex. However our only complaint would be that during 12-3 the entertainment is very much based on drinking in the pools and games on the beach and if you want to stay out of the sun likes us fair skinned brits and don't want to drink it can be a little boring. In the evening there is a live band from 7.30 till 8.30 a show outside by the main plaza at 8.30 then a show in the theatre at 9.30, all quite entertaining. FOOD We went to all the buffets, breakfast/lunch/dinner and we was very impressed. My partner is a chef and even she was impressed with the quality and choice of food. Bit of advice here, get your hot food last then it will stay hot, dont get your hot food then spent 10 mins choosing the salad from the salad bar cause your food will be cold. We also went to 6 of the restaurants. They where all very good. Miso and international are excellent. The 24 hrs sports bar serves food/drinks 24 hrs. on one drunken occasion we had burgers and yes they where a little pink but we was both fine. BEACH The beach is very nice and we didn't find the sea too rocky although i would suggest water shoes just to be safe. The beach can get busy and there is a bar there so you can get a few silly people who don't know there limits. Although the beach is lovely there are some better beaches down the yucatan. GENERAL ADVICE If you go looking for problems and things to moan about then you will find them, enjoy your holiday. Pesos is the preferred currency but dollars are excepted. We found pesos worked out alot better for us so we used them. change your travelers cheques at the banks in playa del carmen not at the resort you get a much better rate. Be friendly with the staff. We was lucky to make some lovely friends with certain members of staff that made our holiday very special. Book the restaurants early as they book up quick. We was unsure about tipping because its not mandatory in the uk however try and be generous. We personally tipped the maid 20/40 pesos to the maid a day, 50 pesos for table service at the bars, 50/100 pesos at the a la carte restaurants etc etc. The free daily shuttle to playa del carmen is fine to use (even if your rep says they are not) but book early the day before. we have lots of other information that iv probably forgotten about so any questions then just email me gaz_dk_w@hotmail.com", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey, Channel Islands", "Title": "\u201cTake most of the bad reviews with a pinch of salt\u201d", "Author": "stuartg77", "ReviewID": "UR25369528", "Content": "My wife (aged 30) and I (aged 31) stayed at the Grand Riviera Princess for two weeks between 31 January 2009 and 14 February 2009. We booked and stayed in one of the Laguna Villa Suites which we'd highly recommend paying the extra for, particularly for couples travelling alone or groups of couples who want a bit of piece and quiet (with no children) around the pool side during the daytime. Like most others that have left comments on this website, we had read a sample of the \"horror stories\" and once or twice had even talked about changing hotels. However, we decided to stick with our original choice as we have stayed in several of the Princess Hotels in Europe (mainly those in the Canary Islands) and couldn't see that their hotels in Mexico could be as bad as some previous guests had made out. It didn't take us long after arriving at the hotel to realise that we had made the right choice. Throughout our stay we got chatting to many other couples, of all ages, mostly from Canada, who had also been a little concerned about the bad publicity left by previous guests on Trip Advisor. No one that we spoke with had experienced anything too awful that would put them off ever staying at this resort again. As far as the rooms are concerned, the Laguna Villa had loads of space and even had a walk-in wardrobe with plenty of hanging space and shelf space. It also had a safe which was free of charge and was very easy to use. The King Sized bed was huge and the room was cleaned to a good standard everyday. The mini bar was also re-stocked daily, although premium drinks are not provided in the rooms, and are only available from the pool bar. As far as the restaurants are concerned, there is so much choice, even for the fussiest of eaters. We particularly enjoyed the Italian (Mamma Mia) and Japanese (Miso). As for the service being slow, yes it was, but you are on holiday (vacation) so who wants to be rushed through their meal. Please do remember that when you are in the a la carte restaurants that men are required to wear full length trousers (pants), 3/4 length trousers obviously don't qualify. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. As for the size of the hotel, it is vast. It will take no more than 15 minutes to walk from the lobby to the beach and that is at a leisurely stroll which is a good way to walk off all the extra food. There are two restaurants located near the beach to accomodate those using the beach at lunchtimes. With regards to security, if you park your car somewhere and leave it unlocked with the keys in the ignition, would you seriously expect it to still be there when you come back? Therefore, I would have thought it made sense not to leave cash or valuables lying around in the hotel room. Common sense would be to use the safe. All in all, this is an amazing hotel. There may be a few small issues that may annoy you but nothing major enough to ruin your holiday. We loved it and would definitely go back, even though we do have to spend 11 hours on a cramped plane.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bowmanville Ontario", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort...but!!!!\u201d", "Author": "afraid-of-winter", "ReviewID": "UR25369483", "Content": "My wife and I booked this destination \"last minute\". We arrived at the resort very late on the 6th of February so we were unable to really see the true beauty of the property. Our room, a junior suite was outstanding; room size was more than adequate , it was well furnished and clean. There was sewer smell and dampness to the room but it cleared out once we turned on the fan and AC. Again, the resort property was absolutely beautiful, but VERY BIG. Our building was the 7 Block which is approximately the middle. It was a 10 minute walk from our room to the main building or the beach. This was the major complaint from many of the people we met. The restaurants are not \"open aired\", they are all enclosed and air conditioned, something I did not like. The food was okay at the main buffet and was starting to get very repetitive by Day 3, but the service was lacking; very under-staffed! We ate at the Italian and the Mexican restaurants; food was awesome but again the service was very slow at the Mexican. We also found the service to be very slow at the many outdoor bars; seemed to be a staffing issue. There was wait staff by the pools to take your orders, but very slow. Housekeeper for our room was great; cleaned very well and left us some very decorative \"towel art\". Bar fridge was very inconsistant; did not always replish daily amounts. Resort has a gift shop with many items to purchase, but much cheaper on 5th Street in Playa del Carmen, which is a very short and cheap taxi ride from the resort if the shuttle is full.

Yes there are better hotels in Mexico but for the money we paid i think the value was good, yes i would recommend this hotel to friends. When you arrive you make your way down the road to the hotel, it really makes you wonder!! However after you make the short trip it opens up to an amazing front entrance and lobby. The people are very nice and accomodating. The beach is ok, as all of the beaches on the Riviera Maya have taken a hit from the recent hurricanes. I definetly suggest upgrading to the Platinum pkg. It gives you a private pool area very nice rooms, an amazing 25 minute massage on the beach and other amentities that you will enjoy. The grounds are beautiful and clean. Pools are cystal clear and the swim up bars well staffed. The entertainment is ok in the central court area they have a two piece band that play the same songs every nite. They have a bongo drum show and a couple of other display shows. There is a flea market type area on Thursday nites in the main court area. AS my rating shows i only rated the food about a 3, There was a stench in the fondue restaurant that is also the buffet dining area for breakfast and lunch in the Platinum area, it hits you the minute you walk in and it takes about 5-10 minutes to get used to it. The buffets are ok breakfast and lunch are basically the same thing everyday for a week. Cold Chicken nuggets, french toast, usually a chicken dish, pasta and burgers hot dogs etc. The salad bar and fruit selection were usually pretty good but i would still rate it just ok. Oh! one thing i should mention, if you enjoy a glass of wine with lunch or dinner don't drink the house wine in the carafe they offer you \"it is disgusting\" and we heard it from many of the guests. We would get our wine in one of the bars that serve it from a wine bottle ( the dining rooms get it from a beer type tap) we would then take it into the dining room with us. We cancelled our trip to Chichinecha (spelling?) as we heard it was a 3.5 hour bus trip one way.

I have been to 3 other all-inclusives, 2 in Dominican Republic, and now 2 in Mexico. First impressions: The resort grounds are beautiful, immaculately kept, and very clean (for the most part). Check-in was quick and easy. We had a jr. suite room. It was very nice, no extra charge for the room safe. Problem with the room: no dresser! We had to live out of a bag for the week, except for our clothes that hang. The mini bar was decent, but only 2 beers/day in there, and the beer wasn't that great. They did leave 3 1-L bottles of water (sometimes 4), which was nice. Food: Well, I wasn't too impressed. It wasn't bad, but nothing outstanding, either. I have to say I was seriously disappointed with the service at the buffet. While this resort boasts 2 buffet restaurants, only 1 was open for lunch, meaning you had to wait to be seated. There were meal times where we were not served water at all, nor coffee for breakfast, and had to bus our own plates to make space on the table. When we did get service, it was pleasant, and the staff was friendly, but they are just FAR too understaffed. There was a nice stirfry pasta bar, but sometimes the pasta cook would not serve you, because he/she was busy preparing other stuff for the buffet. The buffet on Saturday night was by far the best - best tasting, best service, and best variety. A la Cartes: My group did the Italian. It was only so-so. The service in the a la carte was great, but one of my friends was served burned canelloni (it was charred) - there's no excuse for that! My cannelloni was just fine, though. Extras: I thought it was a nice idea that they left out coffee/tea/pastries for those who had early departures or excursions, but there was never anywhere near enough. Service: They simply do not have enough service staff working at any given time. There would be 2 bartenders and 1 waitress for an area with 50 or so tables (seating 4-6 each). As such, you are waiting for about 1/2 hour for drinks. I am not accustomed to waiting so long for service. Also, at one of the swim-up bars, one of the bartenders had the audacity to complain that his tip was wet. And tipping does NOT get you better service. Cleanliness: The grounds are immaculate, and the maid service in the rooms is excellent as well. The public washrooms in the lobby, well, the cleanliness there was sketchy, and in the women's washroom, there were three stalls without toilet paper for about 2 or 3 hours. (There's a checklist on the door indicating the room should be checked every hour). Atmosphere: It's a nice resort, but not a whole lot of personality. I do have to say, the 2-man band is phenomenal. They play a lot of recognizable songs, and play them expertly. If they played in my hometown, I'd go and watch them again for sure. Where the band was, it was always packed with people, and for good reason. Excursions: The staff on hand for day trips/excursions were friendly and helpful. It was a great trip, but due to the lack of 5-star service, I would not recommend this trip to family or friends, and I will not be back.

Our room (in the Platinum Section) was excellent...clean, large, nice balcony with a jacuzzi and a well stocked mini bar. We went to all 7 A La Carte restaurants and though they are not spectacular, the food was good and the service excellent. We really enjoyed the Miso (Asian), the Fondue and the Vacaria (Grill). There are 4 buffet restaurants at lunch time and 2 at dinner time. Some people have said that the food was repetitive but hey these are buffets what do you expect? There was a great selection to choose from so you never had to eat the same thing. I often ate excellent fish grilled right in front of you.

We have travelled in the past to various warm destination but this was our first time here. This hotel is absolutely beautiful. We were in a Delux Junior Suite with a pool view about exactly half way between the beach and the lobby. It was only a 5 minute walk either way. We found the rooms to be clean, yes there were yellow stains in the tub and the shower did leak, but so what...you're on vacation. We did not have any problems with our safe even though the instruction label was peeled back. For the price we paid ($1198 CDN plus tax each) we didn't really expect much but found that there was a lot of little extras included by booking through Air Transat. We had robes and slippers in our room, beach towels and 4 complimentary bottles of alcohol in the room upon arrival. 24 Room service was also included but took a long time, order breakfast the night before. We bought a bottle of Baileys on the plane and had Baileys and coffee every morning on the balcony. The restaurants were very good, some better than others. I highly recommend reserving at Miso, we liked this restaurant the best. Try to plan so that you can book in the back grill corner of Miso a day in advance. You can never get a reservation the same day back there. We didn't plan very well as we left so early in the morning on our excursions. If I had to complain about anything at this hotel, it would be the beach, not so much because it was rocky in the water, but because we found it to be extremely windy the whole time we were there. As such, the included non-motorized watersports were not available for use until our last 2 days of stay. Which were all reserved when we tried to book. I am told that the Mayan is usually windy as this was our first time there. The wind blew a lot of sand all over you as you were laying there so this was the first time we ever actually laid by the pool and quite enjoyed it. One nice thing was that you never had to reserve a pool or beach chair, there are plenty to go around. As for excursions, we went a did a full day at Xel-Ha. I highly recommend this if you like to snorkel. The water is calm so that your snorkel tube does not get water in it from the waves. There are lots of fish to see here. We also did Coba which was amazing. If your into some adventure, this is a good tour. Also, be sure to go into Playa del Carmen. We exchanged some money at the bank there (11.50 was the CDN exchange rate - the hotel was 9.00). Be sure to go in the afternoon and stay after dark as 5th becomes a whole new place. We ate dinner there at the Blue Lobster and had a really good meal (expensive though $70 CDN). Senior Frogs is pretty reasonable. Overall we had a great vacation and didn't want to leave. We were only there a week but easily could have stayed for 2 as this hotel has so many choices for restaurants. We did tip the maid everyday and our waiters at the ala carts but not at the buffets, nor the bars as we were always on the move. Please, if you are travelling to this hotel and have already read most of the reviews as I did, just go with an open mind and you will have a great time.

The resort is very large, but easy to navigate. There are enough buffets and restaurants to provide variety, and the food is very good and nicely presented. Our only complaint was they seemed to have trouble with shellfish: mussels were often overdone and unsalted, and lagoustines looked nice but they were mush inside (thawed and re-frozen?). The beach area was small, and the loungers were tightly packed, like you would see on the French Riviera. This bothered us because all the other resorts we have visited in the Caribbean have plenty of space on the beach. The pools were large and had plenty of loungers at all times of day. The grounds are very nicely laid out with plantings, and the buildings are all attractive. The use of marble and alabaster in decoration is first-rate. The staff are excellent, courteous, and eager to please. We liked them all. There was a small band playing each evening outdoors, which was a nice touch, in addition to the usual cabaret shows. An arts and crafts sale is held one evening a week.

We are not fussy people, and love all kinds of food. We were also booked in the Platinum room. . So all the good points of the resort, Very clean well kept grounds, food was O.K. but not outstanding, we enjoyed the buffet more than anything, Staff were friendly always greeting you. Pools were nice and well kept, and the swim up bar was a nice treat one day for us. The free half hour massage was good that was part of the Platinum package Now all the things that were a huge disappointment... getting your room cleaned, between 4 and 5 pm at night, that was always a problem as that is when you are coming back to your room for the eve to get ready for your diner and relax. , one day they never cleaned the room at all. Talking to other guests they did not like this practice as well. We did tip her every day and left 2 gifts, now being in the Platinum room I would have thought they had a better level of service. The private diner on the beach they advertise is all the platinum guests together at a buffet. between 7pm and 9... Same as the buffet every night with a bit of added sea food. The private pool for the Platinum guests was small but nice, but be aware, It took us 5 days to get a spot there, everyone gets up and throws towels and books on the loungers early in the morning, and sometimes never come back for 4 hours stay for a couple of hours and leave again, I found this disturbing and unfair for all the guests, and many people were complaining of this. They do have snacks and butler service there, and all the towels you need, which was nice, Felix the day butler was very good. The beach is nice but only 1 bar there, so getting a drink there is slim... esp on the very busy days. The entertainment was not that good... Ive been to other resorts where they had much better shows and entertainment I think they need a little work there for sure . The biggest disappointment was the check in service very little information about your stay with them I only knew the extras with the platinum as I read them while searching the resort, they do not inform you of any of this. Take lots of tip money, extra 1 us dollars you get better service if you tip.

Air Transat: We booked our vacation with Air Transat. I will definitely be booking our next vacation with them. Transat made our vacation very easy. They fed us meals and drinks on the airplane. Getting our transportation to and from the airport was very easy. When we arrived at the resort Transat will have a meeting to explain everything to you. (make sure you go) They also have a office on the resort where you can go if you have any problems or questions about anything, which is very helpful. We had a Junior dlx suite and were provide with slippers, robes, we were given 4 bottles of alcohol in our room, free room service, free internet in transat office, 4 a la carte dinning reservations and Transat provided a private Mexican dinner/entertainment on Thursday night. Resort: We were blown away by the beauty of this resort. The pools were lovely and the beach has nice white sand. I read review about the rocks in the water and took some water shoes with us just in case. I was so glad. There are several big sharp rocks in the water. Make sure you take water shoes! You\u2019re going to need them! The room and resort was very clean. When you go to your room don\u2019t forget to put your key into the slot near the door. Otherwise the air conditioner and lights wont work. Our shower leaked into the toilet a little but there were always lots of clean towels in our room. The service was great, people were always quick, and friendly. we didn\u2019t tip much. After reading some of the other review I was expecting to see lots of mosquitoes but the whole week we didn\u2019t see any bugs day or night. The evening shows were great. And on Thursdays nights they have a big market come into the main plaza that\u2019s fun to shop. If you get a chance to go playa, the shopping is better. Food: Our favourite restaurant was the Fondue. You must go and it\u2019s so much fun! We also went to Miso loved there food . Some people have to pay, we didn\u2019t but if you have to I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the extra money. Mexican restaurant was also very good. Go to as many a la carte dinners as you can. Remember if you don\u2019t like them there is always the buffet. We loved the Buffet, they did change the buffet up a little everyday. We didn\u2019t like the desserts, not our taste. Tours: Tours are very expensive. We went to Tulum. We went to playa and got a big bus (like a greyhound )found on 5th ave. for $5 round trip. When we were in Tulum we took a taxi to Grand Cenote. That\u2019s a must see! Amazing! (Google it) It\u2019s only 4km from Tulum. payed $6 for taxi to the Cenote and $10 to get in. I\u2019ve never been to mexico and it\u2019s easy to get around always lots of taxis everywhere If you get a chance go to Playa Del Carmen. The resort offers a free bus. Otherwise it\u2019s $14 each way by taxi. Shop around most stores carry the same items. I got a dress they were asking $60 and I got it for $8. If you don\u2019t like the price walk away. .

These are the perks: beautiful landscaping and wonderful use of statutaries throughout the resort; great selection of ala-carte restaurants; fantastic staff at the Platinum Suites; wonderful rooms with high-end finishes. Here are the downsides: the overall finished look of the place was shotty, meaning there were details in the tiling, the walls, the flooring, wherever you looked, where it appeared the workers were in a rush to completion, and no one bothered much with quality control. The service is good, but I would not give it five stars. The staff worked to address your needs and desires, but they didn't go much out of their way to accomodate or go beyond your expectation-- which is what you expect when you pay top dollar to stay at a fairly new resort, particularly when you upgrade to the Platinum or other levels. Two other grips we came to have: the staff was often on their cell phones, texting away to whomever; and they did not smile much. If you've ever gone to other parts of Mexico, where the tourism is much more established, the staff has learned to SMILE at you. This makes a big difference! Finally, the beach was crap, meaning: it was very crowded, the chairs were extremely uncomfortable, and one could not go out into the ocean without water shoes--a fact of which we were not aware. Thus, if one wished to lounge in the sun, it was best done by the pools, which are not heated. As such, we did very little with the ocean/water, which was a top reason for going. Compared to Puerta Vallarta, I would not recommend spending the premium to go to Cancun and staying at this resort. While we found it - at times - to be enchanting and, let's face it, you're on vacation, so you are a lot more \"open\" and \"relaxed\" than in your natural environment, but at the end of the day, we kind of felt ripped off for what we paid for. Lastly, we had a very nasty run-in with the bell boys, who made us wait over 45 minutes for the \"shuttle\" to our rooms. When they finally arrived, they reminded _us_ that we are only 2 out of 2,500 guests at the resort, and we could not expect to be treated like the only guests. This message was delivered in such a way that we felt threatened and provoked into a fight. We reported this incident (on our second to last night) to upper management, which resulted in an apologetic phone-call from the ueber-manager, two bottles of champagne sent to the room, but none of that really made us whole.

We didn't. Perhaps there is another Grand Riviera Princess somewhere in a parallel universe. Our previous experience was limited to a stay for a week two years ago at the Gran Principe Bahia further south, and for two weeks about 30 years ago at the Club Med in Cancun. First of all the resort is huge. We tipped the check-in clerk US$10 to ensure we got what we'd asked for - top floor, king-size bed, and ocean view, but it seemed we would have gotten this anyway. The clerk appreciated the tip however, and advised us the walk to our room was about a kilometre away - a joke, but not far off. Our luggage was delivered, and the bell-hop explained how to set the alarm clock/radio \"Phone the front desk\" it was that complicated. The mattress was firm, not rock hard like the Gran Principe Bahia. The flooding bathroom floor after a shower had been fixed by installing a rubber dam under the shower door, but a little water seeped under the glass partition into the toilet area. The food in the buffets was great, but lacked the themes (Mexican, French, Spanish, etc.) the Gran Principe Bahia had every day. The trick to avoid boredom at the buffet is to eat something different every day, rather than taking a sample of everything every day. The wait persons could all speak English and were very friendly, not like the Gran Prinicipe Bahia, and didn't have to be hunted down in order to get a drink, but were very attentive in refilling our wine glasses. We were served bottled industrial Spanish wine, rather than the sometimes awful Mexican plonque we drank two years ago. The bars all seemed to stock premium brands, but if you wanted a drink menu it was at the lobby bar only. Be advertureous. Say, \"I'll have what (s)he's having.\" We had four a la cartes to choose from out of 6 or 7 in the resort. The French was the best with adequate portions unless you are a 3-plate buffet type. Someone commented about the raw rice in a sushi appetizer in the Oriental restaurant. You can't make sushi with raw rice. Being from the Vancouver area we have perhaps the best sushi in the world, and the sushi we were served wasn't up to par, although the rest of the courses were good. If you want a good cup of coffee, get it at one of the bars that also serve lattes. $US 1 under our pillows each day ensured a succession of ever increasingly complicated towel and bedsheet origami - ducks, swans, elephants, etc. The maid took a lot of time making up the room, and it was spotless. As mentioned in other posts, the grounds are spotless too, and constantly maintained by an army of low-paid Mayans making US$ 3 to 4 daily. If you don't think tips make a difference, tip someone who doesn't get tips, like the little clean-up girl rushing to mop up a drink spilt by some drunk guest. We took two off-compound excursions - The Green Road - a short bicycle ride between 5 cenotes, 2 in caves where you snorkel in, two in the open where you can swim, and one dry where you rappel down and explore a cave. The water in the caves was a little cool, but we were offered wet suits before we started. This was very non-commercial with a short eco-tour walk through the jungle where our fantastic tree-hugging guide Mauricio (it's ok, he admitted it) explained how the early Mayans lived, and offered us a sample of chicle to chew that used to be the base for chewing gum (remember Chicklets?) before they started making gum from petroleum products. The excursion ended with our group planting a tree in a minor reforestation project. Although advertised as a half-day tour, it was closer to a full day. Unfortunately we had to take our own photographs as there was no annoying picture person assigned to the tour. The other excursion was a catamaran trip from Cancun to Isla Mujeres that featured a disappointing snokeling swim through a reef area destroyed by Hurricane Wilma. However there was an annoying picture person on the trip taking pictures on board and in the water, available for $US 10 on the sail back to Cancun after sight seeing on Isla Mujeres. The crew provided all the entertainment for people who like to be entertained on vacation. As explained in other posts, Hurricane Wilma pretty much destroyed the beaches in the area, and perhaps they have trucked in sand for the upper beach. Sand shoes are a must as the water is only chest deep out to the marker buoys, and there are plenty of rocks and coral stones on the sand. The resort was not filled when we were there so there were plenty of empty lounge chairs around the pool and at the beach, so it was not necessary to reserve them with a towel.", "Date": "February 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cLooks Good, But Beauty Is Only Skin Deep\u201d", "Author": "bumsteadVancouver", "ReviewID": "UR24457137", "Content": "The place looks fabulous.... but...

The only thing that bothered me was that I couldn't really go into the ocean this visit, I didn't have swim shoes and I was afraid to cut my feet on the rocks or broken sea shells. But my husband went into the water, this was his first time ever in an ocean and first time out of Canada.. He was very happy with this experience, he is looking forward to many more visits here in our future together.

Waiting at the resort was my brother and wife, yippee we were ready to start our fun in the sun. Check in was fairly quick for us as we headed straight for the registration desk and were 3rd in line out of a bus full of people. Sadly the room we requested with a pool view was not available, even though after emailing ahead my request and receiving from the concierege an affirmative response, I really thought that was what we would get, we did not however, because \"Senora, I am sorry the Hotel is overbooked\" ???? hello, how does that happen? we soon figured out it is just one big bumping game. My brother who arrived before us and paid $1000.00 extra for an upgrade did not recieve his upgrade for two days and only after much much conversation and rightfully so, they did have his $$$. We never did get the room with the pool view, but we did admittedly have a nice room in Bldg 3 on the top floor with a partial ocean view and at night we could see the lights of Cozumel, that was cool. We were also on the Sunset side, which was confusing because we booked the Riviera, so when we left, our luggage was taken to the Sunset Lobby and not the Riviera Lobby where our bus was picking us up. Good thing we had time to get that straightened out. What we liked about the resort: - Food was excellent - Drinks were great - Rooms were clean, beautiful and spacious - Lots of room at the pools with plenty of bars - getting served where ever you were on the resort, even at the beach What we didn't care for: - The Beach area was very narrow, thus over crowded - Many many rocks (sharp) in the water, so you could not run into the ocean - that is a huge downer for us. - The enclosed eating areas (we prefer the open air style) We came from winter to be outdoors, not behind glass looking out. - the playa del carmen shuttle was not conveniently timed as already mentioned.

I would not pay anymore though. We had a deluxe room, which was enough space for the 3 of us. I liked the fact that we were closer to the beach. We stayed in the 6000's and I wouldn't have been happy staying closer to the main building. The girlfriends and I were thinking about going Platinum and glad we did not. It's not worth it, just get a deluxe room. Save your money. Cleanliness of the rooms is not the best. There were smushed mosiquto's all over the walls and ceiling. Don't think the room was ever swept the whole time we were there, and everyday expect to ask for face clothes. The beds are less than adequate. What can you do? It's mexico. The mosiquito issue: of course there is going to be mosiquitos, the area around the resorts is perfect for them. Plus, in the middle of each of their buildings, which house the rooms, there is a water feature, surround by vegitation, which is wide open to the outside element. You're gonna get them in the wet season, but they are not too bad. The buffets were good. There is a great variety. The restaurants, well, what does one expect for the price? The Japanese, Fondue and Italian were good. The service at the resort was okay. The bar servers were the worst, but I always got a drink, so I guess I cannot complain. Someone needs to explain that to get a tip, you actually have to do something and be pleasant. A tip is a privelege, not a right. The beach was great. If your feet are tender, get water shoes, although we didn't have a problem. A word of advice: Do not buy a tour from anyone on the beach. The price maybe better than a reputable organization, but your safety is not guaranteed. Go on your own. Take a cab, you do not need a tour operator to go anywhere. If you must take a tour, do so with a reputable agency. Even then, watch out for the guides, they will suck ya in to buying something:) Usually, a \"native\" piece of mexico. It would have been nice to know that it seems the place shuts down around 5 pm. Don't go there expecting a lot of excitement. Overall, our vacation was good for the price.

We did manage to get a room around 2pm so we avoided the 3pm lineup (I was very happy!) Service is a little slow, but we are on vacation so I was able to accept waiting for things to happen (ie drinks at restaurants etc) As far as the beach goes, it is not perfect, it seemed a lot of people were going there, but we have a swim out room so we stayed around on our patio (get the Riviera side if you are getting a swim out, the sun is here all day) Pools are not heated and very cold in the winter time. Restaurants are decent, as a previous review said ,bland decor with a variation of Chicken, Beef or Seafood at each. It was better then the buffet every night. A word of advice, email your dinner reservations in advance, we had everything looked after before we arrived and it saved lining up everyday. Another word of advice, don't book your excursions at the hotel! They charge double what you can get the same tours for in Playa Del Carmen. We went to Chechen Itza for $45 per person vs $100 per person at the hotel. We have small children (5, 6 & 10) we did not bring them with us and we are glad. This is not a child friendly resort. Not enought to do for children. We found the ages of guests to average over 45yrs. All in all, a nice place to visit, the rooms are spacious and clean, the resort is well maintained and we had a nice time. We would probably try something else before returning here.

I wasn't totally thrilled with the restaurants. Seafood restaurant was really bad and walked out due to rude server and the most horrible 'red snapper'! The Mexican restaurant was great and the server was fun and very attentive. Only problem we had was reserving the restaurants, We never could get a reservation before 9:30 at night which was very frustrating. The beach was a bit crowded and all reviews are correct in saying you need water shoes! There are lots of rocks but still this will not stop you from enjoying the water. Bar staff were a hit and miss. There was one server at one of the pool bars that was extremely rude. But then we would go to the other pool bar where Rene was and he was great!

The Italian restaurant was the best one, and that was still average. The rest is all down hill. The service was terrible. You ask the same question to different staff members and each one will give you a different answer. If you do not go with a Platinum suite, you are pretty much treated as second class.

Get ready for a lot of walking. This review is for Grand Riviera and the Sunset because it's the same resort. We booked at the Riviera and roomed at the Sunset on the 3rd floor in building #3. Building #3 and #6 are the closest to the beach unless you book the platinum which are the buildings slightly closer. Good points: The rooms are beautiful and large. The resort is clean and the grounds are immaculate. We never had to throw our towels on the lounge chairs to reserve them because there was plenty to go around. There are 4 buffet restaurants, 2 at the lobby area and 2 near the beach. We made use of the trolley which travels on both sides of the resort. This resort has quite a selection of pools to lounge around, 3 which have a pool bar. The music at the party pool was perfect and the animation staff were a lot of fun. Bad points: If your a beach lounger, you will be disappointed. The beach is small and steep when entering the water. I must advise to bring water shoes because the water is full of rocks. While walking to the other resorts on the beach, I develop blisters on my toes because the sand is granular and rough. There is a stench coming form the ocean, not sure why. Like I said before the resort is very clean. But it has really no theme to any of the totally white buildings. There are 6 a la carte restaurants which all look the same (bland). You need to get to the a la cartes for 8:30 in morning in order to book for the next day. The one a la carte (Le Fleur) service was absolutely terrible, it took us 2 and half hour to eat an appetizer and the main course. If you want variety from the buffet restaurants then this place won't cut it for you. It was exactly the same food every day.

We travelled to this resort as a group of 16 people, (8 doctors and our spouses, all in our 40s to 50s). I was the group organizer and had previously travelled to Cancun so I was looking for a location \"off the beaten path\" I chose this resort because of its size..something for everyone! Keep in mind every resort has it's positives and negatives but we all had a wonderful time. Here is my honest review... We arrived around noon and checked in but our room was not ready (check in time is 3pm) but we were given bracelets to access the amenities, go to the buffet, while they held our luggage in the lobby. The check in took about 15 minutes, no problems. We got our room (8229) which is a junior suite and it was beautiful, lovely king bed, gorgeous bathroom and a balcony overlooking the resort. OK, the air conditioning didn't get very cold (I don't like to freeze so I was fine) The mini-bar is included in the AI rate and is restocked daily. We used the safe, no problems. OK, the toilet initially didn't work but my husband quickly took the lid off the tank and adjusted a hose and fixed it quick. The shower leaked a little onto the floor, but if you use your head and don't aim the hand spritzer at the shower door it was not an issue at all. The buffets were awesome. We all tried many new foods. There was an incredible variety...always many excellent choices. Yeh, a few \"yucky\" foods (the warnings about the undercooked hamburgers are REAL!) but way more positives than negatives. The desserts were fabulous. Plenty of healthy choices, also, lots of fruits and vegetables. To make reservations at the alacarte restaurants you need to go to ANY of the alacartes between 8:30am and 1pm and ask about availability. (You don't need to go to the restaurant that you prefer...any restaurant can do the reservations for all the others!) You can also make reservations for the next day at the same time. Between 1 and 3 you go to the concierge for reservations. The preferred times fill up fast so get there early and book 2 nights at the same time! We dined at the Mexican, Italian and Swiss (Fondue). We enjoyed them all. Keep in mind the alacartes do not serve coffee so you need to go into the courtyard after dinner to get regular coffee or these amazing mixed coffee drinks with whipped cream and heated liquer. (Worth the 10 minute wait!) There were shows...Mariachi, fire juggler, acrobats in the evening, some better than others. We did not go to the disco. The drinks were great...I stuck with the typical tropical drinks and wine. We travelled in January and the pools are unheated so a little cool for me. As a general rule the pool temperature will be the average of the high and low temp for the time period. For us the high temp was 80 and the low was 68, putting the pool temp at 74. Refreshing but I didn't stay in long! Plenty of beach loungers and nice sand at the beach.There are underwater sheets of rocky coral that could be a challenge, for this reason I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESORT FOR CHILDREN. I have 2 kids (teens) left them at home and they would not have liked this beach. This would be a real danger for small children (sharp rocks!) The info at check in says to not drink the water at the hotel, so 3 liters of water are provided in the mini-bar fridge. I used the bottled water, even for teeth brushing. My husband drank the tap water, he did not get sick. My colleagues called this resort, 'The cruise ship that doesn't move\" It's real spread out and I loved walking around. There is a little tram for really lazy people but I hardly saw anyone use it. FYI...if you like to run/jog, use the tram path behind the buildings...much less traffic. Everyone found something to their liking and it was a good value. Final word...Great for couples...I would go again. Families with kids...head to Cancun and the hotel zone for the better beaches.

If you do go to this resort you must make it an effort to see him. When you do see him say CHILLY WHILLY. He'll know what that means. This hotel is a 4 star at best. Since when do 5 star resorts ever charge for a la carte restuarants. This resort charges for two of the six they have. I have stayed at many 5 stars hotels and i never paided extra at restuarants. We ate at the 4 we didn't have to pay and let me tell you it was bad food. We ended up at the buffet every time. We are not picky eaters let me tell you. Service in all restuarants is very slow. I remember waiting 15 minutes for water. When you pay the money you pay to stay at a 5 star resort you should be pampered. This resort doesn't do that. I asked a waiter for coffee three times before i had to go get it myself. Food is as good as it is in Cuba. If you have ever been to Cuba, you will know what i am talking about. 3 and half star. Like everyone else is saying, the beach water has lots of rocks. LOTS. be careful. Water is warmer then the pool though. Rooms are great. Very clean and you don't have to worry about space.

There is none........The disco was empty EVERY NIGHT.... I could count the people in there every night. average 30 to 60 people. NOT JOKING. Better off going to Playa del Carmen or Cancun.

Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly and helpful bellmen, they showed us where to check in. Check in took mere minutes, we were in our room within 10 minutes of arriving. We booked our trip through Air Transat, they held a very helpful and informative orientation the following morning, which I would highly recommend that everyone attend. The grounds of this resort are amazing and meticulously manicured, very beautiful! This is a very large resort, however having said that was not more than a 10 minute walk from the lobby to our room which was at the end near the beach. At anytime you didn't want to walk there is a shuttle that runs from one end to the other every few minutes, very convenient. Our room was very nice, and included everything we needed. The safe is locked with your chosen combination, so we felt safe about that. Yes, as many reviews state, the shower leaks a little...big deal, nothing a hand towel on the floor didn't cure. The maid service was average, forgot to leave coffee twice and despite leaving tips daily, never once got 'fancy' towels. The beach was very beautiful, never crowded and never a problem finding lounge chairs. We had heard that at some resorts you have to put out a towel early to reserve your chairs, but not here!!! Lounge chairs were plenty! The food at all the buffets (3 choices) were great. Each day we found different variety and more choices than you can imagine. We ate a'la carte twice, probably wouldn't do that again, my husband is a big eater and found the meals scant, so buffet is definately the way to go for us. We booked 3 excursions through Air Transat (they have an office in the lobby), it was easy affordable and safe. Our excursions were through Alltournative Tours, excellent guides. The brochures state that this hotel has a free shuttle into Playa del Carmen, true but not true. The shuttle is actually run through Best Day Travel, who have a booth at the hotel, the shuttle has nothing to do with the hotel. You have to book 24 hours in advance and we found they run at inconvenient times. We took the shuttle in one morning and were told when and where to meet the bus to come home....we waited over 1 hour and they never did show up, so ended up taking a cab back. Visiting Playa del Carmen, 5th Avenue was a lot of fun. Lots of shops to buy things and also some great restaurants. For those who like the pool, the pool here is huge, again with plenty of lounge chairs and swim up bar. One of the pools is a 'party pool', with lots of activities and games for everyone.

Snorkelling right off the beach of the hotel is not very good but if you walk down the beach to the right about 300 metres, there is a small reef and the snorkelly there is great! There are so many pools at the hotel that the activities are a little spread out. Take some time on the first day to familiarize yourself with the main pools of the resort. The pool by the towel exchange is the main activity pool. (It took us a few days to figure this out). As for the a la cartes, the fondue was our favourite. Our waiter Marco was full of life and made our time at this a la carte a lot of fun, not to mention the food was amazning. A helpful hint for anyone with food allergies: If you go to the conceirge and explain you food allergies, they will give you a letter to take to all of the a la cartes and the buffet and the waiters or staff will explain what is safe for you to eat and what is not. This was so helpful; too bad we didn't know this earlier. Make sure to bring slippers or slip on shoes to wear in the rooms. The floors are all marble and get very slippery when they are wet.

Most of the restaurants, bars, buffet, gift shops, computers, etc. are located in the main front buildings so if your room is close to the beach, the walk each way is about 7-10 minutes as opposed to about 3-5 for me. Weather was sunny every day (25-30C) except 1 cloudy & rainy afternoon which only lasted a few hours. Beach Beach is visually stunning! Soft white sand. Calm water. Very beautiful. HOWEVER, this may be the only complaint I have about the resort, in the water the first 20 meters is very rocky and rough, however once you pass that area is becomes soft and remains shallow about 50 meters out. Wear some type of scuba shoes or slippers or you will regret it. A friend we met there got a very sharp cut on his foot only a few feet out. He had to go to the doctor\u2019s office and they thought it could have been a rock or a Stone Fish... so save yourself the hassle and wear foot protection if you go in the water. For me it wasn\u2019t a problem because I didn\u2019t even go in the water... Lying on the beach, tanning, and having people bring me drinks is enough work for me! Also Beach chairs are not hard to find. We went to the beach after breakfast around 11 each day and never had a problem finding two together. Food, Bars & Entertainment Fortunately we ate at a restaurant every night. Go early and make reservations for as many days as they will let you! Guys, send your girlfriend/wife to do this! I tried to get a reservation at Miso (Teppanyaki) and was asked to pay a fee because this restaurant was not included in our all-inclusive package, so I declined the reservation... My girlfriend goes (possibly in a skimpy outfit) and returns only minutes later with that reservation along with reservations for the next 3 nights! All the restaurants are great! I have been lucky enough to enjoy fine dining in many restaurants in Toronto as well as various other cities around Europe and the food here is great. The Teppanyaki was our favourite (if you don\u2019t know what that is... Google it! A lot of fun & very delicious!) Buffet was good for breakfast (never went for dinner so I can\u2019t say, but not as good as the restaurants I\u2019m sure). All the bars were very much the same drinks, just different cups depending on which bar you go to. The Lobby Bar & this other bar which had a live band playing were the busiest and best. All the bars close relatively early (midnight-ish) so anytime after you have to go to the Disco bar to drink. Sorry single guys, this disco is nothing like Century Room or Ultra Supper Club, however one of the nights I was there I heard some decent house music playing. I never saw any of the shows as we had dinner around 8-9pm every night and then went to the bars after for drinks... so I can\u2019t comment. Tipping Because my girlfriend works in a nightclub and I frequent nightclubs, we were sort of on a tipping binge. Remember, if the service is good, TIP! At the restaurants we left $10-$20US depending on quality of service. At the Lobby Bar and others we would order a round then leave 20 pesos, then order another and leave no tip, then order another and leave another 20... Just be considerate... the service was usually amazing (worthy of any upscale restaurant in Toronto) and the bartenders work they a$$ off! If they worked at any restaurant or bar in Toronto they would make hundreds each night so be nice and repay good service. And guys, don\u2019t look cheap in front of your lady and others and throw a little paper around! Don\u2019t forget the maids and the bellboys... a few dollars per day and a few dollars per bag is sufficient. Nightlife & Singles Nobody ever comments on nightlife in TripAdvisor so I will. We went into Playa Del Carmen twice for the BPM Music Festival which was happening at the time of our stay. Cover was about $20US. The clubs played very good music. Drinks were pretty much the same price as anywhere in the world. There were a lot of good looking girls there for the single guys. I never saw any fights or ever felt any danger. Keep in mind I was with my girlfriend and never had a problem with any guys hitting on her or harassing her. Taxi is about 10-15 minutes & 150 pesos to Playa Del Carmen. Guys, I did see some very good looking young ladies around the resort, however most of them were with their boyfriend, or with a large group of people most likely family. If you want to meet some ladies, just make sure your game is tight and you may have a chance, because trying to pick up a girl while her father, brother, and grandfather are nearby is no easy task! Also be cautious of green bracelets! Tours We went to see Mayan ruins at Chichen Itza. It cost about $100US/person and was well worth it. It\u2019s about 3 hours from the hotel however the tour give gives a very interesting history lesson on the way to give you background information about the amazing pyramid you will soon see. It\u2019s also a great Photo Op to look at years later and reminisce on when you saw one of the New 7 Wonders of the World! Problems, Thefts, & Complaints We never had any problems with theft or items being stolen from our room from the cleaning staff, nor did we hear about any. However, be smart when you travel. Guys, don\u2019t take the Rolex... take the cheap Timex or the replica Rolex. Ladies, don\u2019t take the diamond earrings and bracelet... buy cheap jewellery there from the vendors (they need the money & you can bargain them down very low). We took simple yet effective measures to prevent theft just to be safe, such as putting valuables in your suitcase and locking it when you\u2019re out; leaving the TV and lights on when you go out to create the illusion that someone is in the room; and simply not bringing valuables! Do you really need to wear the diamond ring your grandfather gave you 20 years ago on vacation?!? It will really suck to lose it in Mexico so don\u2019t take it! Overall your vacation is what you make of it so don\u2019t go there with an attitude or expecting people to wait on you hand and foot. Sure I once had to wait about 15 minutes to get a taxi from the hotel, and sure I few times when I went to the bar they were out of mint for Mojitos... YOU\u2019RE ON VACATION!!! RELAX!!!

First time to Mexico, and to an all inclusive resort. Our accomodations were a Junior Deluxe Swim-up room. It was perfect for the two of us for a blissful week of rest and sun. Although the weather wasn't great the first 3 days, the rain held off until the evening so we were still able to get around to see the sites comfortably. We enjoyed our stay, we were aware of the slippery conditions on the marble floors from previous reviews from fellow travellers, and learned to place the shower nozzle in the shower at a certain spot so that you didn't flood the floor. We booked with Air Transat, and were provided with robes and flip flops, which came in handy on the wet marble. The hotel still has issues that were noted in 2007, in terms of the water leaving a brown/orange ring around your jacuzzi tub after using it, and the sewage smell in the rooms, we noticed this right from the start, but just opened our patio door to air out the room. Not 5 star quality. Our room was attended every day by our maid and bar man, which in turn, we tipped them generously each day, $5 US for the maid, $5 US for the bar man. We had 3 days of towel art, and saw the evening maid almost every day for our turn down service and chocolates on the bed. Having the swim up room was great, it allowed you to relax on your balcony and enjoy a swim close to your room. The food was average for the buffets, breakfast & lunch was good, the dinner a la carte restaurants were ok. Mamma Mia & Miso were the best. The after dinner spanish coffees in the square while you listened to the two piece band was good. We had no issues with the staff in the restaurants or room service, we treated all of them with the upmost respect and dignity. All was good until our last day.............unfortunately our toilet was broken, so we reported this early in the afternoon. At 4:45 pm the front desk rang to see if maintenance had been by to fix it, we replied not yet. They would call them again. At 6:30 pm, we called them to see if they would be coming soon, as we wanted to get ready to go for our last dinner and evening out at the resort. They would try them again. At 8:20 pm we're leaving to go out for dinner, in the hall is a maintenance worker, going from door to door with a screw driver. We ask him if he is the person to come and fix our toilet, \"no englaise\", and shrugged no. We determined he wasn't the person, so continued out to dinner, at Le Fondue, I would skip this A La Carte. After enjoying our last evening out to dinner, our last spanish coffee in the square, listening to the two man band, and dancing the nite away, we returned to our room. Voila! the toilet is fixed. We had a night cap on our balcony, said good bye to the Mexican sky, and retreated to our room, as we had to rise very early to catch the shuttle the next morning. Upon entering the closet area where the safe is, we discovered that our safe had been violated. Our safe had the \"stickers\" and number pad perfectly in tack when we left, not now. The sticker had been peeled back and a hole the size of a quarter was visible in the metal underneath. Fortunately for us, the culprits were not successful in gaining access to our money or passports. We called the front desk, and were finally put in touch with the correct person to lodge our complaint. The supervisor informed us that the \"night manager\" would have to be contacted, and they would call back, which he did, and said that they would come to our room in 10 minutes (mexican time). The night manager arrived along with a security person. We explained that we had encountered what we thought to be the maintenance person outside our room in the hall when we left, and showed the manager the door that he was attempting to access, which when you looked at it, appeared to have been pried open with a screwdriver, you would think he would have had a key?? The manager explained that he would have been in there checking the air conditioning, all that was in there was a drain pipe, no eqiupment. We explained that we were not accusing him of accessing our room, but certainly someone had entered and violated our privacy. After showing our safe damage to the night manager and security person, they looked at it, and determined that there was no way anyone could enter it, it was thick metal. Well someone sure tried. The response from the manager was; \"What could they do for us?\", well an apology would have been great, and maybe an assurance that they would look into the matter might have been helpful also. But rest assured the manager said; \"We would be his \"pet project\" for the evening, in other words, we would be safe. They offered to repair the safe that evening, and we declined as it was already well after 1:00 am, and we needed to get up early, it could wait until the morning. It was quite apparent that the hotel management was not going to accept any responsibility for this incident, and I believe that this is a common occurance at this hotel. Needless to say, we didn't sleep well our last night. When we checked out, we thought if this hotel had any class, there would have been some mention of this to us, and maybe an apology or something to show that they were sorry that this had happened to us, we got nadda! This really ended our trip on a sour note, and left us wondering what was it that we had done to make us a target for this offence? Get real eh, no one should ever have this happen to them when they are staying at a so called 5 star resort! I know people who have stayed at other places rated 4 or less, and not had anything like this happen. All I can say is that it's a good thing that this didn't happen early on in our stay, it would have made it not so enjoyable. One other note, we learned to put the dead bolt on our room the first night, the maids don't always knock before they enter, and you may get surprised, and so might those who enter! The management at this hotel needs a complete overhaul, and re-training in the service industry. It is quite apparent if you read back on the reviews as far back as 2007, that many of the things that we experienced are still there..........", "Date": "January 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina", "Title": "\u201cQuit Complaining!\u201d", "Author": "Reginagal", "ReviewID": "UR23785040", "Content": "We travelled with Transat Holidays, (Westjet) Jan 11-18. This was our first hot holiday ever and first time in Mexico, I was a little nervous as I had read so many negative reviews that I was a bit worried about what our experience at this hotel was going to be like. We booked our holiday 3 weeks before our departure date so needless to say we got a good deal. We booked the Junior Deluxe Suite (room 6150 - pool view). Travelling to the hotel, our host on the bus was great! His name was Juan, and made our bus ride an entertaining and enjoyable one! This hotel is absolutely grand when you first pull up, large entrance with marble everywhere! Our check-in went smoothly, they give you a map of the grounds and where everything is so after a day, you pretty much have it cased out! Fortunately our room was ready so we were able to take our suitcases to our rooms. NOTE: if bellboys offer to take your suitcases to your room for you, a tip will be required. You have the option of carting your own suitcases, your choice! ROOM: Beautiful, as soon as I got there I checked everything out, to make sure it worked! After reading reviews about shower stalls leaking, toilets plugging. Luckily our shower worked perfectly, no leaking, toilet worked fine, we had a jacuzzi tub, I did try it once worked fine! Room was cleaned everyday with towel art on the bed, always supplied with fresh towels and clean linens. Only one drawback, due to the humidity the room smelled musty at times and the throw pillows on the bed smelled like when you leave towels in the washing machine too long, other than that you get used to it. Beds are quite firm so that I didn't care for. NOTE: to get power you need to leave one of your room cards on the wall near your door, in order for lights and fan to work. I think the a/c stays on all the time. Transat gave us a nice nut/dried fruit plate, a bottle of tequila and 3 small bottles of liquor in our room upon arrival. I don't think all travel companies offer this. FOOD: Buffets, 4 in total, sometimes they only open 1 side on each side of the resort due to low capacity. Food is not the hottest but you get used to it. You'll soon figure out what you like and dont like. Wait staff were more than acommodating at the buffets, offering you coffee, drinks etc. Greet them with a smile and a Hola! and they will treat you the same in return. All buffets were good, the 2 down near the beach are smaller less choices but still good. Breakfast open from 7-10:30 am, Lunch 12:00 - 2:30 and Dinner 5:30 - 11:00 Can't take food out of buffet so make sure you get enough! A LA Cartes: We were fortunate to have all of our reservations pre-booked, which was great! Grill - Ok, but not my favourite, still good though and hot! Fondue: Great! Lots of choices, nice and hot! Seafood: One of our favourites! Japanese: Great food and entertaining! Try to get the Teppanyaki if you can (sit around the grill) Italian: least favourite Lasagna was bland and cold but the Capresse salad was amazing. We did not try Le FLeur and Mexican We tipped 50 peso at each a la carte Entertainment: We did not take much in b/c we were up early every morning and after supper started getting tired. Entertainment staff put on a show nightly, They had a market set up on Wed nights, in the lower lounge they had nightly entertainment was good, lots of people dancing. We did not go to the disco. There is a girl that sets upa table every night with nice coffee drinks where she sets the liquor (your choice) on fire and pours in your drink with whip cream (MUST HAVE - amazing :) DRINKS/Bartenders: Party pool - Mateo and Sergio are awesome....be kind to them and tip them well, they will give you great service. Also, take a 20 oz or 32 oz go cup with you, they are happy to fill it with whatever drink you want! MUST TRY - Mojitos...are awesome!!! Please specify each time if you want Premium liquor ie: Bacardi, Smirnoff etc etc...all the bars are free pour, no watering down here! Ice cream at this bar too - yummy! Lobby bar (Riviera side) Gaspar and another guy(can't remember his name) amazing guys...very friendly, tip them well :) They will give you great service....they make great drinks..whatever u want. Sports bar: ONly went here once, didn't like the bartenders. Beach: Beatiful but small and I imagine busy when weather is nice. Make sure to take water shoes, it's rocky in places. We had crappy weather so we didn't go in the water, too windy and too high of waves, wasn't taking any chances. Tours: A bit costly but when weather is bad, you need something to entertain yourself. Emilio Aquatic adventure, highly recommended!!! We had a great time, Emilio was awesome...(Snorkeling, cenote and snorkel in underwater cave) Dolphinarus, expensive but worth every penny! Orientation meeting with Vacation rep: MAKE SURE YOU GO!!!!!! They give you lots of valuable information, don't miss out. Usually the day you arrive or the morning following: This hotel offers free shuttles to Playa Del Carmen, book 24 hrs in advance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GYM: Didn't use it..I am on vacation LOL but looks nice. BUGS: didn't have any in our room, few mosquito bites but they spray hardly saw any. This hotel has marble everywhere like I said, we had crappy weather overcast and rained everyday we were there except 1 :( Floors are extremely slippery including walkways, be careful!!! Beachtowels: Make sure you hang on to them, you can trade them in for nice warm dry ones at the towel hut if you want. This place is humid so your best to dry your bathing suits and towels in your room instead of hanging over your balcony! You're in a 3rd world country where the staff make about 55 peso a day and the entire time we were there they smiled and were so accomodating, trying their best to make sure you have an enjoyable time. Please give that respect back to them and you'll get great service. For what we pay hotel.flight.food. we are getting a pretty great deal...just look out the window of your bus on the way to your resort and you'll realize we have a pretty good standard of life, most people there have nothing. They take a bus 1 hour each way from their homes to come and work at the hotel for 8-12 hours a day to provide services to thousands of people. Just lay back, enjoy the trip, and take it with a grain of salt and you'll have a great time!", "Date": "January 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Niagara, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cStop the complaining...\u201d", "Author": "r4rudy", "ReviewID": "UR23782840", "Content": "From: Niagara, Ontario After reading so many negative reviews I felt compelled to write my own having just returned from the Princess. The weather was NOT good, but did make us venture out and do things that we may not have otherwise done. All that was a great experience. The hotel: lovely grounds, rooms, all kept up above average. The beach: very nice, it allowed us to walk for many kms (go north, great swimming there). I could see how it could get crowded, but given the weather it sure wasn't. The food: I have had better. The buffets were disappointing in selection of food, variety etc. We opted out for al la carte.. with some planning we had no trouble booking. These for most parts were very good. All in all, we were satisfied with it. Keep in mind you are not at home. The food prepared for tourists is NOT what they make for themselves. This is to accommodate us, so if it's not perfect, stay home. The room: Junior suite. Nicely appointed. Yes, the shower leaked like a sieve. After the first night of soaking up water with towels and looking at the unsightliness of it all, I figured a little intelligence goes a long way. Control the water with the shower wand (the shower is big enough to drive a truck in) and no more water on the floor. Sweep some water with your foot towards the drain and no more issues. Maid service: excellent, room always clean. Even towel art every day. Some get it some don't. Must be the mood of of the maid. Left a small tip every day. The safe: the sticker was peeled back, I'm not sure what that was all about. I was concerned, but all was well. I wonder if it isn't visitors tampering with their safes. I was playing with the codes and somehow locked myself out (stupid me). I panicked on what I would be charged and how long this would take. I called, 10 minutes later security showed up with a hand-held device, plugged one end into the usb port on the safe and zeroed out the code. No issue, no cost. Sign the book and all is good. Staff: all friendly, courteous and eager to help. Coffee at breakfast, beer at lunch, all brought over with a smile. Lovely people. Entertainment: saw one show. Horrible. Suck it up... lots of other things to do. Great live music every night in one of the lounges. Only problem, they quit too early. Overall: Nice place. I've been to better places. I wouldn't go back, not because it isn't good enough, just because I normally don't go to the same place twice. For all the bad reviews: I can only assume that they are expecting too much in a foreign country. I felt very safe and well taken care of. As far as theft, water on the floor, staff attitude etc. goes, the only thing I can say is that a little intelligence and courtesy goes a long way. We are guests in their country and I think they do a great job catering to our wishes, making it as comfortable for us as possible. Nothing is perfect, even at home, why should it be everywhere else. Do the math and break down the flight, hotel, taxes, food etc. It's a good deal. Bad weather: no such thing. Just the wrong clothing and wrong attitude.

Our first impression was that the resort was absolutely huge (there is a shuttle if you can't make the walk) and that the staff were relatively pleasant. The grounds were beautiful with lots of pools, statues and foliage. We booked the regular junior suite, the rooms were very nice except some of them smelled damp (a few people in the group with us had to switch room as there was a distinct sewage smell in the room). While the rooms were modern, they were missing a few basic features (soapdishes, etc.) The food was mudane at best. Lunch and dinner seemed to serve the same foods over and over again. Get ready for lukewarm as well, nothing was served hot and/or fresh. Be very very wary of the hamburgers as 9 times out of 10 they were still bleeding (this goes for the sportsbar as well). There is fresh, hot pasta served at lunch and dinner but be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes in line. Breakfast was BY FAR the best meal of the day with fresh omelettes (wait was not too bad), waffles, pancakes, etc....I always made sure to make it in time. As well, bring plenty of snacks as between 10-12 and 3-6 there is no food served anywhere on the resort except for at the sports bar. The best meal that we had was at the wedding reception where we had steaks, peppers, chicken, etc....everything was hot and fresh and absolutely delicious. If you're lucky enough to be there for a wedding, bring a doggie bag to the reception! If you can, definately book a la carte, but stay away from the Mexican restaurant (slow service for not so great food) but the Italian and the Grill are both really good. Our biggest problem happened on Day 4 when we realized that there was $240US missing from the safe in our room. We had yet to leave the resort and hadn't spent any money besides a few dollars here and there for tips so there was no way we had spent it. We'd kept everything in our safe, locked up tight so we obviously called security about the problem. They did NOT take us seriously, made us look like liars and didn't try to rectify the situation at all. We asked if situations like this had ever happened before (knowing that they had because of traveller reviews) and the security guy said no, we were the first. They were supposed to print a report of safe entries for us (which we never got). On our own we figured out that it was because the sticker on the safe with the instructions, had been peeled back, leaving the bar exposed. So, do not leave money or anything valuable in your safe. Pay for everything that you can with your credit card as the interest rate is probably better too. Or, carry everything with you, as most of our group of 40 did after they heard our predicament. Final note, there are LOTS of kids at the resort so it is definately family-friendly if that's what you are looking for.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel shame Thomson are so Crap!!\u201d", "Author": "Annabanna25", "ReviewID": "UR23688561", "Content": "We stayed at the Riviera Princess for two weeks In October 2008 and absolutely loved it! We were a little worried having read terrible reviews from previous guests. However it seems as we stayed in low season a lot of the issues other guests had were resolved anyway, I think you also need to remember that some people are never happy!!! Our room (Junior Suite) was ready on arrival, only problem with cleanliness was perhaps the bath could have been a little cleaner but a quick squirt of the jacuzzi jets and the bath was perfect. We were thoroughly impressed with the size and standard of the room, being less than a year old when we stayed everything was well looked after and very modern. We were in a ground floor room that had our own balcony area looking over the rear gardens and the Kids play area (due to time of year this didn't cause us any noise, although I would think it may have done had the kiddies been using it!). We also backed on to the main \"road\" used by the golf buggies to transport guests, luggage, staff, laundry, and more or less anything else that they could fit on there! As they are electric this casued us no noise issues at all. It was also very handy to be grab a lift on the buggy to go to reception when it was raining. The cleaners left us new towels every day, Im not sure how many times the sheets were actually changed but the bed was made everyday and the bathroom cleaned, bins emptied, mini bar restocked etc every day. We were absolutely made up with the room. The hotel is VERY vast, but we kind of liked that! As you're all inclusive for 14days in a resort it is nice to be able to walk within the grounds and not feel your in one place for 2 weeks. From beach to reception I would say it is a 15-20minute stroll, but it's all flat and there are plenty of views to admire along the way. The hotel gardens were immaculate, and were tended to daily using what I can only describe as very long, very sharp knife! This tool cut grass, hedges, trees, the lot! so no noise from lawn mowers etc. The groundsmen were very polite and always acknowledged you as you passed. Absolutely beautiful flowers and plants that were thriving in the rainy season. On our first evening the buffet restaurant was impressive, plenty to chose from exotic to basic, no waiting time for a table, food was hot and well presented. Pasta or omlettes were prepared on demand. Drinks plentiful, although sometimes a little slow, mainly due to being understaffed! Breakfast buffet was the same, we found the restaurant closer to the beach to be serving fresher food mainly due to a higher turnover but both buffets were great. We were told at welcome meeting that due to low occupancy a la carte restaurants could be used anytime as many times as you wished which we took advantage of! we found the lunch and dinner buffet to be fairly similar so using a la carte for the evening was a big bonus. Food and service in all restaurants was fantastic, never had any complaints. Even in the 24 hour sports bar the burgers were hot and fresh. Drinks were a small problem to start with, we soon realised a 5 dollar time brought a far better service and larger glasses for the whole evening! san miguel on tap was great, wine and cocktails good, you name it they had it. Having 24 hr all inclusive was a real perk and no limitations were enforced at all. Waitress service on the beach and round the pool was great, again a small tip was well worth it. Staff were friendly and helpful, found it hard to fault any staff other than reception being understaffed and concierge seemed constantly busy. Again when your turn came they were very helpful. Beach great, pools great. We were very lucky that during October the hotel was hardly occupied, this enabled us to have the choice of sunbeds round any pool any time of day. the main pool and pool bar tended to be noiser with all day drinkers and animation teams but we never found it a problem to keep away from that. the beach was normally empty and we found it very relaxing. always clean and sunbeds were arranged neatly under the shade or in the sun which ever you wanted . we also got to see about 7 weddings on the beach!! Beach towels were readily available and we were able to change them at lunch time for fresh ones. This proved a real treat when the needed to be used as umbrellas during a sudden rain storm!! The weather at this time of year unpredictable but on the whole the was plenty of sunshine and we came home with a tan! However when it rains it really really rains! Th marble floors were lethal after a storm but they were soon mopped and dry again. Some areas became a little flooded at times but the constant heat soon sorted that out. On the whole we had no complaints about the hotel at all, they were very hardworking and very conscious to ensure everyone was having a pleasant stay. Remember that their level or urgency is quite different to ours! The Bell Boy took FOREVER to get our cases when we left but once at reception we realised that literally hundreds of others were checking out too so they were under alot of pressure. I think some of the problem was just the difference between Mexican ways and our ways of doing things! We were however sooooo annoyed at the money making antics of Thomson! Having to pay \u00a35 each, each way to watch the TV on a 10 hour flight!!!! Disgusting! And NO free drinks at all, not even with the meal, not even tea or coffee?! Amazing how the duty free cart (which air hosstesses make commission on) came round several times but nothing else did! we had one hot meal and a sandwich which was barely edible! Aldo Zilli's beef sausages were \"interesting\"! had numerous problems with Thomson before leaving the UK and felt their attitude absolutely sucked, when a sales rep shrugs their shoulders at you in a store it just about sums up the company attitude!!! airport staff and air stewardsweren't up to much either. Thomson took the very lovely rep (Beth) out of the hotel about 3 days into the holiday and she was supposedly replaced by the First Choice rep who was just as crap as their other staff!! very miserable but seemed to cheer up when we said we wanted to book an excursion!!! Xcarat is well worth the visit as was Playa del Carmen but only for an afternoon as there's not a great deal to see. Corona is on happy hour constantly which is always a bonus!!!

We loved it! We travelled with our 4 year old and 10 month old daughters. The weather was beautiful, sunny and hot for 6 days. Food was great. We didn't expect it to be so good being Mexico. But it was. There was alot of fish and salads and variety everyday, and the option to go to the a la carte restaurants 5 times. Rooms very nice and very clean. The resort itself is extremely well kept and clean. The drinks very good as well. They can pretty much make whatever you want and they have all of the name brand liquors (ie Absolut Vodka). The service was great as well. The resort is huge so be prepared to walk wherever you go. One thing I was really impressed with was the kids club. One outdoor with a pool, playground and activity area and one indoor with a movie room, games room and activity area. They also had a mini disco at 8: 30 where they gathered the kids and had a little dance. The sports bar was nice too even though my husband and i didn't really get to use it. It had two pool tables, two foosball tables, darts, and snacks. The beach was beautiful. We didn't really go into the water bcz we have children and the tide was too high. There are plenty of lounge chairs around the many pools including the 4 childrens pools. So you didn't have to get there at 7am to get a good spot. The only thing we didnt like was we were woken up 3 times in the middle of the night. There was alot of noise at night. There is a new club in playa del carmen \"Coco Bongo\" and there were alot of younger people that stayed at the resort that made noise at 1,2, and 3 am. Also wanted to mention anyone travelling with children make sure you request a room without an adjoining door. I woke up one night at 1 am in a panic because my room was full of cigarette smoke. We called the front desk to let them know, but they didn't do anything about it. So my daughters had to breath in smoke until my husband asked our neighbours to stop smoking (which they kindly did) and the room was aired out. I think they ended up switching those guys to another room the next night. I did recommend that they have some sort of a strategy when assigning rooms to their guests (ie) families with young children in certain buildings. Don't know if they'll do it or not. We went to playa del carmen one day. Its something to definitely see, and probably the best place to do any shopping. We took a cab for 14 pesos one way, but there is a free shuttle you can take from the hotel, you just have to book 24 hrs in advance. Keeping the few negative things in mind, we will make certain requests the next time. But my husband and I have already spoken about going back for New Years.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cfantastic resort, don't get caught up on the negative reviews!!\u201d", "Author": "surfsunsand", "ReviewID": "UR23616514", "Content": "We are a family of 5, the kids ages are 10,14,17 my husband and myself all stayed at this gorgeous resort from Jan.6 to the 13th and I really have no idea what all the negative comments are about. This place is definately 41/2 to 5 star property and service. I have had the pleasure of going to Las Vegas every year for some time now staying at different high profile properties every time and this resort is right up there as well. We booked a swim up room 6065 the best spot in the resort we think as it is in the middle of everything, and across from the party pool, it was definately the way to go. The room was well appointed and clean and we got to check in early. (We arrived at 11:30 and check in time was at 3:00) so that was a good thing. You do have the bell boys to guard you suitcases if you can't check in so you can enjoy the resort if your room isn't ready, so no worries, they will also take your bags to your room as well. One of the negative comments I read were the maps of the resort given out at the reception were difficult t to follow. Well perhaps the guests who complain about this have problems with reading any and all maps because I found the map very easy to follow. Not to mention the reception staff and bell boys are helpful and welcoming. Another negative comment I read was that there are just not enough staff to accomodate a resort of this size, another thing I just can't understand. There are lots of staff members all over the place, Getting you drinks, cleaning, saying hola, smiling and asking you if you are needing anything, the service was spot on, I never had to wait long for anything, and the resort was at full capacity. The other negative comment I read was the room not clean and of theft, my room was cleaned everyday, fresh towels lots of them, turn down service, chocolates and more towels at night. No one ever barged in my room they knocked first and also there is a do not disturb sign to hang up if you want. I didn't have a problem with theft at all and I did leave my video camera out and money by accident a couple of times before going out for the day and getting my room cleaned, usually I use the safe. I came back to my room to find my things neatly on the desk by the TV set. The resort is big, I like that about a resort, I like to walk, it was a pleasure doing so as you get to walk around and view beautiful gardens with sculptures, fountains and pools, see interesting birds, say hola to people passing by and walk off all that food! If you do have a problem getting around (walking) because some people do, you may have an issue. There is a shuttle service however. The beach, I found, had a lot of room to sit, I think that the comments about the beach area being small are because the guests who claim that didn't actually walk to find where the perimiters of the resort are. It goes for quite a while, lots of chairs and palapas all up and down the perimeter. You will find a place to sit and you don't have to get down there at 8:00am. Most of the time I went down to the beach in the afternoon. It is pebbly when you get out in the water a little bit not on the sand out of the water, water shoes would have helped, will bring them next time. We mostly ate in the buffets because no one wanted to dress up for dinner. The buffets were fine, I liked the food, some was merely warm but there were hot items as well, thats what I expect at a buffet. Nothing was cold unless it was supposed to be, salad stuff was crisp not wilty, We did go to 2 a la carte restaurants and they were fine, I wasn't blown away by any meal I had at the resort but don't take that the wrong way, the food was good, I am just incredibly picky when it comes to food. I was impressed with the service, it was great and would have been outstanding if I knew more Spanish, only so I could interact more personally with the wait staff. They knew plenty of English, the fault lies with me. I would love to know more Spanish because the staff are fun to talk to. Funny thing, my 17 year old son wore his Metallica concert t-shirt one night at the buffet and lots of the young men working there clearly like that band. \"You like Metallica? Me too! I play their music, I would love to see them in concert,All right! Metallica!!!\"My son was smiling and talking with the guys, they came over to the table, talking about music and different bands, it was good. Who knew Metallica could be an icebreaker topic? LOL My younger kids LOVED the ice cream machine at the main pool bar, and the Mango \"magaritas\" kid style that is, mini ice cream cones, a pool, games to play the animation staff always encouraged the kids to come join games which they did happily. My daughter has made me promise to take them back next year because of the fun and the nice people. We went on some excursions with Edventures, people you MUST book with them, it was fantastic and the absolute best prices I am sure. Email me and I will give you the details as you need to reserve in advance but just to give you an idea, they pick you up at your resort in a van in our case it was just the 5 of us, you go to Tulum to meet up with your guide so you have your own guide AND driver, they outfit you with your gear and the cooler with your drinks, drinks cost extra, but at local prices, we chose beer go figure, we are Canadians haha, the kids had gatorade your driver will go get them at the store for you. So for $90 dollars per person we went to Tulum ruins (no guided tour of it because we didn't want one). Cenote snorkel at Dos Ojos cave amazing with guide, Snorkel with sea turtles at Akumal with guide, Lunch at an amazing little beach restaurant called La Buena Vida,that was extra money but not much and we loved it, then more snorkelling at an inlet with the guide can't remember the name but it was like swimming in a fish tank, then you are driven back to the hotel. Most excursions are over 100 dollars for just one of those activities and you are with a huge group. This one $90 for many activities and small group, do it it will be the best excursion ever I kid you not!! Prices will be reflective of the activities you choose, next time we will go ziplining!!! Playa del Carmen was really fun, we went to a beach club there called Kool, kind of by accident, we were walking on the beach and just decided to play in the waves right there. Lots of music, lots of drinks, food, good looking people, pretty much like most Spring Break movies dancing, tons of people, super fun, some topless people more up by the pool part though, so if you want to see some go up that way, haha, and the good life for sure, beach was beautiful, water was warm, super sandy.PS no kids up by the pool part of Kool. We also went to 5th avenue, also great fun, I like the street venders trying to get you to by their items and barter. Its all part of the experience, so have fun with it!! I know this was a little longer than I had planned to write, the resort is beautiful, great service and great times, book today, you will love it.

It was well worth it. Both times we stayed in the Platinum - by booking at right time with the right agent you don't necessarily pay much more. We had a great ocean view room, get to see the sunrise with a nice cup of coffee or cappucino every morning, just before the dash to get the poolside or beach loungers. Food was decent - better than most all-incs. The a la cartes were also ok . This time the Miso was the best - there is the Teppanyaki and the Asian sit-down - both were great. The French (Fleur) is for the adventerous - Ostrich on the menu, not bad. The seafood restaurant (las Olas) was good too. This time the Mexican (Hacienda) was a big disappointment. Overall the resort is well kept - very clean, service has improved and response to room issues is much more prompt. The beach has deteriorated since our last visit due to erosion. They were going to improve this, but you definitely need water shoes to enjoy the beach. You can snorkel about 100 yds from shore nicely - enough to see. Another annoyance is the watercraft - too noisy when you want to nap peacefully in the sun . The staff work hard - especially in the restaurants and do there best to please everyone which is tough. The Platinum pool area is nice, quiet with great service for drinks and snacks. Only thing was too many smokers - almost everyone smoked. Especially my fellow Canadians - you'd think they'd learn from the warnings on our cigarette packs, but it seemed these poor fools thought smoking was to cure cancer.

The restaurants are fine, but not fabulous. The seafood restaurant is the best by far. The beach could be crowded, if the hotel was full; but there is room to spread out, and the sand is fabulous. Bring swimming shoes if you want to swim in the ocean, as there is a fair amount of rock along the shore, but lots of sandy spots.

It was a trip we really looked forward to. Although my husband and I don't generally enjoy the all inclusive resorts, the rest of my family thoroughly enjoys it, so we conceded to booking here. We were able to secure junior deluxe rooms near each other, but not next to as we requested 6 months prior. We were near the beach end of the very long, very narrow resort, but not waterfront. First, let me say that the resort is HUGE! Really. If you see my other reviews, you'll notice that I prefer the smaller, more intimate spots, but even someone used to larger hotels would have to agree that this place is massive, and 100% books for the week we were there. There's literally a shuttle that brings you from one end to the other, though we found it to be a bit unpredictable and full most of the time. It's a 10-15 minute walk from the lobby to the beach. Mind you, most of the a la carte restaurants are on one of the resort, while our room was on the other side. This isn't a problem for me, but older visitors would surely complain. Reception was fine, our baggage arrived to our room as promised, and we were given a cold drink on arrival, after a LONG day of traveling. My parents and brother (who traveled together) had a similarly pleasant experience. The resort itself is really lovely. The grounds are kept pristine, and EVERYONE was friendly. I find that if you greet someone with a smile, you'll rarely get anything other than that in return. There are LOTS of pools, but they were all pretty chilly, making them difficult to swim in unless it's really hot. (I SCUBA dive off of Maine, so cold really IS cold to me). The rooms were spacious, always clean (we did tip daily), and the bathroom was spectacular, very fancy. We had no problems with anything, and even left wallets, cameras, etc. out in the room by mistake during the day, only to come back and find them neatly placed on bureaus. They would even straighten out our flip flops! The beach itself was truly a disappointment. It is rocky in the water, and the bottom undulates as a result of surge. There is only a narrow piece of beach that the resort owns, and they squeeze an UNBELIEVEABLE number of chairs into this small area. The closeness really turned us off. The sand was fine, though the beach was quite windy most of our stay. Food and drink was never a disappointment. We were constantly given drinks and we tried almost all of the a la carte restaurants. The service was great and we never left hungry. There seems to be some disagreement among the staff as to how to reserve spots for dinner. Everyone had a different answer for this question, so be sure to straighten it out for yourselves, else your desired restaurant might be filled. This is especially important as the lobby and the restaurants are far from many of the rooms, no sense in making more than one trip! The drinks were plenty strong, believe me, and there was no shortage of top shelf liquor (upon request). The resort was great for what it was. I wouldn't return there, just because it isn't my style. It was lavish and complete with all of the excess some desire on vacation.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "MyOpinionOntario", "ReviewID": "UR23224316", "Content": "I loved this resort! My husband and I went this past December for a long overdue honeymoon (seven years)!!! We upgraded our room to a Villa Laguna which was the best decision we could have made. There were so many EXTRA inclusions- but just the room made this worth the investment. Our room was beautiful- and big, with a goegeous outdoor shower. Also with this upgrade you were allowed access to an exclusive pool bar area, with a concierge on duty from 6-6. Seeing as that pool/bar is only for what they call VIP- there is no waiting in line (if you decide to walk up to the bar, instead of waiting for service at your pool chair). Also there is no rushing in the morning to reserve your lounge chair with a towel as there are plenty to go around. This pool is QUIET! So if your looking for a wild party crowd you probably won't find it here. Also with this room upgrade you have access to two Platinum lounges (Riviera and Sunset) with bar service, nice loung as well as 8 computers( four each) accessible to Plantinum and Villa guests only. Check in was a breeze, the food was delicious, the service was mostly great, and cleaniliness was impeccable. The only thing I would have liked was more activities/entertainment. You MUST try the Mayan coffee, this is in the DISCO area nightly from around 7 until around 9 it's made with Kahlua, coffee, whipped cream and a Mayan liqueur called Xtabentum- it's delicious and interesting to watch it being made as they light the alcohol on fire and pour it flamming from one stainless steel ladle to another a few times before adding it to you sugar rimmed glass- By the way you cannot buy this alcohol in Canada- so bring back lots!!! Our favorite restaurant was MISO and least favorite was The seafood- Las Olas (I think) If you go in to Playa del Carmen visit a great restaurant on 4th Ave between 5th and 10th - it's called Ajua - or Aqua my husband and I can't agree on the name! Very delicious- but slightly pricey. As for the 5th Ave shopping well I wasn't that impressed- we went into town only to shop for a few souvenirs and it seems that the hotle sets up a \"market\" on Thursday nights for local merchants in the courtward so you can save yourself the time and the cab fare if you just do you rshopping there- also these merchants don't harrass you the way they do in town.

The resort is beautifully designed, bright, and open. It is a new resort and as such, isn't quite as lush and mature as some of the more established resorts. The front desk provided a map of the resort to assist in locating the key places. This map, however, is a simple black and white photocopy. I would have expected something with a little more quality. We stayed in a Junior Deluxe Suite and our room was located approximately half way between the front desk and the beach. This resort is quite long and there is a bit of walking to get from place to place. Nothing out of the ordinary for a all inclusive resort.

It had a large living area and beautiful bathroom with jetted tub, separate shower, and dual sinks. Plenty of room! The maid service was acceptable. Once we were left without new towels after the room had been cleaned. A simple call to the front desk and towels were delivered promptly. The buffets had excellent food and a great variety.

Some went the extra mile but most were just average. This seems to be the norm anywhere you go. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and were pleased with the resort.

Sports bar: not so good, hamburgers, hot dogs and nachos. Hot tip: Email the conceirge before you arrive with your ala carte reservations, its the only way to go, bring your confirmation email. Also email the front desk confirming the rooms you would like. The staff were very nice, helpful and always smiling! Order a miami vice, mudslide, and a mango marg! Mohitos are the big thing right now. Champagne and OJ was my fav! Beach, I have never seen so many beach loungers, it was amazing. Beach bar had long lines, but went fairly fast!

Beach messages are very good and you can get a temp tatoo on the beach. No vendors walking the beach but a few stands by the massage tables. Snorkeling not good at beach, lots of waves stirring up sand. Take a snorkel trip to Cozumel. Excellent. Tipping: we did tip but not everytime. Tipped in pesos, (10 pesos) for bar, housekeeper, etc. Ala cart we tipped 50 pesos. Not enough pool servers so order 2 drinks at a time. remember your insulated mugs! Our bathroom shower leaked into the water closet, not the main bathroom, no big deal put a towel down. We did have a soap dish in our shower but the other 2 rooms didn't. Lots of towels in the rooms, each night our bed was turned down with chocolates and groovy towel art. Each night Housekeeping came by (6:30) to ask if you need more towels. They change sheets every couple of days, if you want them changed everyday, just take them off and leave them on the floor. Check out was a breeze, they have showers, towels to the right of the conceirge to use if your flight leaves late.

Front desk: Upon arrival, we were told we couldn't get our room until 3pm, and we could not get rooms together in 1 block, even though we specifically requested this when we booked a month ago. One of our friend was a real estate agent and master of negotiation, so he spent 1 hour at the front desk and got us upgraded to junior suite delux for free!

One of our rooms had so much mosqitos and bed bugs that was not livable, we requested to have room change at the front desk, the guy told us he might not give us the same delux suite, and the room would be far away from the rest of our rooms. I asked again nicely, and he told us we didn't pay for the upgrades, then it was my turn to give him my 2cents worth, that it's not his business that we paid for the upgrade or not, and if the room was not livable, it's the hotel's issue! I went on for about 10mins non-stop, then he gave in and gave my friend the delux room even closer to us then the original room!! Overall: 3/5 Housekeeping: We tipped the 2nd day, we got no fresh towels, rooms weren't made until late in the day. We decided not to tip the next day, room was made early and fresh towels provided, we tipped the following day, and no fresh towels were given! Go figure! The mini-bar was filled everyday, and one day I was in the room while the drink guy made his round, he asked if we needed anything, I asked for 6 beers, and he gave them to me with a smile, Good job! Overall: 3/5 Food: We had most of the a la carte except Mexican and Fondue, overall, the food were OK, nothing to brag or complaint about. Best was being the Japanese, make sure you book Tampenyaki (Japanese grill), the cook really tried to entertain us and did a good job, and I was so surprised to have Sake to drink, too bad they over-heat the Sake and it didn't taste right. Seafood restaurant was blend and over-cooked, International was OK, Grill was OK (bad service of our waiter though as he yelled across our table to take order instead of walking around the table), Italian was above average, and my friend who had a stomach of a black hole got an extra pizza, which was a very good gesture of our waiter (we tipped him well). The buffet was OK with lots of food to choose from, but could improve on having the food more heated. Overall: 4/5 Beach: Water shoes a must!!! Glad that I read a lot of reviews here and went to Walmart the night before leaving for the trip. At least 30 feet of rocks before you get any sand in the ocean!! Be careful!! Otherwise the ocean was warm and a blast to play in. Overall: 3/5 Nightly entertainment: We went to 3 shows, and let's just say they tried very hard to impress us, and deserve a round of applause! Overall: 4/5 Christmas Eve Gala: This was the worst organization effort of the hotel staff!!! They made it such a hype, and ended in total failure!! We were given the gala notice 3 days in advanced, but we didn't get our tickets until 5:30pm the night of, and the front desk told us the wrong location to go to, we were running back and forth the hotel to find the restaurant just before it started. Once we got to our restaurant, we were told we had to wait for a table!! What the hell is the purpose of having tickets??? We waited for an hour to have our table, then we found out from other guests we have to wait in line for another 45mins to get our food - some over-cooked lobster and steak!!! My friend and I went to the bar and a lady there told us her husband was in line for an hour to get food!! Our dinner supposed to start at 7pm, we didn't leave the restaurant until around 10:30pm, and our eating time was only 20mins, the rest was plain waiting!! The hotel totally failed to make anyone feel festive at all and I bet you'll hear more bad reviews in the coming days! Overall: 0/5! Word of advice: 1. Negotiate and bother the front desk people as much as you can to get what you want, don't get mad, just bother them. 2. Keep an open mind to the rest of the staff, they work hard, just culturally different, and you'll have a good time. 3. Water shoes a must if you want to go into the ocean. 4. Join the dolphin swim tour from Sunquest, $125 for a whole day of fun, well worth it! The foot push swim and the belly pull with the dolphin were amazing, and I was told other tours will only let you touch the dolphins for 2 mins, and our swim was a cool 30mins!

Travel with my husband (50's), me (30's), step-son (21) and friend (30's) Great things: Beautiful grounds Beautiful pools Free upgrade to Laguna Villas Suites Private Pool Towels/maids/turndown service Good/Average things: Buffet food Fridge/mini-bar stocking Beach Poor/Below Average things: Service A la Carte food We booked our vacation through a travel agent and wanted to try alarge resort having tried small/medium resorts as well as hotels and bed and breakfast accomodations. We managed to book all our a la carte dining via email with the concierge prior to departure. As well, I emailed on a fairly regular basis about our room requests. We booked platinum and received a free upgrade to Laguna Villas (except friend who booked separately and remained in platinum). Arrival and check-in was slow. We left the platinum check-in for the regular line which moved much faster. Went to the Laguna Suites and they were beautiful. Friend went to his platinum suite to find it not cleaned and a complete disaster. Called desk and housekeeping promptly fixed the problem. Air-conditioning unit causing water leak in the ceiling patched at same time. Consequently on the 5th night, his ceiling fell in from backed-up water and it took almost two hours for them to move him to a different room. Housekeeping works very hard. We tipped $50 pesos per day. Lots of towels and the turn down service was beautiful with towel animals, fresh flowers on the bed and fresh room towels. The mini-bar was stocked to the specifications on the fridge door unless you were in the room when the stocker came and then with a tip you could get extra. Beware -all-inclusive is only up to 4 beers per day in the fridge as our friend found out, then an extra $1.00 per beer after. We tipped $20 pesos per day to the mini-bar stocker. Grounds are beautiful and clean. The beach is sandy and white. The ground in the water is very rocky. You really need pool shoes to make this work. The pools are great and the private Laguna Pools and Platinuim pools are great as well if you want some peace. We never had any problem getting lounge chairs or palpas at the the private pools or private beach section, however we did see a full-on fight at a regular pool over beach loungers. Food at the buffet was both extensive and repetative. I do not complain about buffet food as it is what it is. Between the group of us we were booked into all 7 a la carte restaurants. We did miss 2 due to a late tour return and a decision to eat in Playa del Carmen one night. We ate at La Olas which was ok, most seafood was overcooked, Mexican had good food, International also ok but nothing great, Grill was really not so great for all of us except my husband who had the lamb, and Japanese (Miso) which was amazing food. Service was poor except the private pools. They were so desperately understaffed that there is no way they could have provided amazing service. Most of the servers were hustling but simply could not keep up. Then there were the workers who simply did not work at all. Out of seven days at breakfast, we managed to get coffee twice, out of 5 lunches we managed to get drinks once, staff at some of the a la cartes were great, some were average and others were simply awful (seafood and Japanese). Usually only one bar tender at Plaza bar and lucky to have one waitress, 2 bar tenders at the lobby bar, sports bar a disaster but the cheese burgers and fries are really good. This is the only resort I have been at where tipping did not improve service and this islikely due to the size of the resort and the fact that they likely would not recognize you the next time you came in. Free included spa treatments with Laguna Villas was fun. My husband and step-son enjoyed theirs. My massage was a little too \"personal\". Disco was good for my step-son, not so for older crowd. Used Cancun All-Tours (Magic Tours) and booked a bus and driver for private day trip ($336 US) which was totally worth the money. Alex was fantastic! Ate at Madre Tierra in Playa del Carmen - definately worth the money. Had drinks at Carlos n' Charlies - was a blast! Had drinks and coconut shrimp and guac at Blue Parrot - excellent. tried drinks at most bars along 5th Ave and had a great time.

I am not writing to complain, rather point out what I would have liked to know before I book the trip. Overall the hotel is well built with nice grounds, and is very clean, but.... Check in, if you fly transat on the red eye, you arrive early morning, but they will not allow you to check in until 3 pm, no one at the front pointed out the courtesy showers, we stumbled across them later, nor do they secure your luggage or help you in any way. Getting around the resort: it is massive, I love to walk but it is inconvenient, very few elevators and if there is bellhop service we could not get it. The platinum areas are the only ones close to amenities or have ocean view, but are not worth the price of the upgrade ($50 per person per night) Pools: full of kids, no food or snacks permitted (you have to get dressed even for a snack), also most are salt water which was hard on the hair and skin over time, no working showers anywhere convenient to rinse off. Beach: very crowded, no toilets nearby, beach bar drinks are limited and even worse than the bad pool bar drinks, beach is rocky and too hard to swim in. Rooms: very decent, but no views. The chambermaids like to barge in all the time you have to hang to do not disturb at all times. They always short you on towels , and the voltage in the bathroom is like 120 or 125 while the rest of the room is north american standard so for the women no hair appliances Food: totally horrid, nothing was good, even Cuba had better food, and it was hard to get on the off hours, drinks very bad too Staff: unfriendly and unhelpful no matter how much you tipped, they were rude and dismissive. The hotel overall is contained, big cement walls around the beach and just generally hard to get around, service trucks going back and forth constantly which was noisy I have stayed in cuba 3 times where the food was scarce and resources were limited, the difference was that they try harder and make it a good experience, I cannot say the same for this place We wont be going back Kiah and Jim, North Van BC Canada", "Date": "December 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cPretty Good - but not 5*\u201d", "Author": "RosyM", "ReviewID": "UR22999373", "Content": "Hola! After reading so many reviews over the past year I am finally able to give my first hand opinion on this resort. My husband and I were at GRP from 14 Dec \u2013 21 Dec 2008, as Platinum ocean front guests using a voucher. (we were supposed to go Dec 07 but hotel was not ready) Check in: \u2013 Sunday 14 Dec approx 3:30 pm We arrived at reception to check in for our Platinum room, this took about 45 min. We paid extra for oceanfront upgrade. The lady helping us was very nice, but not aware of many of the inclusions for Platinum, told there was no internet in the rooms, no pillow menu, . We did not get a welcome drink or hot towels. We were told our room was not ready yet, and we should go get a drink and room will be ready in another \u00bd hr. No big deal. After the drink we went back to reception to get room cards \u2013 which were ready. As we were leaving the reception areas we noticed the special Platinum/Laguna check in area at the far end of the reception desk, it would have been nice if someone had told us we were in the wrong line \u2013 anyways\u2026 Room(s): we were told to take the shuttle to our room #5219 \u2013 shown where it was on the map, and left on our own. Found our way there no problem. Unfortunately, there were a few problems with the room. My hubby turned down the bed and noticed several large stains, yuck, as he was doing this he leaned on the night table with his hand, and stuck his hand in a big blob of k-y jelly, which totally grossed him out. The bathtub was filthy with stains and hairs. So we went down to the Platinum concierge, she was very nice and sent a crew back to change the sheets, wipe off night table. She did not clean the tub after we told her we were probably not going to use it. (It would have been nice if a 5* hotel did not present dirty rooms to guests \u2013 just my opinion.) Upon waking up the next morning I slipped going to the bathroom. The ceiling over the bathroom entrance opened up a big hole overnight and there was a 4 ft puddle (and growing) on the floor. We went back down to the Platinum concierge and she offered to put us in a new room. She was very apologetic and nice about it. She showed us room 5112 \u2013 which had plumbing parts all over the bathroom floor, dirty tub, and stained sheets again. We declined, and waited for another room. We had to wait a few hrs for it to be cleaned. We finally moved ourselves to room 5212. No bellboy was offered to help us move our suitcases, not the end of the world. Just to note: all 3 rooms we visited had broken sliding door handles \u2013 the doors are too heavy for them. All 3 rooms had the safe sticker half removed \u2013 weird I thought. All 3 rooms had dirty tubs. We accepted this as normal. Finally we begin our vacation. The room was beautiful, with a gorgeous view. Maid service was fine all week. Once we were given sheets with yellow stains, asked for new ones, got them no problem. We tipped the maid 2-3$ every day. One day mini \u2013bar was not restocked. I mentioned it to the Platinum concierge, and we had the refills after dinner. No biggie. Showers have no place to put yr shampoo etc. You have to put yr stuff on the floor. I brought a little suction cup basket from the dollar store, worked fine. Platinum concierge was always accommodating, helpful. Did not give us hassles when we had problems. Theft: I had heard about some theft issues so we locked all our stuff up in our suitcases every time we left our room. We brought a laptop and always locked it in the suitcase \u2013 bag and all. We kept money, iPod, and passports in the safe \u2013 had no problem. The only thing that went missing was a nice bracelet (costume jewellery) I had put in my suitcase outer pocket (not locked) went missing. I made a conscious decision to do this, aware of the problems there, and I am positive someone took it out of my suitcase. Just be aware of this. Beach: I thought the beach was very nice, lots of lounge chairs, usually able to find one in the shade (platinum section) even though we only dragged our butts there about noon every day. We went to the beach every day we were there, in the platinum section, only had a beach waitress ask us for drink order 3 times over he week. The water was warm. There were rocks, but if you step carefully it\u2019s not a problem. There was some garbage on the beach, lots of empty cups, cigarette buts from lazy tourists, but there were also things like garbage bags, several oilcans \u2013 don\u2019t think that was tourists. I saw the same garbage over a few days. Not terrible, but other places I\u2019ve been to rake and clean the beach every day. Also if you walk the beach off the resort you will see more garbage here and there \u2013 sad. Probably from construction or washed up in hurricane season. Food: The food was decent. I always found something to eat, some stuff was very good \u2013 flank steaks, fruit, ice cream\u2026 some stuff was not, but we are in Mexico, we are not picky eaters and like to try different things. I still managed to gain a few lbs. I agree with other reviewers \u2013 food wasn\u2019t that hot, and it was repetitive. Wine served was kind of chateau \u201cdepanneur\u201d (not great but drinkable to most regular folks) I found the same thing at all the other resorts in Mexico. Loved the cappuccinos & margaritas!! yum. Service at the buffets was not impressive. Usually did not get a waiter to our table for drinks. We got up and got it ourselves. Also \u2013 if you go back for seconds they often clear your table. If you want coffee after dinner \u2013 you have to go to a bar, the restaurants don\u2019t serve coffee. We went to Miso - which was quite good. Best service, very attentive \u2013 5* service (finally) We tipped our waiter here $5. We did not use the room service. The private Platinum party was a regular buffet with some seafood (mussels, clams crab claws) and a small band playing. It was nice. No complaints. Grounds: All very nice, surprising that the gardens look so good in one year. It is quite a big resort, but I like that. The palladium resort seemed bigger and easier to get lost - to me. Nice sculptures, secluded sitting areas.Pool looked nice \u2013 did not use pools \u2013 we are beach lovers. Looking around the resort I did see many cracks (from bottom floor to the roof) in the buildings, hope they re not structural. Also, they are building a new section next to the Riviera side \u2013 this might pose a noise problem for those with rooms facing it. Overall: I liked the hotel, but I do not think this is a 5*. I have been to 5 other all inclusive hotels (as comparison) and found the service, lack of attention to details, the little things that make a five star were not there. The staff was always pleasant, but I think they are understaffed, not their fault, not much sign of management or quality control, they were not able to deliver on the little extras that we were sold. DEAR PRINCESS HOTEL - PLEASE HIRE MORE STAFF - THIS COULD BE A GREAT PLACE IF YOU TIGHTEN THINGS UP A BIT! If I was going expecting a 4.0-4.5 star hotel I would have been very pleased, but because they sell this a five star lux hotel, with many bells and whistles \u2013 well , let just say I was expecting better.

It is a big resort, a lot of walking, but this is positifi, help you out to burn the calories from extra food and drink! Some people complained about muskitos bites, not true, never seen anything! Beach: it is a beautiful beach, you can have long walk, very nice. In the water, there is a few rocks at the entrance, but this is typicall to Mayan Riviera, nothing painfull.

We're honestly baffled as to how there can be so many negative reviews about this hotel because our vacation was perfect. This was our third trip to Mexico and every vacation is just as good the others. Check in/Check out No problem. We arrived at the hotel around 10:00 p.m. and were checked in immediately. We were told that the hotel was very full and that only rooms with two double beds were available but we could switch to a room with a king bed on Sunday. They were polite about it and it was no big deal to us. We decided to walk to our room so we could see the resort and it looks just as good at night as it does in the day. By the time we made it to our room our luggage was already there. As the safe in our room didn\u2019t work we called the front desk and someone was there to fix it within ten minutes and fixed it in under five. We went back to reception on Sunday to switch rooms and we were given a great room with a king bed as promised. Check-out was just as easy. We left our luggage at the Platinum lounge where it was picked up and brought to the reception for us. We paid for a bottle of wine that we ordered in room service and that\u2019s all there was to it. As we had an evening departure but had to check out of our room at noon, there are two large bathrooms (they call them hospitality suites) with a shower and change area close to the reception for your use. Staff We found the staff to be very polite and hard working. The staff in the buffet restaurants worked non-stop clearing plates and refilling drinks. The bartenders were excellent \u2013 all nice guys who worked hard to make sure you had a drink in your hand whenever you wanted one. The servers in the a la carte restaurants were great and we got top notch service at every restaurant. We tipped $5 at each restaurant and it was well-deserved. The concierge staff in both platinum lounges were very helpful when we changed our room and for making restaurant reservations. Grounds Amazing! They are perfectly manicured and the resort looks great day or night. Yes the resort is huge but I don\u2019t know how anyone can complain about it when you know how big it is when you book there! Although there is marble everywhere, the floor was never slippery and we never heard or saw anyone fall. The walk from our room to the lobby was less than 10 minutes and it was such a nice walk that we looked forward to it especially after eating a great meal. We saw the trolley running all the time and rarely saw people waiting longer than five minutes for it. It\u2019s a nice short ride plus you get to see the other side of the resort. Guests The resort was very busy from Fri \u2013 Sun but didn\u2019t feel over-crowded. What surprised us was how many children were there. I don\u2019t know if it was because of American Thanksgiving but there were children everywhere!! We spent by the first two days by the pool but moved to the beach because the pools were over-run by kids (even those with swim-up bars). This isn\u2019t the resorts fault by any means by beware if you are looking for a child-free resort. Room We booked a platinum room and our first room was on the Sunset side and our second on the Riviera side. Both rooms were set-up the same and at first glance, they look very sleek. Unfortunately, when you take a closer look, they look a bit worn even though the hotel is only one-year old. However, both platinum buildings were being painted while we were there so hopefully they\u2019ll give the rooms a new coat of paint too. Yes, the shower leaks - throw down a towel and kick the water towards the drain and problem solved. No issues with room cleaning \u2013 it was done by early afternoon, we got fresh towels and our fridge was always re-stocked. The only thing that didn\u2019t live up to our expectations was the in-room bar. We didn\u2019t particularly care otherwise we would have said something but we didn\u2019t get any alcohol (other than beer) while other\u2019s had a vodka, tequila and whiskey (or at least one of them). The jacuzzi on the balcony is great and the room is really spacious. There is no dresser which is odd but there is lots of room to put your clothes. Platinum Package As we got a great deal on our trip, we could afford to upgrade to the platinum package and there are definitely some benefits: - Lounge: the lounge is great because it\u2019s where you make your restaurant reservations, there are snacks and drinks and it\u2019s easy to get a computer. There is also outdoor area with lounge chairs and a small pool but it filled up very quickly so we didn\u2019t spend any time out there. - Location: The platinum buildings are the closest to the beach and it\u2019s a short walk to the buffet restaurants and the pools. - Beach: Platinum guests have their own area on the beach and it has a good mix of sun and shade and we didn\u2019t have any problem getting chairs. The only downside was room service. Keeping in mind that we ordered our food at dinner time, we were told it would take an hour and it took almost two so if you\u2019re going to order, plan accordingly! Pools/Beach The pools are great. There are two large pools with swim-up bars close to the beach and there are lots of others pools spread throughout the resort. They're not super warm but fine once you get in. Like at other resorts, people put their towels on chairs starting around 8:00 a.m. to reserve them but there's still lot of choices. The beach is fantastic - the sand is soft and the water is warm! Yes, it is somewhat rocky for the first few feet when you\u2019re getting in and water shoes are recommended but you can maneuver your way without hurting yourself as long as you walk carefully. Food I\u2019m a very picky eater while my husband likes a wide variety of food and we both loved the food!! There was great variety at the buffet, food was always fresh and we had no problem with food running out. If something was empty it was replaced almost immediately and there was lots of variety at both breakfast and lunch. All of the a la carte restaurants were great. Our favourite was the Japanese restaurant \u2018Miso\u2019 but every meal was fantastic. We got our orders just as quick as we would at a Canadian restaurant and the food was always hot and fresh. The meals are between two and four courses and both the red and white wines are good. Overall we had a great vacation.

Me and my boyfriend stayed at this Hotel for 2 weeks from Nov. 30 to Dec. 14 2008. It was our first time to Riviera Maya. Grounds and rooms : WOW!! BEAUTIFUL!! the place is huge so lots of walking. We were told that they had shuttles behind the hotel buildings 2 days before leaving but we loved the walking helped melt the calories we ate. The pools and grounds very clean but got to say that the pools were a little cold, I guess it's because we were so hot. Not all the jucuzzis were working in the pools, that disappointed me a little. The second week we were there, there was missing lots of water in the party pool, the water level was even below the jucuzzi jets so they closed the jets. When we left they still hadn't filled the pool. It didn't bother us but the water level was getting lower then the holes that filtered the water so I presume if they didn't do something soon the water would become very dirty. The rooms were also very clean a very nice but our shower DID leak but it didn't bother us. We would just put towels on the floor before taking it. We were in the basic junior suite with bath and king size bed. Watch out when activating the jets in the bath, when we did our bath became brown because the jets weren't cleaned. We activated the jets several times during our stay to try and clean the pipes out but our bath would still become brown. But a nother couple we met never had that problem. Will post pictures soon, you'll understand. WATCHOUT : When the floors get wet they are VERY slippery , the first night we got there I slipped and fell !! Marble floors are very nice but not very practical. Service : Overall we had good service. First night we got there they had put us in a room with 2 beds even after I made 2 requests for a King size bed before leaving. But they can't guarantee all your demands which I totally understand. They told me they would put us on a waiting list for a King size bed and to come back the next day at 11 am at the reception to see if we would have a room. The next day they had our King size bedroom ready with a bath ( we weren't originally suposed to have a bath) so we were very happy. The maid service was ok. We would leave her 2 dollars daily, one day we forgot and she just gave us 2 towels instead of our usual 4. The fridge was always full. We broke a glass in our room one night I called reception and they were there within 5 minutes. We lost the remote control also..we think the maid left with it since we had put it on the bed... they brought us a new one within an hour. The food service was so so but it wasn't really there fault. Lack of staff in the buffet , they try to do there best but we were rarely asked if we wanted anything to drink and 4 times they cleared our table when we were getting second helpings. They would take our drinks and everything .... we didn't appreciate that so you have no choice to leave something on the table to indicate you were coming back which i hated cause i was scared to get it robed not only by the workers but other travelers too. The bar tenders are great and give 2 thumbs up to them cause they are lacking lots of staff but they are very quick and do there best !! FOOD : It was good but was pretty much the same thing everyday so after our 6th day we were pretty sick of it. The best part was breakfest yum yum. But the food is not hot at all just warm because they heat the food with heating lamps and i love my food HOT !! But I new this before going so i wasn't expecting much. The A La Carte resturants were pretty good and the food was hot . The Mexican was the BEST !! I only ate ice cream for dessert since they would put there dessert on ice, the ice was higher then the dessert plates so when the ice melts full of water would get in the dessert plates yuk !!!! But i didn't mind I rather ice cream anyways :P ENTERTAINMENT : I didn't participate in any activites but the entertainment staff seemed to be pretty great and would play lots of games. I loved watching them go. The nightly shows in the central area were ok. Only lasted 15 min. but they did a pretty good job. I didn't go to any theater shows or the Disco. the only thing that they could change is that they have the same shows every week. They should have a 2 week schedule for those who are there for 2 weeks. We were stuck watching the same show twice. OVERALL : They offer a free shuttle for playa de carmen, you have to reserve the night before behind the lobby bar riviera side . It opens at 8 so first there first served !! We had no problems with our safe we never got robed. This hotel is good but needs improving, i wouldn't say it's a 5 star, more a 4. People who have already booked to this hotel but haven't gone yet, don't worry you will have a wonderful time.

The pools are large and you have your choice of salt water or chlorinated. The beach is great, nice for walking, can go for miles in either direction. The buffet food was good, but, the tendency was that they would have the same dishes day after day, with little variety. The other thing that could be better, was that there was far to few of staff that worked the buffets, which left you wanting for common things like silverware, water and even a coffee in the morning. The specialty restaurants, now, had enough staff, and service was much better, but you could only book them for that day or the next day, even though you had 4 specialty restaurant choices per week, you would have to go twice in a week to book, and stand in long lines every morning at 8:30 am. to try to secure your limes.Instead of booking them all at once. The entertainment in the theatre was sub-par, but the bands and acts in the square were much better. The only other thing that could be better, is, to have more activities for kids, because, for they were under foot everywhere, even sitting on the bartops with all adults drinking and caring on.

I regret now that I discounted many comments because of what I perceived as bad attitude, pickiness and poor communication. I also felt in many reviews there were unreasonable expectations for a brand new Mexican resort in a 'developing' tourist area. I've included some tips if you do decide to ignore the bad reviews like we did (still regretting it) and go anyhow. Top excursions to do: Xel-Ha Coba Tulum Flight: Air Canada Flight was on-time, bus was waiting to take us to the hotel and a very kind and friendly AirCan rep hosted us and bought beer for the bus ride. So far, so good! Check-in: We booked Platinum and so proceeded to the end of the counter which was empty and were promptly given two flutes of bubbly and a quick check in. The attendant took my printout of the return flight, which I had to acquire from the desk a few days later as it was the only paper that had the time/details of our return flight! Asked for beachfront, but was told they were unavailable. Offered money, still unavailable. They handout a photocopy map of the resort which was a little difficult to read, so read the back carefully, it gives the hours of the buffets and restaurants. Prepare to explore to find what you need. Service: Even when greasing palms with cash, we were not impressed with the service. Most staff, with the exception of a few good ones, were disinterested and did as little as possible. We left tips in the restaurant on occasion when the service was good - or should i say, when we got service? International Restaurant service was our only really good experience with service. We left a hefty tip to reinforce that behaviour! In the Buffet, it was difficult at times to get a drink served with the meal. At times we felt a little invisible. We are not loud or demanding and so seemed to fly under the radar a lot of the time. This is not a 5 star resort it is a 3.5 star at best. If you like the luxury of personal service, quality architecture (yes, some of us really appreciate well designed and built spaces) this is not the place for you. Grounds: Very nice, the gardens are pleasant, and need a few years to mature at which point i think it will be quite beautiful. The resort is very large but the walk only took about 8 minutes end to end and was nice to stroll after dinner. There is a shuttle from one end to the other and we only ever waited a maximum of 8 minutes. You can afford to wait, you are on holidays. Room: Here's where it starts to get ugly. We were in the Platinum Suite as mentioned and on first pass, all appeared quite nice. The finishes used were appealing, with polished limestone floors and modern minimal decor. As nice as it looked - it wasn't *clean*. This is the big problem we had with the resort. We left 5 USD the first day for the maid and 5 USD for the barman. Upon returning to the room about 3.30 in the afternoon the surfaces and tubs had not been cleaned at all. No cute little animals, no nightly turndown, nothing...It was then that we also noticed the SMELL. Every day in the mid afternoon and again in the evening an awful sewage smell emerged from the shower. Running the shower seemed to help, and opening the front door and the sliding door created a draft which also helped to clear it out. And yes, the shower leaked. Close the door, put the provided mat down and that will be fine. We also found that we would return to get ready for dinner and find we had no towels! this happened the last 4 nights of our vacation, and the maid came around 9 pm each night asking if we needed towels. We used beach towels in the interim. After the second night a few itchy bug bites developed on my feet. My husband figured there was the odd mosquito around, and they tend to like me to start with so no big deal. By the fourth night, i could no longer sleep - i kept waking up with terrible itching on my feet and ankles. My husband had no problem and still thought it was me reacting to Mexico Mosquito. I started (not)sleeping on top of all the covers...By the 6th day, my husband got in the shower and I found bedbugs on him. I started developing itchy/blistery spots on my legs. We spoke to the concierge, and reception, who took our room number and did absolutely nothing about it. They just couldn't understand the word 'bedbugs'. A trip to the Dr. upon our return and not only were there bedbugs, but SCABIES. Disgusting. What should have been a very good, quiet holiday in a very nice spot was completely ruined with the lack of cleanliness at the resort. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't sit on the furniture and I could not wait to come home. Such a shame. Now after reviewing again it appears to me that certain rooms are more problematic than others, however knowing what I know now about the spread of SCABIES and BEDBUGS it will not be long before all the beds in Platinum are infested (through linens and towels). There really are so many hotels along this area, I would suggest that you try another hotel which has better reviews. Better to spend a little more and sleep comfortably and in cleanliness, than take a chance at Princess.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cService was nonexistent!\u201d", "Author": "FrequentTraveller508", "ReviewID": "UR22790997", "Content": "Okay, so I'm a frequent traveller, mostly to all inclusive, Caribbean destinations. I used to work for a cruise line, so not only have a lived abroad, I have also provided service for other travellers. That being said I would not recommend this hotel to others due to the poor service. It had the potential to be amazing, but like other reviewers have said, it fell quite short from average. I travelled via Air Canada Vacations, from Toronto to Cancun. I left on Nov 12 and returned Nov 19th. My boyfriend and I purchased the Platinum package which claimed to offer the following which I\u2019ll briefly give you the facts on... you can decide how you would like to take it from there... *In room Premium Bar-there were 4 small bottles, mickeys, of rum, vodka, whiskey and gin sitting on the desk. The whiskey was half full, therefore opened by a previous guest or maid. In comparing to the RIU Hotel, the in room \u201cpremium bar\u201d consisted of 4-26oz bottles of liquor, in a proper liquor dispenser. *Mini Bar-yes, there was a mini bar, but it consisted of 2 bottles of water (which was plenty), 2 canned beers and 2 sodas. The beer was no name domestic, not corona, like other hotels have offered. *Private pool with butler service-we spent 3 days or so at the platinum pool, which was really nice. It was smaller, but not crowded by any means. The loungers were amazing, and probably the highlight of my trip. HOWEVER, I saw the \u201cbutler\u201d once on his way to deliver drinks as we arrived and he never returned to the pool area again. There was a small bar in each Platinum Lounge which was nice, but again the service was nonexistent. I remember one afternoon I went into the lounge to get some water and the bar tender was on the other side of the lounge on the phone. She saw me come up to the bar and so I waited. I wasn\u2019t in a hurry and thought she may be on the phone with another guest or someone, so I waited patiently, still looking her way occasionally to let her know I was still there. It was about 5minutes or so before I took it upon myself to go behind the bar to grab a bottle of water, which was within reach, and you should have SEEN how fast she hung up the phone and ran over to ask if I needed help. It was quite funny actually because by this point in the vacation I expected no less. *Nightly turn down service-did not happen each night, but that wasn\u2019t a huge concern to me. HOWEVER, I thought I would share this little tip with you...LOCK YOUR DOOR at all times! My boyfriend and I decided to have a bit of a lie in one morning until about 9:30am. We heard a knock at the door and before we could even get out of bed 2 maids unlocked the door and walked straight in! Now as you could imagine, they got quite the show as I ducked beside the bed and my boyfriend attempted to cover up! The maids left the room and we heard them laughing behind the door. We thought it was funny, but again, I highly doubt most people would be impressed with their lack of timing. (FYI, I tipped daily, even after this special encounter). *1 special dinner with Live music-this was a pathetic attempt to make the platinum guests feel special. This dinner was the exact same buffet as every other night, except they offered mussels and crab. My boyfriend tried the crab and said it was like paste (and he eats anything)! The crabs were quite small, so I didn\u2019t see how it was possible to get any decent meat out of them regardless. The live music was 2 guys standing against the wall with an electric guitar and organ. It would have been so much better if they had a mariachi band playing and/or walking around...that\u2019s what people want to hear and see, a bit of culture when they visit a place like Mexico, not a 2 man cover band! *Which leads me to my comments on Entertainment...I have an entertainment back ground so there is a VERY good chance I\u2019m being too harsh, HOWEVER, the entertainment was horrible! I watched one show and stayed until the end only because I was in the front row and didn\u2019t want to be rude by leaving early. Basically the entertainment consisted of people lip syncing songs. The dancing was horrible and the costumes were below average. Also, as another reviewer commented, the entertainment by the lobby bar was over each night by 10pm and half the bar closed by this time as well. We didn\u2019t eat until 8pm every night so by the time we were finished, so was the entertainment. The \u201cdisco\u201d was not our scene, so basically we had two choices, wait in line for 20+minutes and hope the bar tender knew who was in line next AND know how to make a drink without guessing or checking a manual behind the bar OR go back to our room...guess which option we chose most nights. *Tours/Day trips-My boyfriend and I decided to book a day trip and thought about going to Cozumel. Once we spoke to one of the tour operators in the lobby, we were excited to do a Zip Lining adventure instead. The tour operator explained in detail what our day trip was to include, which was not the case when we arrived the next day at our destination. In fact, the tour guide, Miguel, explained to us that this happens often, that the tour operator will embellish or describe 2 or more trips combined as one to sell you on a purchase...which in this particular case was true. I had done the things that were promised on this trip before and luckily my boyfriend is laid back, but you could imagine how disappointed some people were when they found out that they weren\u2019t going to get to ride a jeep through the jungle and see monkeys, etc. So this was a HUGE downfall that people should be aware of. *Concierge Service-this was a huge joke. The front desk and concierge were no help to anyone. I\u2019m so glad we booked Platinum because the Platinum concierge was amazing! They helped you out in every way possible, so I was quite impressed. The front lobby and concierge were just like the other reviewer had said... awful! When we couldn\u2019t locate our Air Canada Rep at the front lobby, we asked everyone and anyone and received NO HELP OR DIRECTION! They just shrugged their shoulders and continued on reading or looking at their computer. When we actually located our rep the next day, we found out the all the information we needed was in a binder outside the concierge desk the whole time! I couldn\u2019t believe how ridiculous and ill-trained the staff was! For this reason, I will never return to this hotel or Princess Resorts again. *Food-the food was AMAZING! Especially MISO restaurant...we went there twice for the Teppanyaki. I was quite impressed. The buffets were good as well, lots of choices, but the service was nonexistent there as well. Overall, the resort and grounds were nice and clean. The rooms were nice but had little centipede like worms on the floor and the shower DID leak into the toilet area, but these issues didn\u2019t ruin my vacation. The pools and bars were nice and I must say GOING PLATINUM IS A MUST if you do decide to go to this resort. Perhaps in the future this resort will become more adequately staffed and trained but I know I will not risk the $$ to see if things change. I have to say, if the service was better this vacation could have been amazing...but like many people know, it\u2019s the service that makes or breaks a vacation and in this case it BROKE!

We just returned last night from a 7 day stay, Dec 6-13th. There were 3 of us, 2 separate rooms staying in the Platinum Category. We flew with Conquest Vacations/Canjet from Vancouver. The flight was fine, no issues, on time. We arrived at the airport in Cancun where we were shown to our bus which took us to the resort. We showed up at the hotel around 8 pm. Check in was easy at the Platinum Check-In desk, where we received our room cards etc and were on our way (drink in hand) on the golf cart within a few minutes. We arrived to our room in Platinum 5 with an ocean view. The rooms are beautifully appointed and a jacuzzi tub was on the balcony as well as in the bathroom. The marble rain shower is cool, unlike others our shower DID NOT leak out to the floor. Even if it did though, it would HARDLY ruin my vacation. The rooms are stocked with water, pop, beer, rum, tequila, whiskey, and vodka. (The whiskey isn't the greatest, it's not even as good as cheap Alberta rye) There are plenty of towels and other little amenities you can use. One thing they could improve on is more drawer space and more hangers for clothing as there are only a few hangers and 2 shelves for clothes. The pools and landscaping/grounds are amazing. They really work hard to keep them up. The platinum pool was a wee bit colder than the main pool, but a nice feeling after the hot sun. The main pool was a lot of fun, especially the swim up bar. The characters that carouse around there are a lot of fun.. yes, we were the \"drunk Canadians\" as one other poster mentioned. What do you expect? Free booze! The beds/cabanas around the Platinum pool are great especially for an afternoon siesta or reading your book. The beach was beautiful with a nice breeze. Bring your water shoes to go out in.. it's not THAT bad but it does drop off a bit. The water is typical Caribbean and nice and warm. You can walk around on the sand in bare feet no problem on the beach. They need more servers as when you are lying on your lounger it's hard to get up for a drink! The food: I found the buffets had plenty of selection. I am a picky eater but could still find things I could have. The breakfasts have lots of fresh fruit which is great and the lunch and dinners were full of different items. If you are an adventurous eater you will find lots of things to try. Also, in the Platinum Lounge, they have different snacks in there like tortillas and fresh salsa, cheeses, mussels (which apparently were great) and little sandwiches/pastries. The a la' carte restaurants we went to were the Japanese, International, Italian, and Fondue. Miso- (Japanese) The first night we went was for the Teppanyaki. That was AMAZING and AWESOME food. I thought it was better than a popular one we have here in Vancouver. The experience AND the food were great. I had the filet mignon and it was wonderful. We visited Miso again a few nights later for their sit down menu, which was horrible. My boyfriend enjoyed the sushi and sashimi but the whole experience was different. The first waiter we had wasn't accomodating to our request and then Miguel (our waiter from a few nights previous) came by and everything was \"no problem\". It all depends in who you get. Anyway, I ordered the beef and it was just a plate of beef with a few veg thrown in. That's it. No rice or anything. I had to ask for some just to offset the beef which was really disgusting in taste and texture. Italian: (Mama Mia) I had the lasagna bolognese and it was fantastic. My boyfriend had the veal scallopini and he said it was so-so. International: (La-Fleur) Ok, so the stuff on this menu really turned me off but it turned out to be a great experience. I passed on the appetizers and soups (looked gross to me, it was things like foie gras which I don't agree with, force feeding ducks just to eat your delicacy is wrong) but I had an AMAZING cut of filet mignon beef served with a chocolate souffle. That pairing of tastes was exceptional. My friend had the Lamb which she said was the best lamb she's ever had. They had ostrich on the menu as well. Las Olas: (Fondue) This was my favorite. We shared a combo of chicken, beef, salmon, and shrimp. The meat was already cooked so you were dipping the meat and veg into the cheese. There were lots of other sauces to choose from as well.. a neat experience overall. The dessert was fruit with a chocolate fondue to dip as well. I can't comment on the Mexican or Grill as we did not go there but I heard that the Steakhouse doesn't have steak..lol. Entertainment: Like other posters have mentioned, there needs to be more MUSIC. It was really quiet and almost bizarre at times not having music, especially around the swim up bars. They had music in the platinum lounge (inside) but it was like the same song for hours (techno type music). They had a great band in the main bar every night. Lots of people dancing and having fun in there. The disco was the only place to go after 11 pm ( I'm not into that kind of \"scene\" but we hung out just outside of there and would go in to get drinks.) We met lots of cool people from all over the place. The sports bar has nachos, hot dogs/burgers, fries etc that is open 24 hours for those that want to catch a game or play pool. We saw 2 of the shows and they were tacky, but they all are. Nothing different there. The animation staff looked like they were trying hard to entertain people. In general, the resort is beautiful but I will say this: They COULD be well on their way to being a 5 * property but they need another year or two to get their staffing issues worked out and a few small kinks. I'll explain this in my next part of the review which were the mildly negative parts. If you have an open mind you could well imagine how many people it takes to run a place of this size and calibre. It's HUGE. There are sometimes 1800 guests here so you can imagine what kind of staff it takes to run something like that. There is so much that goes on behind the scenes it's incredible. I would be really curious to see what it's like in a year or two down the road. Excursions: We spent 2 days off the resort. We went to Playa del Carmen for shopping ($15 cab ride) and that was fun. It was the typical mexican junk mixed in with some cool restaurants/bars and some higher end shops. The best part of our trip was going to Xel-Ha. It is the largest natural aquarium in the world and you can spend the whole day there discovering all these neat things underwater and out. I can't even begin to describe it so google it or youtube it and see for yourself. It's amazing. Now for the bad: There were some minor service and security issues with the housekeeping staff. I was tipping our maid $5 or 50 pesos per day. That is a lot on their meager wages. I would write her little notes in espanol explaining if I would like anything and thanking her, etc. Nothing major, just a couple more diet cokes in the fridge, that kind of thing. The first day or two were good, she made us some small towel art (a bunny) and the room was clean. The next day it was sort of clean and no towel art. The third day I got a dinosaur and at night the bed was turned down with chocolates on it. The 4th day, there was nothing. Also what was missing were my favorite pair of pants. This was also the same time I discovered my prescription medication was missing approximately half the bottle. There were over 15 pills in there and I had only 3 left. This was especially interesting since I hadn't taken ANY since I got there. I brought them in case I needed them. I have another theory on this too, so if this person is reading this (she'll know who she is, she's from Brantford Ontario) I really don't appreciate you stealing from me if it was you. My friend upstairs who had issues the opposite way around (right at the beginning), she was tipping a good amount and had nothing. She then spoke directly to her maid and after that she had multiple swans, ladies, flowers lining her pillows, etc. It was unreal! Now I did not go there for the towel art, but it would have been nice to get some kind of decent service with the amount I was leaving them each day. There was a digital safe in the room which only a \"special manager\" could have access to if you forgot your code. That is a bunch of BS. There were issues at one point last year of people pulling back the stickers and they could get in, but they have since installed metal plates behind that so it's not accessible from that way. On our 5th night after having a sticky door lock all week, we finally couldn't get in our room at all. They had to climb up over the balcony on the other side to get in, then 1.5 hours later the lock was changed. This made me feel uneasy as we had to watch them like hawks when they were changing our door. We went and talked to the \"concierge\" downstairs about it, and he seemed genuinely concerned. He said all of my concerns would be taken care of regarding housekeeping etc and my things would be replenished. Upon returning from dinner, the sticker on the safe was ripped up and nothing was done. Weird. Keep your stuff on close watch as you never know what they will do from day to day. We then went and spoke to the \"manager\" who said he would have a meeting the next day about this, but I knew that was a joke and there was nothing done with his \"investigation\". The other small issue was that there were tons of kids. They really didn't bother me that much, but I kept thinking to myself how NOT relaxing it must be to go on vacation with small children. There were lots of couples with babies and some were even breastfeeding at the table. Some people were highly annoyed by the yelling kids and some could just block it out. To be fair, I found most of the kids were good.. the parents that didn't make an effort to shut your kids up if they were acting out is a whole other story. I am also not impressed with Conquest's/Canjet's representatives at the Cancun airport. They charged us 7kg over the luggage limit ($20 per kg) I'm sorry but I don't think that a couple of towels and a pair of paper thin flip flops weigh 15.5 pounds. That was a scam to get more cash as the plane wasn't even full either. It was $140 extra in total for our bags. Ridiculous. Also, we had to go to Texas for fuel which I thought was odd at first so it became a very long journey. Quite the opposite of the way down there! I know this was long, but that is my comprehensive review of this resort. I have travelled extensively and have been to Puerto Vallarta/Nuevo Vallarta numerous times so I had something Mexican to compare it to. The beaches and scenery were definitely amazing and I would go back to the Mayan Riviera again. If you have any questions or comments, don't hesitate to email me!

(I'm an I.A. with a large brokerage firm in Canada). I'm in my early 50's and my wife in her mid 40's. We had booked a Platinum suite . We like the Riviera Maya because its relatively close, the properties are new and clean, the Mayas are very nice and gentle, the food is adequate and the weather is quite good. We have been to 6-7 resorts so far. The Princess Grand Riviera Maya has the potential to be a GREAT resort, but a few things are missing. To start with, people at the reception have this ''I don't care'' attitude. We had requested a king size bed when making our reservation and we had double beds. The clerk was a young lady who didn't seem to know how to handle the problem and got her supervisor involved. Moyses, the person in question acknowledged that we had requested a king size bed but her ''reminded'' us that is was a ''request'' and that it didn't guarantee that we would be granted. He gave us lip service and went through the motions but basically did nothing to help us. In the end, he gave us a sense that he didn't give a hoot...! So much for Platinum.... The resort is very large but they have a shuttle service for Platinum which is very handy and works well. The grounds are very nice, well maintained but they lack many decorative elements. We spoke with many other guests who had the same impressions as us. The same applies to the decoration inside the various buildings of the resort. They lacked many decorative elements. With them, this resort would be quite something to look at. The Iberostars Lindo, Maya are in the same category and have more of those individual or group decorative items that make you go ''WOW!'. The rooms are very nice, comfortable, lots of space, not noisy, and well supplied. Room maintenance was inconsistent even though we left a tip to the cleaning lady every day. The Platinum service is unequal. Teresa was a pearl. She always had a smile on her face and would greet us every morning at the lounge. The AC unit in our room was noisy and she managed to have the problem fixed within the next hour (we had asked someone else 24 hours before and we were told we were on a waiting list (so much for Platinum...). The food and drink at the Platinum lounge was of good quality and Colli the bartender was very nice and ready to help with coffee, drinks, ice and food. The specialty restaurants were ok, nothing great. The found the Asian the best. The buffets were ok by Riviera Maya standards. The beach is relatively narrow and gets crowded by 9:30h. We had the Platinum service so that there was always a couple chairs with a parasol available but on the ''regular'' beach, parasols were a scarce commodity. One very annoying thing was the rocks in the ocean. The water doesn't get very deep so that you have to walk quite a bit until you get to a depth of 3-4 feet. The oceanfloor is littered with rocks. Tread carefully and watch where you put your foot... Pretty annoying for a so called 5 star resort...During low season, they could get a group of employees with some equiment and get rid of those rocks. I went scuba diving and had a great experience with their diving team on the afternoon dive. I dive 2-3 times/year so I'm not looking for the 90-100' dives, having to check my tables and having to worry about decrompression. The 40-60' dives are fine. Mo the instructor was very nice, took us on quite a tour at Cerebro on Dec 12 for the afternoon dive (the am dives are for the experienced and 'deeper' dives; the pm dives are for beginners and relaxed dives). We saw 2 sea turtles, 3 green morays, a great variety and quantity of various tropical fish in a very nice setting. Thanks again guys..! All in all, the Princess is an honest 4* resort and priced accordingly. We prefer the Iberostar for about the same price because of their decorative elements and somewhat better service and care for details. The Paradisus will offer you a nicer and more compact resort, with nicer grounds and buildings and much better service. Finally for those who wish to be pampered, try the Excellence with Concierge. These guys know how to please... Too bad because the Princess is a very nice resort with a lot of potential. Not much is missing to make it great. We wouldn't go back because we never go twice to the same resort but also because we have found out that for the same category there are better alternatives.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florence sc", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation\u201d", "Author": "levyr", "ReviewID": "UR22674049", "Content": "Just to warn everyone driving up to the hotel the service road is under construction, which scared my hunband but he was well pleased once we arrived at the resort. We are a married couple 38 years old we were there from nov 22-28 and had the best time. We stayed in a swim out room 6079 which for us was the best in a great location pretty much in the center of the resort. The room was beautiful and we loved that we could walk out of our room cross our pool and be at the party pool. Manuel and Sergio at the pool bar are the best and we met so many nice people. We ate breakfast and lunch mostly at the buffet near the beach since it was so close, the food was good a lot to choose from. We did also make reservations for Italian I thought it was ok but my husband said his was great. Japanese we only had susi which was very good. I do recommend taking the ferry to Cozmel you can get much better bargains there then in Playa. We also did the jungle jims atv tour which was fun, we can't wait to go back next year to do other excursions and yes we want the same room. We did find out that the riviera side for us was better than the sunset side since in the afternoons the sun was only shining on our side so the sunset people with swim out rooms could not enjoy their loungers. We went to the beach a few times it is very rocky as others have said, but we were happy just hanging out with our new friends at the party pool. The animation group does all kinds of fun activities if you want to join in. The pool water was a little cool but what do you expect it is the end of Nov drink enough and it will not bother you. Check in was no problem even though the driver dropped us off at the wrong lobby the man had no problem checking us in and then had our bags to our room. Towels took us a little time to find but it is the 2nd hut as you walk towards the beach. We did not mind walking that way we found out the layout and where we wanted to be.

We chose this location on advice from our travel agent. The purpose of this trip was for our wedding. Over all or trip was AMAZING but it had NOTHING to do with the GRP. What was amazing was the time we got to spend with our friends and family as well as our wedding day. We had 38 guests along with us for this trip. Unfortunately the GRP left us lots to be desired! Our Travel background is quite extensive. We have been to Mexico five times, the Dominican once, and Cuba once, plus Hawaii too many times to count. As well as cruises, Florida, California, Las Vegas and many more places. We have stayed at everything from truck stop 2* to 5* spa resorts. We are extremely easy going and are hard pressed to find any bad thing to say about any vacation we have been on EVER!!! Till Now!!! I am 26 and my husband is 31. We travel any chance we get we love it. GRP check in with 40 people in our group was very interesting. Before the trip the only request that we phoned in was that our parents had an adjoining room with our sister so they could watch her three kids. That never happened! They were rude and unwilling to accommodate us with the request. Fortunately for us a couple of us ended up with rooms that adjoin so we all just switched rooms. My uncle and a family friend (who were not a couple) decided to get a room together and it was requested that they have separate beds. This did not happen they got a room with one king. So they ended up having to get a cot because the rooms were all booked. This \u201cCot\u201d was absolutely disgusting and my uncle had to sleep on it the whole trip. Once the rooms were all sorted out we though things were going to be good but boy where we wrong. Platinum rooms \u2013 Look nice for five minuets till you actually look at them. The sheets never fit the beds so be prepared to sleep on mattress pads; the walls were dirty and cracked. The patio doors were broken. The TV had a crazy malfunction that caused it to turn on every couple hours so it had to be left unplugged. There are no dressers so you literally had to live out of your suitcase. Yes the floor did tilt the wrong way in the shower so you had to put a towel on the floor. The Millipedes were the worst part. I am a bug lover so they didn\u2019t bother me at first till you woke up in the middle of the night and stepped all over them when you had to go to the washroom. It was so nasty, bug guts all over your floor and feet. You had to keep a towel under the door to prevent them from getting in. And a towel by the bed to wipe your feet every time you got back in to bed. Theft \u2013 We new that theft is rampant in Mexico (other places in the world too) so we are always cautious with leaving anything of value out. Unfortunately you can only be so careful and something still ends up going missing. On the second morning after a nice walk we forgot to put our I-pod back in the safe and it was gone when we came back from a day at Playa. I was upset but what ever it is our fault for not remembering to put it away. But it gets worse. The day of our wedding (I will touch on this later) I gifted my sisters with Diamond necklaces as a thank you for being part of our wedding. My sister had taken her own Diamond necklace off to ware my gift and forgot to put it in her safe before we ran down the aisle. By the time she remembered what she had done and ran back to the room it was already gone (this LITTERALY was only a matter of 4 hours) So that really sucked for her, who was on her very first vacation out of the country EVER. I doubt she will ever go back to Mexico. The Wedding \u2013 I am going to start with the good. It was the most AMAZING day of my life EVER!!! The food was exactly what I requested; the flowers were pretty (though not at all what I ordered, but they got the color right) DJ was awesome, and the wedding planner was SUPER!!! OK now for the bad\u2026 The photographer showed up two minuets after the wedding was supposed to start. He was supposed to be their 30 min before and take pictures of us getting ready. So the wedding ended up being delayed by 15-20 minuets so that he could set up. I have to say he was really good at what he does so that was nice. I paid the extra $300.00US to have ALL of the pictures taken burned on to a CD so that I could choose what I wanted. Unfortunately he went through and deleted the ones he didn\u2019t like or that he thought looked bad so I didn\u2019t get much choice of what I wanted to take. As the wedding couple that chose that resort and brought 38 people you would think you would get some sort of perk or gift or something\u2026 NOTHING. Nothing at all, but bad service is all we got. There is so much more about the wedding stuff I want to warn people about but there is not enough space to write everything. If you have any questions just message me I will be happy to answer. Food \u2013 I am a food freak I love to try different things and am always the first to be at the buffet or to order. Probably because I love to cook. I have to say the food was bland and boring. When they advertise something different every day at the buffet they are LYING. Only one or two items change EVERYTHING else is the same!!! The warmers in their buffet Suck so everything is warm so by the time you get to your table it is cold due to the extreme air conditioning. I have never had such terrible food at an all inclusive resort before. Service \u2013 Everything from housekeeping, room service, and front desk, to the bartenders and servers was very poor. Now when I say this I mean on a rating of star quality they are a 2-3 star type service not a five at all. We stayed in a different 5* for our honeymoon right after the GRP and read my review for that it was a five star no questions asked!!! The staff at the GRP needs a tone of more training to meet a five star quality. Everyone was always so crabby and always acted put out to do anything!! How are you suppose to get a drink from the bar when you are being treated poorly even if you are super polite and tip huge they still seem irritated. Don\u2019t bother requesting extra services you won't get them not even if you offer to pay it is really bad. Massages \u2013 The ones on the beach are to die for. It is so worth going and you can haggle the price too. Trolley system - Sucks so you may as well just walk. Yes the resort is huge and it takes 10-15 minutes just to walk from one end to the other if you are walking fast and don\u2019t stop. They have one trolley running once in awhile it is a major hit and miss, mostly miss. Plus it is run by battery so we saw people out pushing mor than riding. Construction \u2013 Yes lots so be prepared and it wont bug you. Just make sure you are prepared because it is EVERY WHERE and they start very early in the morning to very late at night. Shows - Were poor quality and most of the people in them were your local maid or bartender so it is obvious they don\u2019t practice much. It is fun for one night but that is it just doesn\u2019t expect much. Disco \u2013 What disco it sucked so bad I was embarrassed for them. It consists of a little room with a tiny dance floor and ONE bartender. Plus the same prerecorded CD every night so NO REQUESTS! The resort grounds - this is the only part where there is nothing bad to say it truly is really nice. They keep everything so neat and tidy. But now I know why the inside of the rooms are put together so poorly because they spent their budget on the actual grounds of the resort and not the amenitys. The Saturday Night Market \u2013 CAUTION!!!! Do not buy anything from this market it is a JOKE. The one stand tried to hustle $60.00US out of my grandpa. I was so pissed they are such scam artist and they pray on the ones that don\u2019t know better. Get this when I tried to haggle he told me to \u201cget out of here you cheepie\u201d BRUTAL!!! I bought my grandpa the exact wallet for $8.00US YES $8.00US at Playa Del Carmen the very next day!!!! Check Out \u2013 This has to be the worst day of the whole trip. We had just packed up our room and we were heading to the front desk. The platinum bellboys took our luggage and told us it would be waiting up front for us. We went up with two hours to spare before our bus leaves to our next resort. We checked out and then went to grab our luggage. Our Luggage was nowhere to be found. They searched high and low and they kept saying they didn\u2019t have our luggage and that I must have lost it. We were so stressed EVERYTHING we had was in our bags including my wedding photos. Two hours later and still no luggage our bus had to leave. So the bellboy says just go and we will send you your luggage \u201cif\u201d we find it. As if. We stayed another hour and finally out of know where they bring our luggage here you go they said. We asked if they were going to cover our taxi for the wait and us missing our bus and all of a sudden I am not kidding they played the \"no speak English\" card. I was so sad and tired. So we called our own cab and paid the $60.00 to get to the next resort. The GRP is the WORST place I have ever stayed EVER!!! Once we left the GRP that is when the BEST TRIP of our entire lives really got good. Thank god for honeymoons LOL Read our review about the Riu Palace Las Americas. It was a true 5* I would actually say it is a 10* it was absolutely breathe taking!! And the service was the best you could ever get.

The hotel is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen: architecture, decoration (modern oriental, lots of marble and wood), landscaping. BUT..... ROOMS: poor sound-proofing, we hear everything in the next room, especially with connecting doors, the interior courtyards reverberate even normal sounds in the hallways. the rooms are cleaned properly, no plumbing problems. Tip the chambermaid and lock your valuables in the free safe. BEACH: very rocky, you need beach shoes. They say that it's a natural reservation area and that is why they do not remove the rocks and put only sand... but they rent jet-skis...not very natural! No toilets near the beach (not very practical with kids), and only one bar with a line-up. Lots of chairs, no problem there for us. FOOD: buffets very ordinary, the staff practices the three R's: reheat, recycle and re-serve the food! Very difficult to be served wine , not much service from most of the waiters (some exceptions...)The a la carte reataurants were much better, but what a hassle to make reservations:line up every day or every other day, because they don't allow more than 2 days in advance to book! POOLS: beautiful but cold, noisy people at the pool bar. There is a lot of marble everywhere and it can become slippery. No Mexican music (except in Mexican restaurant). It would have helped for the ambiance... I heard Celine Dion in the hotel shop...Thank you, I can hear hear at home! Yes there were lots of Quebecois , low-class with bellies and fake-***** . I am from Quebec and I was ashamed sometimes! There were also quite a few very noisy English-speaking customers and they disturbed us even late at night. Some were hogging one pool bar and making fools of themselves. The staff tries to be helpful, not always very smiley. When we try speaking Spanish, they appreciate our effort and it breaks the ice, I would not go back there, it was no a good value for the money. I had a much better experience at the Grand Bahia Principe in Punta Cana for about the same price. We tried something else this fall because of the malaria in the Dom.Republic.

My husband and I just returned from a two week stay (Nov 18th \u2013 Dec 2nd) at the Grand Riviera Princess. This was our fourth stay at an AI resort in Mexico and third in the Mayan Riviera, and in our opinion; we feel it was the best so far! Just a bit about us as it may be helpful for some, my husband is 61 and I am 54. We are both retired, have no children, appreciate being able to travel a bit and feel fortunate that we have good health. We\u2019re pretty easy going people; enjoy a good drink or two, fine food, meeting new people and experiencing different cultures. We choose this property as it was quite new, large, and offers a lot of amenities, something for everyone. I spent a lot of time lurking around the forums, reading all of the reviews, viewing many gorgeous photos, gathering information, asking questions here and there and appreciate that people were so helpful. So a big \u201cTHANK YOU\u201d to you all \u2013 we had a fabulous time. I\u2019m so glad we joined TA before this trip. Please bear with me as this will be the first time I have written a review, hopefully it won\u2019t be too long. We flew out of Vancouver with Air Transat (club class) on the 1:00 am non stop flight to Cancun. Good flight with great service. We landed safe and sound at 8:30 am local time, retrieved our bags, cleared customs, pressed the button, got the green light and we were good to go! It was indeed a beautiful morning \u2013 that first blast of warm air was just what we needed. Transfer to the hotel was great, I think it took all of 30 mins and we were the first to be dropped off. A very friendly porter took our luggage and in we went. First impression upon entering \u2026 the open air lobby is stunning with a lovely view beyond. We had arrived in paradise. Off we went to the Platinum desk to check in and we met Edith who very kindly poured us a nice glass of chilled champagne and checked us in. Edith gave us a great map of the resort, highlighted a few things for us, flipped it over and showed us the general information. Edith placed our bracelets on us and asked if we had any questions. Our travel agent and I had both made a few requests prior to our arrival. I knew there would be no guarantees but wanted to discuss with Edith before accepting the key cards. We clearly had a language barrier which in hindsight was no big deal, but at the time, I was tired and excited so decided we would check back in a few hours while she worked on it. She had no record of my email so I left her with my copy. We decided to walk the resort to the Platinum section and scope things out along the way, and with a spicy bloody Caesar in one hand and map in the other, that\u2019s what we did. The grounds of the resort are truly beautiful with flowers, plants, palm trees, many fountains and statues everywhere. It was clear to us very quickly on our walk, that an incredible amount of hard work goes into maintaining this property. We were impressed to see all of the pools and buildings, the little bridges to cross over, and then the swim up bars, loungers and palapas everywhere. We reached the Platinum section in no time and decided to walk about inside and out just to see where the rooms were situated and what their views would be. Decided that the only floor we wouldn\u2019t care to be on would be the ground floor, not much privacy. Everything else looked great. Into the lounge (more on this later) we went, got something to drink and onto the beach. On the Riviera side there is a bridge access to the beach which comes out to the wedding gazebos and beyond, the gorgeous Caribbean. We headed south and were quickly met by the beach concierge, sweet Ale, in her beach cabana. Greeted with a lovely Hola, Ale explained she managed the Platinum section of the beach. This section is actually roped off; I mention it as there is no signage. The beach is the same, but loungers are reserved for Platinum & Laguna Villas guests. Ale will provide more towels to these guests and they are different in color (silver while others are blue). Truly a beautiful Mayan girl. The beach is lovely, that white sand between your toes and the various shades of aqua in the ocean, hmmmmmmm, loungers galore and plenty of palapas along with palm trees. The beach bar is located between the Riviera & Sunset sides, as is the other bridge access to and from the beach. This bridge also takes one to the showers as well as the washrooms, which by the way, were always, I mean always, clean. There were always at least two waitresses bringing people drinks on the beach. Further on is the massage hut right at the water\u2019s edge. Keep going south and you\u2019ll find the water sports center, hobies, kayaks, snorkel gear, etc. There\u2019s also parasailing and jet skis available for a fee. Keep going south and you\u2019ll see the Thai Beach Club, which is not included. There is a restaurant there as well, also not included. When they set up the Thai beach area in the morning it\u2019s really something to see. Black umbrellas with lime green beach beds and loungers, huge pillows, special towels, tables, etc. I had a camera malfunction; otherwise I would post a picture of it. In the two weeks we were there, I never saw a single person utilize this section nor do I know what is charged. We did not use our water shoes for our beach walks which we did daily, however, I did end up using mine for going into the water due to the rocks. Some areas are clearer than others, and I noticed most people didn\u2019t use any. All in all, I\u2019d say the beach was very nice and certainly a good size. It was just what we wanted. Unto our room \u2013 we were assigned 5202 \u2013 3rd floor (which is the top floor). Since we had scoped them out earlier, we knew this would suit us just fine. It was beautifully appointed and large. We actually paced it off and the room was roughly 700 sq feet and the balcony, well it was another 140 sq feet. This was the largest room we have yet to stay in. The d\u00e9cor was right up our alley, simple and crisp! Of course, I knew it would be after viewing everyone\u2019s photos. On the balcony we had a lovely view of the ocean off to the right and lots of privacy. It was very peaceful and quiet. The beautiful sounding birds woke us each morning. As we were on the top floor, we had a palapa styled roof on the balcony which was really nice. It would move with the breeze and make a lovely sound. On arrival for us, there was a welcome basket with fruit, nuts and sweets; a liter bottle each of gold tequila and whiskey; 200 ml each of bacardi, vodka and white tequila. Later in our stay we were also given two more half liters of gold tequila. We also received a gift packaged Mexican figurine. The robes and slippers were there for us to use along with a couple of beach towels and golf umbrella in case of rain. We did not however, receive a princess beach bag \u2013 boo hoo \u2013 I was sooooo disappointed - just kidding. The resort provides a lot of toiletries, and if you don\u2019t see any Kleenex \u2013 well it\u2019s in one of those boxes. Everything in our room worked great. We had taken a spare card to leave in the slot as everyone suggested. Nothing shut off when it was moved, I guess some are wired differently. I didn\u2019t recall reading anything about the hand held shower option and was delighted to find that we also had this as our shower water pressure wasn\u2019t that great. Anyways, it\u2019s a nice feature and we found that if we sprayed it towards the shower door then and only then, would any water leak out. Problem solved for us! The dead bolt door lock feature is nice as well. In our room there was a slight step up into the closet, be careful if you have this, as it could be a problem if you missed the step. Loved this room and the location. We both feel that this resort excels at service. From the moment we arrived until stepping onto the transfer bus 14 days later \u2013 10 out of 10 for us! The first week of our stay the resort was at full capacity and at 70% during the second week. No matter where we went, we were always greeted with a smile, an Hola, Buenos dias, buenas noches, etc. From the porter to the Platinum concierge, and all those in between, they were all happy to assist us. We honestly did not want for anything. It was so crowded the first week; I was amazed at how the staff handled it. Our room was made up and thoroughly cleaned every day (fresh linens each day and no end to towels). Mini bar restocked at all times even when we didn\u2019t request it. We ordered coffee from room service at 6 am each morning and it would arrive promptly and be served piping hot with an extra carafe of hot milk. The only issue with booking dinner reservations was that during our second week we couldn\u2019t decide which restaurants to repeat. We really enjoyed the food at the resort. I realize this is one of those things that is totally subjective; however, I have to believe there is something here for everyone and have to tell you that we were very impressed and pleasantly surprised on more than one occasion. So on a 1 \u2013 10 scale \u2013 here is our 20 pesos worth. Buffets \u2013 8 \u2013 we ate at the beach buffet on the Riviera side each morning for breakfast. Great selection and always fresh. It didn\u2019t take long til our server, Lorenzo, got to know us, what we needed if anything, another cappuccino perhaps. My husband would also go for a light lunch and really enjoyed the fish and salads. The main buffets up by the lobby were too large for my liking; we tried, but just not to my taste. Le Fleur \u2013 International \u2013 9 \u2013 we ate here twice and were really impressed. While the portions are small, if you try each course you will definitely be satisfied. The first time my husband ordered the steak as his main course (after an appy & soup) and wanted more, the waiter was happy to bring him a second main course of the lamb. The second time around we had the most amazing appy, I believe they called it fried egg with crunchy ham \u2013 it sat on a small bed of potato with some sort of sausage/bacon \u2013 whoa that was good. I cancelled the soup after that \u2013 too much of a good thing. Mama Mia \u2013 Italian \u2013 10 \u2013 we ate here twice and it was amazing both times. I remember very early in my lurking days, seeing a photo of the lasagna \u2013 WOW \u2013 outstanding. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the veal dish one evening and the lamb on another occasion. Prior to our main dishes we had both enjoyed the beef carpaccio very much as well as the seafood soup. Miso \u2013 Japanese \u2013 9 \u2013 we ate here twice, once at regular seating and the next at a cooking table. We enjoyed both (they each have separate menus) but the cooking table show is really fun and a real crowd pleaser. The meals were both excellent and plentiful. I would really recommend booking the cooking table (think it is called Tapanyaki), it\u2019s terrific. Las Olas \u2013 Seafood \u2013 ? - we had a communication problem at this one and unfortunately did not enjoy it. The waitress clearly did not understand our questions and tried to assist but it didn\u2019t work. Others were clearly enjoying theirs though. I found this restaurant incredibly noisy as well. It is located in half of the Sunset beach buffet. La Hacienda \u2013 Mexican \u2013 9 \u2013 this was one I was hesitant about however, no need to worry; it was great! The service was outstanding and the food was again, wonderful. I had some snapper that was prepared to perfection and served with some grilled veggies and tasty rice. My husband really enjoyed the lamb baked in corn leaves. Presentation was lovely and our waiter was the best. Vaqueria \u2013 Grill \u2013 10 \u2013 Oh my goodness \u2013 another outstanding restaurant. If you enjoy chicken try ordering the \u201cBaby Chicken on Back\u201d. It\u2019s cooked on an open rotisserie and is seasoned beautifully and was so moist. Husband enjoyed some more \u2026.. you guessed it, lamb, shoulder this time Fondue \u2013 Swiss \u2013 9 \u2013 located in half of the Sunset beach buffet and was another great treat and very plentiful. We had been told beforehand that it was a lot of food and to be sure and leave room for dessert so I skipped the salad and soup courses, but husband really enjoyed the crab salad and shrimp bisque. We shared a large platter of chicken, beef, salmon, shrimp and a selection of great vegetables. Platter was accompanied with a large pot of melting cheeses \u2013 very rich. Dessert \u2013 well I\u2019m glad I left some room \u2013 a beautiful pot of melted chocolate served with strawberries, cantelope, pineapple, marshmallow, oreo cookies, etc. Whoa \u2013 so very good! FYI - Going Platinum Originally, we had booked a swim up room and were really looking forward to it as we\u2019ve never stayed in one before. People were very helpful in giving me lots of information which I really appreciate. Some time passed, and I have to admit, I got cold feet, even thought of switching resorts a few times. I read everything, over analyzed like crazy, doubted my own instincts. We are beach people, love pools, but the Caribbean is what draws us to the MR. I checked with our travel agent and for us, the price difference for 2 weeks was very reasonable (don\u2019t mind telling you that the difference was less than $700 more) so we went for it and are certainly happy that we did. Proximity to the beach was important to us and then there was the Platinum Lobby, which we used each and every day \u2013 really lovely. The bar there was just a few steps from our room, with fabulous staff (our favorite was sweet Celsa), great selection of premium liquors, i.e. Chivas Regal and Glenfiddich Scotch, Havana Club 7 year old rum (so \u201csmooth\u201d), Grand Marnier and Kaluha. There was always some sort of food available here as well. There is a private pool area which is really pretty and we would very often stop there after a full day of beaching, get a drink, shower, and lounge on the luxurious beds. It was very peaceful. There is a nice patio area as well and after coming back home after dinner, we would stop in for a quiet nightcap and sit outside under the stars. Towels here are plentiful and staff would say, take as many as you like. There are 4 computers available in the lobby which were free of charge and a small selection of international newspapers was also available. Making dinner reservations was an absolute breeze here; they couldn\u2019t do enough for us. For us, it worked out beautifully. It is a long way from the main lobby, we knew this ahead of course, but if we didn\u2019t feel like walking, the tram was always near by. Other You\u2019ve heard it before; there is a lot of beautiful marble but this we\u2019ve seen before. My husband saw one lady go down a few stairs and I did see a few people with arms bandaged, limbs braced, etc. I would say \u2013 be aware of your surroundings and where you are walking. Surfaces are hard everywhere, walking to the lobby in heels, for me, was ridiculous, so I just took them off and went barefoot or took the tram. Also, keep a watch for spilled drinks, very slippery and sticky. The main lobby bar areas are really nice in the evening (beautifully lite); we would always stop for a drink or two before heading for dinner. Lots of people everywhere \u2013 a great meeting place. The Plaza was always jammed and again, beautiful in the evening. We also enjoyed peering into the shops at night and admiring the jewelry. The security at the resort is outstanding and unobtrusive. These men are always around and yes they make rounds 24-7. I felt very safe and we never had one problem with theft, etc. All in all, we had a fabulous time at this resort and would not hesitate to recommend it to any of our friends and/or family. It exceeded our expectations many times over, and for that we are thankful and hope we have done it justice here. Thanks again for all of the advice and information we received here on TA \u2013 great memories are with us now.

All Adults in our 40's from Ontario. All of us have travelled to the Mayan before and all of us loved this place. Check in was no problem, we had booked king rooms, regular suites. When we arrived we were in suites with double beds. When we complained we were immediatley upgraded to deluxe suites that gave us 2 extra resturant meals so we grabbed that even though only one of the rooms was a king bed. Not a real deal breaker and the extra meals were appreciated. The deluxe suites are also located very close to the beach, pools and breakfast and lunch buffets so for the money they seemed like the best deal. Grounds are clean and stunning, lots of marble and sculptures. Yes it is a long walk from reception to the beach but with all the food and beer the walk was not so bad. Pools were very clean and we had no problem getting an umbrella each day by 10 am. Pools were cold and 2 out of 3 of the swim up bars were in shade which made them very cold and hard to hang out at. This made it a little hard to meet people as everyone was outside the pool on their chairs. The activity pool had little in the way of activities other than Crazy Games once per day. the staff was very out going and tried to get everyone involved. It would have been better if they did a few of these throughout the day. The beach was busy but clean. As long as you are down there by 9 or so you can get a chair. you need to be there by 7 or 730 to get shade. Lots of rocks but water shoes took care of that. Hobbie cat and kayaks are fun and since it was not so busy we could get a kayak anytime we wanted and the hobbies were 2 days to book. Bars were excellent and service top notch. Rene and Alex at the Sunny swim up bar were working their butts off, as well as the guys in the lobby bar. We only ate one dinner at the buffet it was good. Breakfast and lunch were good as well, there was something for everyone. Meat is overcooked Mexican style but that seems to be the norm down here. We enjoyed all of the resturants we went to , Japaneese was the best but French, Italian and Mexican were also good. Seafood was a little spotty but still good. Lots of specialty coffee at all of the bars. one draw back IF YOU DRINK REGULAR TEA BRING YOUR OWN BAGS FROM HOME. The entire resort has no real tea, only flavoured decaffinated stuff. The staff kind of gave us the we know we know, so there was no sence in blaming them Our room was cleaned well every day, left one or two dollars plus some small gifts. No problems with restocking the fridge or the towels. No problem with anything missing or anyone in our room. All the staff we encountered we friendly and hard working and really made an effort. the only problems we had were with other guests. First the place must a preffered destination for Quebec. I would guess that 70% of the guests were french speaking. It made it a little harder to meet people as you generally got little response other than yes or no in a french accent. The other problem was a group of volleyball hogs from Hamilton who assumed that since they were great players (in their own minds) that they should have complete control of the court. They were refusing to let anyone join in and only would play 3 on 3 as they were there for their volley ball vacation. By the 3rd or 4th day of this they had most of the people who just wanted to have fun ready to kill them. the staff did little other than the official volley ball time where they insisted everyone play. It was one of those stupid things where 10 people thought that a resort for 2000 was in their control and led to a lot of arguments over the week. I only mention this as I hope some of them read this and realize how childish they were but I have my doubts. Anyway no fault of the resort. In all Great Place at a good price ($1000 after taxes). Not sure if I would return but that is only because there are so many other places to check out", "Date": "December 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cGreat time at the princess\u201d", "Author": "JoanBCalgary", "ReviewID": "UR22548852", "Content": "After reading all the reviews of the Princess hotel, we were worried.

You really helped to make it a fun and relaxing vacation. Thanks to the concierge at the adult pool, and to Jeremy \u2013 the best bartender anywhere. We have been to the Mayan Riviera a dozen times in the past 10 years, so we are fairly tuned into what you can expect from a 5 star resort. The GRP met some of those expectations and missed the boat on others. The main reason we selected this resort is for the scuba diving. The boat leaves right from the resort, so you can fit in two dives each morning and be back to the resort by lunch. If you book a series of dives, you can leave your gear at the dive shack and not have to drag it back and forth to your room each day. That\u2019s a huge bonus. (we had no problem with theft.) Although the diving wasn\u2019t spectacular, it was still enjoyable. The weather prevented the dive boats from going out for three or four days in a row, so guests who were there for only one week may have been disappointed. We spent two weeks in one of the laguna suites. The suites were large and visually appealing, but not very functional. The suite is one large room with only the toilet in a closed-off area. That means no privacy within the suite \u2013 don\u2019t jump in the tub or shower if you are expecting room service! The TV is a fair distance from the bed, so if you are watching TV in bed \u2013 especially with the air conditioning on, you need to really crank up the volume. There are no bed-side tables, and only one small wastebasket for the entire room, uncomfortable seating in the sitting area \u2013 upholstered in white fabric which is not very practical for sun-screen covered guests. As is typical in Mexico, there were a number of mal-functions in the room: Noisy air conditioning, unbalanced ceiling fans, no hot water in one of the vanity sinks, toilet didn\u2019t flush completely, poor lighting over the vanities, extra-firm (read: rock hard) mattress, slippery duvet. There were no extra pillows in the room, nor any extra blankets. The suites are located on a lagoon, so there are plenty of hungry mosquitoes. Since the mayan shower is open to the elements, you can\u2019t shut the mosquitoes out of the room so bring plenty of bug repellent. The positives \u2013 large patio, large safe (large enough for my 17\u201d laptop), close to the main restaurants, the spa and the adult pool. However, it is a good 10 \u2013 15 minute walk to the very crowded beach from the laguna area. Our tour package advertised a mini bar, restocked every day with water, beer, sodas and mini-liquor bottles. The water arrived every day, but the liquor was never restocked. When we called to request a restock, we were told the liquor (7 oz bottles) would be $10 US each. The restaurants were hit and miss when it came to food and service. Over the course of two weeks, we were able to visit each of them twice. We found the food to be consistently good in the Italian and the Japanese restaurants. The Mexican was abysmal for both food and service, although we heard other guests say how much they enjoyed the Mexican restaurant. The other restaurants were good some nights, and not-so-good others. Our biggest complaint about all of the restaurants was the noise level. They are all fully enclosed, very stark with no sound-absorbing features, so it is often difficult to carry on a conversation over the noise. This resort really needs an open-air restaurant \u2013 that\u2019s what makes a Mexican dining experience so enjoyable. There are no a la carte restaurants open for breakfast and lunch, so your options are the buffet or room service. More on room service later. We found the buffets severely lacking in variety as compared to other resorts. A real shortfall in the food service is the hours of operation. All restaurants close between 10:30 am and 12:30 pm, reopen for lunch, then close between 3:30 and 6:30 pm. During the \u2018off hours\u2019 , you had two options: get a burger or hot dog in the sports bar, or order room service. The room service was a great option for breakfast on your private patio, although it was a bit of a crap-shoot. Although the service was quick, it was always a surprise to see what you\u2019d get. Rarely did it match what you actually ordered. Don\u2019t bother saying no to toast \u2013 you\u2019re getting toast! One of the positives about this resort is the liquor service. It was all top shelf. At many other resorts, we found they often tried to substitute mescal for tequila in mixed drinks \u2013 not here. At minimum, it was Jose Cuervo Especiale. Other premium brands were available on request. By comparison, this resort didn\u2019t measure up to the other resorts we have been to in the area. Our favourites include the Paradisus, the Royal Playa del Carmen, and the Eldorado Royale, although the GRP is less expensive. We have also enjoyed the Bahia Principe Akumal and the Barcelo Maya Beach which are comparably priced to the GPR, but superior in terms of food and atmosphere.", "Date": "December 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cHad a GREAT time\u201d", "Author": "juliyadz", "ReviewID": "UR22445477", "Content": "Stayed at the Grand Riviera Princess hotel from November 19, 2008 to November 26, 2008.

Book It Today!\u201d", "Author": "jillese", "ReviewID": "UR22422436", "Content": "My family and I travelled down to the Grand Maya Princess On Nov. 25 - Dec.2 and couldn't have asked for a better time. I have been reading reviews on this website every day for about a month before our trip and let me tell you our stay proved those reviews wrong big time! I don't know who has been writing those reviews but they surely must not be happy people and must be pickier then ever, because this resort is amazing! I have stayed at two all inclusive in this area in the past and this by far was the best out of them all. My family consists of two adults and four kids, 18, 16, 14 & 10 and there was something for everyone! We had two rooms and they were the cheapest ones, just junior suites but they were still amazing! Check In Our check in was very fast, the hotel is about a 30 min drive from the Cancun airport and as soon as we arrived at the resort we were greeted by the friendly staff and were offered drinks which were set out on a table for new arrivers. Check in was fast maybe 5 mins, and our luggage was taken to our rooms with in twenty mins. Grounds The grounds are beautiful, and always kept spotless, there are always workers polishing the statues or cleaning the floors. The place is huge ! Walking from the main lobby which is at the very start of the resort to the beach takes about fifteen mins. We were very lucky our rooms ended up being in the 6000's so they were located right in the middle of the resort perfect for getting around. If you are planning on staying in a junior suite then I suggest you ask if you can stay in the 6000's or 7000's so nothing is in far walking distance. Pools There were so many sparkling blue pools everywhere you looked, there is the \"happening\" pool areas and quiet areas for everyone. This resort has more pool area than any other resort that I have seen. They are a bit chilly but they're really nice to cool off in and there are plenty of water activities you can join in on throughout the day including tequila volleyball which was always a big hit , and a good time! There is also free scuba diving lessons, water polo, aqua sizes and more. If there is a dirty spot in the pools there will soon be a worker jumping in and scrubbing it clean it is amazing! Another cool thing about this resort is that there are swim up rooms! Although the resort was fairly busy we never had a problem finding 6 chairs around the pool even at 10, 0r 11 in the morning. The whole \"wake up at 6 and save a chair\" thing doesn't apply to this resort. You will always be able to find a sunny or shaded spot to sit! Food There are a total of four buffets in the resort and 7 la carte restraunts. Two buffets are at the main lobby, and two are at the beach. The food was amazing, my family and I ate way too much! There is a variety for everyone beautiful salads, veggies, a variety of soups, and main dishes, there is also stations that you can create your own omelette, pastas, and steaks. Each a la carte restraunt provides a dish for the buffets, so no the food is not being \"re used\" at the a la cartes and buffets but they are simply letting everyone sample some of the food they may enjoy if they're going to go to the a la cartes. My family and I did like the 2 main lobby buffets better then the beach ones simply because they were less busy, they're bigger and they have a better variety of food. All in all the food was great every meal was awesome no complaints at all! Anyone and everyone will be able to find something great to eat! There is almost always one buffet open all the time but if you would like a snack there is the sports bar which serves fries, hot dogs, burgers etc. 24 / 7. We ate at the fondue, Italian & Mexican a la cartes and they were all awesome! We didn't eat at the seafood one because is cost more if you were only in a junior suite. Staff The staff is amazing, always greeting you with a friendly hola! Almost all of them know how to speak english very well, but they can also speak french and some itallian so there is always someone who will be able to understand you. The staff works very hard and it broke my heart to see some people complaining at the swim up bars because they had to wait 2 mins for their drinks I mean COME ON PEOPLE! They were super friendly and always willing to step out of their way so you could have fun on your vacation! We tipped the maids about 2.00 American a day and are rooms were always nicely made up. My advice is treat the staff with respect they are amazing people, and it doesn't hurt to hand them a tip here or there ! Beach The beach is beautiful, with a ton of chairs, and a bar. We took water shoes and we recommend them only because at some places in the ocean there are little chunks of coral that have broken off and are not that nice to walk on. However if you wear water shoes it is fine. The ocean is warm and blue there were lots of people of all ages swimming in it. Also included with the resort there is a little \"ocean hut\" area where you can sign out boogie boards snorkel stuff, kayaks, flippers, etc for you to use in the ocean free of charge we thought that was neat! There are sea doos, para sailing , snorkel tours, hair braiding and more available to do at the beach! Bars There are bars everywhere you turn, there is defiantly no shortage of them! They make almost every kind of drink, and if they don't know of the drink that you want they will gladly listen to instructions and make it to their best ability. We never had to wait for a drink the bartenders are polite and fast workers. They have every kind of booze available from Smirnoff to absolute so just ask and they will make it with the booze of your choice. The beer on tap is corona which was nice most resorts don't have that. All the drinks were amazing; there are also coffee and ice cream machines and some of the bars which was nice. Rooms We had two junior suite rooms and they were very nice, even in these rooms there was a big jacuzzi which we took full advantage of! There is a safe, a flat screen TV with quite a few English channels and a nice balcony overlooking the jungle. We had no problems with the shower leaking or anything, and the rooms were always clean and nicely made up! Others This resort is really close to Playa Del Carmen, some people walked along the beach there and said it took them a little over an hour. There are shuttles that run to Playa for free from the resort at different times you have to book these a day in advance and it is well worth it. 5th Avenue is not what it used to be it is highly advanced now with a burger king, mickey D's , starbucks etc. It s well worth the trip! We also did Xel-ha which I highly recommend it's a natural bay off the ocean where you can snorkel , swim with dolphins, tube, etc there is something to do for everyone, keep in mind you need biodegradable sun screen so you don't damage the reefs. We spent a full day there and the kids swam with the dolphins it was awesome! Oh I forgot to add that in the resort there is archery, salsa dancing lessons and other fun activities also there is a band that plays popular American music in the courtyard at night and two shows every night! At night in the courtyard there are also specialty coffees served, if you are interested in getting one line up quickly, they are pretty popular! We recommend this resort for anyone and everyone, it is amazing and clearly a 5 star! Well worth the money, I say book today, you will have a great vacation!!

We travel extensively and this is our 4th all-inclusive trip to this region. The reviews were somewhat terrifying and I almost changed hotels after reading so many negative ones. My advice- do not hesitate to book here (and if you already did, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be fine). The grounds are beautiful and clean. The pools are nice, the rooms are very comfortable and the food is typical Mexican all-inclusive fare. The a la carte restaurants are very good and there seems to be enough activity to keep everyone happy. If you have the opportunity, I would suggest upgrading to the Platinum room. Besides being very close to the beach, you get extra perks like a concierge to book the restaurants, a full bar when you arrive, availability of beach towels whenever you\u2019d like one, a free one-tank dive at the dive shop and an area at the beach w/ free drink service (as well as a small pool w/ a bar). We booked through Funjet and found it impossible to deal with them. They would not allow us to upgrade our room so we went directly through the concierge (if you need his email, let me know). If you get a Platinum upgrade, request either the second or third floor, else you may view a wall from your patio. The beach gets quite crowded and premium chairs do get scooped up quickly. If you are on the beach by 9:00 am, you\u2019ll have a good selection. We noticed that the beach seems to clear out by around 1:30, so it really is a small window where you\u2019ll have to \u201ctake what you can get.\u201d The beach sand is wonderful; however the ocean is very rocky for the first 20 yards or so. Once you wince your way through the first section, it\u2019s typical Caribbean sand. The evening shows were mediocre-(how many all-inclusives could possibly have \u201cGREASE\u201d as their evening entertainment?!), but there is a band that plays nightly in the courtyard, a fire show and the disco that merit checking out. There are a few things that could be improved upon. In the main pool area, they constantly ran out of towels. We heard \u201ccome back in an hour\u201d and \u201cmaybe tomorrow\u201d far too often. Since we were Platinum, we always had towels, but I can understand why this would be maddening to the guests. The dive shop was excellent. Unfortunately we wasted a significant amount of time trying to rectify a billing error at the pool dive shop (I would urge you to book at the beach location, instead). We went on 3 dives and the staff was professional, informative and fun. On the hotel website, there is a list of features included with the Platinum upgrade; unfortunately, when we attempted to utilize some of these \u201cfree\u201d things, nobody was aware of them (even with the print-out available). Overall, this hotel is beautiful. The rooms were nice and except for a few very trite complaints, this place is an excellent value. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I always end my reviews with \u201cwould I recommend it\u201d and/or \u201cwould I go back?\u201d Without a doubt, I would recommend this hotel for a reasonably priced getaway. If you are looking for pampering and refinement, look elsewhere. Would I go back? I have made a vow never to stay at the same place twice, so although I would recommend the Grand Riviera Princess, I have too many places to visit and too little time to return~ We came back recharge and almost ready to face reality again, with very fond memories of this trip.

We both did our fair share of research before we FINALLY decided on the Princess Resort. We both had our reservations as we read some really negative reviews...but then finally said the heck with it and decided on this resort as every resort had some negative reviews! Our reservations went straight out the window when we landed in Cancun and were greeted very warmly by pretty much everyone. Our conquest rep Daniel and Milena were very helpful and answered all our questions on our bus ride over. When we got to our resort we were all in AWE of how beautiful it really was even in the dark! I will try to keep my review sectioned and my babbling to a minimum! Check in: As smooth as it gets. While my husband, friend and her husband checked in...I went to the bar and got my first set of all inclusive drinks! We had indicated in our email to the concierge before hand that we were coming for our anniversary and we received a complementary upgrade to a Deluxe Suite...and we only paid for a Junior! Please note, if you want to upgrade to Platinum\u2026. do it when you arrive at the resort..you will pay half the price..then what you would pay when booking! You just have to have a huge smile and bargain at front desk! We decided our Deluxe suite was good enough, but Platinum guests do get a few more perks. Grounds: The grounds are gorgeous and well manicured! They are not as massive as I had read in past reviews\u2026.you see the most gorgeous flowers and greenery. Yes it might take between 7-10 min to walk from your room to the beach..but you are on vacation...so who cares! Plus I enjoyed the walk...especially after the lunch buffet and dinner! Rooms/Staff: We really enjoyed the Deluxe room which had its own private Jacuzzi. The rooms were huge and we loved the way they were decorated. Yes the shower system is not the greatest and there is water left over after you shower, we solved that problem by just placing towels on the marble floor. We got towel art pretty much every day we were there! The staff really did a fantastic job with cleaning our room and we always left them a tip and some small gifts we had brought along with us\u2026.which they really appreciated. We locked all our valuables in the safe never found anything misplaced! One time my friend left the cleaning staff a tip and returned to find the tip still there! We found the staff on the resort and even the general local population to be extremely friendly! After the 2nd day we were saying Ola to pretty much everyone we saw on the resort! We found them to be as helpful as could be...and even if some of them didn't speak English...we got our message across just fine. Food: We thought the food was excellent, especially considering the price we paid! We have been to Sandals before as well, and found the food to be pretty close to the same quality. It would be a GOOD idea to make reservations for the restaurants before arriving, send the concierge an email before to avoid disappointment! We dined at A La Carte restaurants every night! Miso was a solid 9/10! We loved it so much we changed our last night\u2019s reservation to Miso again! We had both Habachi and A La Carte..(this restaurant is reserved for Platinum guests but we had no problems booking it) Mama Mia...7/10...it was typical Italian..but good nevertheless...La Hacienda-amazing Mexican! The portions were huge and very appetizing....Le Fleur-7.5..I believe this was the International one....very good....but nothing compared to the Asian and Mexican\u2026.The buffets were really good....we were amazed at how good the food was...and we never really got tired of the selection..they have a pasta bar..where they make fresh pasta for you everyday pretty much! Pools: The timing of our trip was not the greatest season wise...as it\u2019s cool at certain times...hence the water was pretty cold in the pools. But when you dive in or get thrown in as I did.....you warm up real fast! The ocean is actually warmer than the pools! We seemed to find beach chairs only after lunch...which was ok with us...as we are not early risers anyhow! Bring your water shoes! Although the beach and water is beautiful it does get quite rocky...Make sure you look for Rene, he was the bartender at one of the pools nearest to the beach..and he was awesome...he made us the greatest drinks! Our fave drinks were the mojitoes, strawberry/mango daiquiris, and cosmos, and random shots! Excursions: You had to get out and do them! We went to Coba (mayan ruins) and Coco Bongo in Cancun. Our day at Coba included Kayaking, Lesuirly Mountain Biking to Coba, Climbing Coba, Swimming in Cenotes, Having lunch in a local mayan village, Repelling, and Zip Gliding for $120 CDn per person! This is a full day adventure so plan accordingly! For our last night we went to CoCo Bongo for $80 CDN..which includes your private guide who stays with you in the club, free drinks all night, VIP service and line by pass. This is not a regular night at a club, it's an experience! There are Vegas style shows that go on all night..and my friend and I even got to dance on stage with the performers! So all in all we had a fantastic time! Yes we did get mosquito bites, the bathroom leaked a bit of water, and there was some minor construction going on at 8am! But these were our biggest complaints...if you want to call it that. We went there with a VERY open mind...and were very pleased with what we received. This is definitely a family resort..and we saw lots of little kids and strollers....but again didn't mind it\u2026.as we didn\u2019t hear any cries. We heard next year the price of this resort is going up! We paid $1000 per person..and it was worth every penny.

Our check in did not go smoothly...first they didn't have our reservations (this may have been due to the website we booked from as another couple had the same problem). They told us to go have dinner and when we come back, the room would be ready. When we came back, the room was not ready. Once we finally got to our room, was impressed how nice it looked. Untill we noticed the room staff did not replenish the toiletries so we had to ask for more. This was just the beginning. The next day we woke up with bed bug bites!! for a 5 star hotel and one that looked so nice and clean from the outside, how can you have bed bugs! Every night we had bed bug bites! The replenishing of the towels were not consistant...one day we'd get all our towels, the next day we only get one face cloth or one hand towel...there were 2 of us in the room, you'd think we'd need two sets of towels not just one. The water in our suit got shut off one night while someone was taking a shower, but that was fixed quickly. One day they forgot to put bedsheets on our bed?!!! Seriously, how can you forget that? If you take them off....a new one needs to be put on. I called front desk about that and it took them a long time to get the bed sheets for us. The mini bar was always stocked, which was nice, but the fridge sometimes did not work so our drinks were warm. The food I thought was pretty good for buffet food. We enjoyed the a la carte restaurants. We were allowed to book 2 nights during our stay. The service at the buffet and a la carte restaurants were great On the day of the checkout we requested for a late check out but the person said they're expecting alot of people to check in that day and they need our room. She did not even check if our room was going to be occupied. We enjoyed everything at the hotel EXCEPT for the housekeeping and because of that I do not know if I would recommend this hotel.

I am writing a review and including some pics because this is a new hotel and there wasnt really any reviews on weddings to help me out. There were 30 people in total in our group who flew in from various destinations to meet us. The first problem was check-in. I am not sure if they need more staff or if it is because there was our group as well as another wedding group that arrived at the same time, but it took the good part of an hour to check in. This was not really an issue, as we were all just excited to be anywhere from our day of travelling. Our room was in the 2000 block (on the Sunset side we later discovered) and almost everyone in our group was in the rooms down from ours going over to the 3000 block. It was a great location because it is between the beach and the lobby so both are easily accesible, however, perhaps due to the time of year, we never had sun on our patios which would have been nice since we all had swim out rooms. Since we arrived on a Sunday we had to meet with the wedding coordinator on the Monday afternoon. Everything went pretty smoothly, our witnesses just had to run back to their rooms to get their passports. Then my fiance and I looked at pictures of flowers and picked what we wanted. No problems here. On Tuesday a bunch of us went to the Eco Park Excaret. A few things to note here. Our agent didnt tell us about all the extra expenses that we would have to pay for if we wanted to do any of the good excursions. AND that drinks are NOT included here so you have to take money. We only did one not included excursion and that was the bubble head....you wear a space helmet and hold onto a rail under the water and see the fish swimming around you. It was pretty cool and I would say worth the extra $45. After that we went scuba diving through the caves which was really neat. That took a total of almost an hour and you end up WAY on the other end of the park. After that we went to the night show which was 2 hours long and BRUTAL! It would have been good if it ended where the intermission is, but even if you leave the park closes for it and our ride wasnt coming for another hour. Something I will definetly not go see again!! On Wednesday night another group of us took a tour into Cancun to go to Coco Bongo. I think it was $65US and that included our transportation there and back, unlimited drinks at the bar and a guide who stayed with us all night. All in all it was a really good time, they do \"Vegas\" style shows so you arent just going and standing around as you do at most bars. I would recommend this to anyone from 20-40yrs. Thursday, the day before the wedding I didnt want to do too much so I took my grandma and 3 of my friends to the spa. Just to be fair, I am a hairstylist and have worked in spas before and my maid of honor is an esthetician(which is why she went for a massage). The spa is ok, a lot of little rooms so you really cant have services done together which was really the purpose for all of us going. My sister and one friend had the manicure/pedicure package for $100US. That night my girlfriend had to redo the polish on their hands and feet because it was such a messy unprofessional job. I probably could have painted them better in the dark myself. I think the problem in the spa is that all the girls do everything, hair, massage, manicure, pedicure, facial instead of focussing on just doing hair or just doing massage. Anyways, wouldnt reccomend it for the price, get your toes done before you leave home. Wedding day! I went down to the beach and had a massage done there, I only had a 30 minute and when it was over wished I had an hour.Amazing job and Highly recommened!!You can also barter the price of it with them as a few of the girls had an hour massage for $45 instead of $60. I think almost everyone in our group had one at some point in the week. Had a relaxing morning hanging out with the girls at the beach. Went back to my room to have a shower and dry my hair for my girlfriends to do for me.(the bonus of having hairstylists travel with you and after seeing the brutal job they did on another wedding party in the spa I cancelled my sister-in-laws appointment!) Our reception was supposed to be on the beach and because there is a 40 person minimum I had to pay for 40 people when we only had 30. Early afternoon it rained for a bit so I had to make a decision as to whether to move it indoors. At night it was pretty cold and I didnt want everyone to be cold so we moved it inside which worked out really nice. We had our own banquet room with our own bar and 4 Djs. The ceremony was at 3pm in the double gazebo on the beach which was decorated beautifully!! It is off to the end of the resort so you have some privacy although I could see an old man in a speedo taking pictures of us! The wedding coordinator had them sweep the red carpet 4 or 5 times before I walked down to make sure there wasnt one piece of sand on the carpet. The ceremony was about 15 minutes with the sand ceremony included. Afterwards we had a champagne toast with all our guests and then we went to take pictures with my photographer I hired from Cancun. The resort photographer took pictures for the first 10 minutes and they were ok. If you want AMAZING pictures hire outside the resort....the pics that their photographer takes anyone could have taken and you wouldnt have known the difference. The reception was really good and everyone had a really good time.We had a buffet dinner which was the best dinner everyone had all week, good timing on the good food!!! The only complaint was that it was hot in our banquet room, somehow it seemed to be the only place that didnt have the air conditioning cranked! All in all the wedding day was AMAZING, everything went really smoothly, the staff was fantastic, the food was great, the decor was stunning.Because I couldnt keep all the flowers I gave them to the Djs to take home and to my photographer and I kept one centerpiece to put in my room. After the reception a group of us went to the disco. It would be a fun place if they had more than one bartender to get drinks for the entire club. Overall the music is dated and the service is slow there. We had a good time because there was a group of us but otherwise when we went earlier in the week it was pretty brutal. Now onto the resort review. Pretty dissappointing overall and I wouldn't return for a few years until they get everything running more smoothly. Rooms: the floor is VERY slippery and especially if you have a swim out room you are coming out of the pool and onto now wet marble floors. My one girlfriend fell while holding her one year old and managed not to injure the baby but made quite the large gash in her arm that is still there and still bothering her. You have to put towels on the floor everywhere or dry yourself 100% to prevent falling. The bathroom smelled like sewage from the toilet and almost everyone in our group noticed this.The shower doesnt' drain the right way so you have to kick the water to the drain if you dont want it to leak into your bathroom or to step into a cold puddle of water next time you shower. The room over all smelled like a dirty dishrag from the airconditioning being cranked on high all the time. I was so happy I brought my own pillow because the musty smell from all the bedding made me gag. We would turn our air conditioning off and when we would return after the maids had been there it was on full blast again! I was pretty dissapointed since we did get married there and we did bring gift's and leave money for the maids everyday I thought we would at least get flower petals on the bed on our wedding night.....Nothing special done for us. We actually only got towel art one day out of the 7 we were there. Food: Disgusting. All the buffets were disgusting....and I gave it more than a fair chance and tried almost everything they had. I know how to cook very well but still am not that picky, I just want my food to have some flavor and be cooked properly. We went to the Seafood a la carte......no one liked it. Everyhthing was really overcooked and soggy. Gross. We also went to the Mexican a la carte which was good.....how hard is it to make fajitas!? The breakfast buffets were good, you can have a fresh omlette made, there is little cereal boxes we would take for a snack later. 24hr room service was included in our week package so we had that a lot. The pizzas seem to be of the frozen variety but when you have had a lot of mojitos they taste all right. If you order a hamburger anywhere in Mexico make sure you order it well done otherwise you will get a pink patty!!! All in all make sure you bring some immodium or something of that variety as everyone in our 30 people had to have it at least once due to the quality of the food. The resort is big and beautiful and we didnt have any problems with the service anywhere the only complaint is the quality of the food and the rooms. The wedding was more beautiful than we could have dreamed and that is what the week was about so we had an amazing trip overall with good friends and family.", "Date": "November 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointed\u201d", "Author": "Paramon", "ReviewID": "UR22210449", "Content": "and I am not a picky guy, believe me I'm not trying to get even with somebody from personnel who [-] me off, no, hotel staff is great and helpful; stayed for a week, first time ever didn't want to stay for another, lots of walking, i mean lots; from reception to the ocean 10 min. at least, overcrowded - on the beach if you have couple square feet of free space around you - you have a great spot, not enough chairs for everybody - people just drop beach towels on the sand , beach - the worst I've seen, small and narrow, plus you need a footwear to get into the water, underwater stones are everywhere and sharp enough; almost 700 rooms - one bar on the beach - get ready to stay in line every time you need a drink; room is cozy, but don't take a shower, water drains wrong way- into the room , so we used Jacuzzi, food is very close to very good, other people may disagree (I'm not very picky ) overall - no way 5 star hotel would not recommend to anyone", "Date": "November 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable hotel\u201d", "Author": "bill73met", "ReviewID": "UR22177707", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here Nov 7-14 2008. Distance from the airport is about 35 minutes. We were the first stop so that was nice. They are still doing construction at the entrance from the street, but it is quite a ways from the actual hotel. Check in was fairly quick, although we arrived around 12 noon and we couldn't get into our toom until 2:00. (check in isn't until 3). There is marble everywhere. Starting from the entrance way and throughout the resort. People are very friendly. We flew with Air Transat so we had extra stuff included (regency club). Towels were in our room when we arrived which was nice. There was also a souvenir bottle of tequila in the room as well as 3 bottles of liquor to use during our stay. The fridge was always stocked everyday. The room was really nice. Double sinks, 2 person jacuzzi tub and separate shower. Very nice. The food at this resort was amazing. Not all the stuff we liked but that is just because not everyone likes all foods. That is where people need to understand when they write reviews. Everyone has different likes and dislikes. We ate at all the buffet restaurants. Food was great. The only small problem with the buffets is that the food could be a little hotter. But there was always alot to choose from and they changed it quite often. We went to 3 a la cartes. La Hacienda (mexican) we thought was very good. Mama Mia was okay. My wife and I didn't care too much for it, but alot of others liked it alot. La vaquiera (grill) was also very good. I had the assorted grill entree which had a bit of quite a few different meats. Service was great at all a la cartes. There was also a sports bar/snack bar which was open 24 hours where you could always get a quick snack in between meals (nachos, hotdogs etc), which we used quite a bit because of the time frame between when we ate lunch (12 noon) till when we ate dinner (8-9 pm). There is alot of pools at this resort. We spent alot of time around the pool. We were a little walk from the action pool, where there was a swim up bar but there was always someone to bring drinks to our loungers. The pools are very nice and clean (except when a large crab decides to go for a swim in the pool you are in ). The beach was okay. Not the most beautiful beach. The color just isn't as nice as others i have seen. Very rocky in the water. We just came back from Punta Cana in January and the beach here does not compare to it. The entertainment at this resort i thought was very good. They have a show every night at their indoor theatre. They also have a band that plays almost every night just outside the theatre area. This resort is huge. We had no problems getting around though. To walk from the lobby to the beach would take around 10 minutes or so. We didn't mind because the grounds are absolutely beautiful. The one complaint that I would have is that there is no mexican music playing. I thought that when they played music around the pools that they would play mexican music to set the mood. They only played music that i would listen to at home. Maybe it's just me, but i would like to hear mexican music if I'm in mexico, lounging with a pina colada. I would say that this resort overall was amazing. I would definately return. We did 1 excursion. It was 109 US each. it included. Tulum . The beach here is amazing. You will want to take alot of pictures here. After Tulum we went to a place called Chichen ha. Here we had an authentic mayan lunch followed by mountain bike through some forest. After that we took part in a mayan purification ceremony before we got to swim in a Cenote. The Cenote was amazing. We got to snorkle here for a while. Then we did some tubing in the Cenote. After that we went Ziplining. There is 3 ziplines you get to do. The first zipline is pretty low over the cenote. The final zipline you are above the trees. (what a rush). We had a blast at this full day excursion. The only thing we didn't like about this trip was that they wouldn't let us take in a camera into the cenote or ziplining. We were wondering why they wouldn't let us until we realized that they were taking pictures of us throughout the day. They wanted $30US for 1 picture.

However, the beauty only last so long when so many problems arise. First of all the entire floor throughout the resort is marble which is very slippery if there is even one drop of liquid on the floor. In our two week duration we personally saw 5 people being shipped off to the hospital because of falls. One was a little girl coming out of the bathroom by the lobby and she was knocked unconscience. The rooms were gorgeous but the plumbing in the showers were terrible (we heard many people complain about this) You need to make a dam using towels so the water does not go into the rest of your room. As well because of how the rooms are situated it is very noisy at night when anyone closes their door or used the bathrrom. You can hear everything. Finally, there are 9 restaurants in the resort, 2 are buffets, the rest you need to make reservations. Unfortunatley, you can only make reservations during the hours of 9-12 and when you go to make these reservations there is often nothing left at any of the restaurants. There is also a dress code in effect, men need to wear long pants, my husband did not bring long pants but did bring a nice dress shirt with khaki long capris, he was not allowed in but the guy next to use wearing sweat pants was allowed because they covered his entire leg.

After reading all the reviews, I was a bit apprehensive about going but the price was right. When we arrived at the hotel, we walked up to check-in and were helped within 5 minutes, at most. There were others in front of us. Front Desk was very nice, they explained the different areas of the hotel and gave us our room keys. We told the bellhop what room we had and they delivered the bags. Our first impression of the room was excellent. It was clean, NOT run down or looking over used. We had the basic room in the 6th building. THe room had a separate sitting area and nice balcony. We tipped the maid $2 every day and the beveage guy $1. We didnt drink much out of the fridge so we thought $1 was adequate. I liked the location of the 6th building because it was the closest to the beach, close to breakfast and lunch buffets, bar and pools. It was further from the general dinner buffets but it gave us the opportunity to walk a bit. As others have said, the walk from the lobby to the beach is about 7 minutes or so I am a fast walker. It never bothered me. We never did take the train in the resort. After eating all the buffet food, I needed some exercise. We visited the italian, mexican and fondue restaurants. All were ok. THe resort ala carte food was a 3 out of 5. It was not overly impressive but it was edible. We had ordered seafood paella at the italian restaurant and there was no seafood in it. The fish at the mexican restaurant was good. the shrimp fajita portion was very large. No skimping on the shrimp but there wasn't much flavor. The fondue place was not your standard fondue. all the food was precooked. All you had to do was dip into sauces or the fondue cheese. The chocolate fondue was good. Although it was different, the food was good. We always tipped $5 at the ala carte restuarants. It is Mexico so I dont expect them to be experts in italian or fondue. Also to prepare food in such large quantities everyday for all servings has to be difficult. ThHe buffets were standard. I could always find something to eat. We only did THe Jungle Place excursion. It was not offered by the hotel. We booked online before going to Mexico. [-]. Definitely worth going to see. I am not a picky eater. I was expecting more mexican food but there wasnt too much. The guacamole and pico de gallo was great! THe pools were always clean, never a problem with towels or finding seats. The seats did go faster at the beach. The shaded areas went first. The one complaint I did have was all the smoking. So many of the tourists smoked. It was hard to find a place with no one smoking. The restaurants were non-smoking. I didnt see signs on the hotel rooms indicating non-smoking rooms so maybe we lucked out because the room was fine. We did notice construction on our way to the lobby on the last day. There must be expanding the resort but we had never heard anything. Maybe those in the building next to the construction could hear noise but not once did we. Even as we walked by, the noise was minimal. Overall, I would go back to this resort.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cI found dirty underwear under my bed!\u201d", "Author": "bl00", "ReviewID": "UR21985104", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that over the past 2 years I've gone on 7 vacations and of all of the hotels that I've stayed at, Grand Riviera Princess is at the bottom of the pack. Sure the hotel looks like a 5 star but underneath the surface there really isn't much substance. I can't rate it higher than a 3 despite the fact that I really enjoyed my trip. But this review is not on the trip but of the hotel. So here goes (and i'll start with the negatives first) When we booked the vacation (with Conquest), we had requested to be as close to the beach as possible. Booking over a month and a half in advance we were advised that it should not be a problem considering that they had a large number of empty spaces available when we booked. Arriving at the hotel, not only did we find that we were not anywhere near the beach, we were situated in the building (8000+) furthest away from the beach. Not only did the front desk not accommodate our request to be moved closer, they treated us in a manner to be less desired. Needless to say that set the tone for the trip. I had arrived in my room which upon entering was a sauna. The heat was turned on and on full blast. Think about arriving in Mexico to a fully heated room! (Do they even need a heat setting?) As it was past midnight when we arrived at the resort, I had decided to notify the front desk in the morning (needless to say i had to sleep with the windows open). The next morning I lodged a complaint with the hotel about the heat. Upon returning to my room that next evening I discovered that not only was the air con not fixed but my balcony door lock was broken! I went to the front desk and quite vocally requested to be moved fearing for my possessions and safety. In the end, they did not move me and it took them 1 hour before someone came to the room to repair the lock and air conditioning. I thought the nightmare was over. Boy was I wrong. Doing sit-ups on my floor the next morning I glanced under the bed to find a set of dirty underwear! Disgusting! Other lows of the hotel: 1. footprints on the sheets (meaning that they didn't change them regularly and instead trampled on them first before placing them back on the bed). 2. there was a group of us and we requested a late check out. they gave late check out to only 1 of us and only extended our check out by 2 hours despite the amount of business we brought to the hotel 3. loud construction starting at 7am! i mean hammering, drilling, buzz-sawing 4. at the beach one of the members of our group asked to use the restroom at the thai restaurant. the restaurant was clearly empty and refused. no wonder it was always empty. incredibly rude. 5. one of our minibar fridges didn't work 6. during the trip i had received an emergency call and upon requesting to make a call at the concierge desk all of the phonelines were \"busy\" (for real?) 7. anytime we made a special request for anything outside of the menu (at the a la cartes), they made \"no exceptions\" 8. disco was a bust - they played the same music every single night (\"[----], i feel like a woman\") 9. took cleaning crew forever to clean up mess around the hotel. someone spilled a drink in one of the hallways just off to the side of one of the bars. the dried up drink was still on the floor the next morning. clearly workers at the hotel have problems claiming ownership of tasks 10. cleaning and mini-bar restockers entered the rooms despite the \"do not disturb\" signs on the doors 11. cleaning crew not fully locking the balcony doors after cleaning rooms 12. at the end of the trip i went up to the front desk to express my dissatisfaction of the trip in general. the person in charge, sandra, not only refused to hear me out, she asked me why i didn't complain at the time of the problem. i told her that i repeatedly did however nobody was willing to listen (at the hotel they just keep you running around like a mouse in a maze getting nowhere). she then told me that i should take my complaint to the concierge desk. again, the runaround and she too did not want to listen. Overall it felt like anyone who worked at the hotel was incapable of making a decision that would benefit guests at the hotel. They were all set on following \"procedure\" and not on how to improve the experience of the guest. In all honesty, the hotel is severly lacking on a committed and quality training program (we actually saw one worker teaching another worker on how to wipe down glass???). Been to numerous hotels whereby the experience of the guest is paramount over \"standard procedure\". Despite these negatives, there were some positives. Among them , there were some nice staff at the hotel and the grounds were very well kept. The beach is fine however I would strongly suggest bringing watershoes if you want to play in the ocean. Out of the a la cartes, the Asian restaurant was a pleasant surprise (just don't expect anything too authentic). Other decent a la cartes were the Grill and Mexican. I'd personally suggest staying away from the Seafood restaurant though. The 24-hour Sports bar was excellent for getting a burger, fries and nachos (but be sure to ask for the burger to be well cooked though). In the end my review is an overall negative one as the hotel has a loooong way to go in order to compare to some of the other hotels. The problem is deeply rooted and I'm not sure how they can fix it without a proper training program for the majority of their employees. Don't get me wrong, I love Mexico, however the best part of the trip was when I was off the resort and I didn't have to deal with the stress of staying at the resort. My only hope is that readers out there take the chance to read the warning signs. I'm the type of person who reads all of the reviews and who takes the negative ones with a grain of salt.

We had both been to Mexico at least 5 times each. We were apprehensive before we got there given some of the reviews that we read on here, so we were hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. Thankfully, we had nothing to worry about. Our vacation was totally problem free from the moment we landed in Cancun til we left. We committed to writing on here to negate some of the negativity that seems unwarranted. We never had any of the problems that others had listed in here. I counted a total of 3 mosquitoes the entire trip, the water didnt leak out of the shower (but we did put down a towel so that may have been the reason?!?!), the rooms were always made up nicely (and with the cool towel art too!), the floors were beautiful but were slippery in the very rare spot where there was water, there were oodles of clean towels available, the staff were incredibly friendly the entire time and as they got to recognize you they became even friendlier! The food was good, not over-the-top awesome, but hey you're in freakin Mexico! The grounds were beautiful and very well kept...it was rare that I saw a cigarette butt on the grounds (in response to one of the comments on here). The resort is relaxed but yet there is lots to do...there is something for everyone. If you want to relax, its totally available...if you want to whoop it up, then you can do that too. The place is big enough to accommodate these extremes and everything in between. Which bring sup the size of the place...it is huge, as it takes about 10-15 minutes to walk from one end to the other...which is perfect for helping to wear off the buffets and ALL THAT FREE BOOZE! We took the little shuttle thingy a couple times, but for the most part walked (several times a day) between the lobby and the beach where our room was. The only minor complaint we heard was that the shuttle wasnt frequent enough. Oh well, walk for 10 minutes! You may see the iguana thats running around! So just quickly some of the things that we did/would recommend or some of the observations... = We had reservations for all the restaurants, but after the second one we just went to the buffets since they changed them up pretty good and you could eat on your timetable. Plus, you dont have to wear long pants or closed toe shoes when going to the buffet (my belief is that you should always wear shorts/sandals when its over 20c!). So we blew off the rest of the reservations for the restaurants and just went to the buffets. There was a pretty good selection of tastey stuff. The sushi that was sorta hidden around the corner was found and it was awesome! But since they mix it up so well, I didnt come across it again. Lunches were pretty good too. Breakfasts were good with an egg station to get whatever kind of eggs you want made right on front of you. (and in response to the guy who posted about the pasta...when the pasta cooker was going, all i could smell was garlic .... so I dont know what the heck hes talking about). = The service was great too. My girlfriend was always saying HOLA! and I would say about 1/2 the time they would say it first to us. I say: be friendly and youll be treated well. It kinda seems like there may be a feeling of some sort of entitlement when going to a \"3rd world country\"...we saw it and we were embarrassed at how some people treated these people. Smarten up people! Seems like theres a lot of bitter people on here who had bad trips to this place....well...ahem...what comes around goes around? = Playa is a dive and the guy below is right about hustlers everywhere...thankfully they are no where near the resort. So if youre looking for that authentic experience of the mexican street vendor, playa del carmen and 5th ave is the place to go. = Take trips! Theres so much cultural history there that it would be a shame to spend the entire trip at the pool bar. We took a couple and loved them, especially the trip out to chichen itza and the cenotes. = Platinum isnt worth it unless youre into the status of having a grey bracelet at the pool bar (which seemed there were a lot of...) = The best lounge is the riveria lobby bar...but the most popular is the one down between the buffet restaurant with the live nightly entertainment. = Im starting a new trend...if you head down to the beach in the late am and theres one towel holding 5 chairs, and youve seen it empty for 1/2 hour...just throw the freaking towel off and claim the chair. Its brutal how people think that they run down to the beach and put a towel on the chairs then take off for hours and hope to have them waiting for them when there are lots of people looking for places. We did it, and one of the people came down to claim their 6 loungers they \"reserved\" (pfft!) after we had been in them for about an hour. SO we said that we'd give them up when the rest of their party came down. We sat in the loungers for 4 hours and then left to go to the pool. The rest of their group never showed up. So, I say we stop this stoopid practice of \"reserving\" the loungers and go first come first serve! Ha! Take that frenchies!! :P = Crocs are required footwear in the beach out front given the rocks. But its not like there isnt sandy bottom...theres lots of it. But there are also groupings of rocks out there. I wore crocs in the water out front and never had a problem. = Walk along the beach about 30-45 minutes north of the resort and you will be rewarded with the most beautiful beach. Didnt go south so cant tell ya what its like there. But head north..it is worth it! Just past the huge new hotel being put up. Pure sandy bottom (no crocs reqd!) and beautiful blue water. Just thinking about it .... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! (the 2 beach pics attached) We spoke to a lot of people when down there and talked about the bad reviews that people gave on here about the place. No one we had spoken to could relate to those bad experiences...everyone had a great time and said that they would return to there. Although there was a rumor that the staff had been totally replaced...but I never had that confirmed. Some had a small glitch or two but that is to be expected...with the important thing being that they didnt dwell on it to let it ruin their vacation... Overall we absolutely loved this place and we are already planning to have our extended families (parents, brothers/sisters, nephews, kids) come down with us next time.

We were there Dec 2007. I decided to write this now as we are about to go to the resort again. We stayed in the Platinum Suites. The resort was new when we went. We went opening week.

No problems with them. They did all they could to make our stay excellent. We didn't see alot of the Platinum upgrades as things werent finished but at least the Platinum bar was done and found a excellent beer there. Estrella. The pools were nice and clean. Lots of them. Food was excellent. We did 2 alacarts and the rest were in the buffet. Our kids 6 and 9 at the time of the trip had a great time. The kids programs were alot of fun for them. The kids pool and program area wasnt finished but they had things for them to around the resort. Coba is one of the excurssions we did and I will recommend it to anybody.

Many people had some great things to say and a few were rather negative. We decided to book and form our own opinion. It was the best holiday that we have ever had! From the moment we arrived we encountered exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. We did go as Platinum guests and had a few extras that the regular suites did not. The separate check in service was amazing after travelling for 9 hours. And having our luggage brought to our suite was a huge bonus. Platinum Jacuzzi Suite: the room was exceptionally clean and very well appointed. It would certainly compare with many top hotels in Canada and the US. One thing that became apparent to us was that we had expected less and gained so much more. It is important to remember that Mexico is a developing country and as such may not have some of the things we take for granted. We really enjoyed having the second jacuzzi on the balcony. It is a great place from which to watch the sunrise over the ocean! The only mosquitoes we encountered were in the nursery at Xel-Ha but I'd bring some repellent to be safe different time of year could be quite different. Towels were replenished twice daily. We never needed them replaced as there were plenty in the room. Lots to drink in the room including bottled water. Food: We found that there was a great variety and that it was quite comparable with North American food unlike other countries like the DR and Cuba. There are three buffet restaurants that you can choose from and, as many people have stated, we found the one closest to the beach (beside the Platinum suites building 5) was the best. The food was very likely exactly the same in taste as the other buffets but the view of the pools right outside the windows was quite nice. This buffet is only open for lunch and breakfast. The specialty restaurants were very good. I really recommend the Japanese and Mexican...I don't eat fish so if your expecting the Japanese to only serve sushi you'll be wrong! Beach: a few reviewers had recommended water shoes, we fully agree. The beach is quite nice but with the surf constantly rolling in there are quite a few obstacles such as coral in the water that do hurt. We started wearing shoes in and it was great. Goes out for quite a distance without dropping off! The gift store near the beach sells boogie boards for approx $30 CDN. We bought two and had a great time. We left them as a gift for the concierge Carla. If you do give something like this to the staff you need to sign a piece of paper stating that you did otherwise they will not be able to leave the resort with it. Ocean was warmer than the pools!! It was wonderful. Tips: always good to have a tip for your server, housekeeper etc. We checked and 20 pesos is a good tip. We would leave-daily-things for our housekeeper things that she would not normally be able to afford like fingernail polish, colouring books and crayons, some toys etc. They appreciate is on so many levels not only as a gift but that they were thought of before you arrived. In addition to the small items every other day we would leave 50 pesos. As a thank you we would have a different towel origami on our bed that evening. Tulum was incredible, don't miss the beach there. Xel-Ha was amazing. Swimming with the dolphins should be on everyone's bucket list. We went with Dolphin Discovery and it was a highlight. We're going back in June 09, November 09 and January 10. We fell in love with a wonderful country and an incredible people. My best advice is this: If your looking for a vacation spot to relax, enjoy yourself and live like royalty for a week the Grand Riviera Princess is the place to go. If you are the sort of person that can always find something to complain about you'll find that where ever you go. Always remember that you are a guest in someone else's country.

Well, my wife and I were not charmed. The Mexican mentality of hustling and lying with a smile has not changed one bit in all these years. The prices however have!! We now have a Third World country charging First World prices (and more) for almost every service and goods- even at the street level. For those who enjoy being ripped off with charm and second-rate service, Mexico is the place to go. This hotel is all eye candy. The grounds are huge but the atmosphere is cold. The lobby resembles a shopping centre with all the glass and marble. Very few places to sit and congregate either at the plaza or along the walkways. Couples who come here alone are going to feel that way. Groups were the only ones seeming to be having a good time. Rooms are nice and spacious. Main problem we had is the shower-the floor was not level and instead of the water heading for the drain,it seeped in the bathroom. With marble tiles, the floor becomes very slick in a hurry! I complained to the front desk about this and the person said he would see what he could do-he never did anything. We resorted to putting a towel before the shower door to keep the water from leaking in the bathroom and would then mop up. Needless to say, we took as few showers as possible. The good part is we were on third floor and if ever there are leaks, that is the place to be. We found out later that at least five other rooms had the same problem... Also disconcerting is the number of times personnel came into our room. I would find the TV open,the air conditioning changed and so on. Once I surprised the young man who cleaned our room come back after he had cleaned the room almost an hour ago (it took him about 15 minutes to do everything every day). When he saw me in the room, he seemed out of place and went in the bathroom to fold a towel, then left. We had no problems with the bugs. Our problem was a tractor that came every evening at around 6pm and sprayed the grounds with insecticide. The mist reached our third floor balcony and we were forced to close the patio door. There would be an acrid smell for about an hour after. Food is average at both the buffets and the restaurants. Mainly Mexican fare with American favorites day in and day out. The pasta is Chef Boyardee style-overcooked and badly seasoned. When I asked one of the cooks to prepare some pasta as to my instructions, I was informed that they had no olive oil or garlic! Also strange is that we kept seeing some of the food in the restaurants and the buffets-as if it was being recycled. For instance, they had this taco tomato dip in the buffet. I saw it at the Italian restaaurant being used as bruschetta, at the French restaurant being used as ceviche,obviously at the Mexican restaurant being used under many names and son on.... The wine served here is not worthy of a three star hotel. From what I can see they are trying to make this area the Mexican equivalent of the Orlando area in Florida- charging the same prices (and in some cases more) for inferior service and entertainment. For example we visited Tulum (very beautiful by the way) and for $55. per person we got a two-hour tour with guide, transportation (it was one hour away) and a botlle of water(advertised as refreshments in the sales pitch). Make sure you do not need to go to the washroom at Tulum-it is probably one of the filthiest places I have ever seen, and this in a site visited by thousands of tourists daily. Playa del Carmen is advertised as a quaint Mexican town with a street (5th avenue) being the mecca of shoppers. The street is a string of hustlers selling the same junk as they did when we came many years ago (but at much higher prices). We ended up doing our shopping at the local Wal-Mart where we had air-conditioning and better prices. The rest of the city is difficult to walk because of many stray dogs, broken or inexistant sidewalks, slums and hovels next to luxury condos and hotels,and hustlers bothering you constantly hawking their wares. Yes, very quaint... The first week of our stay, we had above-average service almost everywhere since the resort was quite vacant. The second week the resort was almost full and service not only declined but was tied in to how much tip one left. There were fewer smiles,olas, and gracias. Last year we went to Punta Cana at peak season and had gracious service all the time-tip or no tip(although we tip all the time). We were virtually ignored on several occasions in the buffet (and we were not the only ones)- no waiter to fill your glass with water,no one greet you and show you your table, etc. We ended up seating ourselves and serving ourselves (and still left a tip!). The beach is very narrow and dirty. We often found straws and cups and shards of glass-also many rocks. The spaces between hotels on the beach are also used as garbage dumps by some locals.

I was very nervous because we usually stay at the Iberostar and love it. My first impression of the resort was that it was \"okay\" but everyday it got better and better. The hotel itself is beautiful and VERY clean. We had no problem at check in and we were upgraded from a junior suit to a junior deluxe. The room was very nice and clean, very modern. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. Yes, there is quite a bit of walking but we never wanted to take the shuttle because the walk is so pretty. The beach is kind of small (narrow) and it took a little while to find chairs. It's pretty rocky right in front but if you walk down a little ways, it's not bad at all. We did see a lot of proplr with water shoes though and they seemed to help. The pools are very pretty and very clean. The only problem is that they were FREEZING. So cold that we only got in them a couple of times. The food was pretty good. The buffets were nothing special but the restaurant's were VERY good. Mama Mia is the best. The only thing is that you can only book 2 at a time so you have to remember to go up and reserve another couple of nights. It was kind of inconvenient and if you forgot, you're stuck with the buffet. The staff was very friendly and same with all the ground workers. Please be respectful to them, they work so hard for so little and they are all still so very nice and happy. We left $2.00 every day for the maid and we always had plenty of towels and our fridge was always stocked. Me being a non-smoker, I appreciated that they don't allow any smoking in the restaurant's or shows. Last year at the Iberostar I was 3 months pregnant and couldn't even watch any of the shows because there was so much smoke. I didn't see anybody that seemed to have a problem with it either. The shuttle into Playa is nice but you have to book it a day ahead and they don't have a ton of pick up times. So, you either don't get very much time there or you're stuck there all day.

We were a bit concerned after reading such negative reviews but we made out great. From our experience the pros definitely outweigh the cons. It wasn't the best we've been to but it's near the top. We did a one day trip to Chichen Itza which was fantastic. We stopped at a market place and purchased a few souvenirs cheaper than what they were asking at the resort gift shops. After a fascinating 3 hrs at Chichen Itza, which went by very fast, we stopped at a mayan village for lunch and then stopped at a beautiful cenote on the way home. It was a long day but well worth it. Resort: Beautiful grounds and buildings. We didn't have too much of a problem figuring out what was where. We spent the time checking out the resort while our room was getting ready. The Riviera Princess and the Riviera Sunset are mirrors of each other sharing the same pool area and restaurants. The two lobbies and main restaurants are at the front. The rooms are along the walkway going to the beach with the pool area in the middle. There are two restaurants just before you get to the walkway for the beach. Very clean except for cigarette butts and garbage left by guests. There are garbage cans and cigarette canisters and areas to leave empty glasses along all the walkways and on the beach but some people haven't figured out how to use them. Not the resorts fault. Reception: No complaints. We were the only ones checking in at the time. We were offered a glass of champagne even though we weren't platinum. We also asked for possible upgrade and we were given a room with a jacuzzi in the 6000 block which is in the middle between the lobby and the beach. Very convenient. We also received a map of the resort. Service: Never had a problem. Tipping is not expected but is accepted. We never saw anyone with their hand out. Workers are friendly and helpful. Just ask if you need anything. Rooms: Our room was great. Lots of space and nice sized balcony.Our room didn't have typical dressers with drawers. There are shelves in the closet and two other areas with shelves which we used. Do use towel on floor outside of shower stall. We found the air conditioning too cold for us and slept with it off and the ceiling fan on. We never figured out how to change the temp. on it. You can walk from all the rooms to the lobby under cover which is handy if it's raining. Only neg. about this is that the way the buildings are all attached and the least little noise in the halls echoes everywhere even if it's in the next building. Restaurants: We didn't do the a la cartes just because we can't be bothered to wait in line to sign up. We found the selection of foods at the buffets amazing. I didn't try everything but everything I did eat was great. The only complaint, which has been made by others, is they need to come up with a better way of keeping the food hot. I found the temperature in the restaurants to be too cold and by the time you ate the food that was kept warm by the heat lamps it was only lukewarm if that. They need something to keep the containers hot from the bottom. Beach: I loved the beach. It was sandy and you could walk for miles both ways. I took water shoes and didn't use them. There are stones and shells and dead coral. Sometimes they were right close to shore, other times further out and you had to walk on them to get to the sandy spots but I never a problem even walking on them.The water was red flagged for most days when we were there which made fun waves but I couldn't do any snorkeling. Only complaint is the washrooms for the beach area. While I was there I found only 1 or 2 of the 4 usable. They were either out of toilet paper or actually not working. I think they need better toilets to withstand the heavy use. 1 sink tap was also broken off. This was for the womens, not sure how the mens were. Pools. Loved the layout, there were so many different places you could go into the water and tons of chairs. You could stay in the middle by the pool bar. It was usually more active and noisier here or you could go further away to a more quieter area. Safes: They are electronic. We noticed a corner had been lifted up and because of the scare from previous reports we asked our bellboy about it. He said the reason they are lifted is because management has had to use a device to open the safe because people have left the safe locked after leaving the resort or have forgotten their code and had to get it open. He assured us that a screwdriver would not open it and only management had access to this device. We still used a portable travel safe but nothing went missing. One negative about our holiday wasn't the fault of the resort but a few inconsiderate guests. They figured that everyone wanted to know what they were doing by yelling all the time( at the beach, pool or restaurants) and waking up guests by yelling, slamming doors and running up and down halls between 1 and 4 in the morning. This only happened the last two days we were there and I mentioned it at the front when we left so hopefully security was around at that time in the morning for the other guests. There is a lot of walking but it wasn't a problem for us. It was needed after all the great food we had.If you have difficulty with mobility then it wouldn't be as enjoyable. Great areas for walking and running in the resort area and on the beach. We would recommend it based on our experience. We wouldn't return because we like to experience different places and we enjoy trying different foods.

There is a private huge pool with thick cushions, enough for everyone, and they are strict about not letting people without a black band remain in the area. There is a private bar, conceriage, and bathroom right in the area. The villas are close to all the restaurants and nightly entertainment. I find I don't mind walking to the beach during the day, but at night when I am dressed up with high heels on, I would rather be close to the restaurants and entertainment. You definately need water shoes to swim in the ocean, especially this time of year. The reg flag is up quite a bit, and the water is very wavy. We noticed that the water was a bit brown this time, in spots, but it was not that way in Dec, or the winter. I am sure its from all the storms they have been having.

As is the sunset side! THey are the same resort, just two different sides! Me and my boyfriend (aged 24) just got back a few days ago. We stayed for a week and had a fantasitic time!! We'd recommond this resort to anyone!! And we will probebly go back in the future!! The resort and grounds: THis resort is kept so clean!! The employees are working really hard to keep it this way! Yes, there are marble floors everywhere, but we did not find them slippery AT ALL!! just excersise caution if you see a wet spot or your shoes are wet! people who have said that theyve slipped.. i just duno what to say about that... THe grounds are very pretty! THis resort is MASSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We had a room in the middle so it was a good location for us, as it was inbetween in the beach and the main lobby area. THe pools and the beach: There are like 10 pools at this place!! they are everywhere! HUGE and 3 with swim up bars!!! You can always find a place at the pools and the beach!! THe beach is great!! only downfall is the water is a bit browm for the first 20 feet or so (see attached pic) however, this did not stop us from going in, and it is only because it is rainy season! IM sure this will clear up in a few weeks. THe Room: We just had a standard room, the absolut basic! And we LOVED IT! by far the nicest room we have ever stayed in!! NIce washroom, bed was comfortable and seating area was nice! THeres a ceiling van, and air conditioning, so heat is never an issue!! GOING PLATINUM IS NOT NECCESARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i cant stress this enough!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we debated about it before we left, but decided just to stay basic!! Unless you need a jacuzzi on your patio, and like to have an ocean view, you dont need platinum!! We could book dinner at ALL OF THE RESTAURANTS! we had INTERNET ACCESS at the room next to the sports bar! and there are enough pools and bars for PLENTY of people to share!! The food: GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!! we ate at 6 out of the 7 a la cartes!! My boyfriends favourite was mama mia (the italian) he had the veal which he raved about!! my favourite was the MISO (the japanese) which was better than any japanese restaurant around here, and our least favourite was the los olas (seafood). I dont understand why so many people have complained about the buffet, unless they were going right before it closed.. We have no complaints about it whatsoever!!!!!!!! the food was tasty, warm and a great selection!! we did prefer the buffet closer to the beach as opposed to the riveria buffet tho! The Entertainment: This was a great aspect to this resort!! They have nightly pre shows at 8:30 in the central courtyard which were very enjoyable, and then at 9:30 they have the main show in the theatre! (which is enormous by the way) !! we watched the shows every night and some were corny . yes.. but some were great, and all were funny and a great way to spend an hour. THe disco: THis place is awwwwwwweessommee!! We had some very good times here!! As frequent clubbers, we were very impressed with this disco!! PRINCESS does it right!! The service: Great, fantastic, wonderful!!! no complaints!!!!!!!!!!! all employees are very nice!!!!!!!!! everyone says hola! they all try very hard to please you and make your experience a memorable one!! once again i dont know why some people have complained about the service! it was impeccable to us!!! Better service than we've ever recieved before.. of course tipping is the right thing to do!! we tipped $2 dollars for the maid, $1 for the fridge guy, $5 dollars for every a la carte meal, and then $1 here and there, at least 10 dollars a day! Saul - the bartender is fantasitc!! Ruti - sweetest girl ever! look for her at the theatre bar! overall!! we had a great time!!!! if this isnt a 5 star resort we would like to see what one is!! cause this place is awesome!!!!!! it rained 4 out of the 7 days and we still had the time of our lives!!

We could not open safe so bellboy contacted security who arrived about 5 mins later and sorted it out. ROOM.. Booked in to junior suite which was fine, on ground floor overlooking the back(would ask for a front or pool view if staying there again). Bathroom has 2 sinks toilet and good sized shower(beware that the water does run into the bathroom from the shower so put a towel down before hand)Towels flannels soap, shower gel/shampoo and other bits and bobs are all provided. Fridge is stocked daily (2xbeers 4xpop and 3 litres water. GROUNDS.. The complex is big takes about 10 mins to walk from reception to beach. The grounds themselves are excellent and there is always staff working to keep them that way.There are plenty of sunloungers all over the grounds and lots of pools(most popular ones with swim up bars where some of the activities take place but there are plenty of quieter spots to relax and chill out.One word of warning when it rains the marble floors get very slippy so do be carefull(i come face to face with the marble on two occasions) ENTERTAINMENT/ACTIVITIES.. There are both daily and evening activities/entertainment ranging from beach volleyball,football,archery etc. during the day to shows on the night you also get singers outside the chill out bar for hour or two each night. Also down on the beach your have watersports some of which you have to pay for. BARS/DRINKS.. Enough bars to keep everyone happy 2 lobby bars right opposite the reception desks so you can get a drink as soon as you check in before going to your room.All the bars serve international drinks ie Smirnoff vodka Gordons gin Jack daniels etc but do ask for them by name or you will end up with the house spirits.They also serve a good variety of soft drinks, cocktails alcoholic and non alcoholic various coffees and teas(careful some of the teas are spicy)There are a couple of swim up bars but you can sit and have a drink there on the side if you don,t want to go in pool. There is a bar on the beach a chill out bar, disco bar and a 24hr sports bar(only bar thats open for all 24hrs) There are also bars to use in between the al a carte restaurants whilst waiting for your table) They only have 1 draught beer in all the bars though (Corona) but do try some of the cocktails with or without alcohol. FOOD/RESTAURANTS.. Food is available 24/7 from the sports bar (hot dogs, burgers, chips, nachos)The buffet restaurants have a decent choice of foods but you will need to mix your choices(a couple of times we skipped breakfast had an early lunch and then dinner another time late breakfast skipped lunch then early dinner. AL LA CARTE.. These are a must the only one we did,nt use was the seafood but we ate at all the others. Mexican(twice) japanese,international,swiss fondue,grill and italian. All were very good and no problem with booking just go to any restaurant and book which ever al a carte you want. You can book several at once in advance. BEACH.. Beach is lovely but you may want to take some water shoes as the water has a lote of snones/rocks in but water is crystal clear. You do need to get down early to bag a good spot for sunlounger and the towels do run out quickly so advise you to take your own. STAFF.. Found that staff were very pleasantand spoke/understood english never had to wait long for drinks meals and they also come around the pools and beach to serve you. TIPPING.. Wages here are poor so staff are grateful for tips we gave Bellboy $2 maid & fridge filler $2 per day $1 per visit to buffet and $3-$5 in al a carte and left $s on different occasions in bars(take plenty of $1 bills with you for your stay EXTRAS.. There is a free shuttle bus to PlayaDel Carmen book day before you go from here you can get ferry to Cozumel $14 each way We also had a spa and massage which was about $70 each(really relaxing) Good idea to book a few trips as there is,nt much outside complex.

We stayed in Platinum and my overall impression of the hotel is that is very nice and HUGE! I, like everyone else who reads the Tripadvisor reviews I\u2019m sure, was hesitant after reading all the negative reviews. I have to say the biggest discrepancy I noticed about our stay compared to the reviews was the service. We had outstanding service; the entire staff could not have been nicer. Everyone that we dealt with from the wait staff, the person who drives the golf cart from one end of the resort to the other was fabulous. Check in for us was not an issue as many people have reported. Our room wasn\u2019t ready, but we arrived before it was guaranteed to be ready- no problem. However, we stayed Platinum and the staff in the Platinum lounge either didn't fully know what was included with the Platinum package or didn't want to divulge it. We asked what was included and they told us a list of things, then I remembered reading on tripadvisor about a 1/2 hour massage and so i went back and asked and they said yes of course.. The rooms were nice, the beds were fine, not hard like some resorts. But I have to say the resort does look old and battered already. There were several things in our room, a rusty air exchange vent, knicked wood on the doors and in the closet, stains on the glass divides, that made it seem much older than it was. I don\u2019t think a lot of thought went into the small details of this hotel. For example, there were no dressers to put clothes in, and only 3 small shelves in the closet, so we lived out of suit cases for the week. There are no shelves or ledges in the shower, so you have to keep all products on the floor. Only one outlet instead of a double in the vanity area. I know these are minor and believe me they did not by any means affect my vacation mojo, but they were noticed. I have stayed at several resorts in the area and two really stick out for the attention to detail, everything you could\u2019ve wanted to make your stay comfortable was already there. A lot of the furnishing are worn and stained. My personal opinion on the furnishing is that the hotel purchased gorgeous furnishings- for a house, and not furnishings to withstand hundreds of people in a resort. The exterior of the resort is beautiful, the walkways and statues throughout. People have complained about the food- I have no complaints about the food and I consider myself a \u2018picky\u2019 eater. We ate at the Mexican and the Japanese restaurant and they were good, but I truly preferred the variety of the buffets. When I say that I am a picky eater, I mean that I don\u2019t eat processed food or red meat, so for me, there was a ton to eat: fresh fish, authentic Mexican dishes, pasta, a huge salad bar, the good ol\u2019 salsa and guacamole standby-yum. I never left a restaurant hungry or unsatisfied. If you are a burger and fries eater, they always a few of those items as well, but it was limited. We did have 24 hour room service and after 11:00 pm, there wasn\u2019t much to choose from on the menu, but it was something to eat if you get in late and need something to hold you over till breakfast. The hotel was overall clean, but not compared to the majority of other hotels that I have stayed in Mexico, where there is usually a staff of people cleaning all day. Our room was cleaned everyday, but usually only partially. For example, one day they wouldn\u2019t clean the bathroom, they never wiped off the sink/vanity area or did the floors. They would change the sheets; however, one night I crawled into bed and it felt odd, so I pulled back the covers and saw that they must have used a short sheet and so about 2 feet at the bottom of the bed wasn\u2019t covered with sheets and I was sleeping on a mattress cover. That kind of grossed me out. We also had trouble getting towels everyday; they would leave us 1 large towel and 1 or 2 smaller towels. Odd. If you order room service, you need to call room service when you are done to come get your dishes and they ask you to put them in the hallway. Sometimes they sit there for hours or overnight. One time I noticed that something had taken my piece of chicken off my plate that was waiting in the hall- I am assuming a cat. And I hate to mention the bugs, but.. I understand that we are in the jungle, but bugs are a deal breaker. I saw several men with pesticide cans spraying, but we still saw too many bugs for my liking. We saw a huge bug in the hallway that was barely moving, as though it had been sprayed, but it was approximately 4 inched long and it wasn\u2019t a roach. My concern is that it was on our floor (we were on the second floor) and there are large gaps under each persons doors. My husband killed a bug in the hallway one morning, and security came over and said that it was a scorpion! Ug. Also someone found a bug in one of the swim up rooms pool area and they got the people out of the pool and called security. Ew\u2026 The mosequitos didn't bother me with the exception of one night. The pools were incredible. There could never be an issue of not finding a place at the pool, there were miles of pools! If you wanted shade there were several cabanas and we never had to deal with the towel game. The water was warm and refreshing. We are more beach people than pool people, but the ocean water at the resort was brown and not the gorgeous blue clear that people come to expect in Mexico. I live on Lake Erie and that is what the water looked like. I think that it weather dependent, because others have indicated that the water was gorgeous at other times and we had a friend that was at the Riu Palace that same week as us, and he said the water there was crystal clear. Yes, there were rocks in the water. Along the Princess side, most of the rocks were just along the coast line and then it seemed to be sandy once you got into the water. The Riveria side seemed to have rocks throughout and because you couldn\u2019t see in the water I opted to hang at the pool instead of the beach. The beach was beautiful. It was huge and I loved the little bar down at the beach. Overall the resort is nice. We got an incredible price so for the price I would say it was a top-notch vacation. My memories of the vacation are happy ones \u2013 as every vacation, because, as it\u2019s been said before, I\u2019m not letting the little things impact a vacation. Time off is precious! This last tidbit has nothing to do with the resort review, but thought someone may be interested. My husband and I have been to Cancun about 15 times and we love it; however, I fell in love with downtown Playa. I would take me forever to get tired of that town; it is so quaint, I love the small town feel and everyone was so nice. We are going to go back in December.

It is truly breathtaking, particularly in the evenings. The staff at this hotel were so helpful, we were really grateful. At the start of our trip, we were put in the hotel area near reception where the building works were ongoing. We were lucky to be moved to the main pool area to a corner, top floor room after 3 days after asking nicely. The staff work really hard and are grateful for any tips you can give them. The restaurants are good, we loved the Italian and the Japanese the best. The worst was the french/international restaurant by far. The buffets were not bad but the main buffet got busy and sometimes was not as fresh due to its size. We spent a lot of time at the restaurants nearer the beach for breakfast and lunch. We managed to get 5 a la carte bookings and did not pay any cover charge for the japanese restaurant. It was included. The entertainment staff were really friendly and inclusive. We liked the shows, they were of a high standard in our view. We did not have any problems with mosquitos, we just used the screen on the balcony well to block them out. We used the safe throughout our stay and had no problems with it at all. The sticker on the front did look like it had been lifted previously which concerned me but there was no issue at all. If you go with Thompson, you also get a jacuzzi bath in your room, not just a shower. Really nice rooms. If you leave a few dollars for the maid and the mini bar guy they leave you what you ask for on most days and the room is cleaned well. The only problems we had (apart from the first room issue) was the fan in the room was wired in backwards so didn't work. When we told the staff they laughed and got it fixed within 2 hours. Really good effort we thought. Playa Del Carmen is beautiful. We got the free shuttle bus there a few days and got taxis back to the hotel. It's cheap enough. Overall we had a really wonderful time.

On the journey up to the hotel was a bit scary as there is so much building work going on but when the hotel came into sight that all went away. It is an impressive looking building, lots of marble and chandeliers. We had a smooth check in and a very nice chap called Omar who brought the bags into the rooms. There was a slight problem with my room, but the rep changed it and I was moved to a new room. No problems after that, apart for the mossies who really did like eating my legs - even with lots of bug spray on - i would take the lotion next time as the spray was not really that effective. The rooms were cleaned everyday and the maids did a really good job. I have read reviews that this resort is too big, but this is not the case. It is large, but you can walk from reception to the beach in a brisk 10 mins. My parents managed this no problem and we saw lots of older people wandering about. We did take advantage of the premier shuttle service that everyone can use - not just the ones who have the silver wristbands - you just shout out your room numbers and the bus will stop for you. I think some people did not realise that. We took peso's and dollars - that seemed to work well. The taxi drivers prefer peso's over dollars, but they will still accept them!. We did tip - only when the service was good - which was in all the a la carte restaurants (I would recommend that you make the most of these as the food in the buffet can get a bit samey - which is only to be expected!!). Don't get me wrong, the food in the buffets is perfectly nice. You can book a time slot in all the restaurants by going to the Hacienda restaurant and they give you tickets to take with you on the night of your dinner. Gents beware, take closed shoes with you or wear trainers and long trousers, no sandals and shorts are accepted. Thankfully my dad had some trainers with him!!. The pools are lovely and there are plenty of sun loungers and shades to choose from. The beach is nice, although the water is not as crystal clear as it was in Cuba - but it was warm and the sand lovely. There is a small beach bar that serves anything you want!!. Make sure you ask for the international drink brand you want - eg Gordons or Smirnoff - else you will just be given the cheaper home brand. You can also tell the bar staff to put more in as their measures look large but with big chunks of ice in isn't actually that much:-) The only bad thing is that there is no food allowed out of the buffets. One evening i wasn't feeling that well and i didn't want to go into the buffet place to eat. It wasn't until the next day we realised that you can have room service (only in the deluxe rooms that we were staying in), this is not a service that is allowed in the normal rooms. The guests who were staying in the premier section were allowed to bring food out and we saw many people sat on the loungers with food. I would recommend this hotel to others and would go back again. Although i would see how much it would be to stay in the premier section. I was intruiged by the silver wristbands!!!

The resort and the rooms were kept very clean and our fridge and alcohol were restocked each day. The only day we had a problem with our power going out due to the strength of a blow dryer there was someone from the resort available to fix this within 10 min. I have been to many all inclusive hotels both in the Mayan and in Cancun and I had the best time at this resort.

We were very disappointed with this hotel... The hotel itself is beautiful. The grounds and statues are beautiful. The food at the buffet and by the beach are not good and lack variety. For a 5 star we expected better. Our room was great. We were in building 3. You could walk which was great or you could take the shuttle, but the service was very slow. If the shuttle was not there then you had to wait a good 10 to 15 minutes for it. The service in the buffet and the resturants were excellent. They really do a good job. The floors are really dangerous even though they put up signs so be careful. The beach was terrible... the sand was nice and white but the water was awlful.... brown so brown you could not see anything and the fish attack you in the water... My husband was bitten and was bleeding... it is just not fun at all.... we did not want to go in the water at all. Only one day out of 14 did we have clear water just like a normal ocean.... but if you walk 10 to 15 minutes to the left the beach and water is what you would expect... beautiful clear water amazing.... it seems like there is a river which comes into that part of the ocean and therefore this is what makes the water brown. We have never seen anything like this before. Also the rocks in the water are terrible and you need shoes to get in and out without killing your feet. It is not nice at all. The entertainment at night was not good.... too much lip singing and too much circus acts. Once is enough.... Overall it was a very disappointing vacation and I would not recommend this hotel or beach to anyone. This is definitely not and will never be a 5 star hotel. We have been to many 5 star hotels and this one is not.

I am the only one who who did not have major problems. One room had water pouring out of the lighting fixture whenever the room upstairs used the shower, All of the shower drains pitched the wrong way and water leaked out of the shower all over the floor. When I arrived the room was not clean, same sheets from the previous stay and coffee still in the cups. After a $10.00 tip to the maid, the room was clean the remainder of my trip. The hotel is just too big and under staffed. You must reserve the night before for all restaurants. ( in the resort) We had a couple less than 5 min late and the extreamley rude hostes would not admit them or let them sit with us eventhough they where informed that the couple was on the way and food was on there plate waiting for them. Not to mention our group of 12 was the only people in the place.. Plenty of seats. At another (in the resort) restaurant, the hostes would not seat us togather even though the place could hold at least another 300 people and was very rude as well. Our revervation was for 12. Mind you we were polite the hostes. You also have to book the shuttle a day in advanced ( this was not mentioned) so the hotel staff would not allow the guest to ride the large greyhound bus with five passengers on it going to playa del carmen. It wasnt until the bus driver told the ladies in out group they could ride it for $5.00 usd each. Nice free shuttle. It is easier to take a cab to Playa for 14.00 usd. (about 20 mins away) After may other problems, the group went to talk to the concierge and assistant hotel manager Pedro. We where met by a LONG line of people with complaints as well. After waiting in line for about an hour and talking to the manager for about 2 mins, the manager brought over hotel security to intimidate the guest, HAHAHA amazing! After talking the rude manager, he then raised his hands and said IM done talking to you and walked away. Now I can have fun anyware but I thought this terrible service especialy for an all inclusive.. I would go back the the area but not this hotel. On the other hand it was a beautiful place and the food was pretty good. Most of the staff is polite and work hard. Again too big and too under staffed. The reps from lumos travel are very polite. If you are going, do not expect much. If you are a scuba diver, I went to Puerto Morales to Wet Set Scuba in the Olga De Agua Hotel. Very professional and dam good divers. The hotel they are in is a (dive) but they are great and I would go back and dive with them anytime. For a two tank dive it was $68.00 usd. If you didnt have equipment they would supply it free of charge. The owner Paul as well as his dive master Andreas were great. Would recommend this place for diving.

Great vacation\u201d", "Author": "Brugal", "ReviewID": "UR20355414", "Content": "Hola. My wife and I along with two other couples just returned from a one week stay (Sept 12th-19th) at the Grand Riviera Princess. This was our 10th stay at an All Inclusive resort and third in Mexico, previously staying at the Riu Palace Riviera and the Iberostar Lindo. In our opinion we felt it was the best of the three in Mexico and one of the best overall. We booked our trip with Vacation Travelmart, the second time using them and were completely satisfied. We looked at several different sites and by far they offered the best deal. I\u2019d have no problem recommending or using them again. If traveling with more than two people I\u2019d suggest arranging your own transfers. It worked out much cheaper booking with a company such as Cancun Valet for the 6 of us than if we had booked with Vacmart. Plus we had a private transfer. We flew from Boston to Philadelphia to Cancun on US Air. Aside from a 45 minute delay for a flap issue while in Philly everything went smoothly. We arrived in Cancun a little after 1:00 pm, retrieved our bags and cleared customs within 20 minutes. Pressed the button and the green light appeared so away we went. We ignored all offers for assistance with a friendly \u2018No Gracias\u2019 and found the Cancun Valet rep who was waiting for us holding a sign with my name. We loaded the van, stopped at the 7-11 for some cervezas and off we went on the 35 minute ride to the GRP. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by a Porter who set our luggage aside and directed us to the Platinum desk to check in. Nacho greeted us with a glass of champagne and checked us in. He took his time explaining everything at the resort, circling items on the map and seeing if we had any questions. Even though there are no guarantees we had requested upper level ocean view rooms with king beds a few days before we arrived. We were pleasantly surprised that we received them. Rooms #5101 and #5108, second floor ocean view and #5112, second floor ocean front. After getting our keys and room numbers we walked back to our bags and they were tagged to bring to our rooms. We declined an offer to take the tram and decided to walk to our rooms to acclimate ourselves to the resort. From here on I\u2019ll rate different aspects of the resort on a 1-10 scale. Room -10 We were originally assigned room #5101. The room was beautiful and quite large. Awaiting us in the room was a welcome basket containing cookies, dried fruit and nuts plus a bottle of Gold Tequila. In addition to the Tequila there were bottles of Vodka, Rum, Whiskey and Tequila Blanco. We never opened any of them since the Platinum bar was so close and contained MUCH better quality alcohol. Our complimentary Princess t-shirt and beach bag were also in the room. As previously explained you need to keep a room key or as we did an extra Costco card in the slot as you enter the room in order for all of your electricity to work. Even without the card the mini bar and a/c still worked so it really wasn\u2019t necessary to keep the card in if you didn\u2019t want to. The only negative would be having to reset your alarm clock which took all of, oh maybe 5 seconds. As you walked into the room there\u2019s a large closet on the left containing 12 hangers, a pair of robes and slippers and enough space to store your luggage. Further down the closet you have shelving to store more clothes and your safe which works by entering your own 4 digit code. Off to the right of the closet is the bathroom. First you have the Jacuzzi Tub, and double sink and two stalls to the right, one housing the toilet, the other a large shower. The hotel provides ample toiletries such as shampoo, shower gel, bug wipes, hair brush, sewing kit and bath sponge. There\u2019s also a hair dryer and lighted make up mirror on the wall. Further into the room brings you to the 32\u201d plasma TV and DVD player on the left and large King bed with a padded headboard on the right. Flanking each side of the bed are nightstands with lamps and a drawer for more storage. There are also several low wattage lights above the headboard if more light than the lamps provide is needed. Further into the room brings you to a writing desk/chair and couch on the left and table with two chairs on the right. Lastly you have the sliding door to the balcony. In addition to the glass slider there\u2019s a screen slider which was nice if you wanted fresh air instead of A/C in the room. Speaking of A/C it worked fine. No loud noises and at times we shut it and used the two ceiling fans as it got too cold. The balcony contained another Jacuzzi Tub, which was cleaned every day and a table and two chairs. The ocean was just off to the right and provided us with a great view and place to enjoy a drink at the end of the day. But it got even better. One of the couples we traveled with were assigned #5108 and had troubles with their A/C and room key. After trying to fix it they were given a new room, #5113 which was ocean front and had a GREAT view. They were only staying for 5 nights so we asked at the front desk to be moved into that room for our last two days and they did without hesitation. This room was identical to ours but the view was amazing. In room internet access is provided free of charge. Bring your own Ethernet cable or get one for a $10 deposit with the Platinum Concierge. The plug is located behind the Plasma TV. Sevice-10 From the time we were greeted upon arrival service was exemplary. Check-in was done by Nacho and he was friendly and informative. Our room was made up and cleaned thoroughly every day by 2:00pm. The mini bar restocked by 10:00am. Leave a note and a few dollars inside the fridge and they\u2019ll provide you with what you request. We ordered room service on three occasions, twice for breakfast and once for lunch. They arrived twice in 30 minutes and once in 40. Orders were accurate and hot. The Platinum Concierge\u2019s were always friendly and helpful with any requests and dinner reservations were made for the entire week within 10 minutes. The beach Concierge, Haides, was awesome. She was engaging and eager to help in any way. Sergio and Celsa at the Platinum Bar were fantastic. They couldn\u2019t do enough to keep us happy and our drinks filled and help us brush up on our limited but enthusiastic attempts at speaking Spanish as much as possible. At breakfast and lunch we were seated promptly and coffee/cerveza were served and refilled within minutes. Contrary to a few other reports almost every employee at the resort greeted you with a smile and a hola and seemed happy to assist in any way needed. Grounds-9 The grounds of the resort are beautiful and the landscaping much more mature than I expected. The complex is large but not overwhelming in my opinion. We brought a pedometer to keep track of our walking along the beach and found the resort stretches 4/10\u2019s of a mile from the lobby to the Platinum Suites at the beach. The resort is laid out in a u shape. If facing the ocean the Sunset side is on the right and the Riviera the left. In between pools run 2/3rds the length of the resort starting at the beach. Flowers, plants, palm trees, fountains, statues and palapa huts are placed throughout. The grounds were immaculate and were continuously being cared for. At night the walkways were lined with lights and the resort was stunning. Given a little more time for the trees to reach full maturity the resort will be that much more beautiful. Beach-9 I\u2019m not sure what criteria people are using who say the beach sucked but we thought it was fantastic. We\u2019ve been to beaches throughout North America, the Caribbean and South East Asia and this one more than holds its own in comparison. The nicest? Probably not, but still beautiful. The water was multi shades of aqua and blue plus lots of soft white sand and plenty of palm trees and palapas for shade. Never had a problem finding a lounger, either inside the Platinum section or out. The beach bar was located in between the Riviera and Sunset and always had two bartenders taking orders. In addition, two waitresses were bringing drinks to people on the beach. There was a hut with 6 tables to get massages and on the far southern end was the water sports center where you had the use of snorkeling gear, kayaks or Hobie Cats. For a fee you could also rent Jet Skis or parasail. The first two days at the resort were red flag due to Hurricane Ike passing north of the area so not much action for the water sports. The rest of the week was green with very limited waves. Each day we\u2019d walk the beach to some degree. Walking south was nicer than north. One day we walked to Playa Del Carmen. From the beach bar at the GRP to the dock at the beginning of Avenida Constituyentes we measured it as a 4.6 mile walk. At a moderate clip it took us an hour and 25 minutes. Water shoes were not needed for the walk and I\u2019d recommend bringing a bottle of water or two with you. The only thing preventing this from being a 10 were the rocks in the water. Not terrible and I never used the water shoes I brought but could still be an issue for some. We found if you stayed in the area between the Platinum beach section and the massage hut there were very few if any rocks. Spa/Gym-10 We used the gym almost every day and found it clean, bright and well air conditioned. There were 2 nice universal weight machines, several treadmills, elipticals and spin bikes, 2 rowing machines, a few ab blasters 3 or 4 bosu balls and nice dumbbells, but only up to 10 kgs. They also provide free towels and water. Two large plasmas are on the walls near the treadmills and elipticals. As for the Spa it was beautiful. Staying in Platinum you receive a complimentary 30 minute massage. We decided to upgrade for $40 each to a full massage. They told us to arrive early so that we could make use of the rest of the Spa. We used the hot water Jacuzzi, then the cold water plunge pool. Very refreshing. There was also a sauna, steam room and showers available for use. The massage itself was great. A combination aroma therapy and deep tissue massage. One tip if staying Platinum. Get your coupon for the massage from the Platinum Concierge and bring it with you. If you don\u2019t they told us we\u2019d be charged the full rate for the massages at check out. Pools-10 The pools were wonderful. Both Platinum sections have their own small pools surrounded by plush loungers, beds and palapa huts. Drink service is provided around this area and it\u2019s a great place to lounge. I never actually used the pool in this area since they were pretty small. We did however travel a circuit around the other pools each day. We\u2019d start by getting a drink to go from the Platinum bar, for me either a Negra Modelo or Havana Club Cuba Libre, and the 6 of us would float around the other pools on our floats starting at the Riviera side and ending up at the Sunset. There are a few spots you had to hop out and back in to the pool but it was no big deal. Half way along we\u2019d stop at a swim up bar for a refill or on a few occasions a waitress spotted us and brought us cervezas in the pool. Most of the pools use a salt water filtration system which we all preferred, except for the pool bar pools which we noticed used chlorine for obvious reasons. There was also a noticeable difference in the temperature of the water near the swimout rooms. The temp was much warmer on the Riviera side compared to the Sunset side. Makes sense with all of the previous reports of the Riviera swimouts having sun much longer than the Sunset side. Food. Rated by restaurant Buffets-8 Preferred the beach buffets to the lobby. Food was similar but the layout was better at the beach. More intimate and a special section for Platinum ala carte if you wish. We stuck to the buffet since it offered plenty of selection. Breakfast included scrambled eggs, fried eggs and a made to order omelet station. Also a Mexican section \u2013 rice, beans, quesadilla, chorizo, bacon, ham, sausage. Deli meats, cheeses, muffins, croissants, bagels, breads, waffles, pancakes, potatoes, cereals, fruit, yogurt, juices. Lots to choose from and entirely comparable to any other A/I we\u2019ve stayed at. Food was good and usually hot. Lunch included varieties of chicken, beef, pork, seafood, pasta salads, green salads, pizza, deli platters, chips, guacamole and salsa, quesadillas, burgers, dogs, fries, rice, beans, fruit and dessert bar including awesome coconut ice cream. Absolutely amazing with a drizzle of chocolate sauce. Service for both breakfast and lunch was excellent. Platinum Dinner (held at Mama Mia)-6 I\u2019d say skip this one. It was basically a buffet featuring marinated skirt steak (they called it flank), grilled chicken, pork ribs, shrimp, crab, green lip mussels, pasta station, salads and dessert bar. Service was exceptional but the food just ok. Next time we\u2019d book another ala carte instead. Miso-9 The six of us had our own Hibachi table and had a blast. Miguel was our chef and was very entertaining. For our meal they started us out with 3 pieces of sushi, 1 each of crab, shrimp and vegetable. Next was miso soup followed by a bowl of fantastic fried rice and your choice of stir fried entree. Mine was seafood with grouper, shrimp and mussels. The meal was excellent, better than any Hibachi meal we\u2019ve had at other A/I\u2019s and some Hibachi restaurants back home. Dessert was your choice of banana fritters, fried ice cream or fruit in Midori. Service was excellent once again and we were in and out within 90 minutes Mama Mia-10 Maybe my favorite meal at the resort. They started us with a small plate of mushroom and tomato bruschetta. Next I had the beef carpaccio, thinly sliced beef tenderloin topped with chopped arugula, parmesan shavings, olive oil and sea salt. Following this was seafood soup. It was a lobster bisque base containing shrimp, herbed croutons and drizzled with creme fraiche. Couldn\u2019t decide what to have for my entre so the waiter told me to order both. What the heck, I was on vacation so I got the veal medallions and mushroom risotto all on the same plate. The veal was cooked a perfect medium rare and melted in your mouth. The risotto was also fantastic as was the entire meal. Dessert was skipped since as you may have guessed I was pretty full. La Fleur-7 The international restaurant. I ordered the foie gras but they were out so I had the shrimp ceviche. It was basically a small terrine consisting of 4 or 5 tiny shrimp over a little bed of salsa. Next was the Mexican Caribbean seafood soup. 3 larger shrimp and some green lip mussels in a nice broth. My entr\u00e9e was the beef tenderloin. It was tender and tasty and cooked perfectly, but the presentation was a little bizarre. The menu stated it was served with chocolate souffle which I thought was just one of those things that was lost in translation, maybe served with a chocolate mole sauce or something. Turned out it wasn't. The steak was served with what looked like a small cupcake and tasted like a brownie. That's it, no potato or vegetable of any type. I found it pretty amusing. Dessert was a plate of small petit fours that we picked on. They were quite good. Fondue-9 The restaurant is located in one half of the Sunset beach buffet. It started out kind of shaky with it taking almost an hour to get our salads and soup but got much better after that. Thankfully drink service was prompt and kept us occupied. The food was quite good and the favorite meal of 3 of our crew. I had a crab salad which consisted of a stuffed crab shell served on a small bed of greens. Following was shrimp bisque that was excellent. The entree consisted of a large platter of chicken, beef, salmon, shrimp, broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, zucchini and asparagus accompanied by a pot of melted cheese made up of swiss, manchego and I think queso fresco. Dessert was a big pot of melted chocolate served with strawberries, bananas, oreo cookies, chocolate cake, cantelope, pineapple and marshmallows that you dip in the chocolate. Very decadent!! Las Olas-8 Seafood restaurant located in the other half of the Sunset beach buffet. I started with the guacamole and squid appetizer which was a small corn tortilla cup filled with guacamole and topped with fried squid rings. Next was the seafood fideo. Fideo is a version of paella made with short pasta the width of spaghetti instead of rice. When done properly it\u2019s excellent. This one was perfectly prepared with shrimp, mussels and squid. For our entr\u00e9e we ordered the Princess Grilled Seafood platter. It\u2019s served for two and consisted of grilled grouper, snapper, shrimp, head-on prawns, cuttlefish, New Zealand green lip mussels, red bliss potatoes, and assorted vegetables. It was excellent!! We skipped dessert and headed up to the lobby buffet for some coconut ice cream. La Hacienda-8 Mexican restaurant. We started with the tomato based soup Azteca, served with avocado and tortilla strips, it was excellent. Then they serve you sides of guacamole, salsa and a hot sauce to have with your meal. Then if you choose you can move onto the salad and hor douvre bar which offers you a choice off salads and assorted Mexican items such as tamales, empanadas and quesadillas. The cactus wrapped tamales were filled with pork and very tasty. Next I had the mixed chicken and beef fajitas served on a sizzling platter with peppers onions, refried beans, sour cream and flour tortillas. A very good meal and a lot of food. No dessert this night. Miscellaneous For us Platinum was a great choice. We made use of room service on three occasions and the free in room internet was great to keep in touch with family and my friends here on Trip Advisor. If you don\u2019t want to bring your laptop there are 4 nice computers available free of charge in the Platinum lobby. Just a tip, you need to press control-alt-#2 key to get the @ symbol. Dinner reservations were a snap with our own Concierge and I really took advantage of the Platinum bar. It was a quick little walk from our rooms to grab a drink whenever we had the urge and the 7 year old Havana Club rum became a favorite of mine. They also had a selection of four beers in bottles including the excellent Negra Modelo, and if you had the urge Bud and O\u2019Doul\u201ds were served in cans. Don Julio Blanco tequila was available here as were 7 or 8 other brands of Tequila. There were also snacks served all day at Platinum. Breakfast provided, croissants, danish, muffins and fruit. Lunch always had mini sandwiches, chips and fantastic guacamole, salsa, assorted cheese and shrimp cocktail. After 5:00pm there was an assorted of delicious French pastries. Plastic plates are provided to bring food out to your lounger or back to your room. I still think we would have had a great time if we hadn\u2019t stayed in Platinum but it provided that little bit extra for us that made a great trip a memorable one. And again I can\u2019t say enough about Sergio and Celsa. . I hope the resort realizes what they have in these two. We went to Playa Del Carmen on two occasions. The first trip the 6 of us took the bus from the resort. You have to book it the day before you want to go but it\u2019s free of charge. We went at 1:00pm and came back at 6:00pm. It drops you off and picks you up on Avenida Constituyentes two blocks up from 5th ave. The girls did the shopping and the guys hit the bars, spending most of our time at the Tequila Barrel drinking ice cold cervezas and watching football. The second time Nisi and I walked to Playa and took a cab back for $14. We checked out the Mega and Wal-mart in search of Havana Club rum and a walked up and down 5th avenue stopping to have a margarita at Hemmingway\u2019s and lunch at little Lebanese restaurant called Maktub. Very affordable and authentic food. We did one excursion. We booked it in the lobby with Alltournative Tours for $118 per person. It included private van transfer to Tulum. Our guide Jorge was fantastic. He gave us a guided tour of the ruins and then left us on our own to swim at the fantastic beach below the ruins. After Tulum we traveled to a Mayan ranch where we took a 10 minute bike tour of the village followed by a series of thrilling Zip Lines over the Jungle. Following the Zip Line we had a private purification ceremony with a Mayan holy man and then a snorkel through the beautiful cenote., finally ending the day with an authentic Mayan lunch. It was a full and fantastic day but we were still able to be back at the resort by 5:00pm. On only one occasion did we have a problem with mosquitoes. We decided to walk to the lobby one evening via the Riviera service road. We got munched on pretty good. From that point on I would put on a little off and didn\u2019t suffer another bite. We never had a problem with mosquitoes in either of our rooms, nor did our fellow travelers. Yes, there\u2019s a lot or marble around the resort but not really more than other resorts we\u2019ve been to. I never once saw anyone wipe out, never saw people with crutches, broken bones or bandages or heard any horror stories from people telling of their spills or workers laughing at them and refusing to help when they did. Use common sense and you\u2019ll be fine. We never had a problem with theft in any of our rooms. The safes all worked properly and nothing was missing from any of our rooms throughout the trip. We came across one person the entire time in Mexico, both on and off the resort who we had trouble conversing with and that was at Maktub restaurant. It seems every year we travel to a resort the English gets better and better. I shake my head at anyone who claims they had trouble getting people to understand them. Our Spanish is limited but we try. That said I found myself relying on it less than any other vacation we\u2019ve taken. In closing we had a fantastic vacation. Maybe my expectations were lowered because of the abuse this resort has taken over the past few months but I don\u2019t think so. Plus our fellow travelers had never heard of Trip Advisor and all LOVED the resort. Maybe they\u2019re finally getting it or maybe we got lucky, my guess is the former. I\u2019d recommend this resort without hesitation. If interested we have more pictures of the resort on Webshots. Look at my Trip Advisor profile for the web address.

We went to the bar right there and before we had our drinks, he had a new room for us with an oceanview!. He then booked all our dinners and that was it. His english was superb and the service 1st class. During the week there were a couple of changes to our dining arrangements and we were asked to rebook. it was easy and wonderful. Our first a la carte restaurant was the seafood. The wait was over an hour although we had reservations, the food was not very good at all, nor the service. That is the only complaint we had. From that point on, all service and restaurants were fabulous!. The suite was beautiful, a few drawers would have been good. We barely needed our bug spray, one night maybe.

Back then, there were some problems here and there and the property gave us a free stay for one week all inclusive in a junior suite. So, my brother and I came back in August. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to see we had been upgraded to a platinum suite on the Sunset side. I have never had any issues with this hotel, it is absolutely wonderful. Although I would not recommend for older people because it is almost too big for itself. The one thing they could use is more shuttles to and from the platinum suites. It is just over a kilometer from the platinum suites to the front lobby. And in the daytime, when the sun is out in full force you do not want to walk the whole way, trust me, especially in August. I think most people are just too damn picky when they travel down to this hotel. The place is absolutely beautiful, and the staff is eager to help you in any way. The hotel seemed to die off quickly though after the show ended. Most shows were fantastic but some were pretty lame. The beach is great, a little rocky close to shore but you can walk out for a long ways and it is quite sandy out there. You just have to watch out and be careful. Plenty of chairs and palapas compared to the last time we were here. The rooms are always beautiful. The only thing is, both times I have been here the showers are built funny in some rooms. They drain out into the bathroom and make a huge mess. So, both times here we had to change rooms, it was a pain in the [-], but, I can deal with it. Other reviewers are absolutely correct about the mosquitoes. They are vicious and hungry at night. I would advise to bring some spray. They do fog the bushes during the day sometimes, but try to stay clear of that. They seem to forget that it is poison and people probably shouldnt be breathing it. The shuttles would drive right through the smoke, duh!!! I am 29 and my brother is 27 and we both had a blast. I would for sure come back in a second, I love the place and cant wait to return. Again, it may not be for older people or for people looking for a huge party because it does quiet down quickly at night. You can go with the entertainment crew to Playa del Carmen which is a short distance away. They go there nightly and party with you. There are pools a plenty and bars a plenty and they are amazing as well. They are free flowing and you can swim around the whole resort just about from one pool to the next, they are huge. Anyways, I cant wait to comeback, and if you come here you will not be disappointed. I had a blast and I have been to Mexico and the Caribbean many times before and this is one of the best places I have been.

We stayed closer to the check-in/reception area, so to out walk to the beach was about 15 mins to the beach. THe place is huge! Grounds: Awesome. Well-kept, clean, great scenery: fountains, gazebos, gardens, sculptures. I had a pet iguna in my garden outside my balcony...i named him Henry! Food: I thought it was good! The japanese place was a joke however and I've never had such bad service. I was seriously putting the server out when i asked for a glass of wine (and it was my birthday might I add).

In saying this, they are seriously under staffed and i felt bad for some employees who just seemed over worked. I think this will change.

The hotel itself is pretty close to excellent. Very luxurious rooms, very nice site. Small issues in the room, for instance the shower flooring leans the wrong way, so water does not drain naturally towards the drain. Authorities told us it is a consttruction issue in all rooms. We fixed the problems by creating a small water barrier with towels. Bu this does not detract from the beauty and luxury of the hotel. The hotel is nothing short of lavish. The beach. Sometimes there is a shortage of chairs in the shade on the beach. No issue if you get there before 10 AM - but we were there in no season. The beach is nice, but there are many rocks/pebbles in the water, aing it unconfrtable. hard to get into and out of water due to rocks and sharp decline. Also, we found several pieces of broken glass on the beach, making us a little nervous. The food. Food is OK. I have red some reviews really bashing the food. We found it to be OK, but nothing to write home about. It is of a general good quality. The food is generally tasteless. The \"restaurants\" were rather poor - looks like the resort wants to give itself an air of sophistication, but the food is not at the level.

We were there with one other married couple. All 4 of us had read the reviews on this site and were braced for the worse\u2026only thing is, it never came. We all laughed as we thought back to what others had negatively written about in the resort. Let\u2019s take for example the check-in: Check out is at noon; therefore check-in needs to be a few hours later so they can CLEAN THE ROOMS. We arrived around 11:30am local time. We checked in right away but were told the rooms were not available until 3pm. They said to walk the grounds, go have lunch and enjoy the bars. We went back up to the front desk about 2:30 and found out the rooms were just about done. We received our keys and as I was unlocking the door, our luggage showed up. It seems there are A LOT of impatient people writing reviews here\u2026 Just so this thing isn\u2019t too long, I\u2019ll break everything down into categories. For the record, we were in the Jr. Deluxe Suite with our own private pool entrance, which was AWESOME. Spend the extra couple of bucks. Okay, here we go: FOOD: One word, FANTASTIC. From the buffet to the restaurants, just about everything was great. The buffet changes a little every day, but I can see where people would get bored if they were eating there 3 nights in a row. Maybe if they had a brain they would have known that reservations in the restaurants aren\u2019t that hard to come by as some have said. Here\u2019s the system; from 11am-2pm all reservations can be made in ANY of the restaurants FOR any of the restaurants. Then, from 2pm-5pm, you can make reservations for ANY of the restaurants at the concierge desk. You can\u2019t eat in the seafood or Asian restaurants for free if you\u2019re not a Platinum guest. You can still eat there, it\u2019ll just cost you. We ate at the Mexican restaurant the 2nd night of our stay, the International restaurant the 3rd night and the Italian restaurant the 4th night. All three were fantastic and I would take friends to any of them if they were just regular restaurants in my neighborhood. We stayed at the resort for 5 days and 4 nights. Out of the 4 nights we ate in a restaurant, not the buffet. Does that sound like it\u2019s hard to get reservations? People are just stupid and lazy. As for the buffets for breakfast, there were fine. Freshly made omelets, fresh fruit, good coffee and every kind of breakfast meat you can think of\u2026except scrapple. Lunch was also very good. The buffets in the front of the resort have more of a selection, but the drink service is a little slower due to the larger amounts of people. The buffets closest to the beach were a little smaller but the service was great. POOLS: The pools were plentiful and abundant! They were everywhere. It makes for a great scene and even better pictures. The water was a little warm for my taste, but that\u2019s what happens to water in Mexico in August. There\u2019s one (at least I think there\u2019s only one) salt water pool. I didn\u2019t see any signs saying that and it was a surprise once I jumped in, but the swim up bar here is much less crowded then the ones in the middle of the resort. PEOPLE/STAFF: They couldn\u2019t have been nicer. If I had to say \u201cHola!\u201d one more time someone was going to die. Seriously, we didn\u2019t run into one rude or unaccommodating person here. I guess the resort has fired all the ones mentioned in the previous reviews\u2026 SHOWS: My wife & I went to one. It was a dance thing. It was all right\u2026we\u2019re not in Vegas though! The other couple we were with attended 4 shows and said they were amused (and by \u201camused\u201d I think they meant like watching your kids dance recital) by the ones I didn\u2019t see. GROUNDS/SCENEREY: All of it is gorgeous. We did see where the construction was, but it\u2019s not in your face like a lot of people have made it out to be. The grounds themselves are HUGE. It takes the better part of 10 minutes to walk from the front of the resort to the beach. It can be a very long walk if you\u2019re already tired. Again though, the grounds are beautiful. OUTSIDE EXCURSIONS: We went on two excursions, both were half days. The first one was to Tulum (Mayan Ruins) and cost $70/person. This was a great trip to see an amazing place! We had a 45 minute guided tour and then we were free to roam around for almost 2 hours. Bring your bathing suit because this excursion has one of the most beautiful beaches I\u2019ve ever seen. We went snorkeling for our second excursion at $30/person. It was just okay. We had 2-45 minute sessions; one was shallow water (3-8 feet) and the second was deep water (10-30 feet). There wasn\u2019t much to see in the deep water and there were about 20 people in our group which made for some tight swimming. TIPPING: Not my idea of an \u201call-inclusive\u201d if you have to tip, but after emailing other people who had stayed here on this site, I was able to get an idea of what to leave who: Housekeeping: $3/day, left on the dresser next to the TV w/ a note saying \u201cGracias!\u201d so she knew it was hers. Minibar Filler: $2/day, but you can do whatever you want here because no matter how many notes you leave asking for more than 2 cans of beer, that\u2019s all you get. We left the money in the fridge. Waiters/Waitresses: $2/meal in the buffet, a little more in the restaurants if they were good. Bartenders: $2-$10 depending on how long we were at the bar. Bellhops: $2 BRING A LOT OF ONES!!! Overall, we had a fantastic experience here and would definitely return. Don\u2019t head to this place with negative thoughts or that\u2019s all you\u2019ll see. One last tip\u2026exchange some money at the concierge for some $20 Pesos. They are plastic coated and hold up well at the swim-up bars! Thanks for reading this LONG review! If you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to email me here with them.

My review may seem a little biased, afterall, even with all of the negative reviews of the sister properties, we had two things going for us - friends of ours had already stayed here in the Spring and we had stayed at a Princess resort in the Dominican Republic last summer. First of all, if you do plan to book a trip to either the Sunset or Riviera property look into upgrading yourself into the Platinum Suites or the Villa Laguna Suites (soon to be adults-only). Read all of the reviews from the past and you will notice that most of the positive ones speak of the Platinum or Villa suites. Talk to your travel agent about the specifics of these upgrades BUT they are definitely worth it. Why? My wife and I booked our stay in one of the Villa Laguna Suites, requesting an upper floor suite. The VLSs are comprised of 48 suites in 12 quads that surround a manmade lagoon just beyond the Spa and Health Club near the main part of the hotel. These suites also overlook a private pool, bar and concierge and this area is accessed by a series of bridges with gates. While our arrival wasn't exactly what was stated in the brochure - cold towels, champagne and a private check-in - we did receive the champagne and a speedy turn to our suite. Opening the door to our suite, we found a plate of goodies and a 500ml gift-wrapped bottle of gold tequila on the coffee table. On the table with the flat screen TV was a fully stocked bar - whiskey, rum (Bacardi!!!), vodka and tequila. Also, the mini-fridge below had beer and soda inside. I could go on and on about the room itself but you really have to look at pictures to realize just how nice the room's design and layout is. Sure, there are no drawers to put your clothes in but the closet did well enough for the two of us for a week. The Lagoon - Every VLS user gets a BLACK bracelet, signifying that they are staying in the highest level suite on the property. This allows them to use the Lagoon's pool, bar and concierge exclusively. The pool itself is probably best on the property. There are built-in lounging beds in the pool with more than enough sun loungers and cabanas surrounding it. A jacuzzi sits within the pillars nearest the bar end of the pool, too. Unbelievably, the pool actually heats up from the day's sun and is at its warmest after 3pm. Beach towels are always on hand here so a towel card is not required (bonus). Jeremias, the pool's main bartender, is as friendly as your best friend or neighbor and he serves up an enending supply of whatever you fancy - in our case, Mango Margaritas made with real mangoes. Maribel and Emma, the pool concierges, work from 7am to 7pm and if you have a problem or need something changed, they will get it done. Beyond that, these 3 always have a smile for you when you go to talk to them. For VLS users, here is where you can make all of your A La Carte restaurant reservations. The property, while large and long from lobby to the beach, isn't as bad as you might read about. A walk from the Junior suites or the Sunset or Riviera buffet to the beach may take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes at most. Really, who cares? You're here on vacation, go quick or go slow. Anywhere in between and the walk is fairly short. Enjoy your walk as the grounds are beautifully kept and the paths adorned with statues. Bring your camera along and take some photos along the way. I can't comment on the other accomodations but the closer you get to the beach, the better they seem to be - Junior, Junior Deluxe, Jr Dlx w/ Swim up, Platinum. We didn't make use of any of the pools along the way but they are big and there are lots of them. The busiest seemed to be the one on the Sunset side of the path with the very large swim-up bar. The Beach - To get to the beach there are 3(?) bridges that cross over a swamp. There always seemed to be a lot of lounge chairs and palapas available whenever we went to the beach but I think this was due to the fact that we came at the beginning of low season. I can't rave about the beach area here other than to say that the sand is some of the best I've seen in the Caribbean. You really have to navigate your way through the water to avoid some of the boulders embedded into the ground. While aqua socks may help some, just avoiding these big rocks is the best advice. To put it mildly, my wife enjoyed being in the water WAY more than I did. Oh yeah, Platinum and VLS guests get there own roped-off area complete with bar service. The Restaurants - We managed to have all of our A la Carte restaurant reservations booked for us in advance by email (concierge@princess-hotels or something like that). Now for the Good and the Bad. Miso (Teppanyaki or Hibachi style) - Good; Le Fleur - Great lamb; Mamma Mia - Average but very good Veal; the Fondue - average but worth a try if you like to dip everything in cheese; La Hacienda - Good for Mayan-inspired Mexican dishes. We missed out on La Vaqueria (the Grill) on our last night but heard good things about it from friends we made along the way. The buffets neither shined nor sucked as you pretty much got what you expected. On the positive side, lots of fresh tropical fruit and veggies, wicked freshly made salsa and guacamole, lots of selection and cold bevvies in the afternoon and evening. On the bad, the coffee wasn't nearly strong enough and they didn't start bringing out the mangoes until our last day. Luckily, our caffeine addiction was tempered by the cappucinos made at the Sunset lobby bar. Is it a 5-star? Not yet but somewhere down the road, maybe. Outside of the Room Service menu by the phone, I found absolutely no other information about the resort or about Princess hotels. It would've been nice to have a little reader about the property and the property owners as well as some info about getting around the resort and getting out to visit. You really have to know where and what you want to do prior to going. Language could've been a problem for us but we didn't let it and we got out to do 3 trips - Chichen Itza (all day), Tulum (1/2 day) and Playa del Carmen (free shuttle). The 2 trips to the Mayan ruins will be unforgettable for us but for others there are many options - both for adults and children. Planned properly = great memories. If you want 5-star service, go to an established 5-star resort. These 2 properties are too young to be judged so thoroughly. If you want a great value vacation at a new 5-star resort, try these and make sure you opt for the Platinum or Villa Laguna package.

Overall, I would say that the resort was pretty good. The good points: The rooms are really nice, the fridge was stocked early every day, the maids did the room punctually and did a good job. The bathrooms are definately above average. The restaurants are pretty decent, but none had the wow factor. The Japanese came close if you get a reservation to eat at the table where they cook the food in front of you. The Italian was very good, but the waiter recommended the lasagna and it was very good. I tried to order a few other things first, but he talked me out of it. Just a piece of advise, if you're not sure ask the waiters, they are surprisingly honest. The kids really liked the Fondue especially the chocolate fondue at the end. The buffets are good for breakfast and lunch, but border terrible at night. Some times it was good, but most times you have to struggle to find something you like or even at all. They often run out of stuff. The buffets near the lobby are just plain terrible. This is the only place in the resort that I can say that the service was very, very bad and very unfriendly. Avoid those at all cost. No complaints about the bar service. They never gave the kids any problems with giving them their drinks which is nice. Other resorts serve the kids if there is no one around and often refuse to blend stuff for them, but that was not the case here. These guys word incredibly hard. At the most, you wait a few minutes and that's at all the bars even at night. The beach is really nice, great for snorkelling, but bring water shoes, you won't regret it. You can swim without it as there are areas that are sandy, but when the water is a little ruff, it's hard to see the sandy areas from the rockier parts of the beach. You can get a $40/hour massage right on the beach - the best deal in town. Well worth it. The Mayan Riviera area is really awesome, and it offers many great day tours and things to do. Bad points: If you have to go to the front desk to resolve any issue, you're out of luck. They speak English and understand your complaint, but do absolutely nothing to help you out and tend to blame you for the problem. We has a lot of problems with our keys that wouldn't work and they couldn't care less. It's a long walk to the lobby when they key doesn't work. The consierge service isn't any better. We went there when our key problem kept persisting, and he was rude. If you get a room facing the back of the hotel (not facing the pool), you will be eaten alive with mosquitos. It was so bad, we changed rooms and got one facing the pool, much better. Bring bug spray. The hotel is massive 15 to 20 minute walk end to end and yet not enough service. Most of the bars close by 11:00 (not that there's many once the pool bars close) after and they only ones open are the sports bar and casino, both located by the lobby. If you have a room nearer to the beach, forget getting a nightcap. No snack shack or snacks at the beach. There are really no activities at the beach. They should use that space up and do BBQs or shows there at night. The disco is nice, but they tend to only play latin music - you just have to be in the mood for mexican disco. The kids club is good if you have young children, but if they are older than 6 or 7, they won't like it. There are not many acitivities and despite their claims, there is no teenage or tween club. My kids hated it and only went once or twice. You have to make reservations at the restaurants, and they only take them for 2 days at a time. You have to make them at the restaurants near the lobby. If you are not there by 9:00 AM, forget the good times or the better restaurants. Often all they offer is 6:00 PM or 9:00 PM (too late with kids). It is a very bad system and they don't seem to have any idea how to fix it. It becomes a pain in the butt when you have to make reservations and time your evening accordingly - I'm on vacation, I want to go when I'm ready to eat. Overall, the resort was beautiful and we had a really great time. We had read the reviews and went there with an open mind and that worked well for us. I make some negative comments for your info and so that you know what to expect, but they are not deal killers. It might be a 5 star in the future, but they really have a long way to go, I would say a 4 max. Thetwo really bad points that stick out are the buffets near the lobby and the service we received at the front desk. The two really good points were the beach and the great staff that work there. Would I go back there? Only if I had a great deal - in all reality there are many better hotels for the price. I would definately go back to the Mayan Riviera, but I'd try a different hotel.", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cFear not!\u201d", "Author": "jtin", "ReviewID": "UR19385707", "Content": "After 2 weeks of beautiful sunshine and relaxing atmosphere I can say I was very sad to come home.

I think the management must have realised this though as blocks 7 and 8 were closed down completely on our last day for refurbishment. This is a very large resort with the most beautiful grounds and beach ( a little rocky in places just need to find your own path in over the sandy patches). I would recommend the restaurants - we had no problem booking them straight after breakfast at the restaurants themselves. I have heard that Thompson are upgrading this to platinum next year - they will need to get some of these minor service issues sorted I think.

My number one suggestion would be call your travel agent/ who ever you booked through right now and upgrade to at least a platinum suite, but preferably a Laguna Villa Suite. We had a Laguna villa suite and by far the best place to stay on the resort. The Laguna suites have their own pool, that it is much larger than the platinum pool. The Laguna pool area is never crowded, was always quiet, had our own bar( with Jeramias serving drinks, and is very nice guy) and our own bathroom. You have your own concierge (Emma is her name and she is great!) there to book your meals or what not with no line, although don\u2019t expect to get dinners the same night. We had lounge chairs in in the water and out, also had cabanas to be lazy in. It is just a very relaxing place to hang out. Also we heard that others in the junior suites were having trouble getting towels, but we always had towels. And only Laguna villa people are allowed in the pool and Laguna area. Best deal, call and get the upgrade Room: The rooms are great, and loved the outside shower . . Was always clean, and never had any theft or plumbing issues. Mosquitoes were a small issue, but defiantly bring \"OFF\". Beach: We only went to the beach twice and both times it was just to look at the ocean. The rest of the resort is big and somewhat crowded so we stayed in the Laguna area. Location: Like mentioned in another post, the resort is remotely located so to get to Playa de Carmen you have to 1. Book your free shuttle a day in advance or 2. pay $14 US to get to town via taxi. We did the taxi thing for the ease of not having to make one of the scheduled pick up times in playa. Food: Like everything else you have to book a day in advance, so we only ate at Mama Mia( Italian) and Miso( hibachi). I would recommend Miso. The food was great. The breakfast/ lunch buffets are typical resort buffets. If you walk into a buffet like that expecting gourmet food, you will be disappointed. Saying that we found stuff we liked and some we didn\u2019t, but always walked away full. Only problem was (this one is for Canadian Trey) they didn\u2019t serve beer at breakfast.

There were 17 in our party ranging in age from 70 years to 6 months. and everyone had a great time. All of us were upgraded to Platinum. I was never really sure why we were upgraded but was very glad we were. We were all in the same building toward the back of the property, very close to the beach. Platinum amenities: We had a small, private pool for platinum guests that was always quiet, very convenient and never crowded. Towels were provided and we never had to worry about those bothersome towel cards. There were always light refreshments and a full bar in the platinum lounge. There were four computers in the lounge with full Internet access. The Lounge was a great meeting place for our large group. Also, there was a concierge there who could book our dinner reservations for us. Never an issue getting a reservation, even with our large group. Rooms: Ours was clean and stocked with whatever we requested. Bathrobes and slippers in our rooms and we received three bottles of liquor and dried fruit on the second day. Very nice. Location: Right by the beach and close to three pools. There was a full buffet one building over. Shuttle from our area to the main lobby about every 10-15 minutes. Took about 10 minutes to walk it, but if the weather was cool, very pleasant. Food: The buffet was tasty but a little boring. The guacamole was fantastic. I ate it for EVERY meal. Italian restaurant was the best, followed by the Japanese hibachi. Seafood restaurant was mediocre. Overall, the food was never bad and often very good. Wedding: Absolutely beautiful. The setting was lovely, the ceremony was very nice. Photographer did a wonderful job. Went off without a hitch. The bride was a princess, of course. Ground transportation: We were the last stop on the way to the hotel. Bring some cash and enjoy some cervezas on the way. We had a private shuttle on the way back to the airport (only one other couple) so the trip was very fast. Only complaint: We had a large party and every one of us had a better room than the bride and groom. I had read an earlier complaint about the same thing. It seems like it would be very easy to fix this. Key takaways: Upgrade to Platinum if at all possible. Remember the marble floors are VERY slippery. We saw lots of falls. We were able to get a late checkout by only paying $10/hour after noon. Since our shuttle did not leave the hotel until 3:30, this allowed us to fully enjoy an almost full day for only $30. Money very well spent. A 5 star all-inclusive in Mexico is not the same as a 5 star hotel in the US. You're in Mexico...relax. I would absolutely go back, but I would make sure I was platinum.

My husband and I chose the resort blindly on a suggestion from our travel agent and after reading reviews here were terrified to go. However, I can very safely and easily say that this was the best vacation we have ever taken. From beginning to end, we received nothing but first class service and VIP treatment. I will apologize for the length of my review, but I find it necessary to dispell and rumors! Let me start with saying this - GO PLATINUM!!! For the extra money, it is wroth what you get. Our room was exquisite! Jacuzzi on the balcony was amazing! Stocked fridge every day, room service quickly, etc. The people who complained seem like those who wouldn't tip. We tipped our maid $5 a day and one day even asked if we could get some liquor to make a drink in the room. It was there by the time we got back from swimming along with mints on our pillow! Book reservations for the restaurants and bring long pants! Men have to have pants on to eat. the restaurants were amazing. We had awesome sushi at one and wonderful fondue at another! Breakfast buffets were really good too! People complain about having the same thing over and over, but the buffets offer, specialty made omelets, bacon ,eggs, pancakes, waffles, etc. what more could you want? Beach was, yes, rocky. We bought some water shoes at Wal-Mart before we left and swam everyday. Snorkeled and had a great time! Clear beautiful water. Platinum lounge served great snacks - Ahi tuna, fresh guacamole, etc. Loved it! The seats by the pool are NOT taken up, the maids put fresh towels on the chairs each morning for the guests! Shuttle service to and from the platinum lounge came quickly and often to take us to the main lobby. (PS - the walk is only about 5 minutes from one end of the resort to the other!) Everything was beautiful, we never waited for a drink, and the conceirge was fantastic. Look for Milton - best bartender ever and Fernando at the front desk (A five spot to him got us a beach side room!) these people are dealing with crabby bloggers all day and a little smile and tip goes a long way!

It is the first time I have seen fit to write up about a hotel - we have travelled all over and accept the rough with the smooth, but since the feedback is predominently american, it sometimes doesn't paint a correct picture. We arrived and were really happy with our first impressions. The entrance lobby was stunning, a real 5* feel. On arrival at the room, we were again impressed, still felt 5*. The first alarm bell rang with the first meal. although it was edible, it was by no means 5* food - In reality 3* would be appropriate. We decided to book into all the a La Cartes, and were thankful we did. The evening meals in these restaurants were good (as was the ones we bought off complex), but the food rapidly became repetitive with absolutley no variation. Staff always attempted to be helpful, but there were simply not enough for the number of guests so you had to be prepared to wait. Then came the debacle with access to the room. The card access system on the room door failed, got repaired, failed again, got repaired a second time before failing yet again. On the third occasion a new handle was fitted which managed to see us through the rest of our holiday, but because of time spent locked out of the room we effectively lost a day of the holiday whilst the maintenance guys kept breaking into the room. Evening entertainment was OK, they had their own grandads rock band playing the same songs every night but generally there were good bits. The problem with the entertainment on a 14 dayer is that the same acts are on every week, so when you've seen the fire dancing on the Wednesday you know whats coming the following week!! Vast complex, with staff trying their best - the problem is with the company who just haven't got enough staff on site. If you can walk OK (the site must be nearly a mile long) and if you can regularly eat 3* repetitive food then go.

Good buffets with not so good service in the Riviera and Sunset main halls. Dining halls closest to beach were much better in terms of service and slightly better in terms of the food. The grounds are immense and are in fact two seperate but equal mirror image hotels shaped in a giant U. Everything is beautifully manicured with lush vegetation flanking almost the entire U shaped walkway of the complex. Grounds are so big that a 24 hour shuttle service should be instituted for all guests and not just the Platinum guests. The Princess has the equipment and the road to run a shuttle in place already! MESSAGE TO PRINCESS MANAGEMENT: Avert the heart-attack lawsuit that's one day coming and run a shuttle for everyone. The rooms are very nice and include a beautiful bathroom with great water pressure. I had room 7010, a swim-up suite, which was really great. Place is literally coated in marble and polished cement so slipping is a definite hazard everywhere in the resort. BE CAREFUL when necessary and you will be fine. Travelled with my parents both in their late 60's and frankly, clumsly people. I warned them of the hazards, recomended them the better non-slip footwear choices, and pointed out specific hazards and they didn't fall once. Highlight of the trip was early morning walk with my mom to the beach at the very end of the night to await the sunset. Air is clean and the pathway is well lit and SECURE at night along the entire path to the beach. Mom seemed rejuvenated by the clean, crisp ocean air and security was omnipresent but not intruisive.....unless you tried to swim in the pools after 8pm closing time. My parents had room 7111 and they absolutely loved it . Important tip, if you are a sun worshipper, book the Riviera side of the hotel which faces the sun pretty much from dawn to dusk. I was on the Princess side of the complex and had sun from 10am till 5p in the pool leading out from my suite. Saw and enjoyed various shows and musicians during my stay. Disco was nice and played dance music which matched the taste of the crowd on any given night. Last but not least, the mosquitoes. This hotel complex is less than a year old and still expanding. It was cut out of a thicket of mangrove and jungle where mosquitoes have lived for a million years. Bring repellant and lots of it.

When you tell them you don't have any, they direct you to the gift shop where they have pajama-like pants available for $68! 2) Carlos at the pool bar is rude. When you ask for more than 2 drinks, he will either tell you no or ignore you. If you are a woman, he will not serve you tequila shots. He even said, \"tequila is for men.\" Otherwise, the rest of the staff was great, the rooms were very clean, and the decor was beautiful-not only in the rooms, but the lobby and other areas as well.

They also have their own concierge who can book all your restaurants for you.

Night 3 La Vaqueria (the grill), food good, service good, portions good. Night 4 we were at the Mexican, food was good, service fair, portions good. Night 5 dinner was at the Fondue, food poor, service good, portions good, overall I would not recommend this restaurant, it\u2019s actually fondue style eating even though we asked before booking. Night 6 was dinner at Mama Mia (Italian) food was good, service good, portions good. On our last night the Platinum Suite Guests have a private buffet, we were told that this is better than the regular buffets, it was only marginally better because it had chilled seafood but that was it. Miscellaneous: Found the staff to be very helpful and appreciative of your tips. The Mayan is a secluded area; there is no real downtown district. You must either travel by bus or taxi to go anywhere like Playa Del Carmen or to book any day excursions. The power in our suite went on and off several times during our stay for unknown reasons.

Marble: it is everywhere and a bit slippery, but we saw no wipeouts. Pools: We had the junior deluxe suite with pool entrance, and it was definitely worth the extra money. We also went to the pool bar by La Tortuga, and Miguel took excellent care of us. Exchange some money for paper pesos at the concierge\u2014they\u2019re laminated and perfect for pool bar tips. Food at the buffets: delicious and not greasy. Service in La Tortuga (beachside) was much better than La Riviera (lobbyside). Food at a la cartes: we went to La Hacienda, Le Fleur and Momma Mia and loved them. Service was very slow, but our wine glasses and cervezas were full. We reserved both at the restaurants (9-1) and at the concierge (afternoon) and had no problems. Nighttime shows: Good for accompanying after-dinner drinks. It\u2019s not a party scene, but that\u2019s why we chose to go to Playa del Carmen and not Cancun. Excursions: Tulum and ATV tour were excellent! You must go to a cenote!

They were not that great. We went to Miso (part of the Deluxe package) and you only get 1 of 3 menus. You can't order sushi/sashimi with their asian dishes. You only get 1 of each and is not 'all you can eat'. After waiting forever, we experienced the worst food ever cooked. Super salty 1-wonton soup, sauce drenched pad thai with no noodles, and salty steak. It was a huge disappointment for our first non-buffet dinner.

Flew Air Canada Vacations direct from Vancouver - no issues, shuttle was great. Check-in - Platinum is great - no waiting! Room was ready - ordered bottle of champagne ahead of time (great strategy to get great room) - champagne was waiting on ice, bags arrived 10 minutes later. Room - you need to use one access card to turn on lights and outlets (we used a Blockbuster card - any card works). Room was awesome - king sized bed, just as pictuered in brochures. First room was semi ocean view looking east toward pool...asked for ocean front and was moved on day 2 to incredible room on 3rd floor (#5213). Jacuzzi on balcony was amazing. Left $3 in fridge with note requesting more liquor - got tequila and rum every day - went home with too much - two bottles of whiskey, half bottle of tequilla and 8 micky size bottles - all free. Room service was also great - yes it took an hour but so what. Woke before wife, ordered at 6:30 am, arrived at 7:20 - she awoke to Mexican eggs, fresh orange juice, fruit plate and coffee - too much food but so nice to order in, which we did only once. TV was ok - limited channels - didn't go to watch TV. DVD selection at concierge desk very limited - again, no worries. Buffets - ate breakfast at beach side buffet every day - it's a la carte for lunch as well for Platinum - not well advertised but wonderful. Loads of fruit, yoghurt selection - mango to die for. Coffee just okay - espresso machine in platinum lounge provided cappucino which we grabbed anytime and on way to breakfast buffet. Only ate at main lobby once, again lots to choose from - try to limit yourself and variety will remian for week. Only had 1 item that was off - it was grilled fish dish but fish was off. Everything else was great. Japanese - Miso - ate there first, had Tepanyaki show - grill side, started with sushi rolls, followed by fried rice then grilled fish with veggies, all excellent - 5 out of 5 Italian Mama Mia - very good, tomato salad excellent, seafood soup the best, grilled fish excellent, seafood mushroom combo risotto outstanding, presentation excellent, side potato veggie just okay, waiter was rushed - not his fault. - 4.5 out of 5 Seafood - Las Olas - seafood salad excellent, seafood soup awesome, shared Princess platter, had mussels, prawns, grilled fish - all great. 5 out of 5 Mexican - La Hacienda - beware of filling up on salad bar, shimp fajitas were outstanding - about a pound of shrimp - left way too full. 5 out of 5 Platinum Party - held at other al a carte - exclusive buffet was well appointed - lots of mussels, crab and clams which was additon to buffet options. Live authentix music was very nice. Still, least favourite meal\u2026probably because we live in Vancouver and are seafood spoiled - it didn't seem like anything too amazing to us. 4 out of 5 Drinks - We had a few cocktails at the beach bar - the tequilla sunrise was made with tang and grenadine, or something. It wasn't good at all. Platinum lounge was the best\u2026premium liquors, no waiting, real juices. Blue Margarita, Tequila Sunrise, Seabreeze - all great. Service very friendly. We had sudo lunch there most days as cheeses, cold appetizer finger foods and chips and salsa were all we usually needed. Ice cream on tap and anytime espresso were also great. Oh yeah - the Sangria - wonderfully refreshing. Wine was just okay at all bars and restaurants. Beaches - yes there are coral rocks and seaweed. Water is clear enough to navigate around\u2026use common sense. We didn't use water shoes and had no problem avoiding. Use bug spray - especially below knee. This is the tropics - there are biters. Again, not hotels fault. Amenities - we used the shuttle often - no issues. The marble floors are slippery when wet - again, use common sense, keep your center of gravity about you. Lobby, beach and pool bars were busier. Nighlty entertainment was okay - not our thing, really. Well attended though. There was a public market on the Saturday night - prices were a bit high but much better than gift shop where prices were higher as in most hotels. Sidebars - we ferried to Cozumel ($12 each), wandered around a bit, rented a scooter ($25 all day), went across island, saw ruins at San Gervais, stopped at Chen Rios (amazing beach), continued south - scooter broke down - walked down dusty road and ended up at Playancar - public beach and restaurant. Nice waiter helped to call scooter company. Had excellent tacos and beers and snorkelled while company came to replace scooter. The interruption was one of the highlights. Took $99 tour to Tulum ruins and Akumel cenote lagoon. It poured in Tulum but was much cooler. Got soaked, jumped in ocean\u2026then went to lagoon - no suncscreen allowed so we swam in clothing\u2026absolutely stunning with tons of fish. Then lunch at Akumel 'Best of Life' restaurant - terribly authentic\u2026swings for seats at bar, crowsnest tables where you hoist a Corona bucket up and down for beers\u2026very cool. Shopping in Playa was good\u20265th avenue was okay but too American / commercial. We enjoyed wandering away a bit to less glitzy stores. Closing remarks - Don't expect to be treated like a queen or king. This is Mexico! Be patient - use your manners. A smile goes along way. Try the spanish - even a few words will earn you a smile. We were met with warm and wonderful hardworking people everywhere. We took $100 is US $1 bills\u2026.left $2 in the bed and $3 in the fridge daily. Tipped $1 - $5 for meals, drinks, bellhops - again, you don't have to but these people work hard - show them consideration and a smile and you will have a far more wonderful time. And go for platinum if you can afford it - the exclusive lounge, better alcohol, better pool, and added perks (tequila, free room service, private beach area, separate pool - all worth it. We've read a lot of complaints, and after seeing for ourselves we get it. Some people are born to complain. Don't sweat the small stuff - and almost everything is small stuff. We enjoyed our stay immensely. We probably wouldn't go back only because we like to explore other places. We were introducing ourselves to the platinum bartender and she made us a special shooter (a rainbow I think). Some half cut boar interrupted with 'what's that? Give me two - I want two of those'. No manners. If you're one of those ignorant and condescending boars then please stay away for the sake of all the wonderful people enjoying themselves. If you've read this far - here's your best tip. We didn't line up once for al a cartes - we booked a dine around in advance via e-mail\u2026got 7 pm for all meals. I emailed 3 months in advance to concierge.riviera@princess-hotels.com and ordering the champagne in advance ensured we had an assigned room\u2026great strategy and worth the $65 bottle.

We booked the platinum suite and had a very nice view of the pool and a partial view of the ocean. Let\u2019s start with the good. The rooms are very well decorated and have a modern style to them. The bathroom has a soaker/ jetted tub, with the shower and toilet in cased with frosted glass, this is covered mostly in marble tile and very lovely. The room is two rooms in one. A king size bed with dressers and television, and a sitting room with a couch and two chairs along with a coffee table. The balcony is covered (we were on the 3rd floor) and has two chairs with a small table, as well there is a soaker /jetted tub. Food: We loved the food. The buffets were fantastic (we recommend the Maya buffet or the Sunset both are located at front of the resort) we only used 3 of the reserved restaurants, La fler (international/ French) was wonderful but is what we call (big plate, small food) very well prepared steak and a lovely desert. The Hacienda (Mexican) was fantastic, very large portions and superb hot sauce. The grill (I have forgotten the name) was also a wonder ful meal. Beach: The beach was very well maintained and is somewhat shallow for some distance. We had little or no trouble with the rocks that people had spoken of in past reviews, nor did we see that much seaweed (than again it is an ocean). We did have reservations at the beach (platinum suites) and had very good service for drinks and towel service. Pool(s) The platinum pool is fresh water and is really more of a wading/ lap pool. But you do get covered sun chairs with pads, and you sometimes get bar service from your sun chair. We also never had any trouble with getting towels at the platinum pool. The large pool is salt water from the small section that we swam in. Spa: My wife did use the spa twice for a message and said the it was wonderful The Bad: We had checked in at 6 pm and had a very speedy process. The problem was that once we checked in we were never shown to our room. Now this is not the smallest of resorts. We did manage to find the platinum shuttle but were told that we could not take our luggage with us. After some broken Spanish and broken English the fellow did get on the radio and call a bellboy for us. Once he arrived he quickly took our luggage and informed us that someone would be here to pick us up and show us to our room. Twenty minutes later when no one showed we began the journey to find our room. Once in our room we found that we had no alcohol, or coffee, or robes and slippers (all part of the platinum package). We called down to the concierge and asked for some drinks and coffee for the morning. We were informed that they would try. So we spend most our fist night going down to the platinum lounge to get drinks and unwind (after 15 hours in travel time). The next morning I spoke to the airline representative and informed him of our problems. Within twenty minutes we had everyting that we the guests had requested. The mosquitoes are a problem and you will need bug spray, they seem to mostly attack or feet and ankles. Also you may get a coffee maker in the room but getting the coffee from housekeeping is another story (and yes we do tip. I think very well almost $150.00 in one week). Overview: We did put the negative aside and had a wonderful week of sun and surf. As for the hotel it is very clean and we felt safe the whole time we were there. Is there room for improvement? Of course there is, there always is. But at the end your vacation is what you make of it.

It has not even been open a year, and some of the bad reports I read are crazy. It is like people think when they go to a foreign country they should not have to use common sense. Well you have to be careful with your money (anywhere), there will be mosquitos you are basically in a jungle, and yes, sometimes even the maid soes not get everything clean to your liking BUT you are not home what does it really matter. This hotel was wonderful as long as you are there to vacation. A vacation is suppose to be a time when all these minute things will not be able to bother you. We stayed in the platinum suite in room 5219 and let me just say OMG the view was literally to die for. We would wake up every morning open our curtains and watch the sunrise it was awesome. We did not have any trouble what so ever making dinner reservations to all of the a la carte restaurants when we got there on Saturday. The same Saturday that over 200 people came on too. There were no mix ups with our rooms infact there was one of the members of our party that upgraded and had no issues with this. We all were able to get in our rooms by 3 p.m. The only advice I have here is get 3 keys so you can always leave one in the a/c so it stays on. We were catered to in every way. We received free massages. Several bottle of liquior and plenty of towels. We only had one bad experience with an a la carte the habachi grill. It basically took them 2.5 hours to feed us. That was a little annoying but the food was great. Other than that we ate at La Fluer it was good and the Fondue restaurant it was not bad. The rest of the times we went into Playa Del Carmen. We were always helped with our excursions, and always helped in any form or fashion by the staff. Just be friendly and they will be friendly to you. Things I enjoyed the most- the platinum pool. Great. The tram to the platinum suite- very long walk home. The beach, the beach and the beach. The beautiful grounds. The people.

The rooms were beautiful. The shower did leak but we did the towel thing and it worked out. We had no problems with anything getting stolen from our room. There was a group of 11 people for my wedding and we all stayed in a deluxe jr suite. We were on the Riviera side and faced the pool so we had no problems. My brother however, was on the side with construction with a 1st floor room and it was infested with mosquitos. I would strongly suggest staying in the sunset side which has no construction. He did not persist the issue much as he was only there 4 days but they gave him a can of raid??? My \"husband\" and I thought the buffet food was good. If you have ever stayed in an all inclusive most require you to make reservations for the restaurants at the concierge desk. Yes this is a hassle as there can be a line and a wait. However, I have encoutered this everywhere I have stayed all inclusive. The restaurants are very good and the presentation is terrific. Pools were wonderful no complaints. Beach was very nice water was rocky. Again, I must emphasis that the resort is wonderful. We had our wedding here. Everything for the wedding was picture perfect. The wedding coordinators are great, the photographers are great. We utilized the spa for massage and for my hair. Both went well. Biggest complaint would be the wait for drinks. The have 5 staff members doing dance classes at the pool and 1 bartender at each bar. Doesn't make much sense. Hopefully this is somethign they will work on.

The trip included our family, complete with 13 year old daughter and 16 year old foreign exchange student, along with good friends and their 9 year old son. We stayed in Platinum and are glad to report that the resort got high rankings from everyone in the group. Loved Platinum! We all enjoyed the service of a close bar and tasty snacks throughout the day in the Platinum Lounge as well as the close location to the ocean and buffet for breakfast and lunch. The kids loved the ice cream and we loved the food variety and private bar with no waiting. Making reservations for the restaurants for our evening meals took about 15 minutes and we were able to make them all (for the entire week) at once. So easy and so convenient. We ate lunch and breakfast each day in the buffet closest to the Platinum building on the Riviera side. Food always great. No complaints. Dinner at Italian, Mexican, Fondue and Miso were all great. Seafood restaurant was our least favorite with one exception: the Chef cooked the fish the guys caught on their deep sea fishing trip that day and it was delicious. What a nice touch! (They did have to sign a waiver before the kitchen would accept the fish -- but no big deal). We have traveled quite a bit and while this resort lacked the polish and finesse of a 5 star, everyone was friendly, gracious and worked so hard to please. That means a lot and certainly added to our enjoyment. We all remarked that this was one of the most relaxing vacations we have ever taken. We were well taken care of, were not over run with crowds, had plentiful food and drink -- all within steps of our room. The resort is not too large -- each evening we walked from the main lobby back to our rooms after dinner and it was an easy walk and really lovely with the lighted pools and sculptures. Don't understand the prior complaints. Frankly, after the good dinners, it wouldn't have hurt to have walked further!!

We were excited to get there but it was a big let down. The resort was huge, larger than expected. First I would like to address the positive things about the resort. The pools were gorgeous and huge, rooms were clean, and most of the staff was kind. The resort is definitely kid friendly. Now for the negative things about the resort: 1. I booked the trip with a travel agent. As I was booking it, I specifically asked if there was an adult pool for adults only and was told yes. I did some research prior to booking and the overview stated that there is in fact an adult pool, it just doesn\u2019t tell you that you need to book a certain room in order to be able to use it. When we arrived I asked where the adult pool was and was told that we weren\u2019t allowed to use it because we didn\u2019t book the rooms with that comp. 2. If you want quick service, this is not the resort for you. Upon checking in, we waited in line for 20-30 minutes. We waited until around 3 pm for our rooms. Once we got our rooms I expected our luggage to be waiting for us, but guess what it was not. I called the front desk and asked for our luggage, waited and waited. My husband finally went to retrieve our luggage and had to argue with the bell boy in order to get it. 3. We were given a Xeroxed copy of the resort and as you know it\u2019s sometimes hard to find what you are looking for when it\u2019s all in black and white. You need to be self-sufficient in finding your way around. 4. I asked for reservations to eat at the Seafood and Asian Fusion Restaurants and was told that with the rooms we booked it was not included. I booked the Junior Deluxe Suites not the Junior Suites. This was the whole reason I paid the extra money. 5. The service at the buffet was terrible. We orded our dinks at the beginning of the meal, got them once we were done eating. The food was not the greatest. 6. The beach was quite a long way away. It was probable only about \u00bd a mile, but it seemed like 3 miles. We were told that we could get a ride to the beach, but it took them too long to get there, so we walked and made several stops in the pool along the way to cool off. Once we got to the beach all of the lounge chairs were taken. So guess what you had to take the long walk back?. 7. There was construction on the side of the resort we were on, need I say more? Also, the A/C made this awful noise every 30 minutes. We made several complaints (all of us), but nothing was ever done about it. 8. Now the swim bars. I noticed on several occasions that water was being added to the beer. Service was terrible also. We asked for drinks several times and were never given them. We finally just gave up, thank goodness for the bottled water in our rooms. 9. The shower leaked all over the floor in the bathroom. If I were rating this resort on appearance then I would give it about a four. I understand that this resort in new, but in order to keep customers coming back a lot of changes will need to be made. Last year we all stayed at a resort not ranked as high as this one and were treated much better.

We read some of the reviews beforehand so were somewhat apprehensive. When we arrived at the resort, we found it to be a huge property. It looked beautiful. Unfortunately, they had a computer glitch and it took over 24 hours for us to get our room keys. The first 24 hours we had to call securiy every time we had to go to our rooms. The lady at the front desk even asked us why we had to go to our rooms so often. We were told this never happened before, but the second last day we were there the same thing happened and our rooms keys would not work again. After 5 calls to concierge and speaking with the manager, Fernando, who was actually much more helpful than the concierge we were dealing with, we finally had our room lock reprogrammed and then had to get new keys at the front desk for our room. Overall, our experience at the resort was fair. I think you get reasonably good value for your money. We paid $1208 Canadian per person includinig airfare on Air Canada from Toronto to Cancun for the week. I booked my children as adults so that they could get their own room. While we did not get adjoining rooms, the rooms were adjacent. The buffet meals are somewhat repetitive but there is still plenty of variety so it is not too bad. There are peak periods when the hotel has a hard time accomodating all the eaters. For example, if you want to eat between 130 pm and 200 pm at one of the buffets closest to the beach, you may have to wait up to 15 minutes to get a table, and then wait again in the buffet line for up to 10 minutes if you want pasta made. In general, we found the servers quite good even though there didn't seem to be enough of them at peak times, because they were very busy running around. We booked a la carte meals at the International, Mexican and Italian Restaurant. It took 45 minutes in line to book two of the restaurants. We could not book all three restaurants at once because the lady in the line said she was only doing reservations for the next two nights. This seemed to contradict another restaurant line, where an American was kind enought to book a meal for us 3 nights later. The food at all three restaurants was fine and the service was good, although some of our friends had to wait 2 hours for service at the Italian restaurant. We were told to avoid the Grill because the food there was not good. It seems like the people at the resort are really policy and procedure oriented and have no authority or any discretion to make things right. For example, one day two of our beach towels were taken off our chairs and when I went to the pool hut to ask for replacements, I was told that I would have to go to the concierge at the front desk to arrange this. It was 35 degrees at the time and I told the lady at the towel hut to call her manager. I had to argue with her manager, who suggested the same and then said she would send the towels to our room. I said that was not appropriate because I was right beside the towel hut and was far from our hotel room which was at the other end of the resort. Finally they relented. But really, was all that hassle necessary to get two beach towels? I would also caution people that there is a lot of construction on the Riviera side of the resort. Try to get a room on the Sunset side of the resort. The entertainment was so-so. The best entertainment was the circus shows and the break dancing. In general, the music was blasted way too loud. I agree with the comments that the surfaces around the pools are very slippery, so be careful. The beach is not that great because there is a lot of rocks, coral, seaweed, etc. and they do not do a good job in getting rid of the seaweed which washes up on shore. I think the management of this hotel doesn't really care about repeat visitors, etc. They are mostly catering to value conscioius travellers and considering this is a fairly new resort, it was incredible how many things were non-operational. For example, our air conditioner broke down at one point. It would either stay on all the time or we would have to turn it off. It did not adjust to the thermostat. If we turned it off, the room would heat up, but if we left it on, the room would become freezing. It really is a waste of energy and I thought they would be more energy conscious. Also, many of the showers around the pool areas stopped working halfway through the week. I would say go to this resort and try not to get too worried about the little things, pick your battles. Better still, spend a few hundred bucks more and spare yourself the aggravation.", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected\u201d", "Author": "NJHNorfolk", "ReviewID": "UR18564757", "Content": "We spent 2 weeks at Riviera side in junior deluxe 3rd floor (8211). Great room and perfect view. I have to say that hotel was FAR better than I expected following other reviews I had read since it opened in December 2007. It is a massive resort, but the beach and pools are excellent and the hotels lays on 3 free coaches to Playa each day. If you don't want to use the coach, you can get a taxi for USD13 each way. Clientelle are mostly from USA and Canada, but we did hear some French and Eastern European guests while we were there. Minimal English guests at the moment. Initial downside is that the hotel gives you minimal information on check in as to what facilities are on site, and the resort map is poor. Hopefully this will improve in time. Luckily both reception areas (Sunset and Riviera) have ATM's where you can get extra pesos if needed, much safer than using ATM's in Playa. We used USD, as accepted all over resport and Playa. Reception changed large bills for us into smaller $1 bills for tips. Food is plentiful and varied - but the main buffet food services do let it down.. The bar staff get 10/10 as do the maids. Our room 'safe' was perfect. We tipped bar, restaurant and room staff USD 2 a time. We saw no mosquitoes at all until the rain started on 29th/30th May. Then I saw several in corridors linking ground floor buildings. (Buildings 8 , 7 and 6). The ground floors have some fountains and planting within the building, hence the mozzies. I ended up with 3 bites - not bad for someone who usually ends up with 17 plus. Beach was great, good sand, safe water and loads of loungers to sit on - pools are excellent. We went to extreme right hand side of beach for additional peace and quiet. Beach bar staff come around occasionally taking orders for cold drinks. We walked the beach north and south - this hotel has the best spot. The sea at some of the other hotels beaches looked almost dangerous. Pools - you can choose noisy or quiet - loads of choice. Animation staff are also excellent and work hard. As you can imagine the drink flows well - even at mid day for some groups. There is a lack of entertainment in the evenings - I only saw a three piece band strumming away each evening. Most people just sat around talking and drinking. Restaurants were disappointing - the worst for us was Las Olas (seafood). Slow seating, slow service and overcooked food. The fried fish I had was almost inedible. We walked out when the desert was served up. Luckily we did not have to pay as had an upgraded room. Best was International (Fleur) - Grill (Vaqueira) was good, Mama Mia was also OK but not great. Strange how all the deserts look like the main buffet cakes! My only real gripe the whole 2 weeks was the Riviera Buffet. Its bedlam at busy times - like a canteen.......badly laid out as a rectangle with food at one extreme end and three sections for patrons -walking up and down with food in hand avoiding people and staff clearing tables was a nightmare at times. We gave up eating the broccoli and carrots - hard and warm. May as well have been raw. Also one night the new potatoes in a salad were grey inside. Huge selection though and loads of it. Aim to eat at 7am - 12 noon and 7pm and avoid the main rush. Breakfast and Lunch at Tortuga restaurant by the beach if you want a more calm meal setting. Service is excellent there. We ended up eating all breakfasts there for some peace and quiet. Floors are very slippery in resort (most are marble) - especially when wet - I nearly fell 3 times. Also a concrete bridge area near the main pools get rather slippery. Is the hotel 5 star - difficult to say - I think the fairest thing to say is that it will be 5 star to some people but 4 to others - depending on your expectations and past experiences at other hotels. It could be fabulous - if it gets those Buffet restaurants, A La Carte restaurants and entertainment sorted out. Personally though I think it is perhaps too big to give the service and food quality that a 5 star resort needs. It looks like a 5 star hotel, but the services let it down. Goodness knows how it will cope when the new rooms being built are occupied. So folks for breakfast and lunch every day - head for the restaurants down by the beach (both sides of the walkway). The whole experience will be so much better. Shuttles to PDC leave at 10,11 and 12 am (get ticket from Concierge) and they lay on enough buses to bring everyone back at 6pm. But we got taxi back at USD 13 Our room backed onto the building work at Riviera side. Yes, there is a huge block of new rooms being built that stretches the whole length of the current buildings 8 and 7 but, as at the entrance side of the rooms, we were not too bothered by the banging. It certainly did not affect our holiday, so guests need not be concerned. Rooms have fridges that are filled with water, soft drinks and beer each day. Plasma TV is good and offers about 25 channels, mostly spanish or american. Shower room can be awkward as water goes all over main bathroom floor and again floors are slippery when wet. They give complimentary shower gel, shampoo and soap, which is a nice touch and saves baggege allowance for the flight. Beds were very comfortable. Regarding the computer access - we tried on several occasions to get on line but gave up - I had no intention of sitting waiting for a hour a time to get access to one of the 3 working machines. They do need at least 2-3 more computers in place for guests. I was lucky to get access one evening - but the machine crashed twice. Although I think that was me as the keyboard was not one I was used to and the prompts were in spanish. @ is acessed via control alt F2 for example. There is no @ key. I had to ask an american lady how to access that key. A big downside is that there is no store to buy books and magazines etc - only facilities at the moment are jewelery, basic toiletries, swim wear and tourist tat. So, if you read fiction on holiday you need to bring enough to last your whole trip. Also sun creams bought there are expensive. Trips were excellent - we did Chichen Itza, Coba, Aktun Chen, Tulum and XCarat on mainland - plus went over to Cozumel on ferry to go down to view the Reef from Atlantis Submarine. All were excellent and money well spent. Playa del carmen is safe to walk around - we walked from the beach to Walmart for fun ! Look out for Starbucks near ferry port - itits so nice to have a good coffee and a cookie after a week or so of hotel food. We were lucky in that our belongings were safe at all times - as said earlier the room safe worked perfectly and was not tampered with. I did play extra safe though with clothing items - I kept all items I did not want to lose locked in my suitcase behind TSA locks. In fact each trolley case had all sections locked at all times with TSA locks for the whole duration of our stay (6 locks). Overkill I know but, based on scary posts earier this year, I was taking no chances and we had peace of mind. Would we go to the Princess again, I am tempted to say yes, but I think a fairer answer would be no, although it is a beautiful resort it was too big and impersonal for us. That said at the moment it is excellent value for money. The absolute bottom line for me was the buffets - bedlam.", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "virginia", "Title": "\u201cYou'll be pleasantly suprised as to how nice this place really is\u201d", "Author": "ridgecreekhokie", "ReviewID": "UR18550043", "Content": "After reading all of the negativity posted here, my expectations were limited......what a pleasant surprise.

We paid ~$1700 per person (all tax. etc. included) for a junior suite and were upgraded to junior suite deluxe poolview within a few days. Overall, we would say that we 'got what we paid for' and are satisfied with this respect - but you can definitely expect some 'sacrifices' compared to the other resorts that are charging more and delivering a better vacation package. Some advice on our experience that we would share: 1) Nearly all the rooms in the 6000 block have mosquitos and sewer odour - especially on the first floor. For that matter, in any area, try to get above first floor for these reasons. Our original room had extremely poor odour and ~200+ mosquitos -- we dealth with 'Alberto', who was GREAT, and through a couple of rooms we were upgraded to our third floor pool view junior suite deluxe room with a Jacuzzi 2) We have found that the resort staff (similar with many resorts) understand 'compensation' for 'inconviences' - if you yell at them, nothing will happen. If you discuss your issues with them politiely, they are usually more than willing to help out. 3) If you are arriving before 2:00, don't expect to see a room before then. We tried again for our room key at 1:00, and it was ready early 4) The beach water can be difficult to get into for the first meter or two to get past the shells/rocks/seaweed etc. that piles up, however once you are in there are many connected patches of clear sand and the clarity of the water lets you see the patches of area you will want to avoid. 5) We NEVER had a problem finding a beach chair 6) Be careful, if you are in the ocean and see 'beatle-like' bugs floating on the water surface, some of them bite! (My wife was bitten in three places that swelled up into blisters - similar to bee stings) 7) The jacuzzi may not be worth it - bladder infections were known to be common due to the bacteria in the water. 8) Buffet was ok, can get repetitive - our favorite restaurants were the italian and the mexican. Unfortunately your restaurant experience depends in large on who your waiter is. We had great waiters and were in and out of the restaurants in less than 45 minutes on some days, others it took 2 hours ++ Beware, fondue portions are extremely small (i.e. Meat provided is half a fist for two people - you might be going to the buffet aftewards - we are by no means big eaters either!) 9) Book your resaturants as soon as possible all in advance ( we had no problem booking all of our reservations over our stay as soon as we got to the resort) 10) The bars are understaffed and expect to be 'bumped' for 'high-tippers'. Would suggest ordering two drinks at a time.. 11) Disco was ok, seems to be the same playlist everynight and they are not too willing to take requests (they will say yes but never play them) 12) DO NOT make calls outside of the resort on your room phone - pay the $1 a minute on calling cards located and used at the lobby phones. 13) The pools and grounds are very scenic (i.e. 5 star resort) with gorgeous fountains everywhere, even the rooms are done up nicely with marble, high-end fixtures. 14) Mini-Bar -- if you want it filled figure out what your mini-bar guys schedule is - if you miss him once (i.e. your do not disturb sign is up), it will not be filled and we found any calls to attempt to have drinks delivered were useless despite many promises 15) Cleaning is mediocre of the rooms - they spend <10 min at best it seems. Floors are not mopped, number of towels is inconsistent. Seem to only wipe ONE thing per day (dirty counters, tubs, etc.) Toilet paper, coffee, etc often not replenished (just grab it from the cart - much faster!) 16) If you want to sleep past 8:00 bring ear plugs and put your AC fan speed to high - the cleaning staff are very noisey speaking with each other, often yelling between levels for items, like to drag furniture around a lot, and the halls carry noise. 17) Yes, the beach has many crabs on it at night. We had a great time, we are not complaining - we just want to share some of the glitches and general experiences that we had. For what we paid, we are happy and we had a great time (for all 14 days) at this resort that really felt like a 4 /4.5 star resort depending on the day.", "Date": "August 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cMost unpleasant experience ever\u201d", "Author": "panzerjake", "ReviewID": "UR18464087", "Content": "My family and I visited this resort July 5-12, 2008.

We didn't even stay in platinum and we are more than satisfied with our vacation!! My theory is that most of the complaints on here are the poeple that choose five star resorts and expect to be treated like a celebrity. The fact is this resort is HUGE and all the complaining is extremely unreasonable!! We had a walk out pool...A must if you stay here!!! I will break it down simple in few important points Check was smooth- room ready and bell boy took our luggage while we turned down the shuttle to take the scenic route. Leaving- called for luggage pick up they came in ten minutes...we drank at the lobby bar till shuttle for airport arrived an hour later! Food: BOOK YOUR AL A CARTES early. DOn't go there expected to get what you want hours before dinner. They DO tell you to book between 9-1pm in any of the restaurants. You can book all your restaurants at which every restaurant you stand in line at so pick the shortest line up. we were able to book for our full two weeks no prob. The service is great...they are very accomadating and I am am extremely picky eater so one restaurant even chaged the menu for me entirely. If you want a mixed drink get it at the lobby bar before being seated! Mama mia and mexican were the best!! The buffet is great. SOme complain it's too americanized but if it was all weird mexican food they would still complain. They had made to order omletes for every breakfast and pasta for dinner. Excellent!!!! PS, I ordered Nachos at 3:00am every night after we got home....They were excellent! The pool and beach- AMAZING-enough said!!! Rocks when you first step in but it's paradise...you hardly care at all!! Service- Excellent! We tipped our room cleaner 2 buck US each day and our room was spotless. Not anything we wouldn't do staying in a regular hotel. Minibar guy- asked for extra beer and he said no problem...gave us four instead of two. Better than nothing. Transat party on Thursday= Good TIME Sports bar- Never spent much time there....taken over by teeneagers. BUT, hot crispy fries and nachos and cheese whenever the buffet wasn't open! Shuttle passed by us but we declined b/c we enjoyed the excercise after all the drinking and food. It IS always accessable!!! Safe was secure!! Never had anything stolen....in fact I have to laugh at the ones that actually went swimming with 1000 bucks in their pocket for one thing and then left in laying in their suitcase to dry after that...I mean come on...they give you a safe for a reason. I would think that money would go missing regardless of where you stayed. Misquitos were a pain-Need bug spray for anywhere you go...then you are fine! Massage on the beach...MUST DO!!! Day at their spa--extremely romantic! COBA TRIP- MUST DO! I wild adventure! Definitely take the ferry to Cozumel- We rented Scotters and went to a park to snorkel...best place we snorkeled. They also have great tourist shopping! Overall our trip was excellent and being that it was a honeymoon I wanted perfection and I definitely was above satsified. 1$ american goes a long way.

After we booked and started reading reviews I was horrified. They were 46 of us going!.. went 7/21 - 7/28 I have been to at least 8 resorts in cancun, cozumel, riviera maya so am very familiar with what to expect. I am not \"high maintenance\" but expect a clean room with good service. I want what I pay for. We booked thru funjet. 26 of us arrived at GRP at 1200 noon. ALL of our rooms were ready. Check in took less than 5 minutes. I had a swim up suite and had requested a king room..none was available but was told to come back in AM and I would get one. I was skeptical but showed up at 11 next day and gave the gal $5 and instantly got a king room in a better loction which was ready (dont think i really had to give her tip but i wanted to.) When we got to room safe wouldnt work..called desk and a security man was there within 5 minutes. Never had a problem with theft orsafe entire stay and we left everything in safe. original room was 7012. good thing about bldg 7 - NO mosquitoes....Bad thing..a little further from beach and La tortuga (beach buffet) I think this is best buffet esp at breakfast. Moved to room 6078..great corner room right in the midle of everything...however there were mosquitoes. I brought OFF but when I got in room called desk and they brought me a huge can of RAID immediately..as long as doors to patio stayed closed we were fine..however one of the 20 yo with us and her frienfd left the sliding glass door open all night and she got about 20 bites!..She didnt do it again!..Youhave to realize you are in middle of jungle and part of resort is preserved as a wildlife refuge so there is some standing water...lots of cool iguanas too! Pools are fabulous.. I have been to Iberostars and these pools are better....activity pool a little crowded during the \"crazy games \" but so many others to choose from is not a problem .I loved the swim up room..worth the few extra dollars..I read a review before this one that said loungers in water were only in platinum...NOT TRUE..every swim up room has a double lounger in water with a built in table on both sides. No platinum rooms are swim up. My son and daughter in law got upgraded to Platinum for wedding but they honestly liked their swim up room better...obviously perks better in platinum though(IE room service, brkfst in bed) Food typical for AI in Mexico Drinks and bars were great. we tipped the bartenders a few bucks each day and rarely waited for a drink.. Try the miami vice , mojito and mango margarita. It is a big resort but Im not lazy..I actually enjoyed the walk..you eat and drink enough the exercise is great for you. The staff went out of their way to please you. I dont understand these reviews who were disappointed with service. Maybe some people are just impossible to please. I did see a few people being awfully rude who should have been embarassed. There complaints were so trivial. For gods sake you are in MEXICO. We never met a staff member who didnt speak to us with a smile or try to help us.Housekeeping came every day and did a great job..she always left me extra towels and beer and a \"towel animal\". Beach was gorgeous. we got there the day after Dolly so beach was still red flag..water was still clear.. I never had a problem with rocks and didnt wear water shoes..BUT i did read reviews to go out on beach right in front of la tortuga and i rarely encountered a rock.....and the deal is .the water is so clear you can see the bottom even when you are neck deep so Im not sure how you step on rocks you see???? Grounds are gorgeous even though they are new...wedding was gorgeous..will attach pics for yall to see. If you have a vacation planned here dont worry unless you are a prima donna..it is gorgeous, fun, relaxing and was a great 7 days.. I would definitely go back here before any of the three iberostarts or rius i have stayed at in cozumel or playa or cancun.

My husband, two sons (ages 14 and 18) and I have traveled quite a bit and the GRP ranks near the top for us. We booked 2 junior suites through Travelbyjen (through Vacation Express) and were upgraded, without us asking, to the junior suite deluxe. We were in the 6100 building on the second floor and we really liked that location a lot. Although it was quite a distance from the main lobby, we actually enjoyed the walk several times a day and never once took the shuttle. It was a nice way to keep from gaining extra pounds during our stay! The rooms were great and we had no problems with bugs. There were no leaks and the A/C worked just fine. I did detect a very slight musty smell around day 4 but just sprayed the rooms with Febreeze that I brought from home. Although things were not perfect, we had our expectations in check (from reading TA reviews) and just really remembered that we were there to relax! For instance, it was a bit aggravating the way ala carte dinner reservations were handled and how long the process took. Therefore, we decided to not book anymore reservations and we ate at the buffet every night thereafter. Our vacation time was better spent doing other things and since we couldn't change the GRP's dinner reservation process, we chose not to participate. We actually really enjoyed the buffet restaurant, in particular, closest to our building. I believe it is La Tortuga. Although we ate at the main buffet two times, we felt that La Tortuga's staff was friendlier and the food was better. We know it should have been the same, but it wasn't. Having two hungry teenagers, it was great to know that there was always something available to eat so close by. We did have to get up a few times and get our own drinks but we took turns to do this and it took us 2-3 minutes tops. Again, there was no reason to let something so minor ruin our vacation. The main reason that I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars is because of the wet floor issue. During the first two days of our stay, Hurricane Dolly skirted by and the walking around was downright dangerous! We all slipped and slided our way around and we did see a couple of people who actually fell. I was amazed at how much standing water there was from the rain. It is as if they did not consider proper drainage during construction of the property. One thing that I wish I would have read on this site before heading to GRP is how well-stocked the on site store is. Although the prices were definitely higher for many items, I wish I hadn't packed everything plus the kitchen sink in my luggage. For instance I came home with unused neosporin, band-aids, extra toiletries, etc., not knowing that if we ran out I could easily buy it there. I would have rather spent a few extra pesos for something in case I needed it, instead of bringing a medicine cabinet with me from home. (Incidentally, the biodegradeable sunscreen they sell at the GRP store is not okay for Xel Ha. That was pointed out to us very kindly by a worker at Xel Ha who very nicely gave us proper sunscreen samples to use.) If you are a coffee drinker like we are, bring your own coffee filters, coffee and cream/sugar from home. We did this and it was great because we never did get it from housekeeping. It was lovely to wake up and make a pot of coffee and sit on the balcony. Also, the lobby bar made the BEST cappucinos my husband and I have ever had....we had several a day! I totally agree with other reviews on how beautiful the place is. The pools are amazing and we spent many wonderful, relaxing hours reading poolside. We had two massages on the beach and they were wonderful.....do not miss them! We would go back to the GRP again if given the chance, although we tend to want to try new places and things. Although I was a bit worried by reading reviews leading up to our departure, we had a fine time and it was a very memorable vacation for our whole family!

We had a great time!!! Except for a small glitch at the beginning (not the resort's fault) we arrived with very little delay. The glitch was that half of our group arrived at the Sunset side while the other half arrived at the Riviera side. The driver who had taken us to the correct side, soon realized what had happened and quickly retrieved the others. We had one bag delay with our group that didn't really interrupt anything since we were all trying to get settled into our respective five rooms. After getting settled in, we began our journey of checking out the resort. Since the resort is very large, we were only able to explore a small part of it due to our late arrival between 7-8 p.m. We immediately found plenty of food and drink, some of which was room service. Our rooms were very clean and cool upon arrival. We had few, if any, of the anticipated problems that we'd read about on TripAdvisor prior to the trip. We were a bit apprehensive but the fears soon went away. We were treated wonderfully by the staff and the food was excellent. I would recommend the Grand Riviera Princess to anyone of any age. We had children starting at age six up to an adult in the 80's. There are plenty of places to walk and enjoy beautiful scenery as well as wonderful transportation for those who did not care to walk a lot. We enjoyed the beautiful beach every day. Since there was such a large group, our early to rise hero would go out before 8:00 a.m. and mark our lounge chairs with beach towels. We would be able to go back and forth to the beach without worry of having a good spot. By being in the Platinum Suites, we had drink service on the beach on a constant basis. There was never a \"wait\" for service. On the other hand, those who were not Platinum had to wait, in many cases, in long lines to get a drink. The Platinum club was wonderful. We had quick access to drinks and food from early morning until 11:00 p.m. The staff was very attentive. We especially enjoyed the wonderful services of Sergio. He was not only extremely friendly, but he was also an excellent bartender who would try to accommodate all of our requests. We had 6:00 reservations each evening for dinner. This allowed us to finish early, then enjoy a very nice band near the courtyard bar. We were also able to dance in the courtyard area. We enjoyed most of the restaurants very much. The La Hacienda, Le Fleur, and the Miso (Tepanyaki) were by far our favorites. We were not able to go to the Mamma Mia, but hear that it is also very good. We were very disappointed in the seafood restaurant. The fish was extremely salty. Some constructive comments: I would recommend that at least one pool remain open later than the current closure of 8:00 p.m. I would also suggest that there be piped in music along the beautiful waterways from the lobby to the beach. It's such a beautiful stroll that it begs for music. If you are searching for a travel service, I would highly recommend talking to Angela from Easy Travel USA (1.800.648.9984). She was extremely helpful and made very useful suggestions. She spent a lot of time working to get the best airfare and went above and beyond what most travel agents do for their customers. She set up a wonderful anniversary celebration dinner as well as pre reserving all dinner reservations. I would give our experience an overall four star rating. I'm sure the resort will get even better since it's still in the early stages of development.

I stayed in the Laguna Villas. Totally awesome! It was my own giant room in a building shared with only 3 other rooms. Marble everything. Outdoor rock shower and a tub bigger than my spa at home! We had our own pool, although I didn't go since my friends did not purchase the higher level and couldn't go with. The concierge, Lilliana, was very helpful and arranged for all my reservations and meals when needed. I had a full size ironing board and iron, safe, robe and slippers, very well stocked mini bar, easy room access. I loved it! Room service came within 30-45 minutes. The downfall? The housekeeping, the mini bar guy and the any other hotel service ALWAYS arrived when I was in the tub or shower. I decided they have hidden cameras!!! JK To come to this vacation spot you NEED the ability to walk-LOOOONG distances. There are shuttles on the outer walkway, but even getting there takes several minutes. The Laguna Villas weren't near the ocean. I had to cross 3 bridges to get there, with throngs of people watching. I finally learned to go to the outer walkway and bypass all the people. I even learned to enjoy the walking and skipped the shuttle several times! The humidy in July was a killer. I wanted to stay in my room more often than go to the beach, but toughened up and went. I didn't have to worry about gaining weight, between all the walking and water! Staying \"in the party mode\" was hard. The walking made you sweat everything out. Food? Abundant. The buffets were easy to attend and filling. Buffet food was edible, just like most ordinary food. Nothing fancy though. Higher level food was FANTASTIC!!!! I had ostrich one evening. Yum! The bar pools and beach bar closes at 6. All other bars are open late, but the trek to the big building is ominous. Also, watch out for the slippery sidewalks. I bit it several times. Apparently, they water the vegetation after midnight and I just couldn't stay upright. VERY SLICK! Friends stayed in every level so I was able to experience each. I included pictures of everything on my uploads. The Jr. Deluxe and Platinum rooms were exactly the same. Just better perks in the Platinum. The Platinum even has a bar, concierge and internet access at the bottom of the building. My Laguna Villa was out of this world. My friends had issues with requests. i.e. cleaning the spa, getting the a/c to work, etc. Nothing was taken care of during their stay. My bed was sandy one night, but I ended up living with it. No bugs. That was a beauty in itself. Although I did come home with a huge rash on my neck that the doctor can't explain. Tipping was included with my room. I did tip 1-2 dollars for exceptional service and was told it was very much appreciated. Would I stay here again? Definitely. I think my kiddos would love it, too!", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cSadly Disappointed\u201d", "Author": "lovenfood", "ReviewID": "UR18340714", "Content": "Well, we just got back from our 6 night family vacation. I am sad to report that all of the previous bad reviews are still true. I had hoped that the resort would have worked out the \"New resort bugs\" by now but unfortunately not so. I am going to tell you about our experience in hopes that it will help you decide if you need to look for other options. It is going to be lengthy but I think it is important that you know... We booked our trip through TravelbyJen. They booked it through VacationExpress which uses Elite Travel in Mexico. When our agent called me about the deal that she found, I went to the website of the resort and it looked fabulous! So we booked it. That was my first mistake. Had I looked at the reviews on Trip Advisor first I would not have booked it. But, it was too late so we just hoped for the best. Here is what we experienced..... First of all...the good..... The resort is beautiful! Just like in the pictures. The pools were beautiful and clean. (The in-pool lounge seats that you see in the website picture, must be in the Platinum pools. The Jr. deluxe pool suites had lounge seats but they were for the guest in those rooms) The beach was very nice. Water shoes were a plus when going into the water but the beach itself was no problem. The Massage is a MUST!! Miso..really good food, both the hibachi and regular table. The buffet food was fair to good. We never left hungry but made comments that we didn't think we would be gaining a bunch of weight either...not a bad thing! We went on Alltournative's Maya Encounter- it was an all day adventure with Coba Maya Ruins, visit a Maya village, jungle zip-line, plus rappelling & canoeing and swimming in a cenotes! It was the best part of our trip. It cost $124 per adult and $108 for our 8yo. Well worth every penny!! You have to ask about it specifically, they(in-resort tour agents- Elite, etc.) won't tell you. They will try to sell you half day trips for $95. You can go to their website and check it out www.alltournative.com. Now for the Bad..... The resort is not \"user friendly\" at all. Too many rules...everything that you want to do, you have to make reservations. AND...you can only make these reservations during specific times of the day and at specific locations during those specific times of day...Confused? We were too!This includes the specialty restaurants, shuttles, etc. That would not be so bad if you didn't have to go all the way to the front lobby (a long walk from most buildings) to do it. The frustrating thing is that they make no effort to tell you all of the \"rules\" when you get there. Maybe because they were so busy at the check in desk that they just don't have the time to inform you of everything that you need to know. We tried to get information from the concierge but they would only answer our specific questions and then it seemed that they lack the knowledge to answer many of them. Most answers were \"sorry, you have to come back tomorrow between 1 and 4 to make those reservation\" or something to that sort. It seemed that I spent a lot of time on wasted trips to the front. Just too much work for a vacation. Reservations for the restaurants- very difficult. The available slots fill very quickly. I arrived at Mama Mia at 9am one morning, hoping to reserve a table for 4 for that night. I stood in line for 45 minutes. When it was my turn...no reservations were available for that night and the rest. was closed the next night. I did learn that you can make a reserv. for any of the rest's at any of the rest's. example...because I couldn't get us in at Mama Mia's for that night, I made a reservation for Miso instead. So...be prepared to stand in long lines and be flexible to what time you will eat...unless you are lucky enough to be able to make them 2 days prior(that is as far in advance as they will let you make them) One more frustrating thing about this...if you do get in to one of the rest's, you will notice that half of the tables are empty. So many people don't show for their reservations for various reasons. But they are unwilling to take that into consideration or to work you in. They say they don't book it full because they are under staffed. No kidding! It usually takes a good 2 to 2 1/2 hours to complete your meal. this made eating at the buffets a little more pleasant since you could go right in with no wait, serve yourself, eat and be done. Service was pretty good in the buffet rest's. I know I said I was going to make this brief....Sorry! Slippery floors. The whole resort is a walking hazard. There were people slipping and/or falling constantly(our family and friends included!). Not just on the slick tile in all the buildings, hallways, stairs, but on the slippery concrete around the pools too! One lady that we met slipped and fell down a flight of stairs. They(resort workers) took her to the on site doctor. He told her to go to hospital that he couldn't do anything for her. Then they handed her a bill for $82!! They refused to pay. Then the hotel told her that she would be responsible for the taxi to the hosp and for the hosp bill! (she didn't go) Then they sent her a small bottle of tequila and a paper plate with a small handful of nuts on it..I guess as a good will gesture?? I guess they know we can't seek legal action. Too few staff members. There would be 1 bartender when they needed 3. It's an All-Inclusive, the bars are going to be busy so cover them with adequate staff! It would have made a huge difference to have more than one person making reservations at the restaurants in the mornings instead of making guest stand in line for 30 minutes to an hour. The sports bar...I felt so bad for the bartender there. He had about 40 people in the bar trying to order food and drinks(because the buffets close in between b'fast, lunch and dinner). He was running crazy! And it was like this everyday. Internet service- Not! Well, I should say not unless you want to pay $20 for 24 hours of service. Please note..we were in a Junior Deluxe Suite. I think Platinum gets free internet service. I guess that is what got us so bad...it doesn't cost them any more for 1 or 10 people to connect so why not offer it? Heck, the Holiday Inn offers free Wireless internet to all of their guest and they are not \"5 Stars\"(more about 5 stars later). In addition to the ridiculous charge for internet connection, you have to pay for the access card with a $20 US bill, which the front desk did not have any to change for us but it was their machine that required it! AND have to connect to the service and use in the front lobby. (Although..we did figure out that we could connect in our room even though they didn't tell us we could. We still had to use the card access code numbers. too bad we didn't figure this out until our 24 hours was almost up.) Phone service...they wanted to charge us $5.00 per minute to connect us to our PINGO calling card account (which was only going to cost .12 per minute with our Mexico to US connection number). Here is the crazy thing about that..the operator said $5 per minute. the hotel manager said \"No, only a $5 connection fee, no per minute fee.\" The concierge said \"I don't know, call the operator\". The operator won because they are the ones that do the actual connecting/charging. We asked all of them if they had any suggestions of how we could call home for less than $5 per minute. They all suggested that we take a taxi into town and try a public payphone! WHAT?? We ended up paying $20 for internet service for one day, emailed my mom to check with Verizon on the use of email with our Blackberry. It ended up (per Verizon) that we could email from the B.Berry for FREE and call home on the B.Berry for only a $.99 roaming fee. I'll know for sure when I see my invoice. So why wouldn't the resort have these suggestions for us? Surely we are not the only guest that have had a need to call home to our office and send a few emails. Maybe they were more into that $5/minute and $20/24 hour charge??? SAD and very poor service. Again, not user friendly. Oh..they will tell you that they offer you free internet connection in the Sports Bar. There were 3 computers but only 1 worked the whole week. No matter what time we went, there was a line of people waiting to use the computer. It is \"30 minutes per user\" but we found that the kids would get on it to surf youtube and if there were 2 or 3 of them plus 3 or 4 others waiting in line...well you can figure that out. If you say you provide it..provide it. If it is broke, fix it! Seems simple enough to me! Well, honestly I could continue but my husband is telling me that nobody is going to want to read all this. So won't go into ...the outrageous prices for necessities(bug spray!) in the resort store, the stinky musty smell in the damp rooms, not enough shuttles, getting locked out of our room, by the front desk, at 8:30pm because they didn't have me sign my travelers checks in the right place(yes, seriously!), walking into our room(fresh from the pool) 1 hour before we need to leave for the airport, to find two men tearing our bathroom apart (maybe because of a leak, they couldn't speak English so I don't know exactly what was going on), 3 calls and 3 hours to get coffe for the coffee maker...ok I will stop, sorry. You get the picture, i hope. Luckily we are easy going, \"go with the flow\" kind of travelers, honest. We had a lot of fun regardless of all of this. I will end it with this... I think if you look at other reviews it looks like the Platinum guest were happier with the overall service. Unhappy reviews mostly come from the Non-Platinum guest. Come on, this is supposed to be a 5 Star Resort, all service aspects should be above outstanding regardless of what type of room you stay in, right? This resort has been open since Nov or Dec of 2007. They have had more than enough time to fix the problems but they have not and doesn't appear that they are even trying to change or improve. The conversations around the pools are mostly about how disappointed everyone is...Very sad for such a pretty resort. Also, Notice that the only site that refers to this resort as a 5Star is their own!

Overall, I would say that for the money - it's ok. Definetely not a 4 or 5 star resort. I suggest taking day trips to Xel-Ha (ecopark) and Cozumel (35min ferry ride). Let's go through each part of the stay. Check-in - despite other traveler's reviews, our check in was fairly painless. We arrived around 2pm and had one family in front of us. We got checked in quickly, showed the conceirge our Marriage Certificate and walked to the room. The bell boy followed behind us about 10mins with our bags. We received a complimentary bottle of Tequila for our honeymoon package along with what had appeared to be a half eaten dessert plate. Room - we stayed in Jr. Deluxe 6019. Very spacious, we requested the third floor but got the first. I wanted the first because I fear our patio door being street level. And keeping that in mind, we always made sure our patio door was locked (however, one day after maid service, they had left it unlocked). We kept all of our valuables in the safe, so I didn't get too bent out of shape. Only other problem that other traveler's complained about (and it is really annoying) is that the shower drain is not in the correct location of the shower floor. We had to place towels against the door otherwise there was a pond in the bathroom after a shower. Hotel - the hotel itself is amazing looking! So beautiful at night! Pools were great, bar service was great - Manuel made the drinks very strong! The beach was clean, only rocky in some places as you get further away from the main resort area. We got massages on the beach, they were amazing! $20/half hour. My husband loved them so much we had to go back to get another before we left. Food - Ok. By the last two days I was really getting sick of buffett food. Also, when they come to ask you what you want to drink, order two of whatever you want because they do not come back very often. We arrived at the resort just a week after they stopped doing reservations for dinner for your entire stay. We could only make dinner reservations for the same night and the next night. Reservations begin at 9am-1pm at the restaurants and then 1-6pm at the conceirge. They book fast, and it's a pain in the [--] because we wait in line forever - enough to ruin the experience. We only book 3 nights because we took 2 excursion days away from the resort. We ate at Miso - very good ; La Vacqueria - ok, and Miso Grill (where they cook it in front of you - Japanese steak house style) - great! We will not be returning because basically the entire time you are waiting for something - nothing is on time - or there is a line because they are shorthanded on the staff. My husband said that if we are going to spend that much money - he would spend a little more to be at a resort where these problems do not occur.

Great family vacation with our three kids (ages 15, 18, 20). As everyone else who was reading the reviews prior to leaving, my husband and I were worried about the resort. Totally unfounded....we had a great time. The resort is truly beautiful. Marble everywhere, The front lobby bar is gorgeous at night with great irridescent tile and back lit marble wall art. We had two deluxe jr. suites in the 6000 section. We booked through Funjet and several weeks prior to our arrival, we had requested rooms with a view of pool and/or ocean as well as a preference for corner rooms. We specified either the second or third floors, to avoid mosquitos. All of our requests were granted without us having to remind the check in staff. Only saw a couple of mosquitos...was no big deal. Didn't even have to break out the bug spray (which we brought, just in case). We split our time between beach days and pool days - if you want shade, you definitely have to put your towels out early (by 8:30 at the latest) to get a shady spot. I know there were some people griping about this practice, but when in Rome....... The $20 half hour massages were great on the beach and a bargain. My husband was smart to bring lots of $1 bills to tip the staff. We prefer relaxing on our chaises, reading our books and prefer not having to go to the bar to get our frosty cocktails. The staff was very attentive and we were happy to tip a couple of dollars for the service each time they brought us a round. He also left a couple of dollars each day for the housekeeper and in the mini bar...always had great service and the mini bar guy would leave me an extra Diet Coke since he could tell that was my favorite. The dinner reservation process is not the most customer service friendly, but we were able to eat at Miso(Japanese), Las Olas (Seafood), Mama Mia (Italian) and La Hacienda (Mexican). LOVED Miso (ask for seats at the cooking table). Really enjoyed the entertaining chef (called himself Jackie Chan) and got my daughter and another guest involved in the \"show\". The beef was really good and the sushi appetizer was tasty. We enjoyed the Italian restaurant second best. The breaded veal Milan style was great. The Mexican restaurant had huge plates of fajitas. My daughter and I both ordered the shrimp fajitas and they were brimming with shrimp(could have split it), I have to say that the Seafood restaurant was our least favorite (which was disappointing because I love seafood). My husband and sons ordered the fried red snapper and it came whole (head, tail and all) and was overcooked. My daughter and I split the Special Princess Grill and it was tasty, but wish there had been other choices. Buffets were great for breakfast (nice omelets and cook to order eggs), OK for lunch and not that great for dinner - go to the ala cartes. We didn't see any of the shows but listened to the band a few nights and saw the Aztec dancers in the courtyard. Enjoyed these. We had a bit of rain on Friday night, Sunday night and all day on Monday (Thanks to Dolly), but six of seven days had beautiful sunshine. One big word of warning - when it rains, the beautiful marble floors are extremely slippery. I found that out the hard way by taking a big tumble Sunday night - great big bruise on my upper thigh (looks so good with your bathing suit) and a bruised tailbone that still aches. BE CAREFUL - very slippery when wet so don't take this lightly. If your shoes have smooth soles, this exacerbates the slipperiness. This is probably not the best resort for elderly people. We had a great family vacation. The hotel staff was sweet and attentive, the facility is beautiful and the grounds are gorgeous.

For months prior to our vacation, I spent hours on tripadvisor, reading every user review. Probably like you, I was somewhat nervous about what a week stay at the GRP would bring. It turns out that any worrying was for naught - this resort is fantastic. While our stay was certainly not without minor issues (which I'll detail below) overall our experience at the GRP was a great one, and we would definitely return. Over the next few paragraphs I'll attempt to lay out some info that will help with your trip, as well as give some insight on my experiences. Keep in mind that we were at the resort in mid-July, which I believe is a little slower than 'high' season. Nevertheless, the hotel was crowded during our stay. CHECK IN - After a 45 minute bus transfer through funjet (with one prior stop) we arrived at the GRP at approximately 2pm on a Wednesday. There were no lines, and we quickly checked in with the English speaking front desk man. He gave us our room keys at this time (an hour early). We also received two towel cards ($25 fee if lost) and two maps of the resort - one the zeroxed copy I've read about (although ours was pretty clear and came in handy over the week) and one part of a brochure. DINNER RESERVATIONS - based on the advice I received here, I walked 15 ft over to the concierge desks and attempted to book dinner immediately after check in. I was slightly shocked when the concierge claimed that for Thursday and Friday they only had one restaurant available for each night (Japanese on Th, Seafood on F), but I booked what he gave me. For Saturday, Sunday and Monday I had my options of them all. I am guessing that most people stay from weekend to weekend, and thus arriving midweek wasn't ideal for trying to receive end of the week time slots. Two additional notes on dinner reservations - 1. they claim if you fail to show by 10 minutes after your reservation that they cancel all following reservations you made for the week 2. despite the concierge claiming the japanese restaurant was booked on friday, I was able to score 4 seats at the hibachi table on cancelingThursday when I went directly to the restaurant to change my original reservation. I'm not sure if this was due to other people , or just flat out being lied to, but in any case, I got my table. FOOD - Since we're on the topic, here are my thoughts - The buffet was surprisingly very good. Food quality was for the most part excellent. While they do seem to mix up their dishes on a day to day basis, I can see how after a week that the food can become repetitive, but I can't understand some of the complaining I've read here about the food. All 4 of us had no problems filling our plates every day. A quick review of the restaurants from worst to best - Seafood was in the same area as one of the buffets (which is closed at dinner). The menu was limited, and besides the soup, the food was average, at best. The desert was just leftovers from the buffet. Mexican - really crowded and poor service, but the waiter was over worked, and we were on vacation with nowhere to go, so why complain.. however the food selection was strange. Fajitas made up 1/2 of their dinner menu. Their 2nd course was a 'salad bar' which was literally an american salad bar. Again, desert was taken from the buffets. Italian - very crowded, but food quality was pretty good, from the apps to the main pasta dishes. I'd avoid the pizza, and again the desserts were from the buffet Japanese- hibachi was the highlight meal of the trip. It's pretty tough to mess up hibachi, and they didn't. With offering sushi as an appetizer, and huge portions, it was a winner. Also the only restaurant offering original desert selects that we went to. GROUNDS - By now, you know the deal - the place is huge. It's also beautiful. You know you're at a new resort - even the bathrooms are extravagant (and clean). I am 30 and work in NYC so I'm fairly active, however 12 weeks before my trip I required major knee surgery. I was worried about all the walking required and the reports of causalities on the marble floors. Despite not being 100%, I can say the resort is walkable for most people. I had no issues. It takes about 15 minutes to walk the length from the lobby to the beach... a nice stroll, for sure, but not the marathon that some would have you believe. As for the marble floors - while dry, they pose no issues. After some rain, you need to watch your step. To their credit, the resort was VERY on top of putting out 'wet floor' cones. I only saw one person slip and fall over 6 days, and a hotel employee rushed over to make sure she was okay.(she was) POOLS - the best feature of this resort. Even when the resort is full, i can't see the pools ever getting too crowded- there are just too many of them. The 'party pool' was mostly inhabited by the 18-30 crowd, while the other swim up bars offered more of a family vibe. There are also plenty of areas to get away and bathe in peace, even if you do not have a swim up room. ROOMS - we had a swim up room in the 6000s. I'd recommend this location if you wish to be about centrally located. The other couple we vacationed with had a regular suite in the 8000s. The two rooms were exactly the same - from size to decor. While we did not use the swim up pool as much as we thought we would, we preferred the location of the the 6000s regardless. * room notes- upon check in we had about two dozen mosquitoes in the room. We quickly realized we should had brought along some insect killer instead of just insect repellent. We were able to kill most of them, and I left with 3 bites. We also had two room issues that the GRP staff handled quickly. The first was a back door that did not lock. We had a repair man to the room within 5 minutes, who promptly fixed the door. We also had to call for our lock box to be reset -they sent someone within 10 minutes. Minor issues, and dealt with professionally. GYM - don't expect a full workout. They have a row of treadmills, some stationary bikes, two universal machines, and some free weights under 20lbs. The gym was never over crowded, probably because it wouldn't take long to go through their equipment. My wife did lose her ipod at the gym when she left it there accidentally, but that can't be blamed on anyone besides herself. NIGHTLIFE - they try, but they could be doing more. A band plays at the courtyard bar every night until about 10pm, but their set list is similiar every night. The shows have been written about extensively - personally, i did enjoy the two i attended, but i will admit that i only attended since there was nothing else to do. The sports bar, while offering pool and foosball, turns into the teen hang out at night. The disco opens at 10:30( i think?) and is actually better than I expected. The crowd is mainly young, but mixed. The music is what you can expect anywhere - a mix of 80s, 90s and today. We ended up spending a couple nights in Playa Del Carmen ($14 cab). There are plenty of cabs to take you there, and it's very easy to find a cab to take you back to the resort, even at 3AM. SERVICE - here's where the majority of complaints have been issued. It's a brand new, huge resort, and you can see it's understaffed. We didn't always receive the best '5 star' service that some people seem to think they're entitled to... but with a smile and a small tip, most of the time we got friendly, helpful service from everyone we encountered... whether it be extra beer in our fridge, a special order at the bar, or an extra towel for the pool. Maybe we were just lucky, but we didn't witness any of the horror stories I've read about - not any of the rudeness or indifference that some experienced. We were very pleased. Overall, this resort is what you chose to make of it. It's by no means perfect, but if you're there to relax, take (minor) things in stride, and can leave any stress behind at home, you'll find that the GRP is a great choice for an all inclusive in Playa Del Carmen.", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary,AB", "Title": "\u201cA good place, but tiered service levels\u201d", "Author": "Calgarycouple08", "ReviewID": "UR18101533", "Content": "Here\u2019s a long one, but hope it helps.

We stayed at the Riu Jalisco and the Grand Sirenis on previous trips to Mexico, and I speak semi-acceptable spanish. We originally booked in the Junior Deluxe suites - the base model. After 4 days we paid the upgrade to the Laguna Villas, and the difference was incredible. For completeness I'll review the two separate time frames. Last will be the restaurants. Pre-Laguna: We arrived originally signed up to stay in a deluxe junior suite - the base model. Our room was 6024 on the main floor and was very nice. It had a king-sized bed and stocked mini fridge. On the second day our bathroom ceiling started to leak and after two calls to service and a trip to front desk we moved to a room with two double beds (6133). Not so good on the Honeymoon. Both rooms had the 'non-draining' shower, and the peeled up roomsafe. We brought hardshell Samsonite luggage with locks, so were not too worried. Finding room at the major pools was very difficult, as the shady chairs were often held with a single shoe or other knick-knack. The beach was also very busy and shade was not at all easy to be found. There was still the occasional palm tree or such that could be maneuvered under, but it was a hunt. The salt-water pool was nice, but there are no washrooms near the pools; not even remotely. Of course, this is hardly a concern for the crowd that the party-pools cater to. Laguna Villas: On the 4th day at the Princess we upgraded to the Villa Laguna suites. We had done a walk through of one the night before and were completely sold. The rate for upgrading was $50US/person/night. The Front desk clerk on the Riviera side was trying to mess with us and say it was $99. His name was 'Moises' I believe, and he was the clerk I dealt with when moving from our waterlogged room on the 2nd night. We went over to the Sunset side and got the upgrade for the proper price. Use lack of communication to your benefit. Life changed completely when we upgraded. The rooms were immaculate, the Mayan shower (open roof) was very invigorating and the perks were unbelievable. There is a private pool in the middle of the Villas, only for Villa guests and over 18 only. There are enough double-bed pallaps for each suite, loungers, water-loungers, and a private bathroom, bartender, waitress, and concierge in the little oasis. Guests without the black armband are quickly turned away by the concierge. Your a La Carte meals are booked by the pool concierge, and they have special blocks for Villa guests so no reservation is impossible. We also got access to the Platinum Lounges and pools on both sides (which just upgraded to 4 computers each), and the Platinum section of the beach. We spent all but two of our 10 days at that private pool, and made some good friends. Included in the Villa upgrade/reservation was a \u00bd hour massage, manicure, pedicure, and facial treatment at the resort\u2019s spa. All of these were pretty well done according to my untrained eye. Meals: The Buffet for breakfast and lunch were fairly good. We cycled around the four buffets and found that each offered some unique items, so a little exploring can be worth it. We ate at the buffet for dinner the first 4 nights, then A La Cartes for the rest. La Fleur (International): Great food. We went twice and both times were perfect. Lamb was very good, and their beef and chocolate entree is quite the thing. La Hacienda (Mexican): Only a la carte with a buffet for salad. Generally skip it, since the meals are large and good. The pork or lamb is great and the fajitas were tasty too. La Vaqaria (the Grill): We had fairly good food here, but I can't recall the major details (it was a party night) Mama Mia's (Italian): this was alright. We were able to get a half order of pasta, and half order of meat as the main dish. This was a mistake as it was a tonne of food. The only meal there where we left food on the plates. The Gnochi wasn't too good, but the meat was. La Fondue (fondue): This was a bit slower of a meal, but very good! Some details: the food you pick for fondue is done in the kitchen, then brought out. The fondue pot you get is cheese. The shrimp and beef were tender as could be though, and we asked for some more buns to finish the cheese. Chocolate fondue for dessert = can do no evil. Miso (oriental): Go to the grill, or go home. We did this one twice with interesting results. Meal takes about 2 hours, with ~45 minutes of quiet waiting. The Grill was interesting and they try to entertain. Utensils are dropped here and there, but it goes quite well, and the meal is good. The rest of the restaurant is mediocre, and if I had to pay $25 to eat there, I'd be upset. Tuna was just a hunk of Tuna, and the pad tai was so gingery it was inedible. I feel bad about this review, but it was a let down. WARNING!!!!: For Platinum and Villa guests, there is a \"Dinner on the Beach\" on Fridays. It's actually a roped off part of the Tortuga buffet, with a table of once-cooked shellfish. It was cold, and frightening. There were also no instruments to crack crab either, so we had 1/2 plate there then left for the standard buffet. It would be safer if you just let this dinner slide past. Additional Notes: Mosquitoes ARE an issue. In our two previous stays in Mexico they were not around, but those resorts fogged for them. I took the brunt of their biting fury, but a night or two up at the lobby bar left my wife's ankles quite bitten. Bug spray is absolutely recommended for an enjoyable trip. The grounds are indeed immaculate and well kept. Palm strees This was our first experience with a very tiered resort. The colour of your wrist band really did seem to have an impact on your service level. I strongly recommend that you consider Platinum status if you are going to go, and the Villas if you can swing it. We will likely not return to this resort. While the price is low, it was worth it. If they rise to normal rates, we will go elsewhere. The Grand Sirenis is of the same Spanish style (huge, marble, etc.), and just seemed to have a higher quality to it across the board. We came to this resort since it was one of the only packages that flew on a Sunday.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cThe Good, the Bad, & the Ugly\u201d", "Author": "TexasSuperFarmer", "ReviewID": "UR18078849", "Content": "My family (two boys, ages 9 & 11) and 28 others just returned from a 5 day/ 4 night stay at the Grand Riviera Princess. We read the reviews on tripadvisor prior to our trip (but not before we booked the trip), and they were very helpful/ informative, so we felt obligated to leave a review for others to use. I honestly thought the majority of the negative reviews about this resort had to be posted by picky, negative people who find fault anywhere they go, but that is not the case. This was our 4th trip to the Riviera Maya area, so we have a general idea of what to expect at an all-inclusive resort, and we are low-maintenance people--feed us, be generally nice to us, and give us safe place to sleep, and we're not hard to please. Here it goes... THE GOOD: Check-in was quick and easy and the front desk staff was very friendly. The resort & vegetation is beautiful. We really enjoyed the beach, and we didn't have to wear beach shoes. There were some large rocks in the water, but they were easily visible and did not cause a problem. The boys could walk all the way out to the buoys, and they enjoyed collecting sea shells, building sand castles, etc. Overall the food was good (on par with other resorts we've stayed at) and we all found something we liked. The only ala carte restaurant we ate at was the Japanese restaurant, and we thought it was good & a learning experience. My boys had never eaten a meal with only chopsticks, so it was fun! We did not get to sit at the hibachi grill because we did not know to request that when we made reservations. I heard nothing but rave reviews from those who sat at the hibachi, so request it if you go. We stayed in a deluxe junior suite, and the room was beautiful. I would say it is the nicest room I've stayed in while in Mexico. We had no problems with the plumbing, odor, mosquitos, etc as others have experienced. The massage on the beach was fabulous--$20 for 1/2 hour, $40 for an hour. THE BAD: the resort is huge, and we found it to be too big for our liking. It was a chore to hike the 3/4 mile to the front to go to the restaurants & shops from our room or the beach. The activities are all located at one end of the resort or the other, and the middle is just a long, hot walk. It didn't seem to be designed with a relaxing vacationer in mind. We have always stayed in the middle-of-the-road price range room at other resorts, and we have always felt well-taken care of, pampered even. With the deluxe junior suite, however, we found the whole experience lacking. There is not a snack bar like other resorts have, so when the kids wanted a snack between meals, they were out of luck. Other resorts have chips, fries, hot dogs available most of the day, but not here. If you are taking children, pack snacks for them. The concierge service was poor. There were two concierges to service several hundred people. There was always a line, and I didn't get useful help or information. It is difficult to find out what the resort has to offer--there is no pamphlet in the room so you can see what all is offered--you just have to figure it out on your own. We found it very helpful to ask others who were staying there. We were still discovering things the last night. There were few activities for the kids. The kids club was geared for younger children--4--6 years old. One day there was a kids' volleyball game, but other than that, nothing. There were plenty of activities--horseshoes, bocce ball, volleyball, soccer, water polo--for adults, and kids were not allowed to join in for obvious reasons, but there wasn't the same offered for them. We were very scared of theft based on other reviews. We padlocked our suitcases every day, and we kept all of our money, phones, passports, travel documents with us at all times (yes, even on the beach). It was the only way we felt we were safe. We did not use the safe in the room because as reported, the front cover was peeled up showing what I suspect is a latch to open the safe. The others in our group said their safes were the same. None of us had a problem because we kept everything with us--very inconvenient. THE UGLY: We always tip the resort staff because we want to and because they always work so hard to make our vacation special. At the Princess, we found ourselves tipping in advance just to get the attention of staff and get service. This worked occassionally, but more often than not, we were still left with substandard service. I'm talking about having to get up and get a water pitcher to fill our own glasses--not to refill them, mind you, but just to have something to drink, period. Sometimes a waiter asked if we wanted a drink, and sometimes not. We came to just take what we could get. Our room was cleaned minimally, and the beds were made sloppily. We got 1 washcloth. We didn't get the fun stuff--no towel swan on the bed to greet us! I don't speak fluent Spanish, but I can follow along in bits and pieces. A waiter at the bar by the beach was speaking in Spanish to one of the waitresses as a whole line of people were waiting. He was mocking different nationalities and doing his best impression of each. She laughed heartily, but some in line were offended and left. I had been standing in line for quite awhile, so I stayed for my drink! Our last night was the exception, our waiter at dinner was a welcome relief. I can only say that at other resorts, his attitude and service have been the standard. Conclusion: If you have already booked your trip at this resort, don't worry. You'll have fun just as we did. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and the group we were with. If you haven't booked yet, I would seriously book at another resort. **NOTE: one couple in our group stayed in the platinum suite, and had a different experience. They had their own concierge, bar that was open late, a snack bar, and personal service. The staff knew them by name, and they got the service that is standard at other resorts.", "Date": "July 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monmouth Junction, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "bella1999", "ReviewID": "UR18076285", "Content": "Just got back last night from Grand Riviera Princess.

BTW if you have a teenage son make sure you bring long paints for him to wear otherwise they won't let him in the al acart resturant, it don't matter that he has a child bracelet he still considered a young adult. My son is 16 and had to wear long pants. Shows were just OK, it was only an entertainment not shows like i have been to other resorts. But it was air conditioned so that was great. Lots of pools and lots of fun. We had Pool Rooms so it was fun hung around there and we also had the waitress come around and get our orders for drinks. Beach was nice and refreshing. Did Katamaran and Jet sking. Also went to Cozumel was absolutely beautiful. Went for walk in Playa del Carmen at night a few times. Love it there and had dinner there one night it was to die for. And not expensive. Your on vacation, make it the best you can. It's not as bad as people say it is. Needs some more service around but everything is actually pretty good. Oh BTW don't forget to bring your RAID Insect spray, I don't leave home without it. Spray before dinner and before bed and you will be ok.

My husband and I traveled with another couple, no children, and enjoyed days lounging by the pool and having a drink or two - or three... We arrived around 1 pm on a Friday and check in was very easy and quick. I was afraid of the language barrier mentioned in some prior posts but did not have any problems. The other couple that was with us took spanish in high school some years ago and remembered enough for us to be functional for the trip. The thing to remember here is that we were not in the United States, we were in Mexico, and they were a lot better with English than I am with Spanish. To expect that they would be perfectly fluent in English is a bit egocentric. The resort was HUGE which I did not expect. We were in the platinum area and did not make the walk to the lobby at any point during our stay, we always took the shuttle. I was on vacation and being lazy on vacation is perfectly acceptable in my book. As a side note, we did not experience issues getting a shuttle - I rode on my husband's lap home one night from a show but otherwise the shuttle was usually there within minutes of us getting to the stop and had ample room for the folks that were there waiting. Our room was wonderful. We had a comfortable bed, stocked fridge, nothing stolen, plenty of towels, and it was cleaned daily. It could have something to do with leaving a decent tip the first morning we left our room :) Our view wasn't great but the other couple we were traveling with had a great view so we just moved our balcony chairs over to their room for the week. The Platinum lounge and pool were a lifesaver for us as it was not as crowded as the other pools at the resort and the water tended to be a bit cooler. We were always able to find a chair and normally 4 chairs in the shade which was nice. The one complaint that I would have about the pool area in general was that folks would \"reserve\" the beds and huts by leaving their belongings on it ALL DAY regardless of whether they were there or not and only stop by only occasionally. If you aren't using the space - let others use it, play fair. I also did experience some frustration when trying to use the internet in the lounge as there were a large number of children / teenagers that would park themselves on the computers to play games and check their myspace/facebook accounts for 30-45 minutes at a time. I found this to be inconsiderate and NEVER saw parents monitoring their children's online activity, scary. The beach was gorgeous and the water was beautiful. We only went to the beach one day though as we didn't get there until around 11 or 12 and there were no chairs left. There were rocks when you first got in but if you walked past them, it was just beautiful white sand. We had the breakfast buffet every morning and enjoyed it. Made to order omelets are one of my favorite breakfast treats! We did the buffet for dinner only one time and ate at the restaurants in the main lobby the other nights. We made reservations with our concierge the afternoon we got there and were able to book dinner every night at the time we wanted except for the day we arrived. The mexican and italian restaurants were my favorite. We did a sunset cruise with the Lomas Travel folks (turquoise shirts and white pants, can't miss them) and had a BLAST. Would definitely recommend it for couples of all ages. It would be a great thing to do if there is a night that you can't get dinner reservations. My advice: 1. Book your dinner reservations as soon as you get there with your concierge, DON'T WAIT as the spots fill up quickly. 2. Take lots of sunscreen as you may find it difficult to find seating in the shade at the pool or beach 3. You have a safe in your room - USE IT. I have heard people talk of thefts from their rooms, we did not experience this but used the safe for everything of importance / value - ie passports, ipods, cell phones, wallets, etc. 4. Know some important Spanish - how to ask for more towels, more fanta / coke, more water, where is the bathroom, etc. These things can prove to be invaluable. Would I go back? Sure I would. When you're there - relax. There may be some things that are inconvenient or not as spectacular as you expected but YOU ARE ON VACATION and a mediocre day on vacation beats a day at work anytime!

There were lots of choices at each meal. Bars: We stayed by our own room most of the time, but had many drinks from the pool bar. Carlos & Ramon were wonderful! Tipping everyday sure helps! Only beer they have is Corona. Miami Vices are great! Shopping: We went into Playa Del Carmen one night. It cost $14.00 each way by taxi. It takes about 15 minutes. Little did we know that on Saturday nights in the courtyard at the hotel, vendors are set up with better prices than what you can get in town. Save your taxi money and shop on Saturday night!

The best thing about the hotel were the pools + gardens could not fault them found the waiters + barstaff to be very curteous and friendly .

The Grand Riviera Princess and the Grand Sunset Princess ARE THE SAME HOTEL, just different lobbies. I stayed on the Riviera side and could not see a difference between the two other than you check in at a different front desk. They share the same pools, a la carte restaurants, buffets, disco, beachfront etc. It is a HUGE resort so if you don\u2019t like to do a lot of walking, do not stay here! I loved all the walking (especially since I ate and drank all that I did). It is a good 10-minute walk from the front desk to the beach, but there is pools and bars all along the way to make the jaunt enjoyable! The only place we had bad service was at the front desk. They don\u2019t give info about the hotel, taking the shuttle to the city, booking reservations a-la carte restaurants etc. Plan to figure out the details of the hotel on your own. They did not have maps of the resort to help orient ourselves. They also could not exchange and money for us. We had to go to town to do this (see $ tip below). The front desk is the only area we got bad service. The bellboys are helpful (will deliver your luggage to your room if you ask). The service in the bars, restaurants, room service, mini-bar stock person, animation team, Air Transat reps, even the gardeners are all wonderful! Besides the front desk, we had amazing service. You cannot check in until 4 PM. If you arrive earlier than that, be prepared to not have a room until then. There is a hospitality suite where you can shower and relax and order room service until you room is ready. But you have to ask for access to this room. It is not an advertised service. I never got to experience this as we found out about this service after we got our room. (Even if you can\u2019t check-in right away, all you really need is a pair of sandals, a bathing suit and your all-inclusive wristband. You are on Vacation!) We had a junior deluxe suite (plain, standard room) and it was gorgeous! If you can afford to book platinum though, do so. Platinum gets a private pool and private cabanas! Tips: Bring water shoes \u2013 the beach is rocky. Wal-mart sells them for $8. You will be glad you invested. The water served from pitchers in buffets and restaurants and at the bar is distilled and is okay to drink. I did not know this and spent a fortune in the gift shop on bottled water the first day. Ice cubes and slush drinks are made from purified water too. When they say, \u201cdon\u2019t drink the tap water\u201d they mean don\u2019t drink from the taps. Any water your order at bars etc will be okay. Don\u2019t make the mistake we did. Do any money exchanging or breaking bigger bills into smaller bills before you leave on vacation. Bring American $1 bills for tipping (we had $100 in $1 American bills for 1 week and we ran out on the last day) and bring small denominations in pesos ($20 and $50 pesos) for souvenirs. Use your credit card for bigger purchases, excursions etc. Don\u2019t waste precious vacation time dealing with $ exchange. It\u2019s not nearly as convenient as you might expect. Book you\u2019re a-la-carte reservations early, they fill up fast. Reservations can only be made from 9AM-1PM at the restaurants. Each restaurant has 2 names basically, ex: the steak house is also called Vaqueria. We got confused and booked reservations at le fleur and the international restaurant, which were the same restaurant. We were able to change it but we had to stand in the reservation line twice. Figure out which ones you want to go to before you book. This may save you some time in the end. Take the ferry to Cozumel ($24 American round-trip per person) and rent a scooter or ATV. You can cruise around the island in less than 2 hours. It was more beautiful than words can describe and was the most romantic day of our trip. We rented a Rhino (side-by-side quad) for $55 American dollars for the whole day \u2013 so cheap. Scooter rentals run from $20-30 for the day. There is souvenir shopping there too. Go to the Air Transat beach party held every Thursday night. Lots of fun. You can plug your appliances, chargers, etc right into the wall. You do not need an adapter. The joys of modern electrical outlets! Try the soft serve ice cream at the main pool bar. Unexpected and yummy! Mini-bar stock person is not the same as the maid who cleans your room. Each day we normally got 2 beers, 4 different liquors, mix, and 4 bottles of water. If you tip the mini-bar guy he will leave extra stock! He came to our room everyday at about 4PM. There is a free shuttle from the hotel to Playa del Carmen. It runs a few times a day. Be sure to get a seat reservation voucher from the hotel activity guy or you may not be able to get on. Supposedly, it picks people up from the city and brings them back to the hotel, but we could never find it. A cab ride back to the hotel is $10. Don\u2019t get a ride from a cab parked along the main street, they price gouge. Flag one down on a side street. Be sure to negotiate the fare back to the hotel before you get in and don\u2019t pay more than $10 American to go back. A cab from the hotel into the city is $13 non-negotiable. It\u2019s cheaper to the hotel than it is to the city \u2013 weird! It is the most beautiful resort with lots to do. despite some very minor disappointments, I would highly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cWonderful property, relax and go!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "dimband", "ReviewID": "UR17825294", "Content": "We just came back from the resort (2 couples plus 5 kids).

Great food, clean rooms, cool a/c, good service. It has a very original design - has an Italian twist. Nice sculpture work. Pools are awesome! Beach is wonderful (we swam all the time in the sea). Kids program is very good (Kids club is open untill 11 pm). There are some imprerfections of course, but all the places have something: hotel is understuffed, but the service is great. You can't get coffee or hot tea during lunch or dinner but you can get it in the bar if you want. Beach towels are not always available. Even though the hotel is only 6 months old it needs some cosmetic work done. From time to time there may be mosquitoes in the evening (this in not unusual for Riviera Maya). The hotel provides insects repellent tissues, but it might be a good idea to bring something from home with you.

We went down originally just my boyfriend and I for my birthday, but as the word spread about the good deal we got, it ended up being 8 of us (4 couples) who booked. Brief background on the group, my boyfriend and I, along with one of the other couples all work for Marriott (so we know what to expect from hotels, and how many truly INSANE people there are out there who expect INSANE things). The age range of the group was 25-42. The other two couples work in various other professions, but pretty much all middle class people. I booked before the hotel was open, so I started reading reviews as soon as they came back. As many others have said on here, I was anxious going down to the resort because I really didn't know what to expect, especially because I am used to staying at Marriotts, and it was my first time to Mexico. I will try to not to go into every little detail about our stay, and the resort...many others already have. Our check in was fine. We arrived at 11:00am, new our room wouldn't be ready for awhile, so checked our bags, grabbed some lunch and a drink, changed, and just about as we were heading to the beach, our room was ready!!!! Down we went, with our luggage to follow. We got to the room, discovered it was a double swimout instead of a king. I called the front desk, waited awhile and nobody answered, and said who cares. It might be nice having two beds, and it was. The room was clean (though not up to Marriott standards but nothing really ever is), pretty, and in MEXICO. I was so friggin happy to be there nothing mattered. It took about 15-20 minuted for our bags to be delivered, but the only reason I cared was because I wanted to go to the beach! Our room was cleaned, beds made, fridge stocked everyday. Maybe that's because on the first day I left little notes in spanish thanking the housekeeper and beverage guy with a couple bucks. Maybe not. Either way I am glad I did, because our service was perfect. The food was good. But I am what you may call an adventourous eater. I like octopus salad, and pate, and often would pick something from the buffet having know idea what it was. I loved almost everything. We made our reservations for the ala cartes the 2nd we were there about 9 in the morning. Walked in to Miso, no line, made reservations for 3 places, and left in about 10 minutes. EASY The ala cartes were all delicious, and fun. Le Fleur is the BEST. The beach is FABULOUS. Plenty of chairs, a waitress to get your drinks, the beach bar. I hate seaweed and stepping on things I don't know what are, and I was fine swimming without shoes (though I brought some because it is nice to not step on rocks). The massages are nice and cheap! The bars on occasion had a wait, but when do you ever go to a bar that is fun and not wait?!? And the staff, they were some of the nicest hardest working people I have ever seen. Ruth in the lobby bar is so funny! Guilberto in Le FLeur is awesome, Nacho at check in, and so many others I forgot their names. I don't think I once encountered somebody rude. Remember the saying, you attract more flies with honey than vinegar? I think the people who meet all the \"rude\" workers might just be rude jerks themselves. Overall, this was an awesome vacation. I loved it, and if I didn't like to go to new places each time I would definetly be back. Oh yeah, and to all the people who said the resort is big and complained about walking, you must just be lazy. Although it is big, its nice to be able to move around and not see 200 people walking down the same path. Don't be afraid or nervous to go!!! Enjoy yourself, you are in Mexico.

It was a good value for a family vacation with our two sons ages 8 and 11. This was our 5th time to Mexico (3 times to RIU Palace Mexico, once to Palladium). We have also been to three other all inclusives (Couples Negril and Ocho Rios, and Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana). We did find ourselves comparing this trip to the others we have taken, and it measured up to them in most ways. Check in was very easy. We were the only ones there. It was about 4:30. I had emailed a request for our Jr. Suite to be facing inward close to the pools. That is exactly what we got. We were assigned a ground floor room. It was room 7036, at the end of the building right where the pools start. I would recommend this location, which actually turned out to be great for watching our kids swim from our balcony at the end of each day. We were given a nice colored pamphlet with a map to help find the room. The room was very nice. We did not have the leaking shower problem, but the plumbing was poorly done. Caulk in the sink was unfinished, and one faucet fixture swayed back and forth about 6 inches in each direction. The floors are nice tile, but we could hear our neighbors dragging their furniture over it each morning. We just joked that it sounded like they were remodeling, and tried to ignore it. These were minor issues that would not spoil our fun. The grounds are very pretty. I think the beautiful purple and yellow shrubs add gorgeous contrast to the white buildings. The kids enjoyed the statues, especially an unfinished one close to the beach with an iguana who had made his home there. Our room was right about in the middle of the length of the resort, and we did not feel that there was too much walking. In fact, it seemed about the same size as the Iberostar and Palladium. It could not have taken us more than five minutes to walk to either end of the resort from our room. The pools here seem endless. Some looked virtually empty, even though the resort was at capacity when we were there. The beach is nice to walk on in both directions. There is not much on both sides of the resort, so it feels very private. We were always able to find 4 chairs together, and even got a palapa one day after a late breakfast. Many chairs were saved, but we did not find that necessary. As a mom of two boys, I was on the look-out for toplessness, afraid they would get an eyefull, but I did not notice anything more than a few little girls. There seemed to be mostly Americans and Canadians there. It is unfortunate that there are rocks in the water. On a few yellow flag days, we could not see where the rocks were, and we stumbled into quite a few. I tried to watch for people in front of me who were not seeming to trip or yelp in pain, and just followed them. On green flag days, we could see the dark spots in the water, and just walked around them. Another tip is to watch the path the water aerobics group takes in the morning. Our kids loved the pool by the party pool. Each day the staff (from the Kids Club?) would round up a bunch of kids to play water polo. We could lounge around the pool or go to the swim up bar while the kids were having a blast. The staff was awesome with the kids. I even watched as one of the guys carried a tiny girl who couldn\u2019t swim on his back, just so she could participate. Very sweet! They also very tactfully dealt with an older boy from Italy who seemed to become quite a bully to the other kids. I was very comfortable letting our kids go off to the Kids Club with the group one day to play soccer, and when they were done, the staff delivered them right back to us at the pool. The swim up bar was very busy at times, and the bartender could have used extra help, but we didn\u2019t feel that we needed to wait too long for a drink. We did bring the Bubba Kegs, and I know some people frown on that, but we only needed to go to the bar once or twice all afternoon, while other people had to go over and over again. It was sometimes fun to watch the \u201ccrazy game\u201d by the pool, and there were some people who obviously had way too much to drink. I\u2019m a people watcher though, so it was very entertaining. Housekeeping was inconsistant. One day we only got 2 towels for 4 people, one day-no washcloths, yet another day we hit the jackpot with more soaps, gels,etc. than we could use. I did walk in on the maid changing the sheets once during our stay. I don\u2019t think she ever swept or mopped because the floor always felt gritty. We even had a lady\u2019s hair clip (not mine) under our sink in plain view the whole time. The minibar guy knocked around 9:00 each day even though we had the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign out. We thought it was funny that he\u2019d only let us have ONE Fanta for our two boys to fight over. We brought a luggage lock due to the report of theft I had read about, but never felt like we needed it. Our room safe didn\u2019t look like one I saw a picture of\u2014there was no sticker to peel off. We left valuables in it with no problem. One mystery that gave us a chuckle though\u2014my son had a backpack out by the table, and we noticed about halfway through the week that 2 packs of cookies and a couple muffins we brought as airplanes snacks went missing. Guess the maid got hungry. Food was a let-down even though I was prepared from reading other reviews. Immediately after checking in, we went straight to the concierge and made reservations. We could not get one until our 5th night. Meanwhile we ate the buffet food, which was better for breakfast and lunch. At dinner it was the same thing each night, and compared to other resorts we\u2019ve been to, a very limited selection. I would have to rank this resort at the bottom of our list for food. My son (not understanding that this vacation is prepaid) said \u201cno wonder the food is free\u2014it\u2019s disgusting!\u201d We did not feel there was a problem with the food temperature. Service was acceptable. One night we were not offered drinks, but a few times at breakfast, they gave me the whole coffee pot, even though I\u2019m the only one at our table who drinks it. It was a relief to finally get into an ala carte. We did enjoy the Mama Mia-very good food, Hacienda\u2014great fajitas, and La Fleur\u2014okay food, but the best service we got the whole time. My son got up to get a drink between courses (his idea of fun), and the manager(?) came over and started apologizing. We then saw him scold our server, who was doing a great job, and then HE apologized. We had to explain that our son WANTED to get his own drink. That was almost good service to an extreme! Our boys also enjoyed the sports bar, both for the nachos and the game tables. We could watch them through the glass window of the computer room as we waited to use the internet one night. There are only 2 working computers for the whole resort, so it can be a long wait. Thank goodness the guy in front of us was timing people! The shows were average, but the acrobats held our attention the best. It was nice to sit in an air conditioned theater, especially when most nights it rained while we were in there. One caution was that the floors were then full of puddles and we did see people fall. All in all, this was a great value for what we paid for the week.

I am 28, he is 35, no kids. Anyhow, we had read a combination of good & bad reviews about the resort. So we went prepared with an open mind, expecting some good & bad aspects about the resort. ROOMS - watch out for the safe, some of the stickers on the safe are intentionally lifted. We were warned that it allow someone to reset your pin number, somewhere under the thick sticker. - on the upside, the rooms are modern and beautiful. - we were placed into 4 different rooms in 4 days. Air conditioning was extremely loud, and we couldn't sleep. Every few hours, the air conditioner would turn on, and it sounded like someone threw a desk across the room. The hotel staff finally admitted that they are aware of the problem in certain areas of the building, however maintenance was never able to fix our problem. My boyfriend finally fixed it by adjusting the thermometer to 15 degrees, so that it would never turn off!! This solved our air conditioner problem after 4 different rooms. - we chose to avoid maid service all week, and placed a sign on the door \"do not disturb\". On more than 3 occasions the maids ignored our sign, and went into our room and cleaned it! We did not want anyone in our room/s due to the problem with our safe, and didn't want to risk anything being stolen. Thankfully, nothing was ever stolen! - be aware of the loud construction starting very early in morning...doesn't really allow you to sleep in beyond 8am. FOOD - Boring, and exactly the same every evening. - Had reservations at all 7 ala cartes. Went to three before we left feeling hungry and disgusted. Food was much better at the buffet than the restaurants. - Diarrhea started for me two days before we left, and it is still persisting! My boyfriend had it as well, but only for 2-3 days. ACTIVITIES & ENTERTAINMENT - attended only two shows, similar to all other resorts. PROPERTY - property grounds are beautiful, and well cared-for. - resort is massively huge. 15-20 minute walk to the ocean. shuttle available, but you must always wait. not a great resort for the elderly, anyone with special needs, etc. - most staff barely speaks english, making asking for coffee or tea a big hassle. All in all, I have stayed at 3 stars up to 5 star resorts. This is a new resort (1 yr I am told), and I found it to be more rated to a 3.5 star.

I was there June 11 -18 with 2 girlfriends. We stayed in room 5209. There was a line at check-in (11 A.M.), but then we noticed the Platinum check-in where we had no wait and were provided with a glass of 'champagne'. We tipped the lady at the desk. Our room was ready by noon...our bags were taken for us - we decided to walk just to get a feel for the resort. It took 10+ min. but was a beautiful stroll. The staff we encountered here and for the rest of our trip were very friendly-\"Hola\" is a greeting I will miss. This is going to be a long read - I've bulleted the points for user ease. > Housekeeping: Upon arrival, our room was clean except for the outdoor jacuzzi. We called the concierge in the Platinum Lounge, and a nice lady came up and had it cleaned within 10 min. We tipped her, too. Our room was cleaned every day to our satisfaction. We left a tip for them everyday. > Food: We didn't know what we were doing the first day and wound up eating in the Riviera buffet for lunch and dinner. We did not want to return....it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good, either. A lot of variety, but just ok. The second day we sat down with our concierge, Jonathan, who made reservations for us for our last 5 nights...he couldn't find anything we wanted for that night. No problem, though, as room service is included. We ordered salads and 2 varieties of pizza - Delicious!! Here are the restaurants at which we ate: Miso: My personal favorite...you can make 3 different types of reservations here, sushi, 'regular' or 'tepanyaki' (?) where we sat in front of the grill and got a show along with a wonderful meal. The chef even fried bananas for dessert. Le Fleur: My second favorite....we each had a different fish dinner, and we were all very happy. La Hacienda: Mexican food made for Americans. Mama Mia: Decent Italian Oh yeah, the last night we skipped out on Fondue...decided to start packing and just get room service again. Ate our last meal out on our veranda - it was prompt and delicious. >Platinum Lounge: Did I mention it was worth every penny? Every morning, you can get regular coffee or make your own latte or cappucino. You will be greeted by Sergio, the friendliest and hardest working guy around. We tipped him. There is always an abundance of fresh fruit (I developed a passion for fresh mango with my coffee) and an assortment of pastries and cereals. During the afternoon hours, there was always something to munch on...small crab salad sandwiches, fresh smoked salmon, chocolate covered strawberries, nuts, olives, etc. All this AND a full service bar! In the evening, there is an assortment of pastries, and 'Ceyla' takes over the bar...she is fantastic! She took the initiative to learn our American names. We tipped her, too. She thought we were funny because we always ordered doubles ( see \"Beach\") The downside was that the wi-fi we were expecting wasn't working the entire week, and the lounge had only 2 computers to share amongst the guests. It was never a long wait, but the keyboards were different (Spanish?) and a bit of a pain. My friend needed to do some business while there and everyday was promised a chord for her laptop. This was Jonathan again....she was finally offered one the final day, but it was too late. >Pools: We had our own 'lap pool' outside of the PL, it was never crowded and had the option of either a sunny chaise lounge or a shaded chaise or bed. Towels are abundant. The other pools are salt-water (not sure about the PL pool) and wind all over the resort. We had great service at the swim-up bars even though we couldn't tip (bikinis don't have pockets). >Grounds and Structures: The landscaping is beautiful, if a bit immature - in a few months it will be spectacular. We noticed some unfinished business - some of the sculptures along the main walkway had yet to be installed. I'm not real confident about the structural soundness of the buildings. Many previous reviewers complained of water leaking through the ceilings etc. We did not experience any of this as we were on the top floor. However, we did notice a huge crack running the length of 2 floors outside of our building. The resort isn't even a year old?!? Also, there is construction going on to the north of the Riviera side - mainly along the front of the resort. Avoid this area. (rooms 7017 - 8233) All in all it is a beautiful resort with more marble than I've ever seen in one place. >Our room: Partial ocean view, jacuzzi indoors and out. We really liked being on the top floor because our roof outside was thatched. A tropical delight. The biggest drawback, and it was bothersome, was that the toilet didn't flush properly - yuck! > Fitness center and Spa: The FC offers 4 ellipticals and 4 treadmills with a variety of strength-training equipment. Never had a problem getting what was needed. The spa is beautiful. We each got a free 30 min. massage. It also offers a nice indoor pool if the weather is bad. >Beach: Saved the best part for last (finally!) We loved it. Plenty of sunny spots next to shade from the palapas met all of our needs. The hostess in the Platinum area, Haide, is the best!! And our server, Lily, was a delight, too. We tipped them both. We didn't care for a lot of sweet mix in our pina coladas, so developed a habit of only ordering doubles...we really were 'living large'! Don't miss out on the double mango margaritas, either. The beach is beautiful, but it is a bit rocky once you go in the water....but I was expecting this. Unfortunately, the ocean is very calm, so no body surfing. We also got massages on the beach! $40 US for an hour is a steal. Ask for Eric. All in all it was a fabulous stay - life, even on vacation, is not perfect. Your trip will be what you make of it.

Food - It was good and there was much to choose from. We had a vegetarian with us and she could always find something to eat. Rooms - Very nice. We were on the ground floor and had access to the pool from our room. No one else talked about this when I was looking through the reviews about the safety with the walk out pools. We felt very safe. No one tried to break in. The only problem with the room was the mosquitoes. People did write about this and I think the problem occures mostly on the ground floor. When the cleaners come they leave the door open and all the mosquitoes come in. We did bring bug spray and used a lot. It helped unit we ran out so for the rest of the week our room was full of them. For many people this may not be a problem but because I get a reaction from bug bites when I am down south it was very annoying. But I wanted to stay in our room because having the pool steps away is very nice. Resort - Is kept very clean and is beautiful. It is a bit of a walk if your room is closer to the beach to get to the main lobby but considering all the food and drinks you get might as well walk off a few pounds. The employees work very hard and although not all of them speak english and it may be frustrating please be kind. They get paid so little and work so hard. Being from Canada we never went into the pools (expect in front of our room) they looked clean but too many people were in them during the day. The beach - I have stayed at a few other places down south and have beeen warned that poeple wake up early and place towels on the chairs and came back to their spot later in the afternoon. Well this is the frist time it wasactually happening. At 7 in the morning poeple were walking to the beach mostly to make sure they got a place under a hut. This was also happening with the chairs by the pool. The sun is very hot during the day and there are not too many shaded spots. Also the number of poeple staying there during our week and the number of chairs available did not mach up. If you want to play the chair game be prepared to wake up early on your vacation. Other then that the beach is beautiful and the water is so nice. One other thing if you order a drink from a waitress working on the beach - tip them. I can't believe people would order 5 or 6 drinks and not even tip. They are always smiling and friendly and get paid so little. Entertainment - The shows at night were not the best. And the disco was just as bad. With 2 girls in their 20's there was not much going on at nigt. We did go into Playa del Carmen and had a blast. If you want to pick up souvenirs go there. And it is very safe. At the end of the week we were so sad to leave.

The hotel could be lovely, but I;m afraid it is just one massive faceless hotel. We travelled with one child and our main complaints was the clenliness of the rooms, My daughter didn't have a bed put in the room for the entire 1st week. The childrens club was pretty non existent. Predominantly American& Canadian residents. Middle pool consisted mainly of loud music and drunken Americans, much to 18-30. The food on the whole was very good. Mini bar in room was stocked very minimally. Staff on the whole friendly and tipping made no different to the service you got, worst staff were the bar staff who were very good at ignoring everyone especially children. The availibility of snacks in the day is made as hard as possible to obtain being nowhere near the pool or beach areas. the beach is nice enough, very shallow you could walk out 60metres and still be only waste deep. You need to be aware that there is a lot of sharp stones in the sea, so it can be very uncomfortable. The hotel is very isolated so if you wish to go out at night a taxi is required, which obviously adds greatly to your costs. The Rivierra is a mirror image of thge Sunset which shares the same site and with the building work that is in progress(but not a problem) will create something like 2,000 rooms, which obviously means there is no personal service (its just to big).

First off when you get to the airport in Cancun as soon as you press the button that the attendant tells you and you have picked up your luggage zip through anyone and evryone in the airport until you get outside. Once outside look for your representative. Here goes we got to the resort around 1:00pm as expected room was not ready, we then headed to the buffet where we ate. At 2:30 pm we had our room we then moved our luggage on our own to our room which was a ways away. Although it was tiring the room was worth it we booked a junior deluxe suite. As we finished we headed to the beach, yes you have to mind your step. There are alot of dead coral which makes it yes \"rocky\" although these dead corals provide good housing for marine life; we are snorkel freaks. We then headed to the pool by the store near the buffet breakfast. The bartender was very good even though tip was not provided. I usually tip after I am done using the service and because he was always happy to serve even with no tip I left him a $5 USD. Proceeded to shower, yes the stalls leak; quick fix towels. Dinner was the Buffet. Next day we stayed in the resort booked a trip to playa del carmen, tulum/xelha and xcaret through our representative, do not do this. The same place you book for the playa del carmen shuttle is an agency that the representatives of your agency uses so book straight through them. Tried to book dinner was able to book 4 after waiting in line for an hour. Lunch & dinner was buffet again. Third day we went to playa del carmen, the beach here is not as rocky but beware they get deep fast. Vendors try to get you to come in the store so watch out. 3rd day we went an excursion, xcaret/tulum it was awesome but we ended up missing our dinner reservations. 4th day we discovered that there was a train that takes us around the resort. Breakfats was buffet by this time food was getting repetitive same with lunch, dinner was at the mexican wish I could tell you how it tastes but me and her were both drunk, but from what I remember the La cartes were packed had a line wait was long and not enough food. 5th day we went to Xcaret were we paid yet again extra money to go snorkelling to the reefs (awesome) and we did the sea trek which is walking underwater (ONCE IN A LIFETIME YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE IT). 6th day we chilled and joined the animation team they were not that bad. The day we had to leave our pick up was on time. My review: Pros: big and expensive resort made me feel like a star staff works hard beach is awesome for snorkelling when waves are not to strong free shuttle to playa del carmen with schedule room was always cleaned and fridge stocked free tequila if newly wed as long as bring certificate cons: always out of pool towels understaffed entertainment is mediocre food in buffet very repetitive not much variety in room bar purpose of jacuzzi still has to be clarified (never used it) BOTTOM LINE COME IN WITH A POSITIVE ATTITUDE DO NOT LET LITTLE THINGS BOTHER YOU.

None of our kids took part in the kids club..there was a lot of other things going on for them to do..our kids are very active. Let me put your minds at ease. This place is nice. Go, and do not worry. The food was VERY good. Even my picky eater daughter was very pleased and ate very well all week long. She even ventured out and tried new things with out me coaxing her too. So..let me start there..with the food. It was, in my opinion at least a 4+, maybe a 5. There was something for everyone. We never got tired of the buffets. We tried them all and they were all very good. I never saw any of the chefs putting out food from the night before. All the food was fresh and hot. (The bacon was crisp and yummy!!) Sometimes, depending on what time of the morning it was, we had to wait a bit on omlets..but so what...they were so good. There is only one chef working to cook eggs (fried, over easy, and omlets...). Ok..Pools...they are nice too. 4+. However, gotta watch where ya go here. Crazy pools, quiet pools, family pools, etc. You will figure out which pool is best for you, just like we did. It doesn't take long. Different strokes/different folks. Most of the pools have swim up bars and let me tell you...THESE GUYS ARE OVER WORKED. There is only one bartender at each one. This is not FAIR to them. I never saw the guys leave the bar the whole time I stayed there. Not for a break or anything. So be nice. Some drinks they don't know how to make, but most they do. Some drinks I've had at different resorts have been better, but oh well..I just drank something else. We did 3 A la Carts...I give them a collective 5+. The Japanese one?, Las Olas and La Fondu...they were all great. We had a cook table at the japanese one for the kids...they loved it and thought the food was great! We had the sit down dinner part and the food was good there too!. Las Olas was interesting and very good. Dinner took a long time, but was very good. La Fondu was great. Fun night because it was just us mom's. We laughed and had a great time. Dinner was shrimps, beef, salmon, chicken, and breads...dessert was fruits and cake to dip in yummy chocolate..ummm...yum!!!so good!! All the people who work there were great. I give them 5+. They are under staffed, but the ones who are there are working their butts off..so be kind and patient. They are running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to get everything done and doing a good job of it, but there's just so many of us and so few of them. It makes me feel so bad for them. We tried to tip well, because we wanted too, not because they ever expected it. They were so kind. The concierge people were mostly nice. I give them a 4. There were a few who were or could be \"rude\". But mostly nice and helpful. The front lobby on the Riviera side as far as check in goes was GREAT!! I give it a 5+. I am sorry I don't remember our guy but he was awesome. He had a dry sense of humor and checked our whole group in with ease and put us close together. We booked through Funjet and at the very beginning of our trip had a medical emergency. I can not tell you how helpful the LOMAS guys were. They were there for the people in our party who needed the help all the way through the end. So...Over all, with out the few nit picky negatives that don't amount to a hill of beans, that didn't take away from our trip at all...I give our trip a 4+...we had so much FUN!!! We were a large group of very different personalities who managed to have a great time. All of our kids learned to scuba dive here...did the pool demo and then we paid to take them out to the ocean. They kayaked a hundred miles in the ocean..they ran in the sand..collected sea shells..drank virgin margaritas, pina coladas, daquiris, etc....they made new friends and had many new experiences. This resort is large, but not as large as the Iberostars we have been to or the Palladium we went to last year...not in my opinion. OH..and the trams ran constantly...we used them alot. Yes, go..and go with a great attitude. The sun was great. We had rain one day, so what..we went to town and shopped. It was fun. If you have questions..ask.

Upon registration for two rooms with three guests each, the desk clerk looked puzzled when I asked for two junior suites which we had booked, preferably close together, with pool steps and two double beds each. \"That's going to be very difficult\" he said. I handed him a US $10 bill, and he said \"I'm starting to like you\". With that, he hooked us up with adjoining rooms with pool steps and two doubles each. The staff will get to know you quickly and take care of you if you start out with a frank \"take good care of me\" as you hand them some currency. $5 bills go a long way when hanging out close to the bars.

We were there from the 21th-28th June, and looking back on our overall experience, I would not go back. My boyfirend and I were a part of a large group (52 people in total). We all gathered there for friends wedding that took place at the resort as well. Now, thinking back and considering how much money our group brought to the resort, I do feel bad. I wish we took it somewhere else. Before I left, I did read many reviews on this site. The bad ones scared me and the good ones gave me hope. I had no clue what to expect. However, considering that I just spent a week there and have a first hand experience...I wish I took notes because I needed all the pointers. Also, one thing is for sure, my experience matches those negative reviews. Everything I read, I have encountered. ABOUT ME: In order for those of you who will read this, I want you to know a bit about me so you can understand what sorts of expectations I have. I live ordinary life. I am not rich. I do not travel the world. I am not high maintenance. My idea of fun night is going out for a dinner and drinks with friends. Maybe dancing afterwards. I do not go out often. I do not like spring-break atmosphere. I worried a bit that I would feel out of place at a big 5 star resort. I felt I will be troubled by the sense of feeling that I do not belong at such a place. I come from a modest background. I have survived a war so I look for pleasure in small things. Anything grandiose, makes me uncomfortable because it feels unnatural. I am 26 years old. Simplicity is ok for me. All I expected was clean room, restocked towels and so on. I was hoping to witness some professionalism, organization, courtesy and friendliness. Yet, even that was lacking. ARRIVAL: We arrived at the hotel before noon. When we checked in, bf and I were told that we will have to wait for our room for 3 hours. At the same time, bf's brother (who came alone) was checked in in less than 45mins and was upgraded to Jr. Deluxe. At the check in, we got our bracelets, towel cards and black/white photocopy of resort map...you could not tell what is what on it. We left our bags outside with staff...and they were kept there until we got checked in. My bag was in the sun all the time. After 3 hours of wait, we go back for the room keys; however, we are told that they are not ready and that we will have to wait extra 40 minutes. No explenation, no appologies...just matter of fact attitude. ROOM: Finally, we got our room 70++...standard Jr. room. However, while I was under impression that we had to wait for our room for 4 hours in order for it to be prepared, the room we got was not even clean. Minibar fridge was not stocked. We only had one bottle of water in it and some pop. Sheets and pillowcases had black spots all over them. The inside of the toilet door had a huge dead mosquito stuck on it and it remained there for an entire week. Shower door had soap stains all over them, which remained there for any entire week as well...those doors were never wiped once. They are glass doors. Shower did leak, we had to put the towel at the bottom of the doors. There was no additional information on the hotel inside the room. There was no \"do not disturb\" signs for the door. We did see some rooms using those signs, but I do believe that it is a random treat because my bf's borther did not have them in his room either. Room 'cleaning' or servicing is a random porcess. I hoped I would get a hold on their rounds but it was impossible. One day, they would be knocking at our door from 9 till noon...other days we would leave room at 10am...come back hours later after breakfast and pool and our bed would be the way we left it and the fridge would not be restocked. We have discovered that bed covers were not changed. Our had dark stains on them, which I do hope were from our sunscreen/sandy feet and we ended up making friends with them because they were not changed for an entire week. Sheets and pillowcases, I cannot tell for sure that they were changed. I fell asleep with pool wet hair once and the pillowcase gor some funky smell, which again stayed with us for the rest of the week. Luckly there were 4 pillows so I used another one. A girl from our group mentioned that one night she did not remove her makeup before bed and her mascara rubbed onto the pillow case. Through an entire stay there, that pillow case was not changed. Our conclusion is that when rooms are serviced bed is fixed and not chaged. However, towels and fridge are restocked but randomly. AC \"thing\" is very loud. Some people here already wrote about it. We kind of got used to it but not completely. However, the loud thuds did have a pattern...before the noise there would be light squeek so I would know that big bang would follow after that. However, if you are distracted and do not hear the squeek be prepared to jump or be startled. Room \"cleaning\" is done with open door. In our section there was a non functioning water feature with some water in it which served as party house for mosquitos. So we had ritual of killing them every evening. One night I got one on the room mirror. The next day it wasnt wiped off or cleaned. I killed another one on the same mirror and that one remained there as well making company to the other one. We left, noone wiped them off. So cleaning, I think, means sweeping. That is it. Balcony doors were double: one glass door and anotherone screen door. However, screen door was ripped and we never used it. FOOD: You are lucky if you get reservation for the all inclusive a la cartes restaurants...we couldnt get any at the check in...so we decided not to bother...so bf & I got friendly with buffets. He did some cruises before and he and his brother agreed that the food was 100% better on the ship. We tried 3 buffets...all the same...meat is questionable...mostly cold or undercooked. Fruit on most of the occasions tasted onion-y. My watermelon did taste like that at least 5 times out of 7. My only guess is that maybe they cut the watermelon with the same knife they used to cut the vegetables. Choices were the same almost every day. They only thing I liked were mashed potatoes and bread. We did go to Mama Mia once as a part of rehersal dinner for the wedding couple. They had it booked for 12 people. When we arrived there, they told us they would have to split us in two tables of 6. My bf and his brother both speak spanish, so his brother talked to the staff trying to reason with them...asking them just to put two tables together...they kept saying they cant do it...the place was close to being empty. They told us to go back and wait. After 20 minutes we tried again. The bride to be started crying (the next day was her wedding)...I guess someone had the soft heart so they finally put the tables together. We get in just to see that next to us there is another table of 12 set up...and on the left side, which you cannot see from the enterance, there is another table of 12 people already seated. Go figure!!!! Food was better than buffet...but that does not mean great...buffet was really bad. However, my bf and I ordered shrimp cream soup...I was fine after eating it, however bf got stomach problems after eating the shrimp in it. When he took a bite, he told me not to eat it because it was undercooked. So i did not. We are back now, but he will have to go to docs for a check up because his stomach is still feeling off. RESORT: After pool and beach there is nothing much else there. There are 3 computers (only 2 working at the time) with line-ups all the time. Entertainment was weak...I say non existent. There is something called \"a night club\" or \"disco\" if you will, but go there only if you are extremely drunk. We went once sober and it was not fun. The place smelled of vomit really badly. We did not go agian. The music is bad and same every night (you can hear it from the lobby bar). Lobby bar really humid and hot...even though it is in open air. Service is really bad and slow. Nothing against the staff, but they were understaffed so that does not help their performance. Active construction is still going on at that place. My bf's brother had his room door facing the construction field. He did mention that they start work really early and can get noisy. Early is before 8 for us. Entertainment? There is none after 8pm when the pool closes. There were few things here and there but the place and venue are all off, I felt like I was watching some street performers as I was walking downtown in some major city. We stood and watched some dance performance because it was happening in a off location with no seats or anything that could point at the 5 star hotel entertainment. Trust me, I am aware of 5 star difference in Mexico and Europe for example...but this was just sad. MORE: There is a lot more I could write about...but I am getting tired. All in all, when we left, after reading all the reviews, I was not expecting much. My expectations were low. Really low. However, what we got is just sad. My bf asked me if I will write the review because every time he thinks of our stay there, he gets upset. However, our friends did get married and we all cried at the reception during heartwarming speeches so that will be our warm and happy memory of this resort.", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cSave Your Money, Go Anywhere Else!\u201d", "Author": "ddavlin", "ReviewID": "UR17416422", "Content": "The hotel is BEAUTIFUL, that is the one positive. Other than that, the food was horrible (with the exception of the chicken nuggets) the service was SLOW and the employees made you feel as if you are a bother, not a guest. It is IMPOSSIBLE to get a dinner reservation so you are forced to eat the horrible buffets. I want to say that I am not a picky eater, taco bell and a beer is great food to me, but everyone we talked to was really upset about the food. They do have nicer restaurants that require a reservation; the first day we got there they were booked SOLID for our entire 5 day stay.(and you can not call ahead for a reservation) The drinks are not all that great, nor are they strong. The mini-bar in your room has 2 (TWO) beers in it and if you want more you have to pay$. And it is hit or miss if they will replace the beer everyday. The pool areas are cool, but you can only get a towel at certain times during the day. Not of the staff knows what the hell is going on. It takes 45min-1 hour to CHECK-in. And it is NOT 15 minutes from the airport, more like 45 minutes, if you are the first to be dropped off by shuttle. From the moment you land in Mexico you better have a BUNCH of ones, because the airport staff, the shuttle service, they all want tips, and they will outright ask for them. Also, the beach has a TON of ROCKS in the water, big sharp rocks, and the water is only about 3 feet deep for as far as you will care to venture, making it not very fin to swim. ALSO, bring your walking shoes, from the Beach to the Lobby is about a MILE. They have little golf carts that come by every 15 minutes or so, but it is just TOO big. The good thing about this place is that it beats work, and it is a beautiful hotel. I would not recommend this place to anyone it is a shame, because again it is a beautiful building, but everything else is not. If you do get stuck going, I recommend that you find the chicken nuggets ASAP. The buffets are NOT open at all hours so good luck with that. There is a \u201cSports Bar\u201d that has burgers at almost all hours, it is up front between the two lobbies. (I don\u2019t think the burgers are beef, but the fries are good) If you want good food you can go into Playa and eat at Senor Frogs, it is about a 20 minute cab ride which is about $14 USD each way (tip not included). There are shuttles that will take you to town, however we were unable to get one of those either. The shopping in Playa is a bunch of overpriced crap. To get a reservation at one of the resteraunts at the resort that are all booked, just drop the guy at the door a $20 and you get you INCLUDED meal that you have alread paid for. Nice. Again, I am a pretty easy to please Texas boy, As long as you are nice, there is something remotely edible, and a cold beer.. no problem.

Well here I sit on my swim up patio, my last night in paradise....so sad :(. Thinking back on my week I figured why not writes my review while it is still fresh in my head. As many TA posters know I have traveled quite extensively to the Mayan coast and Cancun in the past 13 years, and again I was not disappointed........yes I said \u201cnot disappointed\u201d!!! I have read many reviews in the past few weeks concerning very unfortunate vacation experiences, which is a down and out shame. That being said my review is based on my own experience from the past seven days and concerning the Riviera side only.......so here goes!! Resort grounds \u2013 absolutely 100% stunning. I have been to many all inclusive resorts and I have to say the grounds of this resort are the nicest I have ever seen. All areas are very well kept Check in \u2013 took aprox 10 minutes...upon arrival (11am) there was no room available, of course I expected that considering the time of day, no biggie I had packed a bikini etc. In my carry on so I changed and started to enjoy my first day in sunny Mexico. Around 1pm I headed back to reception at which time I was given my room key. Accommodation \u2013 paid for a regency club (air transat) deluxe junior suite, swim up. [requested] a king bed, no adjoining door and in building 16, 17 or 18. I did receive a deluxe js, swim up and yes it was in building 16 however; that\u2019s where it ended....the room was 2 doubles with an adjoining door and \u201cunclean\u201d was an understatement. So I headed up to reception again to have my room changed. Of course I was told there was no other room available, blah, blah, blah. Upon arrival at my room again I was approached by another guest that informed me that this particular room was the room she would not accept the day before, she also recommended that I go up and speak to the ATH rep. Which I did and within 1 hour was moved to a room that was excellent!!! This time building 18 and I have to say I consider it the best location for convenience. Close to the buffet restaurant that offered breakfast and lunch, close to the beach and it seemed to have a more quiet part of the pool for relaxation. And I must say that the rooms with direct pool access are the BEST INVENTION EVER!!!!! The mosquito issue \u2013 it seems the closer your room is to the Laguna section, the worse the mosquito\u2019s are. You may also notice upon arrival in your room that there may be many squashed mosquito\u2019s on the walls and ceiling, not sure why this issue is not cleaned on a daily basis. It is quite unsanitary and something the resort management needs to address quickly. I did take the advice of another poster and ensured I was armed with off and raid. I sprayed my patio doors and my main door every night and did not have much of an issue at all. So go prepared. I did ask the ath rep about the mosquito issue and she mentioned the construction to the left of the resort was pushing the insects over, not to mention he abundance of still water the resort has on its grounds. My suggestion is; if you haven't booked yet, book the sunset side it is the furthest side from the ongoing construction. The pools \u2013 awesome!!! There are pools everywhere, thus eliminating over crowding. The pools were very clean and were maintained every night. One thing that was unique to this resort was; not only were the pools around the swim up rooms lit up at night, every pool on the property was lit throughout the entire night....awesome!! There are also plenty of loungers throughout the day so no need to get up at the crack of dawn. There were also plenty of beach towels to be had at any time of the day. No issue in this area at all!!! There seemed to be 3 main pools that were less than quiet. There is the main pool w/ bar in the center of the resort this offered the afternoon games and/or hilarity. The other 2 pools w/ bars were attached to the Riviera and sunset buffet restaurants closest to the beach. These pools seemed to have the longest daily swim up bar scenes. The rest of the pools whined around the rest of the property. The only issue I found was that no other parts of the pool led directly into the main pool bar. Every time we needed a wee drink we would have to get out of the pool and walk over from our section of the pool, no biggie, just a tad chilly later in the day. The beach \u2013 considering the location of this resort the beach was surprisingly beautiful and wide!! I did not encounter the rock issue that others have stated, however due to the surf in the area apparently this situation can change day to day. The sand is plentiful and the water nice and blue (not as turquoise as Cancun) a bit choppy at times though so pay attention to the warning flags posted on a daily basis. Another unique thing about this resort is that they do have a lifeguard on duty throughout the day, a rare thing at most all inclusive resorts. One last thing regarding the beach \u2013 no lights at night, so enter at your own risk. Bars \u2013 there seems to be bars around every corner including 3 swim up bars!!! However they do not all offer every drink. I am a mojito lover but unfortunately could only get them at the lobby bar and the main bar, all pool bars did not serve them, at least during my week. The pool bars offer your typical fruity frozen drinks, mixed liquor and corona on tap.....no complaints here either. No big line ups either. Food \u2013 I had no complaints here either, I mainly hit the buffets and every day they offered fresh dishes, new dishes and many continental items such as fries, hot dogs etc. I found the variety great, the quality of the food great and the cooking stations were outstanding. As many posters have stated before the breakfast buffets were amazing. Have no fear when it comes to food here it is a+ including the room service items. Service - there have been many posts regarding the service at the grp, in my opinion it is a hit or a miss. The service is not terrible however it has not yet reached the 5 star rating it has been given. Most service associates that I encountered at the resort tried to their best to serve or address any issues that arose. There were a few that definitely did not want to make the effort but; haven't we all come across those associates at one ai or another?? :) The overall service at this resort is good and is comparable to many other 5 star resorts I have visited in the Mayan Riviera. That being said; the housekeeping service does need to step up their game. My room was cleaned every day, my bedding changed once while I was there ( no biggie I change my own bedding at home once a week) however these cleans took no more than 10 minutes max?? I know this because I spent most of my days on my swim up patio therefore I was witness to it. In my humble opinion it should take more than 10 minutes to clean a bedroom and bathroom??? It also depended on what time of day my room was cleaned; the morning cleans seemed much better than if my room was cleaned in the afternoon??? All this said, it did not ruin my vacation in the least. Great Vacation as always in my all time favorite destination; The glorious Mayan Riviera.

The food was disgusting. It was salty and of very poor quality. Most of the waitstaff were rude and unwilling to help when we needed something. We had to beg all day just to get our bedding changed in our room which they completed at 5 pm but they refused to take out the trash. We also requested three extra pillows wich took us 3 days to recieive . My father wanted our trip to be a memorable one so he opted to be \"platinum\" status. That at least ensured that we got chocolate covered strawberries and to swim in the exclusive pool that closed at 8 pm each night. Most of that perks that should have come with the additional cost, we failed to receive. There were no managers to be seen and my father had to hike all the way to the front office to get him to show him where the \"BBQ\" that we were supposed to have on our last night was located.

Let me start by saying i started to switch hotels after reading all the bad reviews, but i am glad we stayed at the princess. i have stayed in Cancun many times, but this was the first time near Playa. Check in was easy because we took a private transfer and arrived at the hotel around 9:45 am when nobody else was checking in. it took about 5 minutes. we then booked our restaurants for our days there. i was told at check-in that we couldn't book miso without paying 25 dollars extra per person. i booked it anway and i wasn't charged for it. it was great except very slow service. we also booked the mexican place and it was ok. We headed to find our rooms which they said wouldn't be ready until 3. we had a worker unlock the door to check, and it was ready as well as the other two rooms. we told the front desk and our bags were sent down in less than 5 minutes. Our screen door on our door was broken, they sent someone to fix it in less than 10 minutes. Pool swim out was great because we had some privacy and we were a short walk to the bar at the party pool. we never waited more than 3 or 4 minutes for a drink to be filled in our bubba kegs! we tipped some of the time. i did notice that the waitress that came around to our swim up room came A LOT faster when we tipped. Room was nice, bar aways stocked, food at buffets pretty good and warm. The pasta station rocked except that you had to wait in line usually around 20 minutes. We found the riviera buffet by the beach to be the best with the best service. We usually had our drinks before we sat back down with our food. The massages on the beach were great for $40 for an hour. The beach bar was never too crowed when we were there. Maybe a 3 or 4 minute wait also. the beach was beautiful. the sand was great. the rocks sucked. i went in the first day without water shoes and for me it was horrible, but i have sensitive feet. i cut my toe and pulled my toenail off after only 5 minutes in the water. i am a beach person, i was a little dissappointed. I took my water shoes and float the next day and it was a lot better. we went to playa twice. La Parrille or something like that had great mexican food on 5th! We had a great time at the princess, but probably won't return because it is a little large for us and we leave our kiddos at home and there are a lot of kiddos here. it made me miss mine worse. The only major complaint i have about this hotel was the amount of mosquitos in the room. we had to go on a killing spree every night before bed. i used deet but woke up with my face and head covered in bites every night. i made sure i was wrapped in the sheet each night- that doesn't make for a very good night sleep.

I looked at the reviews every day and was getting more discouraged every day. Almost every one of them was negative. We went to the resort June 21 - 25. Our group had a total of 5 rooms. I wish I would not have taken the negative reviews so seriously. We got to the resort around 7 PM, it took about 15 minutes to check in and 20 minutes to get to our room with all of our luggage (can't beat that!). We had rooms 6001, 6002, 6003, 6011 and 6014. No one had any complaints about the rooms, they were beautiful. We were in a great spot......close to the beach, the buffets and wonderful pools. Yes there are a few mosquitos but no more than we havce at home and if you keep the fan on high they stay away, in fact we didnt have to use mosquito repellant once. Our room was cleaned daily and mini bar stocked daily, no problem with housekeeping at all. The pools were wonderful!!!!!!! Instead of bringing insulated cups to the pool for drinks, I brought beer cooler cups. The glasses they give you drinks in fit perfectly in them and kept your drinks cold. It was just a lot easier to fold one of those up and stick it in your bag than a insulated mug. Ask for the drink called Riviera Maya, it's great! OK, now for the food. I am a person that does'nt experiment with different foods too much. The buffets had a lot of different foods and I pretty much stuck to the chicken dishes. I thought the chicken was delicious. I tried some of the other dishes and wasnt to crazy about them. We had visited the Grand Palladium 4 years ago and I remember the same thing. When you talk about food you have to realize that the resorts deal with so many different nationalities with different tastes. Things that I might not like, others might love. I can't criticize a food because of the way it's seasoned or cooked, in fact a lot of the things I didnt like, others in the group did like. If you intend to go to the ala cart restaurants just make sure you do that first thing because we could not get reservations at any of the restaurants for the following night.

Check-in: we had e-mailed the resort ahead of time with a special room request (we were celebrating a special occasion) and this was pretty much honored. we had requested ocean-front and was told it when we got there that it was $50 extra (a night or week ? - did not ask). we tried to change our room to get a top floor, but was told none was available. when we got to the room, it was indeed ocean-front, and we were not charged extra. agree with previous TA posters that the front desk people do not always know the exact location of the rooms. Room: we were in room #5124 (middle floor) on the corner. it was a very nice room - everything worked, no shower leaking, no noisy A/C, etc. the only problem (on the second day) we had was there was leaking above the jacuzzi in the bathroom. we were told the people above us had overflowed their jacuzzi - not the hotel's fault! we were offered a new room, but we liked ours and the leak went away quickly. we tipped the drink man $1 in the fridge every day and $3 under the pillow to the maid also. that was $30 well spent! we were very happy with their service and received towel animals everyday - which my daughter loved! locked everything of value in a suitcase every night- did not use the safe : nothing touched. only my daughter got one mosquito bite the whole trip - did not use any spray, but had it handy! ocean front rooms are from #11 to #24 on each floor. the bottom floor ocean-front rooms do NOT have an ocean view! there is a mangrove(?) swamp between the hotel and the beach and vegetation in this swamp blocks the first floor view. PLatinum: i have seen cost analysis of whether platinum is worth the upgrade. we paid a little more extra for platinum because kids do not stay free in that category, like the deluxe suites,etc. the material items, e.g. massages, t-shirt,beach bag,tequila,fruit basket,etc., you receive with platinum are not that much. but we found the upgrade worthwhile because of the service and location and the upgraded room(taking a jacuzzi on the balcony overlooking the ocean - can't beat it!). the platinum concierges (especially Diana) are very helpful. when you have a problem, they handle it and you do not deal with the front desk. we were within very easy walking distance (2-3 minutes) of the beach, pools and breakfast and lunch buffets and only had to walk to the front in the evening for dinner - which was no problem. the platinum lounge was nice - two computers and not much waiting. it was easy to get towels by the platinum pool, and the bar served good drinks. (we are not big drinkers so the Princess made some money off of us - LOL). we were disappointed in the afternoon snacks in the Platinum lounge - we had heard that there was fresh shrimp from previous posters, but it was mostly small seafood sandwiches. they did have good desserts at night though - including chocolate covered strawberries. on Friday night they have a special platinum dinner in the restaurant by the Riviera platinum building- they had giant prawns,crab claws,etc. (the only time i saw these all week). it was very good! Excursions: we did not go on any. were just enjoying the resort and the activities they had. we did take a snorkeling trip from the resort ($35 a person). they take you on a 5-10 boat ride south of the resort to a shallow reef for about 45-60 minutes of snorkeling. if you are prone to seasickness, DO NOT GO ON THIS TRIP!! unfortunately, myself and 2 other passengers (out of 11 total) got seasick. the reef is not protected and after a bouncy boat ride, you are still bouncing in the ocean while you are snorkeling - my wife and daughter did get to see some fish, but it was difficult due to the choppy water. i was never seasick on any previous snorkeling trips. Serivce: we thought the service was very good. i think it depends on how you treat others. i saw guests ordering the staff around, i am sure this was not how they would treat workers in the US. we did not meet any workers who were not friendly - indifferent sometimes, but never unfriendly. after talking to Diana the platinum concierge, she did say that the hotel definitely could use more staff, but there are so many new hotels being built it takes awhile to get the required staff level. Restaurants: will agree with previous reviewers that the drinks in the buffet (especially at dinner) are hard to get sometimes and the wait can be long. many of the servers are waiting at one window to get drinks from the bartender. we ate breakfast and lunch at the buffets by the beach and had no problems with service there. i do think the dinner buffets do get a little repetitious, so we ate at an alacarte every other day: 1) LaFleur : international - excellent food , especially the steak! 2) Miso : japanese - cooking table - very good. the chef made a few errors in his show but the fried rice was so good! 3) Mama Mia : Italian - again very good, especially the veal. we ate at 6:00pm at all these restaurants and the service was always good and my daughter always found something to eat. made all the reservations with the platinum concierge after we checked in. Kids club : my daughter loved the kids club, which was a pleasant surprise. the staff there is great (Luis, Jonathan, Frankie, Irelanda). they have water polo, archery,beach soccer,etc. she went everynight to the kids disco at 8:00pm. Activities: we saw some of the nightime shows in the courtyard (8:30pm) which were good - fire dancers, acrobats, music, etc. did not see any of the 9:30pm shows - too late! we played horsehoes,egg toss,archery,rifle,aerobics,etc. the animation team does a great job and are very energetic. and to add what many people have said - the MARBLE FLOORS ARE SLIPPERY WHEN WET! we almost fell many times, especially with crocs. sorry for the long review, but we were very pleasantly surprised at our stay at GRP, especially after the many very bad reviews. any questions, let me know.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!!!\u201d", "Author": "MarcolEdmonton", "ReviewID": "UR17283350", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand Riviera Princess June 16th through 22nd. I've never travelled out of Canada and this was my first big adventure (I'm 33). We decided to book a Platinum package for the extra perks- this was well worth it for us. We didn't get to the hotel until 4am, so check in was a minor hassle because no one was available for the private check in for platinum guests (it was 4am, I wouldn't expect full staff on at those hours- so this was really not a big deal. ) We had our room changed the next day because we booked a king bed but got 2 doubles- our Sunwing rep took care of this- no biggie. We had a beautiful ocean view room. Remember to see your concierge for the extra perks for your room if they are not there. Edgar was our concierge and was great- he got us anything we asked for and took the time to tell me about the resort and different places to see while on vacation here. He also booked our al a carte restaurants for us for the entire week. If you don't get platinum, villi or laguna suites you have to wait in line each morning at the restaurant to get a reservation. The food was good, I really enjoyed eating real fresh fruit- it's so much better then in Canada. The buffets for breakfast and lunch had a large selection, but it was usually the same everyday. Some people were concerned with food safety but I can assure anyone who asks that this is not an issue (food safety is my job). All the restaurants we ate at during the week were all good, but I think they are more geared for adult tastes- I don't think kids would enjoy them very much. The pools were beautiful and we never had trouble getting fresh towels or a chair. The beach was fantastic, I took walks along it every morning. I would recommend water shoes, it's a bit rocky getting in and there are some sharp stones that you may not see. The beach area was always clean and the staff work very hard at this. I would get up at 5:30 am and there were people out cleaning and grooming the sand. We got great service on the beach and we always had good seats and cold drinks in our hands. There were many activities going on at the resort but we decided to do some exploring. We booked a snorkel tour and went to three different places, first a lagune which led out to the ocean, this was my favorite place. Tons of fish, corals and a sea turtle ( I could touch the turtle, it was swimming so close). Next we went to a fresh water cenote, which was cool- lots of fish. We had real tacos for lunch- very tasty. Finally we went to a cave, this was an increadible experiance. It was like looking at something out of National Geographic. Our next adventure was to Cozumal. We rented a jeep and went to the reef just off shore for snorkling. At a bar we met a really nice couple and drank beer and ate nachos- a few hours later at some ruins I became VERY ill and had to cut out day trip short. I was feeling better the next day just in time for deep sea fishing- caught a 51 inch long barracuda. The other fish we caught were brought to the restaurant and were cooked for us for 5 bucks a fish- very yummy. We spent Friday on the resort relaxing on the beach or swimming in the pool- the nightly shows were great. I enjoyed the capoeira demonstration. Our last day was spent in Playa shopping- deals wern't always great but it was fun. Staff at the resort were always friendly to us, the grounds were beautiful, room was always clean, fridge always fully stocked, always entertained (on and off resort), no problem getting a shuttle back and forth on the resort- the resort is HUGE. The bus going to Playa fills up quickly- so get your tickets first this the day before. We had to take a cab- but this was only $13. HINTS Be polite and respectful of staff TIP TIP TIP- this goes a long way, many people work for tips not wages. If you us the shuttle on the grounds alot- don't forget to tip him too ( people seemed to forget). Most of the staff speak some english but try to make an effort and try out a few spanish phrases- this helps build a repoire with the staff and makes things more relaxing and fun. If you need anything ask your concierge- be reasonable and be nice- many people we saw were rude and demanding- this will get you nowhere. Make your vacation- YOURS.

We were told no king rooms available so to check back the next day. Next morning, we decided, no big deal, we'll just keep the room we were assigned since it was room 7104, middle of the resort (halfway to the beach and halfway to the lobby and restaurants). Ate lunch/dinner at the buffet. I am not a finicky eater--I found plenty to eat, but like others have said, alot of it was cold. There is a lot of different things though, so as long as you don't load up your plate every night it shouldn't be too repetitive. (Minus the food being cold it was about the equivalent of the food we had on our Sandals AI 2 years ago, ok but not great). This day, we waited 1 hour at the concierge to book restaurants-really hard to get reservations. Day 2: EDVENTURES TOUR: This, my friends, made our ENTIRE trip worthwhile. They picked us up right on time, picked up another group, and headed to their shop to square things for the day, went to Tulum Mayan Ruins, went snorkeling in a cenote (AWESOME AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), met and took pictures with a spider monkey (we let him drink Coke, his favorite), went ziplining, went swimming/snorkeling with the sea turtles, ate at La Buena Vida (by far the best food we ate the entire week we were there), and then went snorkeling in the lagoon. Not only were the guides awesome, but to keep us from having to go with the other group (they were very high maintenance, complaining and arguing over every peso--no thanks, I like to relax on vacation), Eddie took us everywhere himself, so we had the most awesome and knowledgable guide you can imagine. Day 3: Relaxed on the beach-awesome white sand, awesome blue water, but lots of rocks like everyone else has said so watch your feet. We took out a catamaran (you just leave a deposit that is returned when you turn the boat back in), and did more relaxing. Parasailing people are a little shady, we waited two hours (Frying on the beach might I add), then they told us their were too many people and it was almost 4 pm (their stopping time) so we really wouldn't have time to go, plus there were issues with coming up with the correct price for two couples to go. So, we said, thanks but no thanks, got our money back and left. When we got back to our room, our keys didn't work, had to call, get someone to come and bring new keys (during which time 6 different people came and all their keys worked to our room-scary when there's not even a way to lock them out when you're in the room)--Due to questions we had about the security of room 7104, they moved us to 7106, a king bed now, but the air conditioner didn't work, so we move all our stuff back to 7104 and slept with a chair in front of the door the rest of the trip (We just gave up). Ate at the seafood this evening (if you can call it eating since none of us ate more than one bite of anything except the bisque). By the way, don't eat the salad here (my friend and I were sick the next day). Fried fish is an entire fish (eyes, skin, everything, deep fried). We were not the only ones to get up and leave without eating. We saw three other groups do it too so we can't be too picky! Needless to say, Day 3 was not good after about 4 p.m. Day 4: In to Playa on 5th street to market, fun, but bargain with them. Pretty clean area. Got sick from food on Sat night so had to cut our day short and head back to the hotel (We were supposed to be celebrating my BDay too so that was no fun), ordered pizza from dominoes, husband tooke cab into town to pick it up--we were tired of buffet food. Day 5: More relaxing on beach with friends, massage on the beach ($40 for 1 hr unlike at spa where it's more expensive). Husband took a fishing trip--they didn't catch anything. Ate at Mexican for dinner--fajitas really good. We never had trouble getting chairs or palapas by the way!! Day 6: Back into Playa to get our film developed for fear of security messing up our water pictures. Found out things on the far end of 5th street are way cheaper and people more willing to bargain (this being the end of the street closest to the ferry dock and Carlos and Charlies. Ate at Miso-really good and fun atmosphere! Day 7: Checkout easy, off to the airport. Sorry so long, we had a lot to say. Overall, we made the trip fun and had a great time. I probably wouldn't recommend this resort to anyone I know just yet. Security wasn't good enough for me (no locks on doors to keep people out-the dead bolt still opened if you had a key card)and they are still too understaffed and the food and drinks weren't great.

From the time we stepped out of the limo (that was a different experience - especially on the return to the airport - See their own review. http://www.cancuncd.com/cancun-limo-rental.php is their website address), we were welcomed by pleasent employees. There was champange at check-in. The bar is also within walking distance. We arrived early. The front desk person indicated the rooms were not ready. However, when the bellman escorted us the rooms, one of them was clean. He took the opportunity to request the maid clean our other room when she could. No time passed, when she had it ready for us. The fridge was completely stocked with beer, water, soda and liquor on a daily basis. Make sure you tip the maid under the pillow and the fridge guy inside the fridge. The food was great! We ordered room service and was pleased with it. Quick delivery, as well. Nice selection of fresh fruits, omelette station and other foods. We ate in the Platinum area for our morning and lunch buffets. For dinner, the Italian restaurant was awesome. I have not had lasagna like that since Little Italy in New York. The japanese restaurant was good. Wish we could have eaten at the Fondue restaurant. Make sure you make dinner reservations upon arrival. The tour desks were very helpful. We took the zipline/cenote trip to Tulum. What an adventure. There were only three ziplines on this trip. They had another excursion which involved 24 zips. Wish we would have taken that trip. Do not miss the Blue Parrot bar in Playa Del Carmen. They have swings for barstools and sand for a dance floor. Last but not least, DO NOT miss the massage on the beach. 1/2 hour for only $20.00!

The staff is so friendly, when you walk down the hallway to get to the pool, you wont get there without hearing the word \"HOLA\" ! the whole stay we all got treated great, and met some really awesome poeple. There is alot of walking, but who cares walking is good for you, and if you really dont want to walk you can just wait for the shuttles to drive you to the other end. Our rooms where near the beach so it was about a 10 min walk to get to the lobby and buffet but a walk in the morning is nice. There is a disco/club in the resort which was VERY fun The pool is huge and amazing theres quiet ends for older poeple and louder ends where people like to party Drinks are really good, so drink up! Make sure before you leave home you bring a pack of Imodium with you! I think all 5 of us had to use it at some point Playa Del Carmen is AMAZING its such a neat little place to go shopping make sure you go to a restourant called BLUE PAROT its georgous! the beaches in playa are a bit nicer than the beach outside of the resort You should also take the ferrie to COZUMEL the island and go snorkling, they'll take u to an amazing place in the ocean. We also did a tour to XCARET which you should also do they have a really neat mexican show at night. The showers do leak so before you go in the shower jsut put a towel on the floor outside of the shower and it will be fine.Simple as that! Your stay here will be what you make of it, if your friendly to the workers they'll treat you amazing. If your going there to just find things wrong with the place than why go?..and remember everybody has differant taste so if they dont like somethings doesnt mean you wont! We thought the Fondu was amazing the Buffet was yummy. All of our stuff was fine nothing got stolen no bugs in our room( just keep the bug screen closed), fridge was stocked everyday , the do not disturb sign worked, air conditioning worked,room service was good just dont order at 4 in the morning, everything was amazing and i hope you have just as much as an amazing time as we had. it really was depressing leaving this place! :( i would definently go back", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHad a great stay at the Princess\u201d", "Author": "Maureen87", "ReviewID": "UR17160137", "Content": "Review of Grand Riviera Princess: I am on day four (June 10) of seven on my platinum level vacation at the Princess. I am writing this review on my laptop on the second floor balcony overlooking the ocean enjoying a beautiful cool breeze, sitting on a soft cushioned chair. This is just after luxuriating in the balcony spa while enjoying a cocktail. Unlike advertised, the platinum area does not have wireless internet but will provide wired service for your laptop in your room and also two computers are available for internet/e-mail use in the platinum lounge. My husband and I are here on the platinum package. Now, let me start at the beginning. We booked our vacation package through Fun jet. We traveled on a chartered direct flight from San Antonio, TX to Cancun. Flight was great. In just one year I was amazed at the improvements in Cancun airport. Everything went so smooth and fast going through customs as they now have an x-ray machine that reviews your luggage quickly and gets you on your way. Also since last year, Fun jet is using very new, very large, comfortable air-conditioned buses to take you to your destination. We arrived around 11:3O a.m. and our rooms were available about 1:30 p.m. If some of you are confused, as I was, as to the difference between the Grand Riviera Princess and the Grand Sunset Princess, let me explain. Both resorts are intertwined in the same complex and are mirror images of each other, one on the left side, and one on the right with shared central pools, walkways and lagoons. Each side has platinum suites, junior suites etc. and its own lounge, check-in area and shops etc. However it seems the villa suites are right in the center between the two complexes. The entire complex is very beautiful between all the marble architecture, landscaping, flowers, art, pools and lagoons. The weather this week called for thunderstorms and 60% chance of rain all week. So far we have had maybe 30 minutes of rain over an evening, other than that, weather has been beautiful and balmy. Sometimes sunny, sometimes a little overcast with clouds. The platinum suites have their own club area and private pool which is reached through the club. The club is open from early in the morning through 10:30 p.m. In the club they have a full bar with bartender, coffee, teas, soft drinks and cappuccinos. There are snacks set out all day/evening and I especially enjoyed the chocolate covered strawberries. From the platinum lounge you can catch a golf cart shuttle to the resort lobby which operates every few minutes. Also in this club area is a concierge for platinum guest use. This is very helpful. You can make your dinner reservations for the week with the concierge in the platinum club. You cannot make reservations by phone as advertised in brochure \u2013 who cares! The concierge has every menu so you can peruse them before deciding where to eat. Or you can just do a walk-in at one of the two buffets near the lobby. I\u2019m sure you have read all the amenities that come with the platinum suite. Some of them listed are non-existent due to a combination of language translation problems and also things that the resort anticipated having but didn\u2019t work out. It hasn\u2019t taken away any of the enjoyment of our stay. It would be nice however if Fun jet and Princess updated their Web sites to reflect actual amenities so no one is disappointed. There is no beach dinner at Caf\u00e9 del Mar \u2013 in fact; there is no Caf\u00e9 del Mar! However there are plenty of other restaurants-so no big deal-and, instead, on Friday\u2019s from 7-9:30 p.m. there is a special dinner with entertainment at one of the buffet restaurants. There is no weekly manager\u2019s cocktail and never has been \u2013 who cares- plenty of bars and cocktails everywhere else on property. One hour of motorized water sports is a misprint \u2013 should be non-motorized water sports, i.e. boogie boards are available and kayaks. There is not an ice cream parlor. There are soft serve ice creams machines in several places including the platinum lounge \u2013 again, who cares, plenty of desserts, food, etc. elsewhere. The quality of the food is always relative to your taste. Don\u2019t forget you are in Mexico, things are prepared differently \u2013 just go with it. Buffets are for breakfast and lunch \u2013 tons of food to choose from. They make a great (strong) cup of coffee \u2013 good as Starbucks. We dined at Miso (Asian) -- my husband and I thought it was just Ok, my son and friend thought it was good. We dined at Le Fleur, enjoyed lamb and red snapper that was great. Last night was Las Olas, their seafood restaurant. Very unusual compared to what I am used to. If you like squid, octopus, mussels and shrimp with heads still intact \u2013 this is for you! I had a deep fried fish that came with head, tail, fins-everything. Personally not very attractive to me but the white meat was flaky and tasty. We have been to two shows in the theatre, first one a musical dancing Caribbean review and second one a variety show which included break dancing, juggling, mime type comedian and contortionist. Both were very entertaining. The theater is a huge room with a bar in the back where you can get your own drink or one from a waitress. Right outside the theater there is a courtyard where they provide outdoor entertainment and live band music nightly. There is a 24 hour sports bar with TVs, pool tables and foosball and it provides snacks such as hotdogs, nachos, hamburgers and popcorn. The resort is very large, but hence offers more entertainment and things to do. Our building is right on the beach and it takes 10 minutes at a brisk pace to walk to the main lobby \u2013 but you can take the shuttle. Look for the activity board in the front lobby area which gives times of such things as water aerobics, volley ball, ping pong, etc. Don\u2019t sit around complaining that the staff didn\u2019t tell you this and that. They give you a map \u2013 just go around and investigate the complex, ask questions, and see what is available. There is plenty of seating and shade around the pools and beach. Platinum has a private beach section with a waitress serving drinks. The beach is large and beautiful. I would recommend swim shoes when entering the water as there are some rocks. The beach is very private\u2026 you will only see resort guests and resort staff, not public beach goers. The pools are immaculately clean. How anyone can take the time to complain and nit pick this resort, especially while they are here on vacation to relax is beyond me. Get a life, chill, accentuate the positive! Many of the staff do not speak English well \u2013 hellloo this is Mexico! However, they try very hard to be helpful and some also ask about English phrases to learn more. If sometimes they seem stand offish \u2013 it is not that \u2013 it is just the language barrier.", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cNot what we expected\u201d", "Author": "jlynn30", "ReviewID": "UR17138295", "Content": "We were pleasantly surprised with how beautiful the resort and the beach were, but were soon discouraged when we arrived at our room. It was our honeymoon and we thought for sure we would be greeted with a beautiful room, champagne, and a room with a view, however we found ourselves in a mildew smelling room with a view of construction. We moved to a new room the next day, after making several requests and talking to different people. My husband and I were able to upgrade to a pool side room that was clean and smelled fresh...a pleasant turnout. We even had little towel figurines on our bed each day. The best service we received all week was on the beach. Here you can relax under the complimentary tropical huts, on their comfy lounge chairs. They provided towels as well, if you get their early enough! Otherwise the service was not what we expected of a five star hotel. The attention to detail was visible however we found that the buffet restaurants were under staffed and you had to ask numerous times for what should have been expected service for an all inclusive resort. The pool bars closed way too early and there was not a place available to eat, other than buffets, during the afternoon. Most all inclusive resorts provide a beach bar or sandwich place, close to the pools and beach, where you can grab a quick bite to eat or a snack while in your suit, or out and about. The Princess resort had a \"sports bar\" on the opposite end of resort, however you had to be dressed and could not take anything to go, which was sometimes a burden if you were at the beach. Overall we were pleased with the room, beach, amenities, and food, the only major complaint was the lack of available staff, service, and simple conveniences you would expect of a five star, all-inclusive resort.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointing\u201d", "Author": "LA3429", "ReviewID": "UR17134328", "Content": "We stayed at this resort for our honeymoon. We knew the resort was new but figured by the time we went some of the kinks would have been worked out. I wish I had read the trip advisor comments before booking the trip. Regardless, we still were so excited and figured we were not picky people so it wouldn't be a problem. The main problem was the food. Like you probably have read you have to make reservations for the regular places otherwise you are stuck eating at the buffet which is basically the same every day and gets Soooo old! When we went to make reservations at 9:00 am the first morning after we checked in I was so upset to find out everything was booked until friday which was our last night. We ended up having to pay $50 to eat at one of the \"platinum\" places since we were not in the \"platinum\"room catigory. We paid because we didn't want to eat the buffet every day. I just don't understand how an all-inclusive resort can say, \"sorry, we're all booked\" and make you eat a buffet which is the equivalent of a high school lunch. I felt sad and cheated especially because it was my honeymoon and we were looking forward to some nice dinners. When I tried to bring the issue up to the concierge they basically said, \"yeah, we've had alot of problems with that\" and that was it. The resort was beautiful but was way too big and way too much walking. I came to relax, not train for a marathon.

Having read most of the reports on here we were apprehensive to say the least, and now feel we should write our first ever report to assure those about to go out that it\u2019s a great resort, and we had a great time. Check-in: no issues, no waiting. Arrived at 3pm and the room was ready. It should be noted that if a lot of people arrive at once, there may be a queue (not a great surprise). The porters delivered our cases to our room exactly when they said they would (within ten minutes of arriving and the same prompt process when we left). Check-in staff, and all staff for that matter, were friendly and we\u2019d even get an \u2018ola\u2019 from some of the gardeners during our stay! Room (junior suite deluxe): was perfect, good size, lovely balcony, etc. Only issue was the toilet didn\u2019t flush perfectly at first but that took about ten seconds for us to fix ourselves instead of bothering to moan about it and speaking to reception. Rooms were cleaned every day (they were late one day in fourteen). Pools: Again, perfect. So many of them (and ample sun beds) you have no difficulty in choosing a quiet area or lively area depending on how you want to spend your day. We found a shaded hut every day without playing any towel games in the morning, and although there wasn\u2019t an abundance of bar staff coming round to get you drinks there is always a bar (in or out of the pool) within easy reach. Drinks: a plenty. Daiquiris, margaritas, pretty much whatever you want. Never waited more than a couple of minutes, we always seemed to get stools at the bar when we wanted to take a rest from relaxing by the pool, and although we didn\u2019t find the house wine great, the beer, cocktails and spirits were all good. Food: Buffets were enjoyable for breakfast and lunch (the ones nearer the beach had less of a production line feel about them). In the evening we spent the first couple of nights at the buffets which were a bit disappointing, but then booked a la carte\u2019s for the remainder of our holiday. The booking procedure was painless \u2013 turn up at any a la carte between 9am-1pm and wait a max of five minutes (if it looks like you\u2019ll have to wait longer just go to another one, they\u2019ll all within one minute of each other and are never all busy). You can book all the different places at any of the restaurants, and although understandably availability gets better the further in advance you book, if you tell them how long you are here for and that you want to book all the a la cartes they\u2019ll sort it out for you. As for the a la cartes themselves: Fondue, International, and Asian were great, Italian and Mexican were good but a bit normal, Grill was average, and we didn\u2019t eat at the seafood one (our choosing). Overall very impressive resort, rooms, pools, and drinks, with the food being good provided you don\u2019t eat at the buffet every day, three times a day.", "Date": "June 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cLoved this resort - clean, fun, friendly !\u201d", "Author": "risco", "ReviewID": "UR17104928", "Content": "Just returned June 20 from the Princess. Can't say enough positive about this resort. And folks, please note: it is a resort. A family resort at that. So, expect it to be as big as they say and have all the people, activities, amenities, etc. Guests are coming from all over to enjoy the amazing pools and beach. We saw visitors from Spain, England, Germany, Italy, France and most U.S. states. And we thought the resort did well to cater to many different needs. Nobody was an \"ugly\" anything. By and large we were friendly and others were friendly to us. ROOMS - I suggest you go ahead and pay a little more for the Deluxe Junior Suite. I can't comment on the Platinum level. But our Deluxe upgrade was worth it. Our room was very nice, clean, modern. Had everything we needed. The bathroom was roomy and everything worked great. Didn't see any of the problems others on here complained in previous reviews. Our bed was perfect. Room was nice and cool. TV - what little we watched of it - was a nice, flat-screen. Mini bar fully stocked every day. No bugs, quiet, nice balcony with a partial ocean view (we were on third floor and glad of it). Our room overlooked the mangrove and you could see the water fine. I used the in-room coffee maker many a morning and drank coffee on the balcony as the sun came up. Beautiful and peaceful. BEACH -- Beach was fantastic. Yes, there were some rocks and some exposed bedrock out in the water. I believe this is a result of some of the storms the area has seen in the last few years. Plenty of sandy water, too. But the beach itself is amazing overall. No strong surf to speak of as there were no weather systems this week. Some drink service at the beach but if you're impatient you can always get up out of your chair and walk a few yards to get your own drink at a cool, little beach bar they set up for all-day service. No big deal. You're on vacation. Relax. No real problems getting beach chairs. The resort was pretty full the week we were there. So, a lot of folks on the beach. But we didn't feel overcrowded at all. Plenty of sand to go around. There are a number of palapas which offer shade. Any experienced beachgoer knows these will be the first to get snapped up. If you're absolutely obsessed with being \"first\" or getting \"the best\" shady spot, get up early and stake out your spot. Everyone respected the beach chair/towel etiquette. The rest of the chairs are either under young palm trees with some shade or out in the direct sun. Be honest, this is what many of us came here for anyway! Sun and surf. POOLS - The pools were huge. A main area with music, entertainment, activities. Plenty of quieter areas to choose from, too. Again, this is a resort. They've designed it to accommodate a lot of guests. So, don't be upset to see many people at the pool! You'll be fine. Water was warm but still refreshing. Plenty of drinking here, too, if you want. You just might have to wait your turn at the bar. But, if you're a grown up, I'm sure you learned how to nicely wait your turn, right? Meanwhile, the staff are working their tails off pouring and mixing and being nice about it all. Why not toss them a buck or two? They earn it. RESTAURANTS - Way plenty of food for all. Four buffet restaurants! Food was surprisingly good at all and we're not necessarily fans of buffets even at home. Points for that. The serving staff tend to focus a lot on keeping tables cleared of dirty dishes. And lots of people coming and going all during meal times. Result: In a whole week we never waited more than one minute for a table. I appreciated that. Because they were so focused on clean tables it sometimes meant we had to wait a little while to get drinks brought to us. That's OK. You're on vacation. Take it easy. You can wait a little bit. Several ala carte restaurants. This isn't your first peek at TripAdvisor so you should already know to make your reservations on first day for the following nights' dinners at any of these restaurants. There's no need to whine online about how you couldn't get seated. Enough people have written on this topic. But, more importantly, only about half of these restaurants served good food in our opinion. Japanese restaurant (\"Miso\") was fantastic. Rivals some I've seen at home in the U.S. Italian (Mama Mia\") was just O.K. I had a veal dish that was pretty good. But my wife's cannelloni was a bad attempt. SKIP the seafood restaurant. I mean, don't even bother. Maybe one dish in six is even fit to eat. And it wasn't just us. It didn't taste fresh - what worse can you say about seafood? SERVICE - I can't say enough positive things about the staff and how hard they worked to serve us. No bad attitudes. They didn't have their hand out for extra tips. We tipped because we felt someone deserved it. Try your Spanish out and you'll see their faces brighten. Even if you don't speak a word of Spanish be nice and you'll see what I mean. Appreciate that while they're not perfect neither are we. Yes, we're paying good money to stay at the resort. And they appreciated our patronage. An example: We arrived on a Sat. morning. They handled check-in well. We knew and were told our room may not be ready for check-in until approximately 3 PM. We were free to eat, drink, swim, etc. until the room was ready. Room and key was actually ready about 3:30. No big deal (you're on vacation, remember? Relax). That evening, after dinner, someone delivered a nice dessert basket and complimentary bottle of tequila to our room -- along with a signed letter from the manager apologizing for the delay in our room being ready! Wow! It's not realistic for everyone to expect such a thing every time. But it did happen for us and a few others we talked to. That one, simple gesture won us over for the whole time. Overall, I'd rate this resort highly.

I definately think that $2300 we paid for this trip was certainly advantageous for us. Many people mentioned that this hotel does NOT deserve 5 star rating. I agree with them. HOWEVER, that does NOT mean you will NOT have a GREAT TIME! The only reason why I give them 4 and 1/2 STAR is because of the Mosquitors :) I have NOTHING to complain about. Our room was Great. Food was Fantastic. Swimming Pool / Beach... were gorgeous. We visited 7 different a la carte restaurants. (Olas, Miso, Mama Mia, Le Fleur, La Vaqueria, La Hacienda, La Fondue.) I heard that we only could reserve 3 restaurants, but we were just lucky to reserve all 7, thanks to non-busy season. All of the a la carte restaurants treat you VERY WELL!!! I would say that you will have to pay something like... $40 ~ $50 if you were to get the same qualities of the food in downtown Vancouver. All the reservation were for Dinner. For your Breakfast or Lunch, you can visit International Buffet. Some people mentioned that they were disappointed by the same food everyday. WHY don't you try different International Buffet? There were at least 3 different International Buffets available. You will have MORE THAN ENOUGH choices. The resort is HUGE, so you MIGHT have to walk a long way. However, you can ALWAYs get a ride. Golf Cart like shuttle bus is always available for you to get to the Lobby / Main Center. Beach is little bit rocky, but STILL good enough to be fallen in love. Swimming pool is beautiful and there are lots of locations for you to enjoy swimming quietly. Overall, I would DEFINATELY go back to Grand Princess Riviera.

Requested a king room, third floor, and ocean view \u2026 received king room, third floor, and partial ocean view \u2026 two and a half out of three isn\u2019t bad. The trip was just for me and my wife to celebrate our 40th birthdays this year, left the kids at home. Check-In: Arrived on Tuesday afternoon around 4pm and proceeded to the Platinum check-in in the front lobby on the Riviera side. Check-In was complete in about five minutes, we did receive a fresh towel and a glass of champagne. Returned to the front to let them know our room number so that our bags could be delivered. Grabbed a drink from the lobby bar and went to our room \u2026 bags arrived within fifteen of minutes of our arrival. We visited the Platinum concierge and received our beach bag and a hat, and also had a bottle of tequila waiting in our room as a gift. Check-Out: Departed at mid-day on Wednesday with no issues, went just as smooth as check-in except we were sad to leave instead of happy to be arriving. Suite and Platinum Area: Our suite looked just like all of the pictures we saw online, and everything worked correctly with the exception of the shower not draining due to the slope of the shower floor, but that was expected and fixed by placing a towel at the base of the door. The Platinum area was nice and did have two PCs for public use to connect to the internet. Service: I can honestly say that I didn\u2019t encounter a single employee that didn\u2019t smile and say \u201chola\u201d. Everyone was so polite and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Could they use more employees? \u2026 absolutely, but that isn\u2019t their fault. Our suite was cleaned everyday, our mini-bar was re-stocked everyday, we were served at each restaurant and buffet, bar tenders were responsive, and the butlers in the Platinum areas were also responsive. The shuttle service was great and was there every time we wanted to go somewhere. Now some special call-outs for exceptional service (I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve misspelled some names): Daina (Platinum concierge), Sergio (Platinum bar tender), Lily (Platinum beach butler), and Haidi (Platinum beach butler) \u2026 these folks went above and beyond everyday to make our stay so much more enjoyable. As a note, we did tip regularly but nothing extravagant, but we did tip since we felt our needs were being exceed and that\u2019s what a tip is all about. Bars: The main bars we used were at the Platinum lounge and the beach, both were great and we got exactly what we wanted when we wanted it with little waiting. We did use other bars at night, and generally didn\u2019t have a problem getting anything we wanted in a reasonable time. Restaurants: We had breakfast and lunch in the buffet closest to the Platinum area every day except for twice when we had lunch in the sports bar and once during our excursion. We thought the food was good with plenty of variety, but taste and perception is a personal thing. For dinner, we ate at a specialty restaurant each night, they include Mexican (twice), steak house, Italian (twice), Japanese (twice), and fondue. Again, we thought the food was good \u2026 our favorites were Mexican and Japanese. Here\u2019s an import fact about the restaurants and buffets: Not once the entire time did we have to cook or clean the table, so it was good no matter the quality of the food. Gym and Spa: We used the Gym three times during our stay and didn\u2019t have to wait to use any of the equipment \u2026 usually worked out around 7:30am. We both booked a total body message and used our Platinum credit towards the cost \u2026 we were both very happy with the spa service and message. Pools and Beach: We spent the majority of our time at the beach and the Platinum pool, with the exception of one trip to the \u201cparty pool\u201d which was a short visit and we quickly returned to the Platinum pool area. We didn\u2019t play the \u201csave a chair\u201d game and didn\u2019t have a problem getting a spot we wanted the entire time we were there. Excursion: We booked a day-long excursion with Edventure \u2026 this was a very good day and a highlight of the trip. Bonnie (Ed\u2019s wife) booked everything via email and Ed was our host for the day. We toured Tulum, did a zip-line, and snorkeled twice (centote and lagoon). For lunch we went to a beach side restaurant and had some of the best tacos we\u2019ve ever tasted. Miscellaneous: When we arrived it didn\u2019t feel like there were that many people there, but once Saturday rolled around it got crowded. This caused a little more wait for stuff, but nothing major. We met some wonderful people during our stay, and that\u2019s one of the benefits of traveling, at least we think so. Overall/Summary: We booked this trip way back in January and then we started seeing the reviews roll in, needless to say we were extremely worried but decided to keep our plans and we\u2019re so glad we did. I\u2019m sure there are some out there who have had a bad experience and others who will in the future, but our trip was excellent and we will certainly return to the Grand Riviera Princess, hopefully next year. We went into our trip with an open mind and willing to deal with problems/issues and have a good time regardless of what happened, but nothing negative happened at all. We live in a rural part of South Carolina and I guess you could say we\u2019re \u201ccountry folks\u201d, but we travel a lot for business and pleasure, and have stayed in some nice places, the Grand Riviera Princess ranks right up there with the best we\u2019ve seen. Is it a five-star resort? \u2026 we can\u2019t answer that, but we can say that we had a five-star experience the nine days we were there.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cRelax and enjoy!\u201d", "Author": "Pepperanna", "ReviewID": "UR17074612", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Riviera Princess resort May 28-June 3, 2008. We had a lovely 6 days in paradise, despite the rainy weather from the tropical storm in Honduras. This was our 4th time to the Riviera Maya. We booked our vacation through book-it .com. Easy check in. Got the swim-up room we requested. The concierge was not busy right next to check in so we stopped in and she booked our restaurants for us, even though we were in a swim up room! 2 of the nights the reservations were scheduled at 9 and 10pm. However, we showed up early at the restaurants and were allowed in since we had a reservation for that evening and they must have had some cancellations! Lucky us! We ate at the Grill, Italian and Mexican, especially loved the Italian and Mexican! Our room was cleaned and stocked everyday! Tipped the bar guy and got Coronas in the fridge! Loved having the jacuzzi for 2 in the room! The pools were very nice. Didn't get to spend too much time at the beach because of the weather, but the sand was that perfect white sand and turquoise water! Found some beautiful shells while strolling on the beach. We scheuled the bus to Playa del Carmen (make sure to schedule a day ahead) and enjoyed an afternoon of shopping for treasures! We took a cab back cause we didn't want to rush! We love this area of Mexico and enjoyed our stay at this resort, would I go back to this resort? Probably not, but if the price stays about the same, maybe. So if you have booked a vacation here go and have a great time and don't sweat the small stuff! I figure you're there such a short time, enjoy every minute of it and don't let little things get you down!", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Woodlands, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWon't Go back\u201d", "Author": "kellynne18", "ReviewID": "UR17059260", "Content": "Ok, lets see....I will try to start from the beginning.... Check-In - Check In was smooth, but they only had 2 of 4 rooms from our party ready when we got there at 2:00. Check in is at 3 so, we were ok to wait. We were hungry, but the only thing open at that time was the sports bar. This is the first time we realized the hotel is way understaffed!! The food wasn't good, but we ate it because it was our only option. Rooms - My sister had to change rooms because of the overwhelming mildew smell and mold on the bathroom ceiling. That was a bummer, but they accommodated her quickly. Food - You have to make reservations for the restaurants first thing! We ate in the buffet for two nights and they pretty much served the same thing both nights. The restaurants had much better food but poor service. Because they are understaffed, one waiter has about 5 tables he is responsible for. The poor guy did everything from drinks, bread, order and delivering food, and bussing the tables. We found ourselves sitting at the table for a long time. Breakfast buffets were the best food! Staff- My husband accidently left all his jewlery out when he went scuba diving, instead of locking it up in the safe. Yep, you guess it...it was all stolen. About $1,350 worth of stuff stolen from our room and nobody at the hotel cared. We filled out a report and talked to everyone we could. We were told the first day it would be 24hours before we could get a responce. The next day, we went back and were told it would be 36hours. Finally, after much asking, we were able to speak to a manager and she told us it takes them 48hours to do an investigation. Her name is Gina Gonzales and she was incredibly rude about the whold situation. In fact, I plan on writing Princess, and her bosses about our situation. Needless to say, we left without our jewlery or any answers. This was definitly the last straw of our little frustrations. Check-out - Checkout was fine, but if you owe any money, put it on a Credit Card. We paid cash and were given pesos as change. What are we going to do with pesos back in Texas? They claimed to have no dollar bills, but I find it hard to believe, being that they are a huge international resort! The Resort itesle - Beautiful, but way too huge! It is 1/2 mile from the lobby to the beach. There is lots of walking involved in this vacation! They do have a shuttle available, but only for Platinum guests. My reccomendation: Change resorts if its possible before you go!

This hotel is a solid 7 -7.5 out of 10. So stop worrying unless you are a perfectionist. But this may vary according to the type of person you are. The resort was 80% American and prob 10% Canadian & 10% other during my stay. You had various types of people there. You could group people into: 1.Family & Large Groups \u2013 pleasant \u2013 the odd rowdy/screaming parent 2.Young Couples \u2013 pleasant and quiet 3. Spring breaker types \u2013 loved to drink and hang out by the swim up bar 4. 50 yr old spring breaker types \u2013 same as 3 above but more abnoctious 5. Older couples \u2013 cruise ship type people expecting a 5 * Hawaii/Arizona resort service and food for Mexican price (be realistic \u2013 the price of your 7 day trip is prob equiv to 1-2 days at those other places. So if you can\u2019t expect the same) 6.Other na\u00efve travelers who will complain about everything thinking this was the Ritz.(5*in mexico does not = 5* in US \u2013 comprende?) Given this breakdown, you can see how you get so many different opinions and expectations. As for me, I\u2019ve been all over the world and have been to 10 AI down south (including Iberostar/Gran Bahia/Riu/Gran Sirenis/Occidental X Caret/ Grand Playdium). I would benchmark this resort in the same category except for some service issues and small issues. No resort is perfect and this will also depend on the luck of the draw. So I\u2019m not complaining about the GRP given the price I paid due to its lower intro pricing \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t complain. It was by far one of the most inexpensive trips so a good bargain if you are willing to live with a few small issues here and there. To me, I can live with a few small issues if it saves me hundreds if not thousands. Others may not. PROS \u00b7Got upgraded from jr. suite to jr. deluxe suite. Room 6274 (3rd floor) can see ocean in distance. I did send email prior to arriving with my requests \u00b7Booked a la cartes in advance via email. Managed to snag 5 reservations all around 7pm. Less worries than having to line up at 9am upon arriving \u00b7Amazing grounds esp the courtyard at night. Marble/granite everywhere \u00b7Endless pools \u2013 various \u2013 party and quieter ones \u2013 all around 4 ft deep some shallow ones with sloping entry for kids. There\u2019s a few kiddie pools too. No loud music at the pools except the party pool. \u00b7Tons of lounges. If you were out after 10am no loungers in shade \u00b7No towel card system \u2013 just sign for it but they never reconcile it \u00b7Endless and wide beach. Some rocks in the water but if you can avoid them, there are vast patches of nice sand only 2-3ft high where you can ride the waves. Hint: enter the water adjacent to the beach bar and you don\u2019t even need water shoes! I would still advise you to wear some. Water is clear and warm in the sandy areas. \u00b7Pretty good food at beach buffet (breakfast/lunch): Good fish filets/flank steak/chicken breast/smoke salmon/al dente pasta with congac, good cr\u00e8me soups, - excellent assortment of desserts \u2013flan/pecan clusters/real cream on cakes(good quality) and ice cream (but often melted). Awful pizzas. It was amazing how much each guest can pile on their plate. No wonder some got tired of the food over the week, given they sampled every items every meal. \u00b7Premium liquor everywhere \u2013 Corona even in room \u00b7Air conditioner Theatre! Usually sweating watching a show in other resorts \u00b7Professional type shows especially \u2013 circus one on Sat night and variety show on Monday night. Thur Mexican was ok \u2013 like a mini X Caret show. Animation team shows on Wed/Fri not as good. Good thing is they didn\u2019t have the pre show games like other resorts. \u00b7Good courtyard nightly entertainment at 8pm \u2013 fire dancing/juggling and good band playing thru out the night. The courtyard was like a meeting place \u2013 like a Grand plaza. \u00b7Very good kids disco every night at 8pm \u00b7Excellent kids club \u2013 even have it at night from 7- 11pm (lots of stuff indoor like 5 PS3/Large theatre/mini pool table/mini fuseball/ping pong etc\u2026.) Reg kids club is from 10-5pm \u00b7Free shuttle to Playa de Carmen leaving 10/11/12/1 returning 11:30/12;30/1:30 and 6:00. Can only book 1 day in advance from the Best Travel guy on Riveria side. \u00b7Beautiful comtempory d\u00e9cor rooms with LCD TV. Nice double sink bathroom and good water pressure shower with rainfall head, quiet and big Jacuzzi tub. \u00b7Bar service on beach/theatre/pools with waitresses. Be patient. CONS \u00b7Some rude staff \u2013 eg. sports bartenders \u2013 ignore you and when you ask them, they just say no more even though there was more (eg popcorn or food) \u00b7Front desk not knowledgeable. Upon checking in, the guy refused to accept my e confirmation hotel voucher and said he needed my visa card \u2013 I said no way and complained and showed that another guest had checked in with same. This was a \u00bd hour ordeal and he made it seem like he was doing me a favor at the end. \u00b7Shower did leak to toilet but just put towel on floor in toilet. No biggy \u00b7Safe\u2019s sticker was \u00bd off. I had brought crazy glue with me and sealed that sucker up \u00b7Too many times they ran out of beach towels. Favorite saying \u201ccome back in 1 hr\u201d \u00b7Food sometimes undercooked (fish/chicken/burgers) \u00b7Awful pizza at buffets \u2013 looks and taste like frozen one \u00b7Poor service and no replenishing of food at Main buffets (Sunset/Riveria) \u00b7No theme nights for dinner buffet so same food everyday \u00b7Only 2 working computers for 3000 guests. Also no more free Wi Fi \u00b7Beach bar could get busy during prime time and only 1 bartender as other is serving waited service. Mixed drinks are not as good at the beach bar as they are too rushed to make a good drink. FOOD: BUFFET: Stay away from the main buffets on both sides if you can. Poor service and poorer quality food and slow to replenish items. The best is to go to the beach buffets for breakfast & lunch. Better service, better food, and fresher food and much nicer atmosphere as opposed to those dark main ones. Of course you may not have the option if you don\u2019t have dinner a la cartes as only the mains are open at night. The lunch buffet sometimes seemed to have a better selection from the main. The main had the same food everyday and 1/3 of the hot food was always hot tamales and some other Mexican stuff and some dried up pig/fish. Be careful some food is undercooked. Saw chicken stew which looked good but the meat was all red. I\u2019ve seen fish and burgers undercooked also at the buffet. Poor food handling sometimes at the grill as I saw a young cook at the beach buffet touch raw meat with a utensil then pick up cooked meats with the same utensil. Breakfast Buffet is your regular stuff \u2013 breads are good. Sometime procuitto, lots of cheeses & cold cuts. Omelettes are good. Could be long line up depending on your timing. Lots of Mango/papayas/and other fruits. Fresh juices are not watered down \u2013 it\u2019s the real juice. Sometime they have champagne & OJ at the door. Cappacinos are good but try to have them make if from scratch as opposed to using the machine \u2013 both are good. Lunch Buffet is extensive for an AI. Always every meat group \u2013 porkchops/salmon filet/seabass filet/flank steak/good pasta/nicely cooked veggies (not mushy)/burg/fries/good cr\u00e8me soups A LA CARTES: Ate at 5 a la cartes. As I mentioned above, I managed to book them even before arriving to the resort. This is truly great to be able to do this. Not sure if they will do this if everyone starts doing it. I dreaded going to main buffet dinner so wanted to make as many a la cartes. D\u00e9cor of all the restaurants were bland \u2013 big room without any atomosphere. Note: there is a supplementary charge of $25/pp for the Japanese/Seafood if you are staying in the jr. suite. They waived it for me. 1. International (10 out of 10) Good place \u2013 portions are small but sufficient. But if you are use to having 3 plates at the buffet, it may not be sufficient for you. Appetizer \u2013 salmon/tuna gelatin (good), shrimp salsa, cod salad Soup \u2013 cr\u00e8me of pumpkin (good), seafood soup (excellent) Main \u2013 Filet Mignon & Choc souffl\u00e9 (perfectly done), Redsnapper with mushroom (excellent), seabass with green olvie paste (great) 2. Seafood (9 out of 10) Huge portions but Giant prawns although impressive looking were mushy Appetizer \u2013 cod with salad; prawn/shrimp/mussel; guacamole with shrimp Soup \u2013 amazing seafood bisque \u2013 with giant prawn/shrimp/mussel/clam Main \u2013 grill for 2 (fish filet/3 prawns/shrimp/octopus) \u2013tons of food Platter #1 \u2013 fish filet/tons of fresh scallops/giant prawn/claim gratin (excellent) Platter #2 \u2013 fish fillet/prawns/shrimps Everything was perfectly cooked. Very rare to come by as most places overcook seafood. Italian (10 out of 10) Excellent meal. Good service & food. Appetizer \u2013 beef carpaccio (yummy), shrimps salad, mushroom/tomato bruchetta Soup \u2013 Shrimp lobster bisque (excellent) Main \u2013 2 veal tenderloins steak (great), seafood risotto (tons of seafood), penne in pesto sauce (al dente) \u2013 perfect Asian (not teppanyaki) (2 out of 10) Sushi: 3 pc of raw rice sushi rolls (yuck). Would be ok if not raw rice Appetizer: 2 noodle spring rolls (yummy) Soup \u2013 spicey egg drop soup, or strange wonton soup (not too exciting) Main \u2013 Phai Thai \u2013 Awful mush/Sweet & Sour Pork (hard boiled chunk of pork)/Beef stir fry \u2013 dried out shreds of meat Crunchy Turkey Breast \u2013 dried out battered meat (Mac Donald\u2019s chicken nuggets tasted better). Went to buffet after as didn\u2019t touch entrees. Don\u2019t forgot SAKE if you dare eat there. Grill (3out of 10) Appetizer: Salsa fish; cold chicken cesar (gross) Soup \u2013 fishy seafood soup (unlike Seafood restaurant), Ok cr\u00e8me of oxtail soup Main \u2013 Awful hunk of dried out pork rib/shank; Raw tiny chicken \u2013 actually taste ok but raw, Gross Grilled platter (beef/pork/rabbit/lamb/sausage). Went to buffet after \u2013 barely ate entr\u00e9e. Overall, 3 out of 5 A LA CARTES were EXCELLENT and 2 DISASTEROUS. At least you had the buffet to fall back on. Mosquitos: A few got in the room but no biggy. Killed them before sleeping. They are usually in the bathroom or drape or closet (dark/damp). Just keep your door closed and request a 2/3rd story room. If you get a first floor room your chances are higher as there are fountains in every building with often stagnant water. Never got a bite even around the resort. Will also depend on season Dismissing others neg comment: \u00b7Walk from lobby to beach is 10min. If you are mid way then 5 min to either end. \u00b7Food is awful. Do the buffet 101 \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t look appetizing or it\u2019s cold don\u2019t take it. Wait for the hot ones. Remember also this is not the USA. It\u2019s Mexico. \u00b7Limited choice at buffet\u2013 Don\u2019t take all 100 items at once and you won\u2019t get bored. \u00b7Not a 5 star place. Sure service is sometime rough around the edge. But how can you complain when you are paying around $100 per day including airfare all your drinks and 3 meals. You trying doing that in the USA/Cda!!! Remember this is not a cruise ship or the Ritz. The things \u201coffered\u201d are no different from other Mayan resorts. Platinum also doesn\u2019t mean you are KINGS/QUEENS. \u00b7I can\u2019t get a drink. Line up and chill out. If you see a big line up, wait til it dies down and then go. You won\u2019t die of thirst. \u00b7Workmanship of the resort is poor. You are in a 3rd world and this is how it is. So what if the tiles are not lined up or the marble is not perfectly square. This is how it is even in Hong Kong when you pay $400 a night. OVERALL, Good vacation, nice resort at an amazing price. If you are not one of those people to have the odd thing go wrong, go elsewhere or stay in your own country. Remember you are in a 3rd world country and more importantly remember how much you PAID before complaining!!! This place is a 4-4 \u00bd star in my opinion which is not bad.

Grand Riviera Princess, June 8 - 15: Airport: They tell you on the plane before disembarking that your tour bus is outside and to ignore the people inside trying to lure you. Like all announcements, it's fuzzy and if you're not paying attention, you could get duped because the people inside are very persuasive and actually pretend they are your tour people. Don't be swayed - keep walking. Bus Ride: Ours stopped at 1 (or 2) hotels along the way, so from the airport, the bus ride took 45 mins-1hour. The guy asks if anyone wants a beer and you get revved up thinking it's part of your All-Inclusive, then tells you they are $3 each (and water is $2) Check-In: No problem if you're smart - if you're there as a couple, one of you should see to the luggage, the other should go directly to reception to check-in. This was very quick. The ONLY hotel information we were given was the map they provide at check-in. Keep it with you everywhere you go - the place is enormous and there is very little helpful signage anywhere. They don't even sign the bathrooms - you will only see their locations on the map. They will deliver your luggage to your room, but we only had one rolling suitcase so we walked. Rooms: we had a Deluxe Junior Suite - it was beautiful, the first thing to note is that you must slide your plastic keycard into the slot at the door to make any of the electronics work. We are thinking that MAYBE the bellboy explains this to you when your luggage comes, but since we walked, we didn't know. I remembered from another review I read, so THANKS! Our air conditioner control was on the wall directly across from the door. Because there is a fan control by the bed, the first two nights we thought we had the AC on but really it was just the fan. It wasn't uncomfortably hot, but it was better once we found the AC - and it wasn't crazy noisy - it was normal AC noise. Our shower did the same thing I read in another review - every now and then when someone would shower above us, water would pour out through the light fixture into the shower. Besides the obviousness of this potentially dangerous situation, we were slightly weirded out by the possibility of showering at the same time as someone else and having their drainwater pour down on us. I am pretty sure that didn't happen to us, but it potententially COULD happen - yuck. (room 6102) There was a closet in our room with lots of hangers and a few shelves for clothes - dust off the top shelf before putting your clothes there..... no actual dressers, but one other cupboard by the minibar where we put some clothes too (I got the closet, he got the cupboard.... the way it should be) The bathroom was great with a soaker jacuzzi tub (which I used and loved) - but the bathrooms have too many lightswitches - I could never figure out which was which and put on a lightshow every time I went in there. The bathroom has only Shampoo and Soap (no conditioner or body lotion) - plus a couple shower caps, a comb, a bath sponge and a shoe polisher... who wears shoes in Mexico?? Mini-Bar: It was hidden in a cupboard and had 3 beer, 3 pop, 3 water, and sometimes fizzy mineral water. They keep it stocked up to that level so if you want to make sure you can have access to more, take out all or some of what's in there when you leave for the beach (we took our ice bucket, put drinks in, filled it with ice from the machine on our floor and brought it to the pool/beach with us). We put a only a $1 in the fridge twice and always had our fridge stocked. (it's true, the fridge staff is different - makes me wonder if our maid ever got the tip we left her....) Mosquitoes: there are no swarms around, but if even ONE gets in your room (even back home) you are screwed. So after getting a couple of bites the first 2 nights, we got smart and put the fan on high. That's all you have to do - go to sleep with your fan on HIGH, and pull up the blankets if you're cold. Mosquitoes don't like wind - once we did that, we didn't even need to use the bug spray anymore (which, face it, doesn't work anyway). I recommend bringing a bottle of Bactine with you b/c it is a soothing anesthetic spray good for bites AND sunburn, so it is dual purpose. In-Resort Transport: it's on the outside road, but they don't tell you about this (ok, to be fair, we missed our Air Transat orientation - so maybe they do....) We discovered it b/c our room faced the road and saw it go by. It seems to come with regularity - even early in the morning & late at night. You just wait by the outside road and flag it down. Resort Size: Enormous - seems to be about 2 city blocks from the lobby to the beach (which is why the transport comes in handy). There are pros and cons to room location - ours was the closest to the beach but farthest from the dinner buffets. So naturally, when you're near the dinner buffets, you are a long walk to the beach. The hotel has big umbrellas for you to use - since June is rainy season, you may need one b/c the direct paths in the middle are not covered and you will get wet if it rains. However, you CAN walk totally covered from end to end if you take the long route through each building (each has a little courtyard so you have to walk around it which would make your walk longer) Beach: upland sand is lovely, beach is beautiful, except for the view of cranes on a building far down to the left - but we really enjoyed the beach and didn't matter what time of day we arrived there, were able to find a palapa & loungers. There are no \"sellers\" to speak of - I think once I saw a guy with beads walk buy and he held them up as he walked. Definitely not your typical Mexico beach experience with 6000 vendors harrassing you daily. There ARE massage huts on the beach and a person doing hair braids. It think I heard someone say it was $2 per braid. I do recommend water shoes as many other travellers did. You can see where the beds of kelp are and can avoid those - what you can't see are the big piles of rocks that are the same colour as the sand. So when people said it was rocky, I thought \"pebbly\" and have tough feet so I didn't bother with the shoes. What we really mean is ROCKS. Big piles of rocks and if you wade unprepared into the non-kelpy area, there is a good chance you will stub your foot pretty painfully. Once you realize this, you can be more careful - and probably water shoes won't help a lot with this but they will help a little and this warning will hopefully help you as well. There is a roped off area for swimming and even out at the edge of it, the water is only waist-deep - but the water is WARM!!! (of course, it IS June) Pools: are numerous and gorgeous - if you are up early enough to get to your pool - or at least reserve a seat before you breakfast, choose with intelligence - locate the bathrooms on your map, and THEN find which of the pools have a swim-up bar (they are not all indicated on the map) and try to find a palapa in that location (the pools closest to the beach have swimup bars and are near to a bathroom AND have the added bonus of being near 2 breakfast and lunch buffets). Towels: the towel huts are open sporadically and unpredictably, so once you get a towel, don't turn it in until the towel hut is open again and you are exchanging it - otherwise you might not get one. Entertainment: there is an entertainment crew, but the entertainment was cheesy and repetitive.... but maybe other people who are \"joiners\" (or drunk) would enjoy it more. There is a huge theater onsite where they put on shows... the one we saw (some of, because we left) - they have an enormous projector screen there that they used for the show - I think they should use that to offer movies at night - but they don't. So the entertainment they offer is: aerobics, horseshoes, volleyball, archery, water volleyball, darts, pingpong and croquet. That list doesn't sound bad, but when you count the number of people that can possibly participate in games like those, and then compare it to the gazillions in the resort, it is entertainment for only a small percentage. Although, as I said, the theater is enormous so lots of people could attempt entertainment there.... (good luck) Free Shuttle to Playa Del Carmen: In the Riviera lobby around the corner from the bar, is a desk for Best Day Travel - you must go to that desk to book your shuttle to Playa - for the next day. They will not book any further in advance than that, so if you want to go Friday, you have to book it Thursday. Shuttles go at 10, 11, 12 & 1. The map tells us the shuttle returns at 6, which made for interesting math in our heads. When we got on our noon bus, they explained that if we don't get the 1:30 bus back, we must wait for the 6pm bus, and there is NO GUARANTEE that there will be space. So we concluded that you could return on the half hour after all of the other incoming buses (ie, return at 11:30, 12:30, 1:30...or 6). It's about a 20 minute bus ride (because of traffic). But we went on the noon and returned at 1:30 because we aren't shoppers and are too cheap to buy food when we already paid for it at our resort - and that's all there is in Playa - shopping and eating. Food: Buffet: Really, it's not as bad as you're reading - although we were disappointed the first few days. The trick is to recognize the good food - which is basically the staples/comfort food. The biggest disappointment is the lack of good Mexican food on the buffets. Anything that looks exotic and yummy is bland and tasteless (we compared it to cooking in the army - cooking for the masses). But if you go for things that you would cook at home, you will find some DELICIOUS buffet food.... for example - all of the fish, flank steak, BBQ Chicken, Lasagna, corn on the cob, carrots w/ butter - plus they had lots of salad fixings and fruit. It might just not be the right season, but the pineapple was not even worth eating, and the watermelon was bland too - but the MANGOES were wonderful - and the kiwis. They had papayas etc too - but I didn't eat those. Lots of fruits and Vegetables. As I said, when you go on vacation, you tend to go for the stuff you wouldn't normally cook at home because you want a VACATION from that food too - but the reality is, that is the stuff that tastes the best on the buffet, and once we realized that, we had an excellent meal every time we ate at the buffet. They also do custom pastas at lunch - you pick what you want to put in your sauce, and pick your type of sauce, and then they put it in an individual pan and grill it on a open flame. It seemed to be very popular but the one time we tried it, the result tasted like charcoal - almost like it was burnt. But we didn't try it again to find out if that's b/c of the cooking method or just that ours did get burnt that day. One thing to note, you can breakfast and lunch at the restaurants nearest the beach, but they are not open for dinner buffet - you must trek to the lobby for that. Also, in the buffet restaurants (for all meals), you can only get beer and wine for alcohol - so if you want a daquiri with your lunch, get it at the outside bar first and bring it with you. Also, Breakfast is 7am-10:30, Lunch is 12:30-3:30, Dinner is 6:30 - 10:30. The Sports bar under the Sunset lobby will offer food 24 hrs / day and when I say food.... it is tortilla chips with that chemical cheese, plus jalapenos and salsa, or hotdogs, or a really greasy disgusting burger and fries. I might have seen a sandwich walk out of there once, but I'm not sure.... So time your meal choices well, because that 2 - 3 hour break between mealtimes can be killer. Next time I do AI, I will take some baggies or gladware in a beach bag with me and discreetly take some food away with me for snacking. In fact, I did that with a styrofoam cup, but if I had a gladware, it would have been easier..... Note \u2013 there is really no good Mexican food on the buffets (except the salsa & guacamole). Restaurants: There is a dress code \u2013 long pants & shirts with collars for men \u2013 no flip-flops. For women, basically anything goes as long as it isn\u2019t beachwear. Find out what your package includes. I read about having to pay for some of the restaurants, but found out that my Air Transat package included all... check if yours does or not to help you decide which restaurants to book at. Follow this advice and your restaurant booking experience will not be nearly as frustrating.... PREPARE TO WAIT. So to book a restaurant evening, you must go to the first restaurants behind the Riviera Reception desk (around the corner to the right on the 2nd floor) and there are 2 restaurants that have the same door - you go in and there will be someone standing there at a podium with a computer and a long line of people. Even if the line is not that long, just know you will be there for an hour or more because when you get one person trying to book 7 restaurants for a party of 8, it takes a long time.... BRING A BOOK or just bring your calm - there is no getting around this wait and the restaurants we tried are worth it (and definitely preferable over buffet every night) so plan it in. While you are waiting in the line, they have the menus for all restaurants out for display so you can make an informed decision on what to book at depending on your tastes. We were entitled to all 7, but only booked at 3 b/c those are the ones that appealed. You can order regular drinks at all the restaurants (not restricted to just wine and beer like you are at the buffet) Italian: Good Salad, Bad Soup, GREAT veal, Good Lasagna, Pretty Good Dessert Japanese: pretty good sushi (considering), Bad Soup, YUMMY main meal (fried rice, grilled veggies and choice of stir-fried beef, chicken or seafood), wonderful dessert (especially the fried bananas) Mexican: The ONLY good Mexican food available here.... they have a buffet-style salad/appetizer bar, and then you order from the menu for the main meal. The Tomato Soup was excellent, as was the Snapper and the beef/chicken fajitas. Seafood: We didn't eat here, but heard from others that the food was very 'weird'. It was tasty if you could handle your whole fish complete with teeth glaring at you from your plate. Money: Other than tips, you really don't need any. I think the view on service is dependant on your needs. We are not big drinkers so our opportunities to be poorly served were minimized. But we never had bad service - whether we tipped or not. It is difficult to tip in a swim-up bar. I tipped because I wanted to, knowing that these people make very little money and a few bucks from me means a lot more to them - but I didn't tip because I HAD to.... We left tips in each of our restaurants because we had waiters actually diligently serving us for the entire meal. If you are bringing bills for tipping, get SMALL BILLS from home first - we went with a mitful of $20s which proved problematic, although we were able to get one nice waitress to change it to ones for us one time.... Be prepared with small bills, whether you decide to tip or not, you can at least be ready to.... I never touched a peso while we were there... Don't need much $$ at an All Inclusive, right? At least we were able to leave a $20 for our maid for the week - although I am not convinced the fridge guy didn't get it.... Icemaker: At first, I thought it didn't work, but then figured it out - you press the button for what you want (ie, ice only, ice with water etc), and then you put your bucket under - I think it is motion activated - it definitely works when you use the ice bucket, but you have to use your hand to trigger the motion if you are using a bag or smaller item to put the ice in. Don't assume it doesn't work - just keep trying. BAR: This place has full bar service - you can get a WIDE variety of beverages. I settled into Mango Daiquiris - although they never use fresh fruit - it's all syrup no matter what kind of beverage... but you can get Mudslides, Purple Rain, Mojitos, every kind of Daquiri/Margeurita, Dirty Monkey, and I saw Sour Apple Liqueur on the bar so asked for a drink with that and got a concoction that was yummy (don\u2019t know the name though). They even make a CAESAR!! SERVICE: We had no trouble whatsoever with the service. We speak a little Spanish \u2013 perhaps that helped, I don\u2019t know - but tipping or not, we still got everything we needed. Sometimes coffee is a little slow at coming during breakfast \u2013 but if you REALLY wanted it, you could get it. PHOTOSHOP: each day, they have a photographer come around with an animal and take pics with it - after 4pm, you can go to the photoshop at the front and view the pics and purchase them for $12US for a 6x8. There are no discounts for multiple purchases - $12 each no matter how many. Of course the bigger sizes are more $$. But you can get photographed with Macaws, a monkey, a tucan, an iguana or a snake! Macaws are Monday, Monkey is Tuesday, somewhere between Wed & Fri is another day for Macaws, plus the iguana day. Tucan is Saturday, and Snake is Sunday - they come around in the mornings. All in all, we had a relaxing time, and while not RAVING about the place, thoroughly enjoyed it.", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cMy stay at Princess Maya\u201d", "Author": "Gixcharger", "ReviewID": "UR16975435", "Content": "Well, I also read many reviews here about this resort before I went and was almost ready to change bookings! The only reason I didn't was the price to change was expensive. We stayed at this resort from the 31st of May to June 14th. 2 weeks! I have a few very valid complaints but on the whole it was pretty good there. We flew with Signature Vacations and will definitely use them again. Nancy, our rep was very good and our trip from the airport was informative and comfortable. One thing I can say about the airport is if you are an able person who doesn't mind carrying your own bags, say no to the masses of Mexicans all willing to carry your bags the 1 minute walk to the bus. They all want to help as they know they'll make a buck or two from you but this distance is seriously not necessary. Check in was a breeze and we had our bags in our room within 15 minutes. We stayed in the Junior Deluxe suite 7103. We were only supposed to have the regular suite but I asked if there was room to upgrade us without cost and there was. It probably helped we were on our Honeymoon. The room was great with a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. We were on the 2nd floor which was pretty good. The only bad thing about the room was the leaking shower floor which overflowed into the main bathroom floor which was very slippery! Now on to the negative. Security within your suite is nil!!! The staff can, and do, walk in when ever they want. There is no security bar to latch the inside once you are in the room like in most hotels. There is a dead bolt which is useless as it opens when they swipe themselves in. The first morning we were there, there was a knock and IMMEDIATELY he walked in with no delay. I called out to say what's going on and he said room cleaning. I said we'd be out in 1/2 an hour. After breakfast the same day we came back to the room to change for the beach and the same guy knocked again and immediately walked in without waiting for me to come to the door. My wife could have been standing at the closet changing! He left again and we went to the beach for 4 hours, came back and the room was still not done. We decided to go out again but not before a third time buddy walked in. We decided we should use the door tag that says DO NOT DISTURB and on the other side CLEAN ROOM. Unfortunately they don't really look at that either as a few days later we left the Do not disturb sign on and went to breakfast only to come back and find same Buddy in our room and going through my bed side drawer! I grabbed the sign from the door knob and was very stern with him showing him the do not disturb sign. He didn't say much but kept checking around the room with his check list. I guess a guy comes around first, before the cleaners, to see what has to be done because every time we caught him coming through the door there was no cleaning cart with him. I asked him to leave and he didn't so I said it louder and more directly and he left. We would have kept using the no disturb sign but it mysteriously disappeared over night. I went to get a new one but it too disappeared over night. It was pointless. Four more times over our stay the same guy knocks as he swipes his card to come in. One time I was standing at the safe which is about 4 feet from the door. I heard someone knock and immediately put my hand out to the knob but the door was already opening! This blew my mind at how easily these people can just waltz in whenever! Another time he came in as I was just pulling up my shorts! Ridiculous! Next time I am definitely bringing that door club one can buy at Wal-mart for $28 bucks. It is tubular steel mechanism that goes from under the knob to the floor on an angle with rubber pads at the bottom to prevent the door from opening when you are in there. I still tipped every day but for this reason alone I will never visit this resort again. My wife had brought a regular door stop with us to jam under the door once it's closed but the space under the door was so tight it wouldn't even go under. The Buffet! Well, it was pretty good the first couple of days until my body started to react. I think I narrowed it down to the oil they use to cook EVERYTHING in. The eggs, the bacon, the beef, the pork, the chicken, the fish, the bread, the fries, I don't need to go on. You walk into the buffet and there is this smell. All the food has this same tang taste. My stomach has never ever given me a problem before and I've been to 3rd world nations many times. So needless to say, I used a few packs of Imodium on my trip at US$9 a pack at the resort. By the way, the room's bathroom is not sound proof AT ALL...so if you react to the food you may want to send your partner out for a walk! By the end of our first week my body was rejecting everything. I lived on toast and jam in the morning with packaged yogurt, small salad for lunch, and whatever I could find that wasn't fried or made with oil in it for dinner. It was horrible! Fortunately we had bookings at the restaurants for most of the second week. I still had to be selective but made it through. I was glad we brought a few boxes of trail mix bars! There are 2 computers for the use of guests. There were 3 but one broke down early in the first week and it never did get fixed. This is a pain as there are 2 resorts using 2 computers. We waited for a long time each time we needed to check our business. Our weather was on and off the whole time we were there. Rained for the first 3 days, cloudy with sunny breaks for 2 days, sun for 2 days, and repeat. We spent the majority of our time near the pools which you must go really early to throw a towel and a magazine on to save otherwise you're screwed for shade from the sun or rain by 10 am. So, other than the few negatives, we had a really good time. The bars were great and the entertainment as well. We went on a few tours and had a great time. The lobster cruise was good too. A note to remember when doing the lobster cruise, you have a choice between all lobster or steak and lobster. Believe me the steak is not good! Go for the all lobster\u2026you get more of it and it is very succulent.

Prior to leaving we read alot of reveiws and were so upset by all the bad reviews, we actually tried to change hotels at the last minute. I am happy to report that for the most part we were very pleased with the resort and some of the reviews did give us some good advice (such as buying water shoes for the ocean - it's very rocky). Here is how we saw things: The good: The resort - the resort itself is gorgeous! There are numerous pools and lots of beach chairs and even beds to lay out on. The rooms are gorgeous and the air conditioning worked great! Beach massage - we had a couples massage right on the beach for $20 each. This is soooo cheap. We spoke with other couples whom we met on excursions and they were paying around $60 - $70 per person. No bugs - we didn't have an issue with bugs at all. I think I had 2 bites the entire time from \"no see-ums\" but that's it. Originating from Saskatchewan, I can live with that!! Guide - Our Signature rep named Nancy was awesome and we booked a few excursions through her. However, I do NOT recommend Chichen Itza as it is close to a 4 hour bus ride just to get there. Not worth wasting so much time on a bus! Tulum is closer and just as beautiful. Free Scuba Diving Lesson - this is a short introduction but all I wanted was to try breathing using scuba gear. It's free, so try it! I thought that was great for them to supply this to guests. The bad: The food - my husband had some difficulty with the food - it just did not sit well with his stomach. I, however, enjoyed the food but by the end of the trip I was finding my stomach was bloating badly after eating. It was quite painful but would resolve after 20 min or so (we were there for 2 weeks though, so we were eating ALOT of this food). Buffet service - It was often difficult to get drinks from the staff, however which was annoying. You had to actually stop them to get service. But we got used to that or else we just went and grabbed a jug of water/coffee ourselves! Internet - there are only 2 working computers (out of 3) for a VERY large resort. You can expect to wait at least 3/4 of an hour to get a computer. (There is a 1/2 hour max usage for terminals). The cleaning staff - they knock early and don't wait long before bargin into your room! It got to the point where my husband had to yell at the guy! We even found him looking through our bedside drawer one day when we walked in on him cleaning and surprised him. (He had no reason to be in there). So use the SAFE at ALL times!! Even if you are just going for a breakfast. The bars - the swim up bars and lounges in the hotel usually only have a few bartenders to deal with many, many tourists who are drinking for free (all inclusive), so needless to say they are overworked and you usually have to wait a while for a drink. However, they mix the drinks super strong so you don't have to come back so often! haha. Convenience Store - do NOT forget anything like suntan lotion - they charge close to $23 for a bottle there!! Total rip off. Make up remover pads were $7 for a package ($1.27 at Walmart here). Just remember to bring all the essentials - don't buy them there! The bad things aren't worth writing a bad report on this hotel. We had a wonderful honeymoon and I wouldn't expect perfection from ANY resort!

Here is feedback for the interested. Grounds- Outstanding (5 out of 5) Beautiful, landscaping groomed meticioulsly. Pools-awesome, clean. Rooms/common areas-almost all granite flooring/modern motiff. Service- Poolside-Average (3 out of 5). Provide tips, return time for the next drink round decent. Overall understaffed, a couple of the pool servers, were running around like crazy to cover large areas. Roomservice- Poor (0 out of 5) MAJOR ISSUE!!!! We came down with 25 family members with 9 rooms between us. 2 of our rooms experienced cash being taken that was not locked in the safe (shame on those guys for not using the safe) but on the other hand, this is a \"5 star hotel\" so it shouldn't happen. Floors were not cleaned in the rooms (all tile room), best way to describe flooring condition- a bit \"sticky and grimy\" at times. Room assignments were suppose to be next to each other-were not. Families requesting cribs were not set up upon arrival. Those that requested Queen/King were assigned two twin beds (though Queen/King) was confirmed). Food (3 out of 5). 2 Buffet restuarants-\"Government issue\" which means weren't bad but run of the mill food. No change of pace, same stuff for every breakfest and same stuff for every lunch. \"Ala Carte\" Restuarants- Biggest disappointment here and best guidance for a new traveler- 2 day advance reservations required for \"Ala Carte\" resturants since resturants are always \"Booked/Sold Out\". No guidance is provided by the staff until you try to go out that night or call for availability. The unfortunate truth, the restuarants are not sold out and usually 50% occupied at dinner time. You can gate crash if you are nice about it and get in without a reservation but that is something that needs to change (eg. 2 day wait). We ate at the \"La Vaqueria\"-Spanish motiff. (3 out of 5). Ceviche-above average. Meat dish, the restuarant's special dish after its own name \"La Vaqueria\" was dry with the feeling that some of the cows that made up the dish were a little long in the tooth before turned into the evening meal. Next-Le Fleur-French cuisine- (1 out of 5). Food was 3 out 5 but had a server that was unfortunately over the top bad and was not ignorant to it. The back drop of the story- 3 tables for a total of 25 guests. (Ages babies to 85 year old). 2 tables without Mario, our server, were eating dessert when our table was being served its soup. In an effort to create the perfect storm, our table had 4 children under the age of 3, naturally a couple were crying off and on and the guy MOCKED the kids crying by rubbing his eyes simulating crying and making the crying voice about 12 inches from the crying baby. Ok..I know you might think I'm just an over the top parent but after the 5th time....maybe its not me but Mario, the server. The last comment-Dinner comes out and after two bites, he askes if he can take our plates. Attempted to escalate with the concierge, got a friendly smile and the look back at me like we have no idea what you are saying to us. Just craziness. Last resturants-Mamma Mia- (4 out of 5). Not enough wait staff..2 servers for 25 people, they tried and were polite and helpful. Food was a cut above the other two restaurants I mentioned but this is supposed to be fine dining so big miss on service is a big miss on the dining experience. That is the takeaway, the Hospitality expertise is lacking. As you all know, fine dining restuarants have the \"roamer\", the head server/manager that roams the floor determining if anything is going array and touching base with diners regarding the experience. That does not exist here and it is a costly miss for the hotel and the guests. Bars/Discotec-Not enough wait staff and bartenders-When you have the situation, no need to elaborate, you know how it plays out. No comment on Spas-did not use So....Pools/Grounds-Great Everything else-nothing really special-I will speculate this hotel will morph into a younger under 25 place in the next few years and the older crowd with the willingness to pay more $$$ for the service and ambiance will just go elsewhere.", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort but will not go back\u201d", "Author": "sweetsoutherngal16", "ReviewID": "UR16866385", "Content": "We stayed at the GRP June 2-8 in a Platinum suite. I'm going to break this down since I found it easiest for me when I was reading the reviews. Check-In: Painless. Our room was ready immediately and our luggage arrived within 10 minutes. Room: Kind of an ocean view...if I stretched around the corner I could see it. Not a big deal since we weren't in our room much. The TV only worked some of time and we had to beg for the free internet...which wasn't free according to the concierge. A technician came to hook up the computer and ended up giving us the passcode to get the wireless. The shower leaked horribly but we just kept a towel on the floor and it wasn't a big deal. The safe was fine however I was a little nervous b/c the front sticker looked tampered with but it was fine. Our room was cleaned sporadically but was cleaned everyday. The mini bar was restocked every morning. Resort: Gorgeous and very large. They do have a shuttle that runs from the lobby to the Platinum lounge and beach. It ran about every 15 minutes and we only had to walk twice. It was not a big deal. The tile is very beautiful but very slippery when wet. I saw a couple people take pretty hard falls walking on the tile...be careful! Pools: They had a ton of pools. I would take my girls to the larger pool in the morning to afternoon. After lunch, we would go to the private platinum pool. The platinum pool area is really nice and the only way you are going to get poolside service is if you tip. I was done with tipping for service that they should provide anyway so I refused. It wasn't a big deal, I just walked in and got my drink and snacks. Buffets: Eat at your own risk. I bit into a hamburger the first night and it was rotten meat. I read a previous post about this very same thing and had forgotten about it. It was disgusting. The food was the same every night on the buffet...nothing spectacular and not that great. Service was ok. Nurse your drink b/c it will be a while before you get your next one! A la carte: We made reservations the day we arrived and were able to get reservations for Tues, Thurs and Sat. Seafood was AWFUL. We didn't even wait for dessert and we went and ordered room service when we got back. The Japanese rest. was a dissapointment b/c we were supposed to be booked at the grill, however, they didn't book us there and we had to eat off the menu. There was crazy food on there and by this point, my husband was not feeling well from the night before. The Italian rest. was by far the best. Miscellaneous: If you are going to Cancun to dive, do not stay here. We were told their was an onsite dive shop and their wasn't. My husband had to ask about 5 people about the included dive until he found someone that would honor what was offered. Supposedly they got their boat last week, which would have saved the 40 minute drive to the other dive shop. Not a big deal, but it caused a lot of confusion. Also, their were a couple things on the details that were \"cancelled\" before we got there (i.e free hour of motorized watersports, dinner on the beach, etc) We didn't cause a big fuss but will get with our TA to follow up. The massage was ok...the spa is very pretty. This is a nice resort and has a ton of potential. If we ever go back to Mexico, we'll stay at a more established resort. They have a lot of work to do here. If you are concerned about the food, don't stay here. It's just not great and we actually LOST weight on this vacation. I don't think you should have to tip to get what you paid for. I've stayed at SEVERAL AI resorts and have never in my life seen so many people tipping just to get a drink brought to them. We did a few times but only when it was warranted. The staff took advantage of this completely and it was very irritating.

The vacation got off to a bad start when we checked into our rooms. I had 2 rooms (We're a family of 6) and were told we would have adjoining gulf front rooms, we we nowhere near each other and only one gulf front view. After tipping the concierge, the other room was upgraded to gulf view, room 5111. The smell in this room was very musty when the a/c was on and almost unbearable. I was told they would fix it but that never happened. The 1st thing we did after checking in was to make reservations for the restaurants. The earliest times we could get get were 10:00 pm.

There was no private butler on the beach, we were told maybe tomorrow every day. There was no private dinner on the beach like advertised, we were told there were turtles laying there eggs. The area where the dinner was to be had hundreds of people on the beach during the day and this was there common excuse. These a just a few of the things promised and not delivered. The pools are very clean and beautiful, but with no waiters or waitresses walking around, it made it tough to get a drink at the swim up bar. Most of the help there seemed to be unhappy people except for a few. The big exception to this was Sergio in the Platinum Lounge. He was the most outgoing, happy, accommodating person in the resort. This resort has all of the possibilities of being a 5 star resort if they get a better grasp on service!!!", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcaslte upon Tyne", "Title": "\u201cGood but not 5 star\u201d", "Author": "scotty1980", "ReviewID": "UR16861166", "Content": "At the time of booking hotel knew that it wasn't actually open to the public filled me with a lot of sceptisism. But then holidays are supposed to have some sort of surpirses. Flight from UK was good. Cancun airport is an absolute nightmare getting through immigration and customs. Upon arrival at hotel was very impressed with organisation of bell boy who dutifully took our bags and placed them waiting for our room numbers. Check in went OK. Receptionist was obsessed with us providing voucher to prove accommodation details despite the fact travel company do this 7 days prior to arrival. Luckily another member of staff overheard conversation and intervened to resolve issue. Rooms were ready and check in took 5mins!!!! Told bell boy room number and headed off to room. 5 minutes later bags arrive. Will split review into the different sections to make it easier. ROOM - we had 7046 which is junior suite. Went into room, everything was excellent. nice and clean, spacious, no bad smells and A/C on keeping room cool. First problem started when tried to shut door. The door had slipped slightly off hinge which meant door wouldnt shut without me putting my back out in process. Informed bell boy when dropping off luggage. He rang reception and arrived for maintenance to sort it. They came the next day which was fine. they fixed door when we were at the pool. Second problem. For some reason the card wouldnt work for the door. A visit to reception and cards were reset. 2 days later same thing happened again with the door. 5 phone calls to concierge and many promises of it being fixed. It wasnt fixed for 5 days. In the end we got our holiday rep who spoke fantastic spanish (including the swear words) to tell management it needed to be sorted. It was 3 days later. If anyone reading this ends up stopping in 7046 then keep an eye on door. the standard of mexican carpentry not the best. One other issue with room. mini bar was only ever filled with water. until i caught guy filling it. He said only fills with water unless a tip is left for him...I left a list in the fridge instead. apart from these two issues the room was fine. overlooked main walkway through resort and got sun late afternoon to dry clothes on balcony. No mosquitos or any other wildlife problems. In the middle of resort so close to everything. Loved the walking as it helped work off my meals and drink. FOOD - Mainly ate at the lobby buffet restaurants with a few trips to the a la carte ones. Buffet was what you would expect from buffet. mass produced food with little care for presentation and guarantee of a hot meal. Breakfasts were better as you could eat lot of fruit or stick with waffles & syrup etc. Didnt understand the brocolli and carrots for breakfast though Lunch and dinner were slightly stranger. You could not make a meal of the food served. It was very random - Chicken but no vegetables or pasta and onion rings. A la Carte were ok. liked the italian. waiters were prompt and cheerful and food was hot and enjoyable. veal fillet was delicious. Grill was mediocre and as described in previous review-the origin and accuracy of the meat could be questioned. Cant complain too much as will eat most types of food and never went hungry. POOLS/BEACH - excellent pools with plenty of space. never saw all of the loungers full and plenty of shade when the sun got a little bit warm. Pool bar was great and self serve ice cream was god send at hottest times. Service was very good. quick and someone came round to collect glasses and take orders so didnt really have to leave pool. Beach was of good quality but sea was always bit rough when we wanted to take kayak out :( CUSTOMER SERVICE - left the worst till last. With the experiences of our room we experienced the 'Mexican minute' or week depending on how much you tip. In England it is not an accpeted part of our culture to tip for good service. You do it after good service has been received. therefore we didint tip much apart from the cleaner and barman at lobby bar who had drinks ready when he saw us walking towards bar. The priority was always given to Americans flashing the cash. Fair enough but hotel will be a lot different next year (2009) when Thomson (Tiu) have bought up 90% of rooms on resort and will be filled by English holidaymakers who dont tip. They will have to work hard for that $1. The basic problems stem from the hotel being massively understaffed and what staff they had been overworked. In the two weeks we were there you could notice the difference already from the new manager who made changes to smarten place up and some hiring and firing to get best out of staff. in couple of years this hotel will be a 4*/5* but not yet. overall the holiday was good and would recommned stopping here to other people but to wait a couple of years before booking.", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cDon't Do It\u201d", "Author": "sunnyday24", "ReviewID": "UR16849191", "Content": "Well, we just returned last night at 1:30 am from an 8 day stay at the GRP, and I promised I would write this first thing in the morning to try and help someone somewhere change sites if at all possible. We stayed the 3rd through the 10th with our children, 6 and 7, my sister and her husband and son who is 10. Check in was fast, but talk about rude. The guy who checked us in was like the mafia, at first I thought he was kidding around, made a big deal to my children that if they loose the bracelet it is a $100 fee, or they don't eat or swim, this guy was totally nuts! We were to be in the building with our family, however we were not even close. We asked him to move us closer, simply stated NO! Again are you kidding me? We were looking for some info on the grounds, activities ect, and he gave us a map of the grounds and highlighted our room number, and pointed. We had no idea where to go, but laughed it off, we were on vacation and things were starting to get funny when the bell hop said that if we were not in our room when the luggage arrived it would go back up front and we would need to get it to our room...thought that was a joke too, but did not want to take the chance. Our room was nice , everything was clean except the tub...asked for it to be cleaned, and until we gave the housekeeper $10, it did not happen. We arrived at 2:30, and no food was available except in the sports bar. It was insane. There were so many people trying to get food and just one guy working his tail off at the bar. There was no way he was going to please anyone, and it was to no fault of his own, way understaffed. If you have never seen people fight for food before, go to the one sports bar that offers food on a resort this size around 3 or 4 in the afternoon, YIKES. My husband asked for some better rum in his drink as it was sitting right on the shelf, and he was told that the had the wrong color bracelet...and then asked for a splash of coke in another drink and the guy in the sports bar told him he would have to pay for more coke in that drink..we laughed thinking he was joking...ahhhh, not the case, I know this guy was overworked but I was really suprised how rude most of the folks that work on this resort are. We have never experienced this before in Mexico, usually everyone is so kind. NOW, THE FOOD. I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH, IF YOU HAVE SMALLER CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT INTO DIFFERENT KINDS OF FOOD, YOU ARE IN FOR A LONG VACATION. They have hot dogs just about every night, oh and fries, but other than that, nothing geared to children....bring snacks, a bag of chips in the one gift shop they have is $4.50...and it is a medium size bag. I don't understand it but the food on the buffet is always, always cold...never had one warm item that should have been warm...the wait staff down by the beach, which is the best for breakfast and lunch rocks. They played with the kids, gave us tips on the area and were one of the best parts of our trip. One guy actually taught my son a new spanish word each day, the kids loved him. The pools are GREAT. They are very well taken care of, and kids had a ball there. Remember to bring a ball or floats of your own, remember that you are at a resort....a ball and some sand toys were $20, same thing here is $3..but on a resort and we made the mistake on that one. One couple told us that sunblock was $22 in the beach shop...(sorry there is a beach shop as well). We did not encounter any problems with bugs at all, usually they zero in on my son, and we each only got 1 bite..so no problems there. Be careful on the free shuttle to Playa, according to our American Express rep, they send in 4 shuttles a day, and only pick up once at 6 pm...if there is no room for you on the shuttle, then you take a taxi back..we choose to just get a van , 7 of us was $27 into playa and $27 back, we just called the guy when we were ready, and he was there in no time. We also took the shuttle over to Cozumel....AMAZING. Buy your tickets there...the shuttle was $10 for adults and $8 for kids, cheaper if you buy your round trip, but we did not want to be pressed for time. Once there my husband found a guy that offered a 3 hour snorkel trip in a glass bottom boat for he and one of my sons, as well as my brother in law and his son, and said it was the most amazing thing he has ever done. This guy new just where to go...and then they had photo's taken under the water with the most beautiful fish....this was a highlight..Cozumel was fun for shopping as well. Bottom line, we wont go back. We tipped everone, always kept in mind the fact that these people were working their tails off, but the lack of kindness and respect gets way old. I do want to add that the one thing this place has going for it is the animation staff, they always had a \"hola\" and a smile.

I was like everyone else, very nervous after reading all of the bad reviews. We got to Cancun around 2:30 pm. After about a 45 minute ride in a nice air-conditioned van and a few coronas, we arrived at the hotel. Check in was a breeze. There was one person in line ahead of us, another employee called me over to the platinum check in to speed it up. Got our room number, a map of the hotel, and all of our other instructions. We began walking to the room, and it was a little overwhelming, the resort is very very big. We carried our own bags, we just thought that would be easier than waiting on them. We got lost along the way, but a nice little security guard saw that we were lost and led us right to our room. We had a poolside deluxe junior suite, but not a swimup room. I definately recommend one of these for the little extra cost that they are. We asked for one at check in but the told us they had none. Six of them below us were empty our entire stay. It was fine though, our room was nice too, and a bit more private. The room was very nice. As far as the shower leaking, well every room in the hotel is like that. It was a terrible design error, there is no shower basin or slope for the water to drain, the shower door is just flush with the floor. Nothing that a few towels did not fix. The room was clean for the most part, except for two open sodas in the mini-fridge and vomit all over the trashcan in the bathroom. The room was cleaned everyday, bar was stocked, plenty of towels all of the time, no complaints there. The buffets were okay, above average for all inclusive buffets. The only problem I had with them is that the were so big. There is one main buffet for lunch and one for dinner for both riviera and sunset. They were always packed, however they never ran out of food. The lines for the cooking stations were always very long. The day after our arrival, I went to make reservations for the speicialty restaurants. I got a reservation every night at a different place, but you will have to be willing to eat at different times. We ate at 10 pm twice, wich was fine we were on vacation. My advice, go to the retaurant not the concierge to make reservations, make them for all the restaurants at that time, they will let you do that and you dont have to wait in line everyday. The italian and mexican were very good. The pools were outstanding. Plenty of loungers, chairs, swim up bars, etc. There are quiet pools and a large party pool in the middle. The resort is so big though, we always felt like we were by ourselves. I went down early and got a tiki hut every day, although I dont think I needed to because they never filled up that fast. The ocean was nice, it was a little rocky for about 3 feet right where the waves cap and crash. Typical. Plenty of chairs, no other resorts around so you didnt have peddlers and walkers all day long. My only downfall about the resort was its size. It was nice to be able to have the privacy, but my gosh did we walk alot. One day I walked from the beach, to the lobby to sign a form, back to the beach and was gone for 30 minutes. I did not have to wait in any lines it just is that big. We got luck and our room was about in the middle so we were equidistant from the lobby (where all of the restaurants are) and to the beach and pools. Although it was private during the day, at night when everyone goes to the lobby/plaza area, it is overly crowded. Hard to get seats, chairs, service, etc. My only other downfall was that if you werent standing at the bar with money in your hand, the bartenders would not wait on you. I have never been around a more hateful group of bartenders in an all inclusive resort. All of the other staff was very very nice, there just wasnt enough of them. Overall, a very nice place, but very big. I think the only thing it is lacking for a five star is the service and personal attention you get at other five stars.

As always, there were a few dents on the road but nothing horrible. Keep in mind that at this point, the hotel is still fairly new, 8 months old, and so more tweeking is needed but I'm sure that it will only get better from here. It's a beautiful resort with friendly staff. We arrived June 1 and although the weather was stormy, the resort was beautiful nonetheless. We got to the resort and had a room ready and waiting. Our room was great, big, spacious, great pool and ocean view with a big cozy lucious bed. The downside though, was our jacuzzi tub in the room wasn't exactly clean. There were marks on the tub, like paint marks which added a gross factor. Asides from that, we were quite content. After settling in our room, we walked around the resort. Very big resort. Takes about 10 - 15 mins to walk from one end to the other. If you don't want to walk, they also have a little train that can give you a ride. Pick up anywhere and drop you off anywhere so it's really convenient. The pools are well kept, lots of beds and chairs and loungers. They have these really cute hut/palapas that you can lounge in which shades the sun and is very very comfortable. We walked our way to the buffet as it was dinner time already. They have four different buffets for breakfast and lunch and two buffets for dinner. The buffet selection was great. There's so much food to chose from. I think there was enough food to feed the entire country. However, compared to Vancouver, the qualtiy of the dishes were not as good but in Mexican standard, it was great. Lots of deserts to chose from as well. After dinner, we walked around the centre court and everynight, they have a band playing there. Great music and very relaxing. There is a bar at the centre court as well but service is a little slow considering the guests to bartender ratio. They've got 7 a la carte restaurants to eat from which you have to make reservations for. Reservations were a hassle as it was hard to get a dinner reservation for an early time so I would advice that you do it once you arrive at the resort to get it out of the way. The concierge service is really slow as there's usually only one person available. We liked La Fleur the most. We also went to La Hacienda, La Vaqueria, Mama Mia and La Fondue. La Vaqueria was the worst as we got sick eating from there but the rest were fine. It's also a great place for kids as they really try to get the kids involved. They have a mini disco just for kids to dance in at night and it's so cute because the kids can go to the bar and order milk and juice! they've got nightly entertainment at 8:30 and 9:30. Two different shows at different times and it's a different show every night. So for the 7 days we were there, we didn't see the same show twice. On saturdays, they allow vendors into the hotel to put up booths at the centre court which is really cute and neat as you get to do a little shopping inside the resort. They've got an \"Animation Team\" which gets the guests at the resort involved with the different activities they have everyday. They've got beach yoga, tequila vollyboll, modelling contests, belly flopping contests, horseshoe toss, archery, etc. All in all, the hotel was great and I had a blast. The staff there are friendly and helpful although sometimes there was a language barrier. I definately recommend this hotel to anyone who's considering.

Some reviewers need to relax.\u201d", "Author": "nwtx0353", "ReviewID": "UR16779567", "Content": "My wife and I arrived on Sun Jun 1 for a 6 night stay. We were concerned about the weather with Tropical Storm Arthur having just been through, but the whole week could not have been nicer. It rained a little on Monday June 2, but we got to relax around the hotel. First let me say that we booked this trip back in February and by the time we left to go, we both were more than a little nervous, what with all the negative reviews. I guess there is a reason my mom always told me to go decide things for myself and not to be influenced by so many others negative feelings. Over the last month , we have read many terrifying reviews here, and found them to be about 95% bunk. Or maybe of the thousands of guests that have stayed (approx 3,000 guests per night since December, that makes approx 540,000 guest nights) since opening, these are 200 or so people who mostly could not possibly be satisfied no matter what. My advice to them. STAY HOME. Let me address a couple of these false issues. First I heard complaints of mosquitos. Hello, it is the Mayan jungle. Get some OFF and be done with it. Then I read \"too much walking.\" May I suggest the Holiday Inn Express! Please. I mean almost 1400 rooms (Riviera plus Sunset) and nothing over 3 floors means a large area. If you don't want to walk, again, please stay home. Then I read that \"you have to pay extra in the Japanese Rest.\" That is just plainly not true. We ate with people at our table with both white and platinum bracelets and everyone got the same free service. No extra charge! Then some reviewer said that the \"Steakhouse\" did not serve steak. That would be true if the Princess had a steakhouse! They have a restaurant named \"The Grill\" that I'm sure some interpreted as steak, but it's just not true. My wife and I had wonderful Lamb Shoulder and Pork Ribs there, but GRP never said it was a steakhouse! Also, lost luggage by airlines, or wrong directions to another place, or bad transportation to and from the airport are not the fault or the responsibility of the hotel. Gripe to your travel agent please. Then, the most amazing complaint of all. Some guests (rude Americans or Canadians I am sure) were shocked, SHOCKED mind you, to find that the residents of a foreign country don't have the common decency to speak English. Of all the nerve! Come on people. We are guests in their country and they are doing their best to show us a good time so that we will grace them with our dollars. If you don't want to put out some effort to communicate with them, then shame on you. To close we found the staff to be extraordinary. If the guest does not walk around with his or her nose in the air and feeling like the staff should bow and scrape to them, but shows them the small courtesies and respect they deserve, then you will be treated like royalty, no matter what room level you puchase. I know that there will be many who will rapidly respond to this positive, encouraging review, to tell you how truly miserable they were while at the GRP. But my wife and I won't see it. Just be comforted in knowing that we plan to go back; that the GRP and its staff are still growing and learning, and be left with the knowledge and satisfaction that those same people who were so miserable in Mexico are probably equally as miserable at their homes.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cPoor Service; Good Deal for Groups\u201d", "Author": "venicegirl", "ReviewID": "UR16770898", "Content": "I am a recent bride who had 100 guests travel to Mexico and stay at the Grand Riviera Maya Princess with me and my groom. We did NOT get married at the resort, as we selected a more intimate venue for our wedding; however, we picked this resort for our group's stay because the very reasonable prices \u2013 which were nearly \u00bd the price of many other of the resorts in the Riviera Maya area - made it possible for many of them to join us. Factoring into my score the price, my complete awareness of the size of the resort when selecting it (I don't see how people can complain about the size of a resort if they chose to stay at the resort in the first place), the prior knowledge that many of the AI resorts that call themselves 5 star in the Riviera Maya area are not actually 5 star, as well as having lowered expectations after reading everyone's negative reviews, my rating is still lower than it would have otherwise been due to the horrible service I received as both a guest and a client holding a private event at the resort. I'll get to my regular (more positive) review further down, but I figured I\u2019d start with the poor service highlights: Check in: Platinum check in started out well with yummy Champagne and no line. The first warning sign should have been that the front desk woman claimed there was no way for her to know if my room had an ocean view or not. We walked to our room (having been on a plane all day) and when we arrived, we found our room overlooked a construction site. As we were responsible for 100 guests booking stays at the resort, 30-40% of whom were staying in Platinum suites and had a private paid event planned on the property, this was infuriating. I spoke to 3 different managers on the phone while waiting 2 hours for the bellboys to deliver our luggage. The first manager said he couldn\u2019t help, the 2nd attempted to get me to pay an extra $50 per night, claiming that was the ocean view rate, and the 3rd told me that they treat all their guests the same, when I asked if he could look into changing my room with that of another of my guests\u2019 (who would have been happy to change with me to make us happy, I\u2019m sure, as I had a few offers later). Completely ridiculous and horrible service! Not only was I upset with not having an ocean view room, but I was upset with the indifference to our business at the resort! After our luggage finally arrived, and we had eaten a little so that I wouldn\u2019t pass out, we spoke to the front desk representative again, and she claimed we could switch in 2 days, but would not give us any notice of this in writing. After complaining to my TA and my father, who spoke with an additional, very sweet and much more accommodating concierge, we switched the following morning to an ocean view room. A-la-carte Restaurants: The 3 a-la-carte restaurants we patronized had poor service for different reasons. The first, the Grill, had unenthusiastic, disgruntled waiters who treated us like we were at a fast food joint when placing our order. It didn\u2019t help that the ambiance of the restaurant was also cold. The second, the Italian, did not honor our reservation for 10 people and split us up into 2 tables, one of 4, and one of 6. Otherwise, they had the friendliest service. The third, the French, had waiters that were completely rude to us, and we had to wait an hour AFTER ordering for our meals to come, while other people who came in after us were served first. Please note that the restaurants were only 1/3 filled at most (despite being \u201cfilled\u201d according to reservations system) so the poor quality of service was even more curious. Planned Event: My inlaws and I had planned a private rehearsal dinner for 100 guests in one of the small conference rooms near the main lobby. Firstly, the wedding/event coordinator didn\u2019t get us the menu prices and options until exactly 1 month prior to our event, even though we had requested these 5 months prior. Secondly, the management was unwilling to offer meal choices between meat and fish, and we had a pretty evenly split group of guests in terms of dietary preferences and needs. We ended up opting for both on one plate. Thirdly, in addition to paying a substantial amount per person for the meal itself, we had to pay a hefty extra fee per person for an open bar for the 2nd hour (we stopped at 2 because of the fees). Ok, so we agreed to all these things because we wanted to have an enjoyable rehearsal dinner, right? Well the night of the rehearsal dinner, there was no visible open bar within the conference room. The wedding/event coordinator claimed they couldn\u2019t put it in the room for some reason (not clear) and that we could simply ask the waiter for our drinks. Since the waiters were only offering wine when coming around to the tables (and the wine at the resort is pretty awful), some of my guests were leaving the room to go to the regular lobby bar to get drinks. I had to announce to my guests that they could order any drink from the waiters. Little good that did \u2013 my now husband and I both ordered a drink, and by the time we had an opportunity to order a second, the waiters told us the bar was closed. That was how fast we were served, to give you an idea. Yet, while serving the food, they rushed us and took our plates away before we were done eating, without even asking. Additionally, the menu included 2 different types of desserts on the table, so that there would be 4 and 4 at an 8 person table. Well, my dad\u2019s table only got one type of dessert, which, unlike the rest of the food, thank goodness, was disgusting and inedible. My dad requested one of the other desserts and the waiter said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u2013 That is poor service! Considering we were ALL PAYING GUESTS of an AI, and thus in theory already paying already for food and alcohol, the idea of paying extra is to pay for the service of having a private event. The fact that the event cost similar to what it would have cost in a like restaurant in the US and the service was so incredibly poor forces me to warn you not to hold a private event at this resort. Other minor details were that they offered welcome drinks on your way into the event, but ran out before we got one. They had a conference room board type sign directing people to the event, but it was next to the conference room door, which you would only see if you already had found the room (which was hard to find), and our names were spelled incorrectly. Their speaker system with music was so full of static that we had to turn it off and eat in silence (well not silence, since we were all talking, but you know what I mean). The positives were that it was convenient to have the event on the property where everyone was staying, that the food was very good, and we and our guests had a great time, listening to toasts and catching up with each other. Just so you don\u2019t think I had a completely horrible time at the resort \u2013 Grounds - For a new resort, I felt the vegetation had grown in pretty well. I had visited the Princess before it opened and comparatively it looked really good. The architecture is tastefully designed compared to many of the other large AIs I've visited in the area, the pools are beautiful, and the courtyard and lobby bars are great meeting/lounge spaces. I didn't notice many mosquitoes, contrary to what I've read on TA; however, I did get accosted by a fumigation cart that seemed to follow me to the lobby one evening around 7 PM. I fear I inhaled a lot of poison. Rooms \u2013 For an AI of the size and price in the area, the rooms were very large and nicely appointed. Nice bathrooms, fairly comfortable bed, and everything else was there as promised.. Our first (construction view room) was decorated wedding/honeymoon style with flower petals and kissing swans, etc., and we had chilled champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us, which would have been wonderful if I wasn\u2019t stuck on the phone for 2 hours with rude staff. Everything worked (although we didn\u2019t try either of our Jacuzzis due to lack of time, so no comments there). I appreciated the toiletries \u2013 which included mosquito repellent wipes (which I didn\u2019t use), a wooden hair brush, and a toothbrush (thank goodness, as I had forgotten mine!) Platinum Lounge/Service \u2013 Computer often available (for when the wireless is flakey). Nice snack bar and bar. Concierge was relatively helpful (especially the one who helped us change rooms!) The carts that take you to the lobby were not very frequent though. We didn\u2019t mind walking when we had the time, but this caused some problems when dealing with getting to the spa or restaurant reservations in a timely manner. Good pool and beach drink service, especially if you tip. Pools - Lots of them so lots of choices based on preference (intimate Platinum, fun activity, quiet regular area near Platinum, multiple swim-up bars, well filtered separate kiddie pool, etc. Easy to find lounge chairs, and no strict towel policy. Beach/Ocean - The beach was white, soft, and sandy - very nice. The ocean was less rocky than I expected - I was able to go in without water shoes and it was clear enough to step around the rocks. Not the most amazing ocean ever, but that is the case with most of the Riviera Maya coastline. Still very pretty. Easy to find lounge chairs and plenty of palapas. Bars \u2013 There was no problem getting whatever alcohol you wanted, although the Platinum areas definitely offered slightly better mixed drinks than the other bars. They were all fun to hang out at \u2013 and the main courtyard bar was the place to be. We had a great welcome cocktail meet-up there with all our guests, no problem! For wine drinkers \u2013 stick to the champagne. Disco \u2013 Fun, cheesy music with guests of all ages dancing \u2013 but the one spot in the resort where smoking was noticeable, which meant we didn\u2019t last long in there. Buffet Restaurants - The buffets near the beach were superior in quality and service (and atmosphere) to the buffets near the lobby, so we stuck those for breakfast and lunch. There were tons of raw and cooked green vegetables and salads, soy milk, legumes, beans, grilled fish, food that make a healthy person happy. Daily fresh grilled/cooked food to order. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 you can also find unhealthy options such as some amazing brioche style French toast, onion rings, guacamole and chips, etc. Very good for an AI! Lots of Mexican food options. A friend ordered off of a menu during lunch at the closer-to-the-beach buffet, so that appears to be an unadvertised option as well! A-la-carte Restaurants \u2013 Despite the horrible service, the food was very good. Portions were very small and lacked vegetables however, so we ended up getting some vegetables at the regular buffet after dinner. Sports Bar \u2013 Heard it was horrible from all my guests, but never tried it. Room Service \u2013 Good food, slow service (order an hour before you want your food), and they got my orders wrong both times. Entertainment \u2013 We saw fire dancers in the courtyard, which were fun, and some sort of cultural Mayan ritual dance, which was less impressive. From our other guests heard that the evening shows varied \u2013 one was excellent with great talent, one was bad with poor talent. Activities - Friends participated in activities, such as kayaking, sailing, beach volleyball, dance lessons, and step classes, but the activities weren\u2019t posted anywhere \u2013 they had to ask the concierge for the information in advance. It would have been nice to have the activities posted. Gym \u2013 Nice, clean, lots of windows and natural light, well air-conditioned, no wait for equipment. Equipment could be more up-to-date, in that there were no TVs on the ellipticals, and only 1 TV for the whole gym. Also, my husband complained that the weights were too light. However, they did offer free classes and I got many good work-outs between classes and the elliptical and treadmill machines. Spa \u2013 Hair and makeup trials were awful, actual wedding day hair and makeup was ok \u2013 not as professional level as I would have hoped for. I had to bring my own makeup due to lack of selection, and my hair fell down in stages throughout the day (it ended up looking natural that way, but it wasn\u2019t exactly planned). One of the hair dressers, I believe named Amara, is far superior to the other one (the 3 people I knew who used the other one had to immediately wash and redo their hair after). Some of my guests loved their massages, others thought they were horrible \u2013 probably up to individual taste. The salon manager, Beate, is very nice and professional; however, she needs to invest in more experienced employees. My guests and I had a really great time together at the Princess, and have talked about a group reunion visit \u2013 but it isn\u2019t a place I\u2019d just go on my own (due to my personal preferences in smaller higher end or smaller more authentic resorts). After visiting many similar hotels in the area (during my site visits), I still feel is a good choice for the Riviera Maya area if the price stays the same and the service improves, and you could certainly have a lovely time there with a group if you plan your stay well (get room numbers quickly, stay in the same building sections, or plan meet-up points). We ran into almost everyone daily and once we knew people\u2019s room numbers, it was easier to make plans.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201c2 Weeks in GRP with Some Challanges\u201d", "Author": "MMK7114", "ReviewID": "UR16768174", "Content": "Fun and Relaxing BUT NOT A FIVE STAR Short Review OK, so I just got home from a two-week vacation at the Grand Riviera Princess. Yes, I read all of the reviews from other vacationers all the way back to Nov of 2007. There is much truth in most of what each and every person has written in their reviews and some that are completely overboard with negativity. So here is the quick version of my review. If you are dependant upon a certain level of service and quality of service like a five star then you have NO business going to the GRP. This hotel is beautiful, with a staff of hard working people who do not have the ability nor the correct level of training or staff to provide this high level of service. If you are the type of person who is willing to monitor and maintain your vacation by making the hotel do what they are supposed to do for you then you will do well at the GRP. I will explain this in the long version of my review. I had several minor and major problems on this two week trip but each time I followed through with the hotel, typically tracking down the hotel manager, they made all things right; except level and quality of service. We had one of our families most relaxing vacations ever at the GRP. Long Version My wife and I were pretty skeptical about the GRP after reading all of the reviews for GRP all the way back to November of 2007. Upon arrival, checked in at the platinum checking in the Riviera side. One thing we forgot to do was print out our travel document showing that we had paid for our two rooms at the platinum suites. The receptionist was very eager to turn us loose on our own to figure out how to print out our documentation. I offered up another alternative, which was I would boot my computer and give them the files to print over a thumb drive. Our check in representative though that was a good idea and we dodged our first bullet. We arrived at 3pm and our room was ready right away, which was room 6218. Having read the horror stories about how long it takes to get bags down to the hotel room, I tipped the bellman a $5 to deliver them right away and he literally followed us down to our room. The room it self was wonderful; I simply can\u2019t say enough about the cleanliness and overall accommodations. Two spa baths; one in the bathroom and one on the terrace over looking the beach. Safe worked fine all 14 days that we were there except when my wife forgot the dam code! Frig was not stocked with premium liquor but that was quickly resolved the very next morning. A major problem we did have was the lack of a free internet connection in our room, which was depicted on the Princess Web site; Fun Jet Web Site and Vacation Express Web site. Knowing I would have problems with this, I printed out the amenities for the hotel from all three sites and took them with me on our trip. Funny thing was the for FEE wireless Internet connection worked fine but you had to purchase an access card from the front desk area for $20 for each 24 hour day. The free Internet did not work and as it would happen, we REALY needed that internet connection, which also acts as a telephone for us via Skype because on the day that we left, my son got into a pretty bad car accident. I requested the internet be fixed in my room to numerous people including the Platinum Staff but nothing happened. After a day or two and making expensive pay phone calls from the front desk area, I tracked down the Hotel manager, Gina, and insisted that she fix it immediately. I walked away thing that it might be fixed in a day or two. In one hour, Gina has two solutions for me. A free pass on the wireless WiFi and a fixed free internet connection in my room which was pretty darn fast! I was blown away! I wished that I did not have to spend so much of my time tracking down the hotel manager but in the end it was worth it. Buffet Food Certainly not anywhere near five star food but it was tasty and in our entire two week trip we never lacked for anything to eat. Other reviews are correct; the food is not hot when you get back to your table. We found the two buffets down by the beach area to be quite nice. Contrary to this we found the two buffets in the main building to be HORIBLE! Long lines, shortages of food; lack of staff; you can\u2019t buy a glass of water or diet coke in these two buffets if you had $10 simply because the staff are too busy cleaning tables and could care less about your drink. Take drinks with you if you want to save yourself some trouble. A La Carts Seafood \u2013 Horrible! Save yourself some time and eat elsewhere. Miso \u2013 Wonderful food and staff. Fondu \u2013 We had a great time here and food was tasty. International \u2013 My family went and two of the three did not like it, my wife liked it. The Grill \u2013 Similar to that pig troff restaurant you have near your house with really bad meat. All in all, the buffets are your best bet. If you are going down to GRP to eat well and different restaurants, save your money and go else where like a true five star. These are just reasons to get out and about; not good food or service or ambience. Pools Oh my God; these pools are amazing in every way. Clean, stylish, swim up bars and of course the normal drunk American (I am American by the way) drunks who shout too loud and drink too much. Best pools ever! We loved the Platinum pool the best, and they are now keeping non platinum members out of the platinum pool area. Private bar and sometimes the bar service people even come out of the building, the hotels claims they will, and even ask you if you want a drink. Beach Beach in now fully covered with shade areas. We never had any problems getting shade at the beach. Beach bar is a joke. Two bar men for 8 billion beach goers but in platinum area, a nice lady come about once an hour to see in you want a drink; no food just drinks. Other reviews are correct; the beach area is shallow and loaded with rocks everywhere. We used our dive booties and had no problems but not the best beach ever. Bars At certain times of the day, getting a drink was as easy as breathing air. At other times of the day, you can\u2019t buy a drink with $100 bill because there are just too many people attempting to get drinks and very few bars open at night. Additionally the bars that are open at night are not properly staffed. Premium bar at Platinum bars only. Staff Most of the staff would do anything for you if they had the time. There were a few like the service staff at the two pool bars that I though should change to a new career because it was quite obvious he and some other no longer liked poring drinks for people. Bas attitudes and walked away from me on more than one occasion without a drink in hand. Tips I brought $100\u2019s in ones down with me because I planned to tip anyone and everyone well so I could get closer to a good vacation. $2 tips for room cleaning worked well; our room was never dirty plus cool towel animals. Tips for food service staff worked well for the most part. If you plan on getting anything to drink at the two large dinner buffets you had better have a dollar or two on the table or you can forget it! The real problem with this hotel is not with the hotel itself; it is the fact that it is severely under staffed for the size of hotel this is and that negatively impacts the quality of service and the level of service any one vacationer can expect to receive. If the management of this hotel were to staff it properly, this hotel would be a five star except for food quality. We had many minor problems along the way but none that were critical to the success of our vacation. If I were any more relaxed, they would be calling me Jello. I rate this hotel a solid three start. I do not think it will ever be a four or five start because of the size of the hotel and because it is owned by Princess, who are not typically in that same five star market as Secrets or Excellence. I would go back only if all other hotels were full.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cGo Somewhere ELSE!!!\u201d", "Author": "sunburnt4", "ReviewID": "UR16704205", "Content": "We just returned from this hotel.

We arrived early in the day, so check in was a breeze. Our room was ready by 1pm, so we were able to check-in early. We tried to upgrade to Platinum, but were told they were booked. What I liked about the resort: -Beautiful resort, we did not mind the large size and enjoyed walking the grounds (we are training for a 20-mile walk in NYC next weekend, so it kept us in shape!) - Our room was nice, clean and cool and was located next to a pool (we were next to the platinum area, so it was nice and quiet). -the wait staff seemed friendly and helpful. They tried their best to please the guests, but I can see why others may feel frustrated with limited English. Luckily, my husband speaks Spanish (just enough to get by), so the staff continually expressed appreciation for him speaking in Spanish. - The bartender in the lobby was friendly and efficient. Even though he was always busy, he attended to the guests as quick as possible (they do have to put up with a constant flow of drunk guests, so you have to give them credit! The last morning he remembered that I just needed hot water for tea! great memory. -The beach was nice and plenty of beach chairs, towels, etc. The water was nice and blue. The restaraunts were nice- the food was well prepared at the Mexican and French (warning VERY small portions), but the Fondue was just O.K. (too much work for me). -The rooms were made up daily and towels stocked daily. My husband put the tip on the bed, which would prompt the maid to change the sheets. Putting a tip in the fridge insured it would be stocked when need. -- What I was excited about was No Bugs in my room. The mosquitoes were very limited and no bug bites the whole time. I wore bug spray the first few days, but did not see a need after that. What needs improvement: -The buffet was average and I agree with the selection being limited. When they ran out of toppings for the omelet bar, that was it- they did not bring any more toppings even though there was another hour left. Food did not always look fresh and was just warm. -The restaurants were always empty, even though everything was always booked (maybe 10 tables with people at them). We ate at the Mexican at 10:00 at night, the Fondue at 9:20, and the Le Fleur at 7:20 (the only early reservation we were able to get). The service was excellent though and the staff really tried to be professional. -The airconditioner in our room made VERY LOUD banging sounds all night long, waking us up throughout the night. One guest actually opened the vent and turned off the blower to stop the banging sound. Then they turned the ceiling fan on to circulate the air at night. We just lived through it, as we had not tools to open the vent. -The fountain outside of my room was not turned on very often, and there for was a potential mosquito hazard. -The staff was not always well informed of local sites. My husband lost his passport and we needed to get to Merida to get an emergency passport. We were given the wrong time for the bus to Merida, wrong driving distance (they said 3 hours- it was almost 5), and wrong fees for the bus (they said $10, but it was $28 each way). We wasted $25 the first morning taking a taxi to the bus station in Playa del Carmen, to find out the bus left at 6:15 am (not 7am), so we had to go the next day. We ended up renting a car and then paid $70 in tolls! The really rip off the tourists. So it took an entire day (4 1/2 hours each way) and over $300 for all expenses by the end of the day. It was a very long day and of course, have could have been avoided if my husband would not have lost his passport! Overall, even with all of the drama surrounding the lost passport. we had a good time. Staff tried to be helpful as possible (just not always accurate). I think everyone that works there tries there best, but they are understaffed, so they are stretched so thin. Making sure to tip the staff often ensures prompt service (they basically work for tips, so please remember this if they do a good job- tip them at least a few dollars daily. The weather was perfect and the staff was friendly. The Cozumel Highlights trip was nice, although due to the rough waters, we could not snorkel in a good area, so it was so-so. Driving the jeeps around the island was fun for my husband, lunch was just O.K., but that is where we suspect we ate/drank something contaminated ( we continue to have GI issues even now that we are home). Do not drink the water off of the resort- this includes ice cubes (this may be the contamination site (-either the ice or the food, we will never really know , but we are still paying for it 4 days later. (NOTE- do not lose your passport- you will be flagged by Immigration when you return to the U.S. (even with an emergency passport) and you may miss your connecting flight! The wait for immigration was 4 hours (since we were U.S. citizens they did move us through as promised in time for our flight. We made it with 2 minutes to spare- very stressful.

Overall, I would say that our stay was a pleasant one. We booked through a travel agent, the flight was quick, and the check in was sort of non-existant for us because in the tour bus on the way to the hotel they had people fill out a short form for the hotel and bracelets and keys for rooms were given out; when we got to the hotel around 10am the guy told us that all our rooms were ready which was a good surprise. we just carried our own luggage and found our room okay. not so hard, although the map was a little confusing. the hotel grounds are beautiful; we liked walking around the huge resort ^ ^. We got a room on the third floor, spacious and nice. Our shower didn't leak. the jacuzzi didn't look so clean so we never used it. although i did notice the safe was a bit suspicious (sticker thing coming off at one of the edges) My boyfriend and i always made sure we never left anything so valuable in there, we carried it with us if we could, and so we had nothing stolen. Rooms were made everyday around 3pm. we had cute towel arrangements. our view wasnt so great though. i would recommend requesting a room that is facing the centre of the hotel. Our agent had called us before the trip and advised us of the construction and asked us if we wanted to move/go to another hotel/or get a refund. we just stuck with it, and the construction didnt bother us so much either. Unless we were in our rooms in the afternoon which we weren't, the sound didn't get to us. the beach is really pretty, i dont think you really need water shoes. The pools are really great too. We had no problem with towels, even if we were getting them late, like at 5pm. No problem with getting beach chairs by the beach or by the pool. we liked the bars, the bartenders always work so hard everyday. yes you have to wait, but it's not like you don't wait for one if you go to a club here, so it didnt bother me. The food at the buffet was really yummy, but definitely not something i expected to find at a 5 star. The a la cartes werent so great either, because we found that a lot of the food were salty. we ate a la carte dinners every night, because i thought they would be spectacular food, but they werent. 2 restaurants had the same soup on the menu...the worst would be at the seafood restaurant and the italian. i had lasagne and it looked and tasted like the frozen ones you can get at grocery stores. miso was good, but cant really call it japanese because i've experienced such good japanese in vancouver i guess. Oh yeah. Reservation for the restaurants went smoothly as well, i would say it took me 5 minutes. we went to playa del carmen 2 times and cancun once. the shuttles to playa fill up quickly, so make sure you get vouchers in advance. the bus is really comfy though, and cooler with air conditinoing than most taxis. we played tennis (i didnt see anyone play tennis during the week we were there lol) you have to go to the concierge and the deposit is $20 which you get back after you return the raquets and the balls. ccheck out was a breeze as well, took 1 minute. because we had to check out at 12pm, they have a storage for our luggage and also the shower facility. at nighttime, there are daily shows and other little stuff like a tiny band playing wonderful music by the bar downstairs or the night market, random fire shows and stuff like that.

No complaint on the food. We thought it was really good. It was the same thing day and night, but still really good. They could change up the menu alittle more. Very buggy. I ended up with sand fly bites or something, really left big scars. I was the only one, so maybe an allergic reaction??? Beach was nice, but noisy. Chain saw all week long, building a wedding chapel.

The positives first,check in was swift only took ten mins. The location is great with a beautiful beach and lovely grounds. Never had any problems getting towels for the beach,but if you want shade when on the beach you need to get down at about 7am to get sun beds with the shade. Booking the restaurants was fine no problems,but i will only recommend two,the itaian and japanese,with the latter ask for the chefs table. Negatives,on our first morning i was awoken at 5.30am as i could here water running, went into the bathroom to find water pouring into our shower though the light fitting it was coming from the room above, went up to lobby to complain was told it would be fixed but guess what it was like that for the two weeks that we where there,on the second day went up to complain about it and showed them a video of the problem and asked if we could be moved and was told there were no rooms left and they would fix it for me,a man came to the room to look at it ,i showed him the video,he left but came back with a pot of paint and panited the celling,so if you get room 6102 i just hope that this problem has been fixed. FOOD,apart from the two restaurants above the food was not to the standard you would expect from a 5* hotel,food in the buffets was the same every day with no variety at all,and it was either luke warm or cold did not get any hot food at all. MAID SERVICE,not good at all room floors not cleaned for the two weeks we were there,we did get clean towels and bedding every day but that was it, not the service you expect from a 5* GETTING YOUR PROBLEMS SOLVED,forget it as nobody seems to want to know and that goes for our rep to. OVERALL SERVICE,was really poor not enough staff for the size of the hotel.

The grounds are beautiful and the room is very nice. We got there pretty early and were checked in quickly. They watched our luggage until our rooms were ready so we could go to the pool and the beach. The breakfast and lunch buffets were good. Lots of fresh fruit and salads. When we went to make reservations for dinner we were told there was nothing available until 10pm the next night. Once we said we would even take one of the restaurants that cost extra they found us a reservation at the seafood place near the beach. This was the worst of the 3 places we ate at. The food was very salty and the waiter who took the order was not very nice. The guy who served our food was great and we all had a good time anyway. La Vaqueria was good and Mamas was a little better. However, they were all less then half full so we're not sure why it was so hard to get reservations. There is no information in the rooms about the hotel so you have no idea what's going on. The restaurants require men to wear pants for dinner but you don't know that until you get there so all our guys had to run back to the room to change. The place still needs alot of work and I believe they are short handed which is why they couldn't accomodate more then a few diners at a time.

Had it just been my husband and I, we would have left to stay somewhere else. Some of our other observations include: Check In - They put all of us in 4 rooms with king beds even though we requested two double-beds. We requested them to change one of the rooms which took them two days. The first attempt with concierge to get a golf tee-time took over an hour and we still had to return the following day. If you're golfing, make plans before you get there. Rooms - The biggest complaint about the room was the shower leaking and an exposed electrical outlet which our one year old shocked herself on. It was obvious that they hurried to get the hotel built and sacrificed the craftsmanship. Food - We tried to make reservations at the a la carte restaurants and they were always booked until ten. We were able to walk-in on a cancellation and found that only half the tables were in use, while the employees claim they cannot seat you. It was apparent they did not have the staff to operate the a la carte restuarants (or the resort as a whole). The buffet food was decent but the service was terrible.

Check in was smooth, as we were in a small van arriving instead of a large bus of people headed to the same place. We were in a Jr. Deluxe Swim Up, and it took maybe 20 minutes for the bags to get to our room. The room was fine, no real issues. No dressers, but there are some shelves and hanging space in the closet, and under the tv. As many people recommended, we put towels against the bottom of the shower door and had no problems. A towel in the door jam of the room also seemed to keep the few bugs out. THE GOOD: Swim up room was great. We were close enough to the party pool to hear what was going on if we wanted to, but not too close. The volleyball net for Tequila Volleyball was right by our room. Pretty entertaining! The a la cartes were pretty good, especially the Teppan table at Miso! Make sure to ask for it specifically, highly recommended. We also went to La Fondue and La Hacienda. The animation team was great and tried to change things up instead of the same old same old every day. Most of the staff was very friendly and we heard holas all the time. As you have heard many times, the pools are awesome, and the grounds are beautiful and VERY well maintained. It's like Disney with people constantly picking up trash and tending to the landscaping. Free shuttle into Playa is nice - Take advantage! The town is beautiful. THE BAD: Even though I provided a copy of our marriage cert at check in, we never got the honeymoon package. It was not for lack of trying, as I asked about it at least 5 times in 7 days. At one point, they told me that it had already been delivered and would not believe me when I said they were wrong. Buffet food does get old, so book your a la cartes ASAP! They do fill up fast, which stinks. Service at the buffet was most often HORRIBLE. Bring your own water bottle because often we were halfway through the meal before we got a drink. We even were sat at someone else's table once. They were not pleased when they came back from the buffet! Unless you are bringing your own computer, it is nearly impossible to get on the internet. There were originally 3 computers, but one has been broken for a while, and it does not seem like too many people adhere to the 30 minute limit. I know that people can use their time as they wish, but it's frustrating to see a room full of people waiting while a 12 year old plays an online game! I will wrap this up, but all in all, it was a nice place. We are easy going people, and the little things started to wear on us by the end of the week, but it did not ruin our vacation in the least.

My boyfriend and I (from Toronto, Canada) are in our late 20\u2019s and went on vacation to relax and enjoy ourselves, not so much for the party (but there was plenty of that for those who are looking to \u201cparty party\u201d). I felt like I had to post a review since there are so many negative reviews on here. All in all, don\u2019t listen to the complainers. These people are more than likely never satisfied and are spending their \u201cvacation\u201d looking for things to go wrong so they can come on here and complain about them. I wanted to address a few of the negatives that I have seen on here that have really, REALLY bothered me and made me want to write this review\u2026 1) Resort is too big (i.e. 20 minute walk from their room to the lobby) \u2013 BULL, the walk from the beach (furthest point) to the lobby was 10 minutes at a slow place AT MOST. These people must be obese, lazy pigs who don\u2019t ever exercise to complain about something so ridiculous. These are probably the same people who piled on the fries, fried potatoes, hot dogs and other junk on to their plate morning, noon and night and then wondered why they didn\u2019t have the energy to walk around this beautiful place. I personally (along with everyone we met on our trip) loved the walking. It\u2019s a form of exercise when all you are doing is lounging/relaxing and eating for most of the day. 2) Bugs/mosquitoes \u2013 We stayed on the ground floor in room 7043 and didn\u2019t see a single bug in our room all week. Yes, I got one or two mosquito bites when I sat around the lagoon until 4 a.m. one night, but this was to be expected and didn\u2019t bother me in the slightest. I brought bug spray and didn\u2019t need to use it once. 3) Bad Food \u2013 Couldn\u2019t be more untrue. I have stayed at 3 other All Inclusive resorts (Cuba, Dominican and Cancun) and this one had by far the BEST food of them all. The food was hot and very tasty and there was always a good selection. And yes, there was a different selection daily. Those who say there wasn\u2019t were the ones who consistently ate fries, burgers and tater tots which were always in the same spot. The fruit and vegetables were incredible and the meat and fresh made-to-order pasta were also fantastic. Breakfast had everything you could think of and we loved the fresh soups that changed at every meal, every day. 4) Problems booking reservations \u2013 This is the craziest thing I have ever heard. We arrived late Thursday night and we went to book our reservations at 10 a.m. on the Friday. We made 4 reservations without any issues at all. We wanted to eat at the buffet the other nights so we could take our time and go for dinner when we felt like it. Plus the buffet was great too! Booking these reservations took us about 3 minutes and there was not a single person in line when we got there. We were amazed that there were people complaining about this! The al la cartes were awesome. We ate at the Grille, Italian, Mexican and International, all were great and the service was quick and friendly, so friendly. We always left a big tip because we were so pleased with everything. Other people we met ate at all of the other restaurants and had no complaints. They loved them all! The resort is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are stunning, like nothing I have ever seen. We had absolutely no problems with check-in or check-out (took about 5 minutes for check-in and about 1 minute to check-out) and the service we received was incredible (and we were just regular, non platinum guests). Tip a little and it goes a long way! We went to the disco twice and had a great time. The music was great, the bar service was fast and it was packed on both the Saturday and the Monday that we went. Very good times! We also went to the gym twice and it was perfect, lots of machines, weights, etc. it was really big and nice. Someone one here complained about it\u2026.what a tit! I would recommend the Tulum Adventure. We paid $96 each and saw the ruins, went ziplining, rapelled, snorkeled in a gorgeous cave and had a BBQ lunch and felt this was more than worth the cost. We actually wish we had done this adventure earlier on during our stay because we probably would have booked more of them had we known how great it would be. I really have nothing bad to say about this resort. The negatives were so minimal and non-important that they really aren\u2019t worth mentioning. Hopefully this will help those of you who are hesitant to book at this resort. I would recommend it to family and friends and we will return ourselves I am sure. In fact, I have already recommended it to anyone who will listen! Best time ever!!!

I refuse to get nit-picky about insignificant details as we look at the big picture. Our check in went fine, but we asked about an upgrade and were told immediately that there were no other rooms available. The staff was not fluent in English at all and I think saying \"No\" was an easy out for not having to communicate. We checked in on time, our room was ready, and off we went - us on foot and our luggage was transported by shuttle. The delivery staff were very courteous and helpful in explaining all the amenities of the room. But, they did fail to explain one of the most important details of all - how to get the electricity to work. A couple of lights came on with switches and the refrigerator was running, but nothing else would work. So, I called the front desk and they sent someone right over. What they failed to explain was that you use your room card in a slot by the door to activate the electrical system. This makes a lot of sense as nothing unnecessary runs while you're out of your room. The workmanship in the rooms wasn't the greatest, but we do not plan on investing in it as real estate, only as a guest. Based on that, the rooms were beautiful. Yes, the drainage in the showers was not totally directed toward the drain, but a towel fixed that problem in a jiffy. The walk to the beach was rather long, but who minds walking down paths winding through beautiful pools, gardens and scenic views of the various buildings. Besides, there were a couple of bars along the way to quench your thirst. The pools were all saltwater filled, very clean and toasty warm. There was never a lack of seating whether you wanted sun or shade. We even enjoyed poolside palapas with queen mattresses a few of the days. The beach was beautiful. Yes, there was a pebble here and there, but overall the white sand was well maintained, there was an abundance of lounges, palapas and palm trees intermixed for a more natural, tropical setting. The ocean was brilliant shades of greens and aquas. It is best to have water shoes if you plan on adventuring out into the water. A real plus for the resort was the beverage service. This is the only resort we've been to (out of 6 trips to the Riviera Maya) that delivers your gin & tonic, water, Dirty Monkey, or Margarita right to your lounge. They were always cheerful and did not expect any tips, but there was with a grateful \"Gracias\" and a smile with any donation . Believe me, in the heat of the day, they earned every peso!!! The drinks were all good, but we found that the closer you got to the lobby, the better the drinks were. Beach, pool, then lobby bar - good, better, then best. Mosquitoes were a problem, but that's why they make insect repellent. There were more mosquitoes in the rooms at night than we saw all day outside. Staff will bring you a can of Raid if requested. The walls did get quite spotted from swatting the little critters, but then again - you're in a warm, humid climate and that's just part of the package. The buffets were very consistent with a good variety of food all the time. They paid close attention to maintaining proper food temperatures which was reassuring. We went to the Mexican restaurant (La Hacienda) and had a fairly good meal. We tried the Italian Restaurant. It took 30 minutes to even get a menu, then another 10 minutes for a glass of water. Then another 15 minutes for them to take our order, then another 30 minutes to get our food. We were starved by the time our food arrived so we thought anything would taste good. I had a pizza. Good, but not something to write home about. Two others had spaghetti which was barely edible; and the 4th person had Cannoli which was NOT edible. After spending 1-1/2 hours in the restaurant and not one server offering us more water or checking on how things were, we got up and walked out. We knew the buffet was good, so we wound up eating a late dinner there. The last restaurant we visited was the Japanese. While half of the experience is to enjoy the chef's show and the other half was for the food, we felt this one was still worth trying. Our chef must have been somewhat inexperienced, spilling half of the stir-fry veggies when the tray hit the counter. He really felt bad and that set the tone for him the rest of the night. His show has more comedy than the awe-factor. Still, enjoyable for show and food. Sure can't get this at Applebee's so it is still worth the time. The only real gripe we had about the resort (and we please very easily since we could either be on vacation in Mexico or back home at work!!!) was the HVAC system in the room. There was a loud clunking sound every few minutes the first couple of nights, so we reported it to maintenance. Someone must have attempted to quiet it, but after another day or so, the metal clunking noise returned. We got used to it as time went by, but it was still aggravating in the middle of the night. The refrigerators were stocked everyday, but even with leaving a few dollars a day and asking for extra water and Coke, we never received it. Again, not a problem what with ample bars throughout the resort. The room cleaning staff was not always on a great schedule. Some days our room was cleaned in the morning, while one day it wasn't every cleaned until 7:00 at night. Nevertheless, we had clean linens and a stocked frig everyday. There are separate crews for beverage stocking and room makeup. I must say the beds were extremely comfortable, the bathrooms were awesome (and we had just a standard room). We never had any problems with the safe or the TV like other reviews mentioned. We were quite concerned with their insect control program. While enjoying icy cold gin & tonics in the lobby bar one evening, we heard a small, low flying plane buzzing the resort. Within a few seconds we could smell and taste a chemical in the air. My husband's lips tingled and the rest of us had watery eyes for a while. Upon inquiring with the concierge, we were told they were spraying for mosquitoes with a plane flyover. I asked what insecticide they used and he had no idea. We never felt any further effects from the spray, but still it was a little worrisome at the time it happened. There is a lot at the resort that is not completed, but it had absolutely no effect on our stay there. We are anxious to try this resort again in a couple of years after they deal with their growing pains. We highly recommend this resort if you want beautiful surroundings, nice rooms, good food and an awesome beach with cool drinks abounding where ever you go. We hated to leave on day 9, so that tells us it was well worth the trip and will return some day.

The worst part of our experience happened at the airport. We went to the assigned tour company with another family and were told that did not have vouchers but it would be OK, the tour bus would stop at our hotel 2nd. After the 1st dropoff, the driver drove right by all the signs clearly marked \"Princess Hotels.\" At this point, we had endured a 1-hour flight delay and 2 hours in Mexican customs. Our two-year old had hardly eaten anything all day and it was 6:00 PM. We asked the driver if that was our dropoff but he did not speak English (!). He ended up driving to the 3rd dropoff an hour south of the hotel because he didn't have our vouchers. He tried to drive the wrong way after that and only pulled over after we all yelled at him. We eventually got to our hotel at 8:30 PM (a 3-hour ordeal) but it was so traumatic that I will never take another tour bus again. After you spend that much money on a vacation, it is not a big deal to spend $30 to have a cab take you directly to your destination. I cannot recommend this enough. The Grand Rivera Princess is a beautiful hotel and travelers' photos have accurately shown what it looks like. There is one person handling check-ins and it truly takes 20+ minutes per check-in. I saw the same person doing this every day that we stayed at the hotel. Thanks to a previous arrangement through my travel agent, we were lucky to get upgraded to a Platinum room and I highly recommend the upgrade. However, we did not get the king bed or 2nd floor that we requested. Of course, they called 3 days later to ask if we wanted to move (this tactic is done by most hotels on purpose). The room was very nice but the shower does leak and there are bugs. Don't turn off the A/C in your room, it will smell terrible if you do! I made that mistake and it took a good two days plus a ton of Lysol spray to clear it up. Also, no one has mentioned this in their reviews that I read but the rooms do not have dressers in them. I did not have anyplace to put my clothes that didn't need to be hung up and it was a pain to literally live out of my suitcase for a week. We brought DVDs for our child which do not play in the DVD player. You must rent a \"Spanish\" (but English speaking) DVD from the concierge for $20 which they return to you when you are done with it. All the pools were great and it was fun to meet other families with small children at the baby pools. Hint: all the Platinum lounges have lots of towels. The towel stations by the big pools ran out every morning 1/2 hour after they opened, and I saw dozens of people waiting for them. Just take them from the platinum pool area. The ocean was beautiful and we loved that our room had a jacuzzi tub outside, when we were done with the ocean we just put our daughter in the outside tub to clean all the sand off which kept our inside bathroom free of sand. The food was a big disappointment and the service lacking at every meal. We tipped everyone at every meal and I didn't see anyone else doing this, however, it resulted in the same poor service so kind of a waste of our money I think. The Platinum lounge and concierge were great. Our favorite bartender was James (\"James Bond\"). The Electric Lemonade cocktail was awesome. We did not get to eat at the Italian specialty restaurant but the guests we talked to all loved it and recommended it the most. Like all the other reviewers, we didn't understand that the specialty restaurants were \"full\" so we could only get into 3, and when we actually ate there they were 1/2 empty. We concluded that it was simply because they are understaffed. It seemed to us that they marketed the hotel mostly in Canada, and when people arrived, they weren't prepared for it. Bottom line, the purpose of our trip was to relax and have our daughter enjoy the ocean and pools. We got this but for the money we paid, we do not plan to return because of the lack of service and food. However, we love the Rivera Maya and highly recommend the Riu Palace in Playa Del Carmen.

Like most, we had been reading up on the reviews and were worried as to what to expect. We needn't have. Yes, it is a brand new hotel so there are teething problems and there is a bit of construction work ongoing however we were lucky enough that it did not interfere with our holiday one little bit. The hotel was fantastic; absolutely loved it. Check in was very quick around 5 mins in total. Our luggage was delivered to our room after 5 mins too. We stayed in a junior suite which overlooked the wonderful gardens and lagoon. The room was immaculate; mini bar was fully stocked as it was all fortnight, had a lovely bathroom and a huge bed, no problems with the air conditioning. We used the safe at all times and never had any problems whatsoever. Maid service was good too; they made the loveliest towel animals and spread petals. The pools are gorgeous and there was always plenty of sun loungers; only issue with them was people leaving their litter about the place, disgusting. Pool bars are great but get really busy, definitely get served quicker if you have tipped. The beach was gorgeous and very big. Again people leaving litter can spoil the effect. The sea was rocky but be careful and you will be fine. Beach bar was great, prompt service. All the bars we used in fact were pretty good; the sports bar is great for quick snacks if you skip lunch or anything. The bar outside the fondue restaurant is great. The bartender Jorge works doubly hard from the others and is very entertaining without knowing it. There is a good coordinated entertainments programme should you wish to participate and entertainment at night. On a saturday night there is a market in the main courtyard. There are 5 restaurants available for you to dine in when staying in a junior. We had reservations at 4 but cancelled 2 as we didn't like the food on the menu. We ate in the mexican which was fantastic. The ambience was great, the food was delicious and the staff top marks. We also ate in the italian, food was nice but as I did not eat all my starter the waiter was horrible to me all night.lol. I did not get any top ups on drinks whatsoever whereas my husband was constantly receiving more and bread rolls. We thought it was a joke to begin with but judging by the looks I was receiving it wasn't. This was our only negative experience in the hotel. The buffet restaurant was fantastic. Thats where we ate all the time basically. The staff were efficient and friendly and the food was so varied; always fresh and delicious. Whether it be breakfast, lunch or dinner there was always something my partner and I liked (I'm a fussy eater). The staff throughout the holiday were lovely.

I know its a new hotel but please stop making this an excuse for the problems its having. Princess resorts is a worldwide company with enough experience to operate a 5 star hotel. Look at the price of Moon Palace & other quality 5 Star resorts in the area to see why your getting 3 star service, your paying 3 - 4 star prices. One of the many problems were the lack of stafff in the bars and restaurants. We booked with Thompson which allowed us unlimited use of the al la carte restaurants, but it was difficult to get a time you wanted, let alone a restaurant, and when you were dining they were only half full because of the lack of staff, the waiters did try hard but had too many tables to tend to. The pools are great, the jacuzzi's are lovely ( when they bother to turn them on ) . The grounds are pretty, the beach is fine but you do need beach shoes for going in the sea. We went with friends for 2 weeks and both had a Junoir Suite Deluxe, we didn't have the lounge furniture in the room we were supposed to have, the minibar wasn't restocked every day, coffee & toiletries weren't replenshed every day. On two seperate occasions our rooms were not even serviced until after 9.30pm after spending 3-4 hours complaining. I have travelled all over the world, in all types of accomodation from 1 star single room in Greece to real 5 star hotels and i have never not had my bed made before. We were told this is a very rare occurance but the very same thing happened to our friends. The Concierge was helpfull about information but tried to fob you off when you had a complaint.

I came home married and tanned and that is all I really cared about HOWEVER looking back I really do have some serious issues with the hotel, the food and the staff....my wedding day went well, the preparation before hand not so much, the restaurant that we booked for the wedding, which was given to us as a choice was closed the night we were married, which we didnt find out until one day prior to the wedding, the coordinator for the hotel then told me that I had to choose another restauraunt which by that time we had eaten at them all (more on that later) and I did not want to be intside so I asked to have it on one of the patios, at the restauraunt and was told this was not possible and was not given a reason...luckily due to my wonderfully agressive and former wedding planner of a best friend, within 10 minutes we were meeting with the GM of the hotel and his assistant and were then set up on the beach, granted with 200 other people that were there for a party but in the end, it was good, the barbeque was great, the cake they provided was to die for, we were able to order wine off the menu and everything went off without a hitch.... Check in was 1/2 hour per person and if it werent for the Champagne they pumped you with when you walked in and checked in (the Platinum Suites provides you with this) I would have snapped, being a bride I just stepped aside and let my fiance and my Mom deal with it. The staff was very friendly and welcoming but the language barrier was not what it should be at a check in desk and it seemed to me like no one knew what they were doing and constantly were looking to each other for assistance.... We went with 12 of the best people and best friends and family so this was what made my trip aside from my wedding. The food - to put it midly was not good. Never hot. Yah not good. But it is about standards, I like good food, I like hot food, I dont like buffets - yes, you go to an all-inclusive and there are buffets this I was aware of, HOWEVER, I have eaten at 5 star buffets and 5 star restaraunts many times, this hotel is labelled a 5 star - the food is no where near it. Trust me. Depends again, on standards....Each one of us with the expeption of 1 of us was extremely sick one day of the trip - 2 of which people specifically took medicine before and during the trip to avoid getting sick - these two were the sickest of us all.... The restaraunts were clean and nice but are more like giant blank rooms of marble and are all the same shape, size and feel. And cold. you have to experience it first hand to understand what I am saying. You can see the different themes they are trying to achieve but again, I think that if you are more used to cozy intimate dimly lit romantic 5 star restaraunts and not a bright large cold cattle call type of idea, you would not appreciate them. BUT for what it was, I had fun, you make it what it is, we drank lots of wine and tested lots of different food. The pools. Amazing. Nothing more to say. The VIP pool in the Platinum area which is where we stayed was outstanding. The service there for drinks was amazing, the coffee bar was good, there was always someone there to assist you, fresh fruit etc...the Platinum conceirge was great, always there, spoken fluent and understandable English - was always content in that regard. The beach was amazing. The Platinum area of the beach is roped off, and there are serves that serve drinks not food. There is nothing open on the beach for food, just drinks. There is a little hut on the beach that is a bar, it is convenient. The water is amazing, a little rocky in areas but nothing like described, no you do not need aqua socks...and you can go out very very far until it actually gets deep. There was construction going on at the hotel (and beach area)so you are laying by the beach and you hear a chain saw for about 1-3 hours of the day - not exactly relaxing....the resort is still very much under construction.....at night they would burn wood to keep the bugs away while they worked so it smelt like fire... The bugs - bring bug spray - I had little bites all over me the whole time but again you are in the jungle so I would assume this to be expected anywhere you go not just at this resort....but the area in general. The rooms - well they are very nice, very well laid out and new looking, our shower leaked and our sliding door didnt lock. Again I think that this is just being a new hotel there are going to be little problems like this. We went to Playa one day and spent the day, getting there was a 30 dollar cab ride for a van that fit 6 of us and it was easily arranged. I utilized the spa the day of my wedding for a pedicure and it was very nice and I would recommend using the spa. Some of our party had massages as well - they both have different reviews, one enjoyed and one didnt - again expectations I am sure. Check out was easier then check in but still was slow and the language barrier still existed even though there was a shift change. I would go back to the Mayan Riveria area of Mexico, I would not go back to this hotel specifically, I am sure in due course the service, food quality of the grounds will improve as it continues to get up and running - all in all I had an amazing vacation and wedding....I would just suggest you go with an open mind, tip well and not let the little things get to you.", "Date": "May 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGood Times were had!\u201d", "Author": "kelleysweeney", "ReviewID": "UR16296750", "Content": "I just got back from a great trip!

I just wanted to let people know what I thought of the resort. I got back last night, May 19, 2008. I was there for 8 days/7 nights. First, I will go through all the positives. The resort is gorgeous! The landscape is beautiful even though its still new. The beach is large but very pretty. And it's nice because you're not sitting on top of another hotel like if you stay in Cancun. There are like a thousand pools,bars, restaurants, and things to do. We ate at Miso, La Vaqueria, and Mamma Mia's. Miso was awesome, La vaqueria was fine(not the kind of food I like so I'm not the best one to ask), and Mamma Mia's was good. The buffets were fine, the typical all inclusive buffet. I thought there were plenty of selections and the food was always warm when we were there. Usually anywhere from 7-9. La Tortuga down by the beach is the best for breakfast. We didn't eat lunch much, usually we were too busy hanging out at the beach or the activity pool. The rooms are nice and clean. The first room we had was a junior suite. It was big and neat. The beds are very firm so if you like soft beds hears a heads up. Okay here is the flaw I was talking about. On Thursday we noticed there was water leaking from the light fixtures in the bathroom above the toilet and shower. It started out just dripping but ended up being more of a steady stream by later in the day. We called the concierge and informed them of the problem. We called at around noon and off to the pool we went. When we returned to the room around 4:00 no one had been there but low and behold the phone rings. It's the front desk letting us know that someone will be there in 10 mins. And in 10 minutes there was a knock on the door, it was a maintenance guy who didn't speak very good english. My friend showed him the problem, he made a phone call, left and then the phone is ringing again. It's the concierge wanting to know if the problem had been resolved I told her no and she said would you like to switch rooms. Of coarse I said yes and off to the lobby we went. They upgraded us to a deluxe junior suite with a pool view. Right across from the activity pool, our favorite place! I was impressed with how they handled the situation. We loved the new room and had no other problems. Overall, I thought the craftmanship was lackling slightly. But this DID NOT in anyway put any kind of damper on my vacation. You have to remember that this is Mexico, it's very humid and construction is different there. The staff was wonderful. They always say \"HOLA\" when they walk by and were always helpful. But not all of them speak very good english. Again that is in no way a bad review. I have to mention of few of the staff......... Ruth at the plaza bar was superb and a great waitress, Jose the bellboy(who helped us when we got there and when we switched rooms) was fast, a peach, and helpful. Of coarse I can't forget the Animation staff. They are absolutely awesome people....... I give them alot of credit they are energetic all the time and always smiling. I did get to talk to a few of them and they all love their jobs and work extremely hard with long hours. So to Josue(absolute sweatheart), the DJ(Braulio), Poncho, Carlos, and Isidro keep up the great work, it's much appreciated and you guys really made our trip unforgettable and all around the best time. We are already looking into booking another trip there within the next few months. Keep this in mind, the resort is HUGE. I am not saying this is a bad thing. I'm just letting everyone know that there is alot of walking. I looked at it as \"I'm on vacation so I don't have to power walk\". The disco is fun at night, but some nights it's more packed than others. The plaza bar is also great to sit, have a drink, and listen to the jazz music after dinner. Also, some nights they have shows there. We went to one of the shows in the theatre, we missed the beginning of it but still thought it was great. Okay, on to the beach. The ocean has about a 2 foot portion when you first walk in that is rocky then it gets better. The water isn't that deep for a ways out which was nice. However, beware there are large boulders that you have to watch out for. Okay I know I'm missing alot but this is really getting long. All in all I will definiately go back and remember it's vacation if you worry about everything you're not going to have fun.

We arrived and received excellent service at check-in. Our suitcases were held while we went to get a room. We were \"upgraded\" to a deluxe junior suite (has a jacuzzi tub). When we got to the room, we had NO AIR CONDITIONING! I can deal with alot, but could not deal with the hot room. I tried to ignore it, thinking that this was a problem with everyone, only to find out that others had air. After calling down to the desk 5 times, being ignored, we finally went down to the lobby to get another room. They told us NO... that we had to stay in the room that was 95 degrees... We told them NO. After calmly telling them that we needed another room for medical reasons, we got another room. (recommended: STAY CALM!) The food: The buffet is terrible. Rarely did I find any hot food. I was worried about getting sick, so I stuck to the fried potatoes and non-meat items. There is a snack bar that serves hamburgers, hotdogs and nachos. That was the best place to get food. It was cooked properly, and hot. The hours for lunch were crazy - they didn't open the buffet until 12:30. Another hamburger for me at the snack bar. I went to Mama Mias... it was good. the minestrone soup is tasty. The service is extremely slow. The pools were absolutely beautiful!!! This was the best part about the place. The bar at the pool had great service. I only wish they stayed open past 5:00. (They really should keep it open at least until dusk). The hotel is WAY TOO BIG... and growing. To get from the lobby to the beach - long walk. To get from my room to the lobby - long walk - to get to food - long walk - to get to bar - long walk. EVERYTHING IS FAR! You get a balcony, but unless you upgrade to platinum, you can't see the beach from your room. You will either get a courtyard or construction view. (we had both of these views... one with air conditioning.) The safe... I gotta wonder about it. On every safe, the tab has been pulled up, and I wonder if they can easily get into it. We didn't have a problem, but also did not let them into our room except one time. Grab towels any time you see them. They only left us 2 small white towels in the room. The towel shed was always out when I walked by. I got them in the open cloak rooms. I still had a good time, despite the issues with the hotel. I was because of our group that we had fun. We made our own fun. I would never go back to this hotel. I would not recommend it to anyone after having to go without air for 2 days, and having to eat cold food that should be hot.

The resort is incredible with gracious and hospitable staff . We were fortunate to stay in the Platinum area of the resort which allowed us to not only develop relationships with the staff but meet other Platinum guests. One of the 'perks' of being a Plantinum guest was the ability to book 'ala carte' restaurants for every night if we wished. We ate at the Japanese (twice), Mexican, Grill, and Italian. The food and the service at the Japanese and Italian were incredible. I did not eat my meal at the Mexican restaurant (I just didn't like the taste) and my husband and brother in law did not enjoy their meals at the Grill but my lamb was delicious. We too, as others that we met on our trip, were nervous after reading the reviews...but were pleasantly surprised that very few of these were realized. Were there mosquitoes? Of course there were but very few. The majority of the staff were pleasant and always willing to please...were there others that didn't really care...of course there were. It did look like the final touches on the rooms were rushed to get the resort open but they didn't hamper our stay. Not every room had all things that were advertised...but again nothing that disrupted our vacation. Having a jacuzzi on the balcony was the best ever...when my husband and brother in law took their afternoon siestas (a MUST, by the way) I soaked in the tub looking out at the ocean...it doesn't get much better than that. The Platinum Lounge was great...24 hr concierge, lots of snacks (constantly replenished), liquor/refreshments, cappacino machine, free internet and an incredible pool with great chaise loungers. As I said we met other wonderful travellers and hope to stay in touch. What I was appalled at was the lack of appreciation by so many guests when it came to the staff. Hello people, this staff should not be treated as your personal slaves...they are people who work hard for minimal pay. They survive on tips and should be rewarded for going 'above and beyond' for you. Remembering how you take your coffee or what wine you prefer...keep in mind how many people they serve every day. For the people who whine about the 'starkness' of the resort, or complain that all the statues were not finished, state of the mangroves. Stay home.

Before we took off to our vacation/wedding at GRP, I've read almost all of the reviews and posts on this forum. I knew what to expect and what not. Thanks Goodness for this forum, our trip turned out pretty good. I hardly write reviews but since I've spent so much time on this resort, I decide to write one. Ok, here it goes.. The hotel grounds: beautiful. Nice landscape. Require LOTS of walking or waiting time for shuttles. Front desk/check in: We booked Platinum so our check in was an ease. Nacho, the front desk rep. handed us cold towels and champagne as we checked in. Nice touch. We requested for oceanview room, got oceanview room with no problem. Didn't have to tip. However, we didnt get the 2nd or 3rd floor as requested. We didnt care much. We got our bracelets the time we checked in, around 12pm. Our room was ready by 2:30pm. Not bad on timing. Our oceanview room # 5019: Our room was beautiful. We can see the ocean clearly from the patio. Patio was huge with jacuzzi and 2 lounge chairs, tables with 2 chairs. Our bathroom didnt have leak issues. We were happy with our rooms. However, it has funky smell. I assume it's the ocean breeze. We got our gifts (bottle of tequila and nice snacks) the first and 2nd day. That was nice. Room & mini bar service: Room service was ok. I'm a little confused about this. The first night I left $2 for the maid in the room, she didn't take it. I was impressed. She did clean our room well. The next day, I tipped the maid (short hair) in person and our room got clean well. The day after, a different maid came in our room right when we were about to leave, so I tipped her 2 bucks. When we got back, our room was almost the same-uncleaned. She only picked up the towels and replaced w. new ones. Our sheets were damped! I was ticked so I didnt leave any tip the next day. Surprisingly, our room got cleaned extremely well with towel arts. I notice that whenever the short hair maid(dark skinned) clean our room, it was perfect. So, just make sure you know which maid really work hard and tip them accordingly. the safe: we didnt have any issue. We also didn't leave much..just 10 bucks in it. We left everything in our luggage and locked them up. If you use the safe, be careful. We found that the safe can be opened with magnet key. mini bar service. not impressed. Our fridge didn't get stocked the first 3 days we were there. I called the concierge 5 times, that didn't help. So we gave up. We just went to the platinum bar for water and drinks. food: above average. We loved the Miso, The grill (la vaque.. something), Mama Mia, and absolutely loved the Le Fleur. We had our wedding reception at Le Fleur and it was beautiful. We had our own room. We hated The Seafood and the Fondue. Bad food..really bad. Buffets were better than these two. We loved the breakfast buffet. However, by the 4th day I was tired of eating the same thing every morning. I thought the lunch and dinner buffets were good, but again, same thing every day-lunch same as dinner. Food at the sport bar was awful! The hamburger smelled like rotten meat. Service: For God's sake, please tip those waiters, waitress, bartenders, maids. They work so hard to please you. I've seen so many people don't care to tip and I feel so bad for them workers. We always had good service at all the restaurants we ate at. The buffets, well, it's buffet so I guess service was not too attentive. We tip anyway.. The only time we didn't tip was when no one ask us anything from the time we walked ourself to our table to the time we walked out. Liquors: Awesome. There selections are pretty good. We loved mojitos, mango margaritas, miami vice, and of course tequila shots. Beach: Not the best beach, but very nice. Rocky, so we wore water shoes all the time. I find that the beach to the South (on your right if you're looking at the ocean) is much nicer. If you walk a little south you'll find some nice clear blue water. Beach bar: There's only one on the riviera side. Not too convenient. I didn't like this fact. Had to walk quite a bit to get a drink. Saving chairs at the beach: Urgh! I hated it. I had to wake up at 7am every day to go save us some shade, but hardly did I get a good spot. Disco club: They actually play very good music. However, there were lots of smoke. Live band: They have live band every night around 9-10ish on the 1st floor lobby. It was nice. Very talented artists. Shows: starts at 9:30pm everyday. We saw the musical show and the variety show. Both were awesome. Strongly recommend them. Wedding: The setting was beautiful. Everything was planned as requested, and a little more. I had issue with Damarys due to her lack of responses, but surprisingly she did a great job. If anyone has any specific questions I'll be happy to answer. Some tips for people who book platinum..or other category: -book your dinner all at once. They dont have many options open so get them while they're available. -ask for your massage voucher/ bag/ ect to the concierge. They dont hand them to you. You have to remember what is being promised to you. -bring water shoes -bring comfortable shoes -men- bring long pants for a la carte restaurants. -becareful with marble floors. I felt on the stairway at the lobby due to slippery. One woman felt and broke her arm. So, be REALLY careful. Would I come back to this resort again?

We were told after we checked in to go back to the bellboy to tell him our room #. From there we didn't know where to go but since I had printed a map off the internet of the property we figured we could find our room on our own. This resort is big! Lots of walking! Not a problem for us. Found the Platinum lounge stopped there to go ahead & book our dinner reservations. Couldn't get anything for that night because we arrived after 1 & they don't make any reservations after that. Wanted to eat at the Italian & the only opening was at 10pm...kind of late for us but we took it anyways. We were told we weren't eligible for the Platinum massages because we were only staying 5 days & not 7! & the beach dinner they offer Platinum guests was only on Friday nights & that is when we were leaving so we didn't get that either. Neither issue was that big of deal. I was looking forward to the massage but luckily they had massage tables set up on the beach - the massages there were great & very cheap! $20 for 1/2 hour!!

Kind of thought that at least in our room there would have been resort information but there wasn't. Just a room service menu. We waited in our room (which was BEAUTIFUL) for over an hour & still no luggage. Finally my husband went to check & after a phone call our luggage arrived shortly. Platinum section on the beach was a joke! It was roped off with nice huts & cushy lounge chairs but it would have been a lot nicer if there wasn't chairs (not Platinum) in front of you. Not as private as the brochure made it seem. Also, I don't think a lot of people even knew it was the Platinum section - there were no signs that I saw & we started noticing there were a lot of people without the Platinum bracelets on in the section. The only issue we had with that is that there was only 1 girl getting drinks & it took a long time for her to get around to everyone so most of the time we got our own. Platinum lounge was a nice perk. Always little snacks out at any time of the day. Chocolate covered strawberries were awesome! We used the lounge a lot for internet access because we didn't have it in our room (Which we should have) The few times we were lucky enough to get internet access in our rooms it was horribly slow. This was a big reason we booked the Platinum because this is how we planned to stay in touch with our 12 & 6 year old at home. Things we didn't receive were the slippers, beach bag, hat, coupons for the spa, no motorized water sports & no mention of the DVD library. No biggies to us on any of these. Really did not care for the location of our room due to it being on the ground floor back side of the Riviera. I was really excited about having the Jacuzzi tub on the terrace but ours was located on the back path which was a main walkway for the workers so I didn't feel comfortable out there by myself at night. There was construction going on but it wasn't close to our section. A few days on the beach they were adding on to one of the beach buildings & that was a little annoying listening to the chainsaw. Mosquitos - Had more than a few in our room. Should have brought bug spray! Food - not my idea of good food. Liked the breakfast buffet the best. Made to order omelets were excellent. Lunch & dinner buffett not really my liking. Fajitas on buffett were good but never could find any sour cream. We ate at Mama Mia (Italian) & Los Olas (Seafood) Both were pretty good. Room service we ordered twice & came quickly both times. Would rate the food as just okay. The club sandwich with chips, salsa & guac were the best things I ate all week. Pools were awesome! Beautiful! Like nothing I have ever seen before! Bars & bartenders were great! Lots of alcohol! Beach was pretty but not the best I've seen. Many rocks! Go slowly in the water & you will be fine just beware - they are out there! So even though we had some issues we still had a great trip. Met lots of great people & actually met lots of people that live in our hometown here in Lou, KY. We definately enjoyed the trip & the resort. Very good staff here. Always attentive to any issue you might have. We would return here if the price was right but most likely we will try out a new destination.", "Date": "May 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved the resort.\u201d", "Author": "delby", "ReviewID": "UR16123120", "Content": "Let me start we have never stayed at a five star resort before.

Overall, our experience was very positive... yes, there some things that we didn't get that were supposed to be part of the package (slippers, turn-down, liquor dispensor, beach towels), but they were not he main reason we went on holidays... so we dealt with it! After all, it is Mexico... We arrived at 8:35 am, found our bus immediately after picking up our luggage and were on our way to the hotel by 9:45 am. I don't know if Air Transat does things differently, but we were pre-registered and were given booking slips to fill out in the bus on the way down. We had our room number before we even got to the resort and then it was just a matter of indicating our suitcases to the bellboys (ok, bellmen!), heading off to our room with our carry-ons, change into a swimsuite and we were off. The resort is big so bring comfortable walking shoes or sandals. The grounds are nice, but will be far more spectacular once the trees and shrubs fill out. The pools are salt-water chlorinated which is great because there is far more buoyance in the water (easier to hold your arm up so you don't get water in your drink!). There was someone that came around regulary to see if we wanted more drinks or we could go to any of the swim-up bars. I didn't find the beach or water all that rocky, but some people's feet are more sensitive than others. We brought water shoes but never used them. They do need more palapas for sun on the beach as it was difficult finding something in the shade if you hadn't gone down to reserve one first thing in the morning. We were more fortunate with the pool palapas and normally could find something in the shade, no matter what time we were there. The only one issue I would raise is the buffet food - I agree with previous reviews that the buffet food is cold or lukewarm by the time you get back to your table - the reason for this is that they only use heating lamps (not chafing dishes) and the lamps keep the food warm, not hot! Havings said that, we always found something appetizing to eat (yum, guacamole and salsa, and ice cream!). With our package we had unlimited \u00e0 la carte and we used them. We LOVED the International (La Fleur) and went back twice, the Japanese (Miso) was very good (ask for the Tepanyaki show) and the Fondue was good as well (it is a mozarella cheese fondue, so if you don't like this type of thing, don't bother, you won't like it). Unfortunately, we did not like the Mexican (Hacienda). We found the food unappetizing and little different from the buffets.

Resort: very big and a very long walk from the main resort to our room, so planning the days meals was important...a very long walk to the beach. the lobby is not grand. there is not much seating in the courtyard. Buffet Restaurants: ok, not much variety in comparison to other 5 star resorts. the food in all buffets was the same. Al a carte Restaurants: we couldn't say, we never had the opportunity. we stould in line for 1/2 hour one day to book a restaurant, but people were coming out saying they were booking for next week unless you want to eat at 9pm. the computers are not talking to one another so it takes forever (upwards of 2 hours) to book your dining experience.

Service: our room was always clean...our fridge was never restocked with alcohol. the room was beautiful (but who cares..). the bartenders (mostly in the lobby) only care to wait on you if you are a young person, specifically the ladies. There is no place to get american money...at the lobby they will give you up to $10 american dollars, if they have it and if the 1 person designated to disperse it is available...otherwise they tell you to go see the bellboys...so much for tipping.

Have just got a beverage from Carlos at one of the many swim-up bars and made a short walk back to our swim-up suite at the Princess. It is another day in paradise, 33 degrees, partly cloudly but a beautiful day none the less. First let me say that I read each and every one of the reviews posted about this resort. They are all true. This is a new resort, only a few months old so it has some maturing to do. My wife and I have booked 2 weeks at the Princess. For resort destinations we have been to Mazatlan, Acupulco, Manzanillo, Puerto Plata and Kaui in the past, always looking to stay in at least a 4.5* resort. The Princess is one of the best resorts we have visited. We are staying in room 6035, a swim-up Jr. Deluxe suite at one end of swim-up suites. We are steps away from the beach, and a breakfast and lunch buffet. We love the room, good maid and mini-bar service. There are a few bugs, bring spray and spray around the doors as that helps. We arrrived on Air Transat out of Calagry. Flight was great (Club Class - you should do it if you can) but there was a about a 2 hour delay from landing in Cancun to departing for the resorts. Bus ride to the resort was good, bring cash - Cervezas are $3 each. We arrived at about 2 in the morning on a Saturday morning. Check-in was pretty quick - we were the first off the bus. After about a 15 minute wait for a golf cart we were shuttled to our room. Not the one we booked but the cart driver assured us that this would be corrected in the AM. As I had read all the reviews about this place I was a bit concerned, but when I went to the reservation counter the next AM they already had us on the list to move rooms. (I saw the list room change was right across the hall to our booked swim-up suite.) When we moved the room was lacking in a couple of areas - missing a few pillows, bed skirt. A quick move of these things along with our luggage made our room perfect! Our experience is that the staff here are really trying hard to make this a good vacation for everyone. We were supposed to receive a bottle of tequilla and bar service (besides beer) in our room. Didn't get either but that's probably a good thing. If it's important it's nothing a few bucks and a quick note can't fix. As with any resort there are compainers and folks who can't get their next drink fast enough. My wife and I spoke to many people who just loved the resort and a few who are not so happy. Those pleased outnumber the complainers many times over. Here is the bottom line. The resort is beautiful, even for only being open a few months. Staff are trying hard and will accomodate you when they can. The weather is outstanding and food and drinks are plentiful and of good quality. Enjoy the opportunity to get this resort at a good price while you can. If you expect 5* Fairmont or Westin service this is not the resort for you. There are many other 5* resorts that you can book and pay many times more for that level of service. |f you want great weather, outstanding pools, good food and beverages and fun in the sun then look forward to the Princess.

We also ate at the Grill, The Italian, and the Japanese resturaunts. I could leave the all but the Japanese, it was GREAT. They tried to charge us to eat there but don't give in and they will let you have it with your all inclusive plan. 2) The front desk is very helpful with any questions you have 3) The resort is BEAUTIFUL to walk around. Cons 1) It is very big and you have to do alot of walking. Which I didn't mind to much except when your tired and ready to go to bed. 2) There are always lines at the bars and tipping doesn't help! 3) The water at the beach is very rocky.

The room was cleaned well everyday around 3pm. The lobby of the platinum rooms was great! Access to the internet was easy with no lines. Booking a la cartes was easy also, it only took us 10 minutes to make reservations for 3 resturaunt. We also had beach towels at the platinum lounge 24 hours a day, no standing in line. We also enjoyed Budwiser in the can, corona in the bottle, ice cream cones, and specialty chocolates at the platinum lounge. Service in the lounge is amazing! You can have any thing you want any way you want it. The resort is rather large and much walking is required. Although this can be an advantage. You can find many quite spots and escape from the crowds. As platinum guests you have access to the platinum pool and well as the villa pool. The villa pool is adult only and had many beds with palapas. This pool has the best margaritas. We spent many afternoons here napping in the beds listening to the waterfalls. The main pool is very large. There are many quite and many active areas. The center pool is the active pool. Many games are played here. Music is played at this pool daily beginning around 11 am. The buffet food was average, compared to other all inclusives we have been too. The Japanese resturant, we really enjoyed. Edwardo was an excellent cook and entertainer. The food here is delicious. The beach was a little rocky in some areas, but water socks are not needed. There was a waitress on the beach, who was working very hard. There are also massages offered on the beach for only $25 dolllars! Listening to the ocean, feeling the wind in your hair while getting a massage--doesn't get better than this.

We couldn't have asked for more perfect weather or hotel, considering we left snowy weather back home. It was both of our first time to the Mayan Riviera, but had both been to Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan before. After reading this site religiously before we took our vacation, I must say I was quite worried considering all the negative reviews. But after spending a week at this resort, I don't know why there were so many complaints. In this review, I am going to break down each area of the resort to give you the full experience. Now I understand that some people are more picky than others, but my boyfriend and I went to the Princess with no expectations. Airline: We flew with Air Transat and right from the beginning it was not a good experience. We found their staff to be quite rude, but we were not about to let that ruin our trip. Arrival: We were whisked through the airport without any problems what so ever and were greeted by our transportation reps within minutes. We had an overnight flight so we were very exhausted by the time we got onto the bus, but others started their vacation right away with Corona's being cracked open at 8 a.m. The transportation reps were quite humourous and made the 40min drive to our hotel go by very quickly. Hotel: When we arrived at the hotel, there was no line up and they took down all of our information and told us to come back at Noon. The bell boys looked after our bags so we decided to explore the resort. I never truly could have pictured how big this resort was until we started walking around. The pathways are lined with Palm Trees, flowers and statues. There were swimming pools everywhere you looked. Since we had a few hours to spare we figured we would go book our a la carte restaurants right away. From reading previous reviews, I got the impression you could book all 3 reservations at any of the restaurants, so we decided to walk into the Fondue restaurant, but were told we had to book at the front lobby with the concierge. So we walked all the way back to the lobby (10min walk) and were told we had to book them in the Mexican restaurant. Really I have to stress that this was the only concern we had all week. Since the resort is new, not all the staff know where things are or how to go about doing things. So after that, we went back to the front desk at Noon and sure enough our room was ready. We had our bags to our room within 10 minutes. Room: Our room was in the 6000 section, which was located near the beach, and pools. Great location, as we didn't have to venture up to lobby except for dinner buffets and a la cartes, and we discovered the two restuarants (which turn into a la cartes in the evening) closest to the beach were open for bufffet for breakfast and lunch. We had requested a King Balcony room through our Travel Agent, but were given a King ground level room - not a big deal as our room backed onto the edge of the property so it was very quiet! After all the walking you do not want to have to climb stairs, especially after having a few cervezas. All of the lobbies of the rooms have water fountains with palms trees and plants. Our room was gorgeous and very modern. Marble flooring, jetted tub, frosted glass shower and toilet area, patio, flat screen TV. The bed was very comfortable and everything was clean. We did notice there were quite a few mosquitos in our room by the end of the day because the maids leave the doors to rooms wide open while cleaning. If you are allergic to mosquitos, ask for a second floor room to minimize the amount of them. We also did receive our complimentary bottle of tequila on our second night there without having to ask for it as well as a dried fruit basket. Tipping: We tipped everyday - $2 and a souvenior for the maids and $2 for the bar people. Everything was always perfect when we returned to our room. We left a note for the bar people as to what we required. The maids left us two swans in the shape of a heart with pretty flowers on it, so we decided to give them a bunch a Canadian souveniors and whatever money we had leftover at the end of our stay - they did a wonderful job all week. Restaurants: The buffet and a la cartes were very good. The buffet always wide something new. They always had a wide variety or fruits, vegetables, fish, meat, etc. We ate at the Mexcian, the Japanese and the Italian. The Mexican was good, the Japanese was fantastic - we ate at the tapanyeki grill, and the Italian was okay. Aparently the Veal at the Italian was fantastic, so we will know what to have the next time we go there. Beach: The beach was like what you would see in a postcard. There were a lot of complaints on TA about the beach having a lot of rocks as you enter the water, but we went in without water shoes and were fine. You could walk out for a mile and still only be waist deep. The sand was white and the water was blue/green and somedays you could see right to the bottom, depending on how choppy the ocean was that day. We did, however, have to get up pretty early and reserve a shady spot on the beach at around 7:30 a.m. There were always a ton of sunny spots available all day long. Nightlife: Unfortunately we never did make it to the disco. After being in the sun all day we were often in bed by 10 p.m. They did have nightly entertainment from Thursday - Monday in the main court yard outside the lobby/buffets. It was very entertaining and usually started around 8:30 p.m. On Saturday nights they bring in vendors where you can buy some neat keepsakes. We especially liked an artist that painted everything with spray paint, newspaper, little tools and his hands - absolutely amazing. It was neat to see the pictures come to life in a matter of 10 minutes. I am not sure if I missed anything, but I would be glad to answer anyones questions. All in all, we had a fantastic time and will definitely return to the Mayan Riviera and if the price is right, we would stay at the Princess again. Everyone there are so hard working and try to make your stay the best is can possibly be.

The Resort: This hotel is HUGE! It's divided into the Riviera side and Sunset side; both sides are mirror image of each other. It's about 10 minute wak from the lobby to the beach. There are beautiful saltwater pools everywhere! Check-in: I think there were some complaints about the check-in time. We booked our trip with Transat and on the bus from Cancun airport to the hotel, they provided us with our room keys. We were able to get to our rooms right away and dump our luggage in the closet. The room wasn't cleaned until sometimes in the afternoon. Our Room: Regency Deluxe Jr. (Pool View) Our room was on the 2nd floor and we didn't have any problem with mosquitos. There was 1 mosquito in our room I think, and I chased after it with bug spray everytime I saw it. The room was cleaned and mini bar was refilled everyday. The cleaning lady comes at 9 in the morning to clean our room, and if we are sleeping, she drops by around 1PM. We tipped $10 every 2-3 days. We had no problem with our safe! There was also 24-hr room service and it was lovely!!! We ordered several times at night and the food was delivered within 20 minutes. The fish fillets and steaks were great, don't forget to tip! Food: We preferred the buffets at the main lobby over the buffets at the beach - they had more fresh fruits and better food! I think previous reviews were right about the food staying the same everyday and it does get boring after a few days. We booked 3 a la cartes - Fleur, Miso, and Seafood. Fleur was excellent, really loved the lamb chop. Miso sucked...tasted like Chinese fast food. (We are Chinese...and we are probably picky about asian food than most people) Seafood was good, portion is huge! Beach: Fine white sand and ocean floor is a little bit rocky. As you walk further into the ocean, you could feel the ocean floor wasn't leveled. It should be okay if you have water shoes on. We didn't spend much time at the beach, the swimming pool is a great alternative! Alcohol/Drinks: I drank mostly fruity ones and my boyfriend drank mostly corona's. We can't say much about the drinks, you will have to try them for yourselves. Playa Del Carmen: We went there twice, once for shopping and once for scuba diving (which I will talk about later on). There was free shuttle from the resort but you have to register like a day early to get seats. The cabs are $13 from hotel to Playa and $11 from playa back. Cabs will drop you off at 5th Avenue, which is like the \"shopping\" street. I personally think some of the prices are rediculous! If you want to buy cheap, buy from department stores on 5th Avenue. Tours: We did 2 tours - Tulum & Xel-ha (check out the photos)and scuba diving. We booked the tour from Cancun-Discounts, it's $110pp and it includes hotel pickup. You could also book tours from the hotel, but at a higher rate, the same tour costs $140pp. Playa Del Carmen also have lots of agencies that offer lower prices, but some of them seem a little bit sketchy. There is a tour that we really wanted to do but didn't get a chance, the Coba tour + Snorkeling at cenotes (check the website). We did a Discovey Scuba Diving tour for beginners for $100pp, we booked it in Playa Del Carmen. It was a 2 tank dive at 2 different reefs - Mumchambo? and Jardines. I wouldn't really recommend this tour, nothing spectacular. It was good for the experience though, but I think if you really want to see amazing sea creatures, you need to get certified.

The beach was very nice, the pools are gorgeous and huge, the rooms are clean, new, and have big bathrooms, porches etc., and - if you have kids (which we do not) - this resort is certainly kid-friendly. Also, it was always very easy to get alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. It seemed bottles of water, juices, daiquiris, etc. were everywhere. Finally, the staff (while not always knowledgeable) were kind and friendly. Now for the negative aspects of the resort. 1) If you want personal service, or a quick response to most requests, you will not get it at this resort. Self-sufficiency is required. For example, a fuse blew in our hotel room one night - and the front desk kept promising that someone would come to fix it. An hour later - no one had come. We ended up finding the circuit breaker ourselves. 2) Checking into the hotel requires extraordinary levels of patience. We spent a half hour at the front desk for no apparent reason. It was the oddest thing. And we had to fight to make sure we didn't have a room overlooking a construction site. There seemed to be no manager at the front desk - or for that matter anywhere in the resort. A chain of command seemed to be missing. 3) The food: The food was as you would expect at an all-inclusive resort -- fair. We ate breakfast and lunch at the buffets every day. We had dinner at the specialty restaurants around the resort. There is absolutely no ambience in any of those restaurants. It was as if the hotel made sure that each dining experience was in as sterile an environment as possible. Very odd. Also, the only type of wine served at the resort tasted like dishwater. i think the beer was only non-watered down drink at the resort. 4) Also - it is very difficult to get a reservation at any of the specialty restaurants. You have to book days in advance. Knowing this, when we tried to cancel a pre-existing reservation at the Japanese place (we opted to go into town for dinner instead), i was placed on hold without any confidence that I would - at some point - be transferred to the correct place. I just gave up after 10+ minutes. In short, all of these issues, in combination, made for a rather frustrating experience. But - as another reviewer said - the resort is not a five star resort - so if you go - just go in with your eyes open.", "Date": "May 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cVilla Laguna Area & Room\u201d", "Author": "Mandycakes", "ReviewID": "UR15738271", "Content": "Just had a few requests for room photos so had to write another review in order to post them...

We booked through Signature Vacations (Holiday Market Travel). Unfortunately we had to travel on Skyservice with this package, really and truly the worst airline out there. I see other people have complained about Air Canada Vacations not rating this hotel properly, but then neither did Signature Vacations. I believe they get the rating from the hotel themselves. This is a decent hotel, but definitely not the promised 5 stars. As it only opened in December, there are still many glitches to work out, mostly in the service area. I attended the briefing by the Signature tour rep, and his first question was if anyone had read the reviews on Trip Advisor. Some people said they had and he responded by saying \"Then what are you doing here?\" He has done this job for six years and worked at pretty much every hotel on the Riviera. He told us that this hotel had already changed management twice since opening. Theft has been a major problem at the hotel. While we were there, on about our fourth day, three men came to our door around five in the evening. We were just back from the beach, and they entered abruptly when my husband answered the door. I was changing to have a shower and scrambled to cover myself with a towel. They said they were from maintenance and wanted to know what was wrong with the room. We had a broken toilet seat which we had signalled to maintenance three days earlier, and my husband thought they were here to repair it. One man went through the room and appeared to check my balcony door all the while looking at all of our belongings scattered througout the room. The second man opened the closet door and looked at the safe (which was locked), and the third followed my husband into the bathroom. They left shortly after, but we both felt very uncomfortable by the encounter and I brought it to the attention to the front desk who knew nothing of maintenance checks. They referred me to the concierge who knew nothing of it either, and then asked me to fill out a form explaining what happened. The form was actually a standard theft report. They said they would get back to me, but never did. To back track a little, I must tell you that probably one of the worst experiences in this hotel was check-in. The staff was rude, surly and totally unaccomadating. Our only request was for a top floor room somewhere reasonably close to the beach. We also mentioned that we were celebrating an anniversary. My husband had knee surgery one month prior and didn't feel he could walk too much. However, as we retire early, we like to be on the top floor which tends to be quieter. We were told that they were only requests, and so none of them were honored. When my husband became somewhat annoyed, we were told to come back later. We had arrived at the hotel at about 11:15 a.m. He was initially going to give us a room even though it was before check-in, but then said we would have to wait about three hours. We went to lunch and then came back at three. The same room was once again offered. I said if I were going to take the same room I wouldn't have waited almost four hours. I had to wait again, and finally at 4:30 was begrudginly given a top floor room, but it was nowhere near the beach. Although new, the resort appears unfinished. Everything is painted stark white, and it makes everything look blank. It appears as if the whole resort is covered in primer. A shame as there is so much potential to add some character. The lobby is bare, blank and lacking any personality or charm. About 20 statues that are supposed to be installed on the grounds are missing leaving blank concrete mounds in their place. The overall construction workmanship is generally poor. You can see the place was built in a hurry. The resort is huge, and the walk from the lobby and main restaurants to the beach is about a 5 - 6 block walk. Our room was situated about 2 blocks from the lobby, and hence about 4 blocks from the beach. There was supposedly a shuttle service to take you around, but despite wasting 20 to 30 minutes on many occasions, it only showed up once. The vague photocopied plan of the resort gave very little clues as to where one was actually going most of the time, or as to what was available or where to find it. The room was very well laid out, but the promised iron, iron boards and coffee maker were not there, nor did they ever materialize despite several requests. There is no pen or paper or any resort information in the room either. If you enjoy reading before going to sleep, this is not the place as the lightbulbs in the room are atrociously dim. Although the room was clean and well laid out, there was a constant sewer odor emitting form the bathroom floor drain at all times. Yes, the shower leaked under the door, but not much, and a towel on the floor solved that problem. It's unfortunate there was no shelf in the shower as you had to put shampoo on the floor all the time. Also the towel racks in the room were falling off the wall. The housekeeper usually came around three in the afternoon, except one day when she didn't come at all, but after calling, someone arrived within a half hour. The floors were swept daily, but never washed. The resort grounds are beautiful, but several years will be needed before the gorgeous palm trees actually have any shade bearing leaves on them. Everything is newly planted and hence immature . Don't count on sitting under the shade of a palm tree. If you want shade, you must be up early. As a natural early riser, I was usually at the beach between 6:15 and 6:30. I was not alone. This was the time of day you could get a nice palapa. One morning I came at 6:50, and I believe I got the last one available. The beach is beautiful and generally clean, but not nearly big enough for a resort of this size. Chaise lounges are sardined in, and there is a roped off area on the beach which the lounges must stay behind. The larger sandy area is part of the public beach. The dirtiest part of the beach is the hundreds of cigarette butts that smokers leave behind. There are some pebbles and rocks in certain areas, but nothing to get alarmed about. I wore no shoes and had no trouble avoiding them. To the left and the right of the hotel is undeveloped land, accessible by the locals. The beach areas to the left and right are therefore dirty, and considered unsafe. One lady had her camera ripped off her shoulder while walking alone, late morning just slightly the right of the hotel property. Besides there is really nothing to see either way, except another large resort being constructed farther down the beach to the left. I tried to make restaurant reservations the first day we were there. I was pretty much told nothing was available. I pleaded that I had just arrived ( I didn't even have a room number yet), and that it was our anniversary on the 26th. I was finally able to secure a reservation for 7:20 in the French restaurant, and I was only otherwise offered the Japanese or the Mexican at 10:00 p.m. I declined as I am generally in bed by that time. The food at the French restaurant was good, and the only hot meal I had all week, but my appetizer (foie gras), which really was just regular liver pate was the size of a quarter in thickness and diameter. Good food, but ridiculous portions. I can't say for any of the other restaurants because we never ate there. One day at the beach I hear a couple beside us bragging that they had secured six reservations. He didn't say how, but I assumed he paid under the table. So we ate buffet for all of our other meals, a hit and miss venture. Some food was quite good, some was atrocious and most was just mediocre. The common thread was that everything was cold, with the exception of eggs or omelettes in the morning that you had to line up to get. Of all the resorts I've stayed at this place had the least selection in all buffet areas, be it salad bar, hot dishes, bread etc. Getting coffee in the main buffet was a task, as was wine with our meals. We were usually close to being finished before we could finally get service. This didn't seem to be the case at the beach buffets, but for some reason, other than breakfast, you cannot get a coffee after your meal unless you go out and line up at the bar. The main buffet seemed understaffed, and despite tipping everywhere it didn't seem to make any difference to the level of service. There is a shuttle service into Playa del Carmen where we decided we would like to go one day, but when we went to get it were told it was all reserved for the next three days. We were never told ahead of time that this was something that needed to be reserved well in advance. We took a taxi - $13. each way. A couple of nights there were beach BBQ's, One was reserved only for Air Transat passengers. Another was for Platinum guests. As a Signature guest who wasn't Platinum, we were kind of made to feel like chopped liver, as it didn't seem we were entitled to much. We travel at least twice a year and have been to about a dozen all inclusive resorts in the past five years, six on the Mayan Riviera. So I can say I have a basis form comparison, and I must say that although this is not a bad resort, it is far from being a five star, and I doubt that it ever will be. It is a decent four star hotel, and with a lot of work may be a 4 1/2 star, but unlikely ever a 5. There are simply too many issues in regards to service, some which are difficult to achieve because of the sheer size of the resort. For the same money, you can do much better. I've stayed in resorts rated 41/2 that were far superior to this. Barcelo Maya Tropical, Grand Palladium Riviera, Riu Yucatan, Barccelo Maya Beach, Bahia Principe Akumal (all similar priced) and all far superior. We always go away for our anniversary, and despite the travel agent mentioning it on our request list, and my stating it at check-in and to the concierge when I made a dinner reservation, this is the first hotel we've stayed in that never made any acknowledgement of the fact. Generally a fruit basket or a bottle of inexpensive sparkling wine is sent to our room, (an inexpensive gesture on the hotel's part, but one that goes a long way in regards to customer satisfaction). On our last day our check-out was noon, but we were not being picked up from the hotel until 10:25 p.m. We asked if we could keep the room longer and were told abruptly that we would be charged $20.00 and hour for every extra hour we stayed in our room. We checked out at noon and stored out things with the bellboy. We were able to have a shower late in the day by the lobby, but there was no hairdryer, shampoo or any amenities other than a towel provided. Would we stay here again? Definitely NOT. There are too many better places to go for the same money or less. I haven't attached any photos as there are many photos availble for this resort and although attractive, it was the least attractive of any we have stayed in, and therefore we took very few pictures. I know people say that if you go with the flow or don't sweat the small stuff you can have a great vacation. To a certain extent this is true, but there were too many small issues to overlook - I've only touched on a very small amount of them. This may also be easier to do if your are knowlingly staying in a 3 or 4 star hotel, but if you are told you are in a 5 star and expect 5 star service, this is not the place to be.", "Date": "May 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, ON Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful trip\u201d", "Author": "cherbear23", "ReviewID": "UR15573739", "Content": "Our group consisted of 3 couples arriving on April 17 until the 24th.

Our luggage arrived shortly after us to our rooms. The villas are absolutely beautiful. Well worth the little extra we payed for them. We had a fairly large living room area. There was a beautiful king-size bed, with a large assortment of pillows to pick from. Directly behind the marbled headboard is the double size Jacuzzi bathtub. There is also a large walk-in closet, with two separate vanity areas on either side of the double doors that lead out to a lovely outdoor garden shower. They are totally blissful after spending the day around your own private pool area, soaking up the sun and having butler services that was fast and friendly. By having the villas we had a concierge service located at the pool area.

We were on the first floor, with a balcony that actually had steps right down into the pool. This was GREAT !!! We walked down to the beach twice, but liked the pool so much better due to this balcony arrangement. We found the service to be terrific. This was all the way from checkin with Miguel at the front desk up until check out time. Everyone there was always smiling (with us anyway) and always had a pleasant HOLA !! or BUENAS DIAS for us. The service in the restaurants was good as well. The chambermaid did a nice job keeping the room clean and the bed made. Every afternoon found a new Towel Animal waiting to greet us when we returned after a day in the sun. YES, there were some BUGS, but this is the tropics, and you will find bugs there. A little \"OFF\" and some \"RAID\" sprayed onto the balcony floor kept the problems away. The BREAKFAST buffets were all excellent. They had a fresh omlette sation that offered about 10 different fillings for freshly made omlettes that were great. Lots of fruits, juices, cheeses and other goodies were available for the taking as well. We really had only 3 gripes about the week and property. 1. The food was not so great. There are several \"specialty restaurants\" included with the A/I package. However the quality of the food was just mediocre. The exception was the \"Miso\" asian restaurant.This was the best of all. better quality food plus a show at the hibatchi grill. 2. Again with the restaurants - one is told that reservations MUST be made for the specialty places. However, one must either wait on line in the AM or do as we did, ask the concierge for assistance in making the reservation. We were told that all of the specialty restaurants get totally booked very quickly, but whenever we arrived to dine, the places looked to be only 1/2 filled. Never understood why the difficulty getting reserved. 3. Again the restaurants - We were only staying for 5 nights. We were told that we could only eat \"specialty\" 3 of those nights with the other 2 at the buffet. Those staying for 7 nights, get 4 specialty nights. For us this was a problem because the buffet food was edible, but barely. We found very little that we wanted to try. All in all, this was a very relaxing 5 nights/6 days. The property is great.

With Airtransat. I would recommend bringing some food on the plane. Our flight left around 4:30pm and we arrived at the hotel around 10pm. They supplied a light snack and by the time we arrived at the hotel and checked in we were starving. The dinner buffet closes at 10:30pm. Room was jr. suite deluxe number 8123 on the second floor looking out on the grounds, no pool view. No problems with cleaning of room or bar restock. It was done everyday. We were happy to be close to the lobby because the a la carte restaurants and buffets are located there and in the evenings we hung out at the large lobby bar playing games. The Riviera side is bordered by construction but the noise was just during the day and we used earplugs for early morning noise. Some construction dust but hardly any mosquitoes on our side. The Sunset side is bordered by mangroves and I think that is why there are more mosquitoes. Another plus to being by the lobby are the computers. The Transat office has 2 computers that are available to use. (As a side benefit, if you happen to need an extra washroom in cases of emergency, just run to the lobby washroom. It came in handy one day). Resort: The resort is very modern looking with beautiful marble everywhere. It was easily the largest we have stayed at, some may like this but I felt a bit overwhelmed by the size and amount of people. I couldn\u2019t wear most of the shoes I brought because of the walking, but I don\u2019t think this is too much of a problem because this was the only exercise we got. Also, we went with another couple and because of this brought 2-way radios to contact them around the resort, which was a great convenience. Food: The Japanese restaurant was very entertaining sitting at the cooking table, but this must be specifically reserved. We didn\u2019t do this ahead of time but the host asked us to wait 10 minutes and if they have any \u201cno-shows\u201d we could get the table in their place, which is exactly what happened and well worth it. Both veal choices at the Italian restaurant were excellent and by far our favorite of all the restaurants . The lamb chops at the International were also very good but the ostrich was terrible, prepared like meatballs but tasted more like liverwurst with bad seasoning. I have had great ostrich back home many times and this was not. A bit disappointed in the Mexican, the food tasted good but was not hot, however that could be hit or miss. The buffets are like other resorts we have stayed at. Nice selection but can get a bit boring at times. Between the two main buffet restaurants is an outdoor lounge. We picked up cappuccino\u2019s there for breakfast and brought them into the buffet instead of drinking the coffee served. Beach: I would recommend water shoes for the few spots of rocks in the water. Tulum & Cenotes: We rented a car one day. Found a better deal online so the resort rentals gave us extra time with the car to compensate. Tulum is about a one hour drive from the resort. It was very interesting and beautiful but recommend going early in the morning or later in the evening when the sun is not so hot. There is very little shade. Also recommend taking the trolley to the ruins, it is only 2$ but in the scorching sun we were happy to get a break. Drove to Grand Cenotes, which is another 5 minutes away and swam in the underwater cave system. This was a highlight. They charge $8 to enter and another $10 to rent snorkel, vest and flippers. Bring snacks and water with you. Playa Del Carmen: they have free shuttle buses that leave at 10am, 11am, noon, 1pm and 6pm. You must reserve them ahead and get a bus ticket. Leaving: Have your flight info, eticket ready for the airport bus, they want to check that you are supposed to be on that bus and not trying to get a free ride to the airport or on the wrong one.

This year as well we travelled with Air Canada Vacations through Multitravel to Grand Riviera Princess in the Mayan Riviera from April 15th to April 22nd inclusive. My partner and I have always felt very confident in the ratings that Air Canada applies to the various vacation spots they advertise and up until this point, I feel that those ratings have always been very accurate and reliable. This was certainly not the case this year with a five star rating given to the Grand Riviera Princess. We arrived on Tuesday, April 15th and were booked in the Platinum section. Upon arriving at the hotel there was no instruction or direction that in fact, even though we were staying on the Riviera side of the resort , that we had to check in on the Sunset side of the resort. We therefore wasted over 45 minutes in line on the Riviera side only to be told once we reached reception that we had to go over to a different line at the sister resort. Once checked in, we were only given a barely legible photocopy of the map of the resort and absolutely no direction with respect to the various services offered. I understand now they have that problem rectified and that there is a platinum check in on both sides. Once we reached the platinum section, I had to ask the concierge for everything that was promised to us in the Air Canada write up, i.e., beach bag, spa coupons, tequila, etc. It seemed if you didn\u2019t outright ask, they were not going to make this available to you. The room was well appointed, however, the workmanship was exceptionally poor with flooding showers, no toilet paper, no Kleenex, no toiletry rack in the shower. The bathtubs in the bathroom and on the balcony were unclean and the floors were unswept. We ordered room service several times and each and every time, the order that arrived was incorrect and had to be sent back. There was major construction right outside our balcony (within 15 feet) and we were never made aware that there was ongoing construction at this property. At most times throughout the day, you could hear power saws, etc., which at some points was quite noisy and annoying. The food in the buffets was always cold, probably because the dishes were kept on warming trays and not the deep dish steamers that most resorts use. The chefs who prepared the food could be seen cross contaminating raw beef and chicken consistently using the same utensils and cookware for everything. We ate at the Grill restaurant on the second day we were there and both my partner and I quickly came down with a severe case of food poisoning. In fact we were not able to leave our room for three days. I visited the resort doctor who was supposed to be on call 24/7, at 8:00 a.m. one morning where his office door posted his opening hours as 8:00 a.m. At 8:30 he still had not arrived and I called the Reception who after several attempts of paging him, finally located him. He finally came into the office and looked at his fee schedule and looked at me and quite simply said \u201cwhat do you want lady, do you want me to look at you or do you simply want drugs\u201d. I told him I had food poisoning and he wrote me a prescription and told me that I had to go into Playa Del Carmen to pick it up. I explained that I was too weak to go anywhere and he shrugged his shoulders. I contacted the concierge at the Platinum section and they kindly arranged for the prescription to be delivered to me at the resort for a fee which I gladly paid for. For the rest of the vacation, we ate only ice-cream, dry toast and drank bottled water. I would have tried to arrange an early flight home if I could have, however, I did not feel that I could travel in the condition I was in. At check out, we ordered a bell boy the day before to transport our luggage to the main lobby. We reconfirmed these arrangements . Predictably, no bell boy arrived and we ended up dragging our luggage to the main lobby of this resort in order to meet our transfer to the hotel. Simply put, I feel that travellers should be alerted to some serious concerns around food safety in this resort and lack of service. Many travelers were wandering around asking each other for direction since that seemed to be the only way that anyone could get any answers. Certainly the staff was not properly trained and did not take any concerns seriously. I am a mature adult and not interested in vacationing at an all-inclusive with less than a five star rating. This resort clearly fell far short of that designation. Admittedly the resort itself was beautiful to look at, some staff tried exceptionally hard, the beach was definitely worthy of a five star rating, however, the service and the food did not exceed what you would expect in a three star resort, let alone meet the minimum expectations of a five star. To end up with food poisoning is simply unacceptable which led to 3 days being completely incapacitated and 5 days overall being terribly under the weather. As mentioned above, we have been to many resorts and have always had excellent experiences. My hope is that Air Canada reviews its commitment with this resort and in fact adjusts the rating to more accurately reflect the level of service that is so obviously lacking.

We entered our room at 330pm after eating and it was not done. The platinum concierge called on our behalf and it was done by 415pm. The room was lovely and comfortable. After our first day we came back from the pool to a strong sewer smell in our room. This was resolved quickly, but still gave us a bad indication. The smell continued to come back, so we put a face cloth over the drain under the sink where the smell was coming from. The platinum was nice and service good at the private area. We found we paid alot of money and there were other regular guests using the beds and eating the snacks! The beach was okay, but only a beach bar and no food , you had to walk to the buffett to eat..which was closed from 3pm- 5pm The first day I did not wear water shoes and hurt my foot, at which my husband had to put my dislocated toe back in!! It is rocky and full of coral and seaweed.. not a 5 star in that sense. Food was good and the mama mia italian restaurant was awesome! The grille was NOT steak, but rabbit and veal!! good if you like that. If we return, we will get the villa laguna which is 100% private and no stragglers in the area you paid for private service. Likely we will not go back. We prefer the Xcaret hands down!! this resort does not offer the warm feel i expected.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bc", "Title": "\u201cWonderful get away\u201d", "Author": "kayleajean", "ReviewID": "UR15197340", "Content": "My parents, a friend and i went to the Princess April 11/08, the trip started out a little rocky. our flight was delayed, so we didnt arrive to our hotel until 4:30 in the morning. However that had nothing to do with the hotel. when we arrived we were told our luggage would be brought right to our rooms, it took about an hour, which we didnt understand why, we just wanted to get some sleep. upon our arrival, we were greated by happy staff members. our roomn was beautiful, it was exactly what we asked for, we were in room 6236 and 6237, could see the ocean and pools and some restaurants. very short walk to the beach and pools. they say you cant swim after 8, but we did anyway, no one cared. the drinks were amazing. the bar close to the beach by the fondue restaurant was awsome. the bartender there was very funny and we enjoyed sitting there at night. the beach is amazing. everyone recommended water shoes.... i would for children, there are only some patches, so just be careful. we didnt wear them, and it was fine. we didnt have a problem getting good chairs at the beach in the afternoon, you didnt have to save them. they cleaned our rooms everyday but one they didnt clean until around dinner time. the service by staff was good. we expected to have slow service but it was not bad at all! the resort is huge, so take some time to explore, we were finding new things all the time. the night show was good. nothing great, but good. the 2 complaints i have are simple. the day you arrive, book any alacartes you want, and be prepared for frusteration and line ups. it's not fun, expecially since some of the staff doesnt really know what they're doing when booking them. and you must book them at one of the alacartes between 9 and 1. the second complaint, the consierge was USELESS they new nothing! go to your transat representative , they klnow more, they're around the corner on your left when you walk into the riviera lobby. we had decided to get up and catch the shuttle one day to Playa Del Carmen, the Conseriege told us we did not need tickets to take the hotel shuttle. so we got up and went to take the shuttle at 10. they wouldnt let us on, it was full with people who bought tickets!! turns out you do need them, and be sure to purchase them the day before, because they fill up fast! to take a cab is only 13$ so it's not too bad. So to sum it all up, the rooms were great, nothing wrong in them, although the trick to keep you mini fridge and fan on all day , leave one of the keys in the slot! the staff was GREAT! the resort was AMAZING the beach was BEAUTIFUL all around a wonderful experiance i highly recommend this resort, although it's big with lots of rooms, it's very spread out, it doesnt seem like there are that many people there.

We\u2019ve been to several all-inclusives in Mexico, Dominican Republic and Jamaica before. We booked through Funjet and flew Northwest. Air travel was seamless (which almost never happens for us!). Transport to and from the Cancun airport was just ok. We had to make stops at other hotels which gets tedious and long. But not terrible. We arrived at the hotel right at 3pm. However, the front desk told us our room was not ready and to check back in an hour. We did just that and the room still was not ready. I asked that they work on this ASAP and they said they would. About 15 minutes later, I went back and the room was finally ready. This process was frustrating to me. While I was hanging around the front desk, I heard a family trying to resolve their room issues. They had arrived a day earlier (a family of 4) and were given a room with one queen bed. The children apparently slept on the floor for a night because the hotel couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t give them a suitable room. The two parties argued for awhile and ultimately I think the situation was resolved. On the other hand, we had asked for a king bed and got just that. Our room (8130) was exactly as we expected. Very spacious, marble everywhere, nice furnishings, great fixtures and plenty of toiletries/towels/etc. Each room has an iron, ironing board, hair dryer, safe, flat screen tv, tub and separate shower. Toiletries include a shampoo/body wash combo, bar soap, insect repellant wipes, shoe shine, comb, shower sponge, kleenex, etc. Speaking of insects, we did have quite a few mosquitoes in our 2nd floor room each day/night. We put towels over the drains but still had the issue. We both had bites on our bodies each day, but not necessarily from the skeeters\u2026 might have been from the sand fleas. Our safe stored our cash, passports, laptop and cameras; no problems whatsoever. There was free wi-fi at the resort; it worked all but one day; we loved this feature! Housekeeping didn\u2019t come until 3pm each day, but they were always reliable. One day we only got 2 bath towels (normally got 4) and no bar soap (normally got 2). We called the front desk to ask for more in order to properly get ready for dinner. We got impatient when no one came after 45 minutes and called again. Within minutes, someone was at our room with more towels and soap. A couple minutes after that, someone else came with lots of towels and more soap. Additionally, while we were at dinner, a third person dropped off more towels and soap. On another day, our toilet stopped flushing. The chain in the water reservoir had broken. We called the front desk and within 3 minutes, two maintenance guys arrived and fixed our problem. Good response in both cases. The resort\u2019s buildings and grounds are beautiful. Other folks are right about the vegetation being new and needing to grow some to fill things out. But not a big deal. The pool was huge and well maintained. It had varying depths and was slightly salty (which I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like, but I did). There were two kids pools as well. We did not purchase the Platinum package and we hardly noticed that we were missing anything. The beach was nice, but the ocean was a huge disappointment. There were rocks (big and little) nearly everywhere. Also, it is very shallow (no more than chest-deep in the entire roped-off area for Princess). This made for poor floating, frolicking, snorkeling, boogie-boarding, kayaking, etc etc etc. If you are an ocean person \u2013 stay elsewhere. The beach itself had very nice sand and was very wide. It had lots of beach chairs, plenty of shaded huts and the drinks were brought to you! Put on plenty of insect repellant if you do not want the near-invisible sand fleas to bite you. You can walk forever in either direction down the beach. This makes for great exercise. The walk from lobby (and our room which was close to the lobby) to the beach is rather long. We guessed it was a half mile. Be prepared to walk a lot, in any case. The service was decent at the buffets and restaurants. In some cases, it was excellent. The buffets got repetitive with the same items on them often. Still, we didn\u2019t go hungry (quite the opposite). We ate at 3 specialty restaurants \u2013 Grill, Mexican, Japanese. The Grill was forgettable and very similar to the buffets, except for the beef tail soup which was excellent. The Mexican was very tasty, especially the \u2018salad bar\u2019 which we enjoyed immensely. The Japanese was fantastic \u2013 more so because we sat at the hibachi grill. Everything was tasty and our service was great. Drinks throughout the resort were always flowing and were usually very tasty. Bars are everywhere at this resort. The sports bar is open 24 hrs and has food (hot dogs, sandwiches, nachos, popcorn) for your all-hours cravings. They have several TVs, fooseball tables and pool tables. The resort is mainly visited by Canadians, followed by Europeans and then Americans. Unfortunately, we ran into some of the rudest and loudest Canadians on this trip than we\u2019d ever encountered before. They complained about every little issue as if it were some major deal. They were rude to the staff repeatedly and we rarely saw them tip anyone. In fact, at the Japanese restaurant, we sat at the grill with a group of French Canadians who were bossing the waiter and chef around like little kids. They insisted on being served a certain soup that was not even on the menu! When the waiter explained it wasn\u2019t on the menu, the loudest lady in the group demanded to see his supervisor (we were completely appalled and embarrassed by this). These folks work hard and want to do a good job. They also want to keep their jobs and it was obvious that by the woman requesting his supervisor, that he thought he would be in major trouble (lose his job?). He jumped through hoops (probably having to run across the resort or having the cook make the soup special) to appease this woman. Another woman in this group ordered \u201csushi without seafood.\u201d The waiter was confused by this but made it happen special for her; it seemed preposterous to us. We loved this restaurant the most, but couldn\u2019t wait to get away from these ridiculous people. We are guessing that a lot of the negative reviews on here have been written by similar folks. There is construction (right behind our room even) throughout the resort. They are adding rooms and other facilities. It didn\u2019t bother us much, but people should be aware of the sawing, pounding and other construction noise. Our room was very close to the lobby and disco, but we only heard faint noises from there. Not enough to disturb our sleep and we go to bed early. One noise that did annoy us was in/around our room. It happened every 5 or 10 minutes, off and on, throughout our stay. We never found the source, but it sounded like it was in the walls or ceiling. It sounded like a winding up noise followed by a rather loud bang. This occurred at night quite often. Maybe it was the AC or water pipes? We\u2019ll never know. By our last day, we were sick of it; we never talked to anyone about it, so it\u2019s our fault for putting up with it for a week. We took two day trips \u2013 one to Tulum and one to Playa del Carmen. Tulum is pretty neat, but our guide wasn\u2019t very good. Nonetheless, the ruins are interesting and the beach/location is breath-taking. I recommend going at least once in life. We\u2019d been to Playa before \u2013 it is much nicer than in the past. Less aggressive as it relates to shopkeepers, though they still try to get you in their stores and bargain like crazy. We enjoyed our stay at this resort, but will likely not return. It is nice enough, but it\u2019s a not a place we\u2019ll call \u2018home.\u2019 We\u2019ve never repeated a stay at any particular resort, but are fond of the Iberostar chain. The Grand Riviera Princess is simply not as good as the Iberostar just up the road, which we\u2019ve stayed at before.

We left on April 9th and returned on the 13th. I have to admit that check in was a little crazy. We arrived early and our rooms were not ready. Ok, I understand that, but a few rooms were not ready until after 5:00. We had to do some room switching due to smell and missing furniture. One of the rooms even had a leak, but they came immediately and fixed it. Once we got pass the check in everything else fell into place. This is a beautiful resort! We stayed in the Platinum Suites. I am going to give you all the tips I wish we would have gotten. 1. You have your own conceriege in the Platinum Lounge. They are there 24 hours a day. 2. Give the late night conceriege at the platinum lounge some money and he will save you some chairs out by the platinum pool. 3. The first thing you should do is make dinner reservations!!!!! Our travel agent was supposed to do this and it was not done. We didn't have a lot of options by the time we did it. 4. There are internet connected computers in the platinum lounge for platinum guests. 5. Go to the breakfast buffet's by the platinum lounges, they are great.

Two adults in our early 40s and 2 children ages 9 &12. We have been to Mexico before as well as other locations in the Caribbean. We read all the reviews on trip advisor prior to our trip and I was quite nervous about our stay........for NO reason. We had a great trip. We were at the Princess (Riviera Side) from March 25-April 1,2008 We did not have any major problems and would recommend this resort to others as well as go again. The previous review by Phanyl from Sydeny was very on the mark. We did not travel with the company she used so that is the only thing I can not agree or disagree with. Everything else in that review was very true for us as well. We had a basic junior sutie which we were very happy with. Clean room, great housekeeping and fridge was always stocked. We did tip on a regular basis ($5 for maid $2 fridge) We loved our location #7138. Our shower did leak a little but we just used a towel to fix that problem. We never had problems with our safe or with bugs of any kind! The food was what we expect from an all inclusive. Very plentiful and average to above average for some meals. We were allowed to make 3 a la carte reservations. We ate in the Mexican which we all loved, the Grill was ok, and the Italian was good. We liked the breakfast buffet best. One note: one night for dinner at the Sunset buffet my 9 year old daughter asked one of the chefs if they had chicken nuggest. They did not have any out but he told her to hold on and 5 minutes later he came out with a plate of nuggest for her. I thought this was great! We enjoyed the sports bar with the kids. It would be nice if they had more of a selection of snacks (just hot dogs, nachos and ham/cheese sandwiches) but it was fine for hanging out. We did not see any of the shows in the auditorium but caught a few out in the courtyard which were good. Just wanted to add that my kids LOVED the staff in the kids club. My daughter asked to go almost everyday. My son would join the kids at the pool when the club came for water polo and he would go in the evening to play PS3. We did visit the beach a few times but my children liked hanging out at the pool where all of the activities were being held. The beach was pretty. Yes, the ocean floor was a little rocky but the children just wore water shoes. FYI we took blow up rafts to use in the pool and at the beach. Again, overall we had a great vacation. Everyone we encountered was very friendly and polite. The kids club staff was great! The food decent. The rooms very pretty. Plenty of pools, nice beach and lots to do.

It is a new resort and very beautiful but we would never go back. The resort is huge with 1300 rooms, our first room was 1km from the beach. We checked in late on Friday night and had no problems there, we got to our room ( which was really nice), but it was across the lobby from the disco. The music was really loud and we had people yelling right outside our room. We were told when we checked in that if we did not like our room to come back in the morning and we could get a room change. We had no sleep on Friday night and I was down at the front desk at 7:00 am to request the change. The staff was very rude to me and didn't believe that I could hear the noise. They told me the hotel was booked and we would not be able to change rooms, I told him that this was unacceptable and we would not tolerate the noise. We had heard from other guests that they were offered free up-grades and room changes when the checked in the night before, so I am not sure why we had such a problem. I told him that people were checking out and I wanted one of those rooms, he put my name on a list and told me to come back. I went back and was told again that no room change would be possible ( we even offered them money), finally on Sunday we were given our new room - we had to move our own bags as well. Our new room was great, very quiet and a nice view. The second problem we had was getting bottled water. We got down to the pool about 10:00 am, and could not find a bar or restuarant to give us water. And as the resort is so huge, I was walking around for about 20 min before I found a place to give me a glass of water. We requested room service and it took 3 hours to get there and they refused to give us extra bottles of water. The other issue is the restaurant reservations, I had to wait in line for over an hour to book and I did not get the restaurants I wanted and the earliest we could eat was 8:40 pm. The major issue is the resort is too big and be prepared to walk alot. I had read this before I left and you really do alot of walking. The pools and beach are fantastic and the weather is ideal. The staff in the buffets and restaurants are great. Our room was always cleaned well and no complaints there. We had no problems with mosquitos but many people did. Also the beach is rocky so bring water shoes. Smoking is everywhere, even in the rooms and the bars. The beach is littered with cigarette butts and it's hard to get a breath of fresh air due to all the smokers. We loved Playa Del Carmen and recommend a day there for sure. We booked a tour with the hotel and went to Tulum and Xla-ha, which we loved. We met great people who all had the same complaints. The food at the buffet is okay, not much change in the items from day to day and it was usually cold.

We traveled with two other couples and we were all supposed to be booked in the swim up deluxe juniors and somewhat close together. Upon arrival we were told that our rooms were over booked but they would upgrade us...nice:) Well my husband and I got upgraded to \"the villas\" but the other two couples got downgraded to the junior suite both on totally opposite ends of the resort. My husband and I of course loved our room :) but our friends were stuck in rooms that smelled of sewage and were not cleaned plus one couple had a ton of mosquitos! They did however give us all Platinum wristbands which at the time ment nothing. Anyway the front desk told us to come back the next day and we would \"maybe\" get our rooms we booked. So we called it good and decided to ride it out. The next day we returned and they stated there was still no swimup rooms and we could check the next day but no guarentee. Needless to say my husband was ticked. We did not feel comfortable having this awesome room while our friends stayed in rooms that were less than they paid for. Plus who wants to spent everyday of there vacation trying to switch rooms. My husband marched down to the lobby and calmly told them they either get us our booked rooms or move us all to the villas or platium area. Well they blamed this whole mess on our Funjet representative, which when he found out he was pissed, but our rep ended uo getting us all moved to the Platinum area which matched our wristbands by the end our third night. Anyway...besides the mix up with the rooms we had a blast even when we were stuck in rooms that werent right . We stayed positive and enjoyed our 9 day vacation. Just remember be assertive but calm. Resort in general was fabulous! Big, modern and beautiful. There were so many pools but we ended up sticking to the party pool for our wild days and the Platium private pool for the other wild days. We atcually preferred the private one because the party pool was salt water and it really irritated our eyes...and tasted horrible. O.K. I can hear people now, well keep your eyes closed underwater and your mouth shut..lol! We also really enjoyed the people at the Platinum because it was kind of like your own little community. Plus your very own concierge, bartender and butler..sweet. Beaches were good. I think I have seen better but they were still beautiful and the waittresses on the beach were great. Beach bar was a blast! Jose, Jesus and Joel were hilarious. We never had to wait but a minute for our drinks and they are total comedians. The food was overall really good. We hated the buffet that was up by the lobby but the buffett that was by close to the middle of the resort was awesome. Make sure you book all your restaurants with the concierge as soon as you can for your whole stay. My favorite was the sushi and Italian. Fondu was really kinda fun but interesting. We also ate at the mexican one and it was pretty darn good. Service at the restaurants is great! Spa was also nice. Seemed alittle expensive, but the massages were excellent ( you get a free one with Platinum room 7 days and longer). The staff at this resort is mostly great. Some were nice and some werent, kinda like the other vacationers. I really do think this place needs a new front desk and a new map but entertainment was nice and I can't say it enough, the grounds are amazing. Enjoy your stay and get over the annoying mistakes. Your on vacation!!!! I would recommend upgrading to the Platinum suites if you can afford it or if you get lucky enough to get upgraded for overbooking. The staff, 24 hr room service (free), jetted tubs on the deck and in the bathroom, ocean views, beach parties, private bartenders, private pools, no limits on how many restaurants you can eat at and great concierge named Diane that will get you anything...WONDERFUL.

First off, I was very impressed by the hotel. The biggest resort I have ever seen, Huge! beautiful though, very clean. The landscaping is outstanding. The first day we arrived at 10:30 am and had to wait until 3:30 for our rooms. We headed straight for the swim up bars. The pools are huge and flow all the way along the length of the resort, I think there are 3 main pools. The drinks are great, all premium brand liqour. The rooms are beautiful, Jacuzzis in every room, Big comfy beds, lots of room. Before I came I read reviews about mosquitos, I only saw about 2 the whole time. We saw about 300 iguanas in the time we were there. We never had a problem with our rooms being cleaned, they were always clean and had little towel creatures on our bed everyday. There were some minor problems, The room service is a complete joke, don't even bother, if you ever do get your food it will be cold and then they will charge you outrageous amounts. We had to pay $40.00 US for 2 sandwiches. We had a hard time getting bottled water for our room for some reason. The walk from the lobby to the beach is about 15 minutes, which I didn't mind but in 40 above weather can be quite a hike. If u r staying in the 6000 rooms it is not far to the beach but then the buffet is by the lobby, so either way you walk quite a bit. The disco was fun, definately need more bartenders. Actually the whole place could use about double the staff, the service is not the greatest, you can really tell it is a brand new hotel. We had to wait every where we went, buffets, bars, a la cartes, etc. We could only get into one out three of our a la cartes. They were so booked that you had to wait for hours for an opening. There is not much entertainment around the pool but the swim up bars are good, except for the waiting for your drinks. The food was alright, same thing everyday though, not much selection at all. The best day of our trip was the tour we went on. We toured with Ed Adventure on Monday the 7th. Left the hotel at 8am went to Tulum to see the ruins so hot in there but very cool. The most beautiful beach you've ever seen right there. From there went another spot and went into the jungle for some ziplining, and a visit with some monkeys. Then we went snorkeling at the under ground caves That was great, right where the movie \"The Cave\" was filmed. From there he took us to another snorkeling spot. We saw coral, huge sea turtles, schools of fish, a barracuda, sting rays and more. Our driver then took us to this great little restaurant on the beach, the food was incredible (had to pay ourselves but really worth it) After some great food and Coronas we went to ANOTHER snorkeling spot called \"swim with 1000 fishes\" A nice little lagoon with tons of fish. We arrive dback at our hotel at 8:00pm. Awesome day. With all of that it was about $80.00 US person. We went with a group of 11 people. No big hot bus with a hundred strangers! We got to do things at our own pace, our driver was awesome! He got a good tip for waiting around for us all day long and looking after the van with all of our stuff in it. All in all it was a pretty good trip, I think this resort will be better when they get all of the kinks out, and hire some more staff. I would probably rate this about a 4.0.

TRAVEL TO MEXICO: On Fri Mar 28th we flew out of the Halifax airport. We flew on a WestJet plane. It was a 5 hrs 15 min flight. We landed at around 11pm Cancun time. When you step off the plane and into the Cancun airport, the first thing you'll notice is a sudden rise in temperature and humidity! The second thing you'll notice is a smell. Not a horrible smell, just a different scent. Hard to explain, but we only noticed it when we were indoors, not outdoors. Near the end of your vacation you don't even notice the smell anymore. Anyway, we were herded to \"Immigration\" (Aduana). After we are cleared by the Immigration Inspector we were allowed to get our luggage from the carousel. Once we found our luggage we stood in line to go through Customs. Easy, the Customs guy looks at your \"Customs Declaration\" card and then asks you to push a big red button then you walk through and your are free! (We were amused by this big red button thing, we later found out this is their \"Automated Selection System\", it randomly determines whether your luggage will be submitted to inspection or released. Anyway we were lucky, we were not inconvienced by a luggage inspected.) We walked out of the airport and found the Transat Holiday person. We were told which bus to jump on. We waited in the bus for a little while, then at 12:35am Cancun time we left the airport. There was a driver and a host, they were friendly, they had a cooler of beer and other drinks for us for fair prices. It was approximately a 45 minute drive to the \"Grand Riviera Princess\". CHECK-IN: It was nearly 1:30am by the time we disembarked the bus and got our luggage. Check in was virutally instantaneous. We got room 8015. We were given two room keys and a resort map. We were asked to wait for the bellhop to take us to our room, but we felt adventurous, so we tried to find it on our own. Not the best idea, but anyway, with a little help from a maintenance worker we found our room about 30 minutes later. CONDITION OF ROOM UPON ARRIVAL: The room is like walking into an episode of MTV Cribs. Marble everywhere, beautifully furnished. The faucets are \"Moen\" brand and the ceiling fan is \"Hunter\" brand. Our complimentary Tequila bottle was there as promised and the \"fruit basket\". Unfortunately, the room wasn't in perfect condition when we arrived. It was only half done. The bathroom had bath towels, but no hand towels, and no face clothes, and no toiletries. (Not a big deal) On the brightside there was toilet paper!! LOL. The robes and slippers were missing. The minibar was not stocked and there was an opened half-consumed can of beer in the minibar, eww. I was disappointed that the minibar had no bottles of water because we were both parched! We left our room and went looking for the 24 hour sports bar called \"5th Avenue\". We found the place but unfortunately, they had run out of bottled water. So we trekked our way to the front desk (we are tired and cranky and thirsty by now). Anyway long story short, we found water and returned to our room and we fell into our beds around 3am Cancun time (which was 6am home time, so needless to say we were exhausted.) TRANSAT HOLIDAY ORIENTATION: We slept only 4 hours because we were asked to attend the 9am \"Transat Holiday Orientation class\". It is strongly encouraged you attend this orientation. So we got up, made ourselves presentable, found the buffet and had breakfast and then went to the lobby to meet the Transat people. Everyone met in the lobby then we were led to a conference room. We met Josee and Blaise, both are Transat Holiday employees, they are Canadians, they speak English, French and Spanish (and maybe more who knows). Josee is a friendly lady and informative and outgoing. She gave us lots of good information about the resort itself and the surrounding towns and tours and attractions. TYPES OF ROOMS AVAILABLE: According to the official website (http://www.princess-hotels.com/web/EN/FPW/29_Resultados_Busqueda_Hoteles.asp) there are four classes of rooms: 1) Junior Suite 2) Deluxe Junior Suite (some with direct access to pool) 3) Platnium Suite 4) Laguna Villa Suite Our room looked exactly like in the photos. No disappointments. Our \"Hotel Voucher\" says we were entitled to a \"REGENCY RIVIERA PRINCES DLXJST\" or in other words a \"Deluxe Junior Suite\" however our room was not the kind with direct access to the pool. Just because you paid for a \"Deluxe Junior Suite\" does not mean you will have a swim up room. SUNSET SIDE AND RIVIERA SIDE: From the highway there is one entrance to the resort and it is just labelled \"Princess\" from the highway. However once you are on the property this resort site is treated/marketed as two separate resorts. On one side is the \"GRAND RIVIERA PRINCESS\" and on the other side is the \"GRAND SUNSET PRINCESS\". Each is a mirror reflection of the other, in terms of layout. In the shared main/principal building there are two lobbys. The disco is shared between them, also the gym, the spa, the 24 hour sports bar, etc. But really, from the guest's point of view, I don't understand why they have done this, as far as I am concerned it is just one super big resort. As a guest, you have access to it all. INTERNET: If you are a \"Transat Holiday\" guest then you have access to two internet computers in the Transat room. Josee and Blaise ask you to respect the 15 minute limit out of the respect for the other waiting guests. In our case, there was always a line up for the internet - so go to the bar and get a drink, and get ready to sit & wait. I suggest you try to start up a conversation with the other people waiting - it makes the time go by. The Transat room has odd hours, they are open morning and evening but not afternoon. There is a schedule posted on the door and a \"Be Back At: _____\" sign. RESTAURANTS: After orientation, your first job is to reserve your a la carte restaurants. The Transat staff, Josee and Blaise, told us to go to any of the a la carte restaurants to make all of our reservations. We stood in line at the Mizo the Japanese Restaurant and they took all of our reservations for the whole week. We were allowed 3 reservations. We stood in line for at least an hour. To pass the time we chatted with the couples ahead and behind us. The restaurants are: * LA HACIENDA (Mexican) - located in main building on lobby floor * LE FLEUR (Gourmet International) - located in main building on lobby floor * MISO (Japanese) - located in main building on lobby floor * LA VAQUERIA (Grill) - located in main building on lobby floor * MAMMA MIA (Mediterranian-Italian) - located in main building on lobby floor * LA FONDUE (Swiss) - located at the restaurant near beach * LAS OLAS (Seafood) - located at the restaurant near beach Hint: the restaurants are described in English on the cardboard jacket that your room keys came in!!! Hint: Dress Code, no shorts. Bring dress pants. BUFFETS: There are two buffets in the main building open for breakfast/lunch/supper. There are two buffets near the beach open for strictly breakfast and lunch. The buffets are not bad but they are not great. They are good. They are satisfactory. Please have realistic expectations. If you go there expecting a spectacular, blow your mind Las Vegas style buffet restaurant like the \"Spice Market Buffet\" in Planet Hollywood on the Strip, then yeah you'll be disappointed. I was not \"wowed\" by the food, but I was not let down either. There was variety. POOLS: Lots of them. Great. Different pools for different people. Party pool. Kid pool. Etc. Lots of chairs and many 4-post thatch huts with mattresses. BEACH: Nice fine sand. Nice shore for romantic walks. Lots of chairs. Many thatch umbrellas for shade. Now I'll talk about the water itself and the ocean floor. It is not spectacular clear turquoise blue calm waters here. This is not opinion, it is fact. I was surprised, some times during the day the water felt cooler, and other times during the day it felt warm and inviting. The ocean floor is not 100% silky soft sand. Other reviewers have been calling it \"rocky\" so I was imagining pebbly rocks, but no that is not it, the ocean floor is 40% nice fine sand, but the other 60% is like uneven bedrock, be careful you can easily twist your ankle. Black-ish vegetation grows on 50% of the bedrock. Some days the water was black-ish and nearly opaque near the shore (first 25 feet of water) from stirred up sand, sediment and bits and pieces of the black vegetation. THE STAFF, MINIMUM WAGE, AND TIPPING: We were so impressed by how hard these people worked. They are everywhere on the resort. They smile and say \"Hola\". I wonder if they resent us vacationers - if they do they don't show it. Sit and watch them, they are like ants. Go, go, go. They seem tireless. We heard through the grapevine that mayan workers are paid by the day, not by the hour. They make around $50 PESOs per day for a FULL day (not a measly 7.5 hours). When I returned home I did a google search and according to http://www.mexicanlaws.com/STPS/MINWAGES2008.htm the minimum daily wage for 2008 in the mexican state of \"Quintana Roo\" is $49.50 PESOS. Thats about $5 bucks per day. We were told by the Transat staff during orientation that we were not expected to tip, but it was not discouraged either. We were told the tips are pooled together and shared among the staff. We were told we can tip daily or leave one big tip at the end of the visit. We flew down with $2000 PESOS for tipping. ($200 bucks CDN). Every other day, we left $50 PESO on the pillow for housekeeping ($20's are very hard to come by) and another $50 PESOS for the minibar restocker person. We chose to tip the buffet restaurant once per day, rather than every meal. We tipped every bus driver, every taxi driver. You drop the equivalent of a twoonie or 5 bucks here and there - it brightens their day. WALKING: If I had to guess, I'd guess that from the main building to the beach it is 3/4 of a kilometer. Depending on your stride, it could be walked in 5 - 10 minutes. Not a big deal, but at the end of the day, it all adds up. Yes, absolutely you do walk a lot. You wake up, walk to the buffet, walk back to your room, walk to the internet room, walk to the pool, walk to the bar, walk back to the pool, then it is lunch, so walk to the buffet, then walk to your room, then maybe walk to the beach and walk the shoreline, then walk back to the pool etc, etc, etc. Lots of walking. Fact. Thank goodness I wore CROCS, otherwise my feet would be in sorry shape. SHOWER: In past reviews you may have noticed people complaining about leaky shower stalls or flooded bathroom floors. Yes it is true. In our room, the first time I took a shower, I noticed a little river of water had left the shower stall (very dangerous on slippery marble floors). This is because the shower floor is not properly sloped. The solution is easy, wrap a couple hand towels around the base of your shower. Don't let this ruin your vacation. Small stuff. CONSTRUCTION: On the Riviera side, on the outer edge, there is construction going on. According to Blaise in the Transat room they are building another 1000 rooms!!! Currently in the entire resort there are 20 buildings, housing 1348 rooms. Add to that another 1000 rooms. That will bring to the total to nearly 2500 rooms. The buildings are no higher then 3 floors. This is a Mega-Resort. The construction did not disrupt any part of our vacation, despite the fact that our room was next to the construction. HOUSEKEEPING: Good, our room was done up every day. Our minibar was stocked everyday. It doesn't look like they mop the marble floors in the rooms, I saw them sweep the rooms. The jacuzzi tub had some kind of film on it, it didn't look squeaky clean, we never used it. No big deal. BUGS: Other reviewers complained a lot about bugs and mosquitos... so I packed bug spray. I am happy to report I never used it once!! Yes, our room was on the ground floor, room 8015. I am the biggest whimp when it comes to insects and I have to say the bugs did NOT bother me. They are minimal. At any one time there were maybe three mosquitos in our particular room. Maybe some rooms are worse then ours. During the entire trip I got two mosquito bites and the funny thing is they don't itch!!!! Weird. I did find two centipedes in our room during the week and one beetle. Nothing big, scary, or fast moving. Never found any bugs of any kind in the bed. Hint: put a towel under your door, it seems to be the only way they can get in your room, otherwise the rooms are pretty tight. It is obvious they do use pesticides and fumigate, because you find dead bugs on the marble walkways. Including beautiful butterflies, which is sad. Keep in mind this is a resort in the middle of the JUNGLE, there will be bugs. But we feel they have a handle on it. Now I spoke to a woman and she said she was being eaten alive... who knows, maybe Albertans are tastier. NIGHTLY SHOWS: Every night in the big theater (above the spa/gym) there is a show at 9:30pm. Lots of dancing and costume changes. Usually 45 mins long. We went to two shows. Both shows started on time. There is a bar in the theater. SPA/GYM: No comment. Didn't go to either. MERCHANTS: Every Saturday merchants come to the resort and setup in the main courtyard. Like a big market. I bought a bowl from one guy, he spoke perfect English. It was a treat. SUNBURNS AND SPF: Every second person down here is sunburnt. Warning: the sun will chew right through your SPF 30 even when you reapply regularly. One day I spent most of the day at the beach and I applied and reapplied SPF30 but my shoulders still burned. I recommend SPF50. SPF50 is what we used on our trip to Chichen Itza and we were fine. TRANSAT THURSDAY NIGHT BEACH PARTY: Buffet on the beach. Good socializing. Nice time. CHECK-OUT It was a breeze. Check out is at 12:00pm. THEFT: Did not experience it ourselves. Did not hear anyone speaking of it. CONCLUSION Again, I want to emphasize that overall, despite some minor glitches, we had a very lovely vacation. Worth every penny. Yes I would go back to the \"Grand Riviera Princess\".", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Manitoba", "Title": "\u201cOk, but not in the 5 star league\u201d", "Author": "Ianwpg", "ReviewID": "UR14867449", "Content": "Since I probably read over 100 reviews on this property, I felt obligated to write a review based on my experiences. I have travelled to the Mayan on a few other occasions and have stayed at Iberostar Lindo and the Barcelo complex. We stayed the first week of April in the GRP side. The GRP and the GSP are the same hotel \u2013 just different sides. Our journey had us arrive at the hotel at noon, and we immediately checked in at the platinum desk located in the Sunset lobby. Then we were whisked away by trolley to the platinum section. We were told, surprisingly, that our room was ready ( I had been expecting the 3pm story). Went to out room \u2013 no view (concrete wall in front of us, and workers making noise in the room next door, no king bed. Back to the lobby and received a main floor ocean view room \u2013 much better, but no king bed just doubles. We decided to stay and just pushed both beds together. We immediately noticed that the sliding door on to the patio was broken and could open when locked. It was fixed quickly with a couple turns of a screwdriver, but its a tiny latch that anyone with a good pull could open it. We were concerned about thefts, and when we were in the platinum lounge there was a distraught woman there who was leaving that day and her room had been broken into with things missing \u2013 I do not think it was the safe though. We noticed throughout the trip that the finishing carpentry and quality of workmanship was very poor. For a supposed 5 star resort, they must have used the cheapest materials and labour they could find. We were not overly impressed with the overall look of the resort. Yes it definately has beauty to it, but it\u2019s a very modern looking place. We were hoping for more of a Mexican flavour, but the place is painted almost entirely in white and gets quite boring after a few days. The marble is nice and the grounds well kept, but again the finishing work is very poor, especially in the rooms. The rooms are generally quite nice (platinum section) \u2013 good size, nice bathrooms, great shower and two sinks, nice Jacuzzi tub. The cleaning of the rooms was inconsistent, usually around 4pm and just did the bare bones cleaning. We tipped most days, but found it did not help one bit. Mini bar was filled everyday, ut only with 4 water bottles and 2 beers. We were always searching for more water. There were mosquitoes in our room. I had read many reviews with differing opinions on the bug situation, but make no mistake there are mosquitoes. We had a main floor room near the mangrove, which probably made it much worse. We usually killed about 10 bugs before bed, but always got a few bites over night and then killed the blood filled ones in the morning when we found them. I would suggest to not get a main floor room for this reason. With platinum you get to book all your al a carte restaurant via the concierge in the lounge. It takes about 15 mins and you are set for the week \u2013 works well. We ate at the following: Le Fleur (international) \u2013 excellent \u2013 try the lamb or sea bass Mexican \u2013 good, but expected more considering where you are. Miso (Japanese) \u2013 very poor, we ordered off the menu, book the teppanyaki side for better food. Grill restaurant \u2013 very poor, the pork was so tough you could not even cut it with a knife. Seafood \u2013 very good. Mama mia \u2013 excellent \u2013 try the veal. Beach dinner (for platinum) \u2013 a big bbq/buffet \u2013 was very good. The buffets were not good. Lots of selection but cold food, undercooked. If you are willing to stand in line and wait for an omelette, or grilled meat/pasta then that was very good. The liquor was premium, but only if you asked for it up front, and you still had to watch the bartender as they are so used to grabbing to cheap stuff. If you are staying in platinum make sure you find Jaime the bartender and get him to make you a margarita on the rocks \u2013 the best ever! The entertainment was not good \u2013 they were trying there best but its just not up to snuff. Lots of people get up and leave. The pools \u2013 are very nice and lots of them, but they are not connected in anyway. The junior deluxe swim out rooms have their own access. The beach \u2013 very nice, large, nice sand; however bring your water shoes as there are lots of rocks in the water. People wince in pain as they go out and come back in if you are bare footed. Overall, our trip to the GRP was good, but there are still many issues the resort has to deal with. We would never go back to the GRP as we know there are superior places nearby. If you are going in the near future \u2013 book platinum!! This way you can avoid the a la carte reservation line ups, have your own private pool, lounge, etc\u2026.its worth the extra to make your stay bearable. If you cant \u2013 then go elsewhere! Many have mentioned that the price of this resort will probably be double in a year from now. I highly disagree with this as they are a very average resort on the Mayan strip \u2013 not nearly the same calibre as the Iberostar, Barcleo\u2019s, and Bahia Principe\u2019s of the strip. They will have to always be at the same price or a slight discount to these resorts \u2013 just my humble opinion!

Our group consisted of 30-something aged, experienced travelers who've been to all inclusives previously, some to Cuba, others the DR and still others to different areas of Mexico. Before booking, we of course did our research which included sifting through mountains of testimonials on this site and on others. Admittedly there was some trepidation given some of the negative posts (typical complaints were service issues, size of hotel, and food), but, we went with a positive attitude and were not disappointed. My review will touch on the five key areas vacation travelers like myself typically focus on (1) Flight and Bus Trip and Check-In (2) Rooms (3) Food (4) Pool/Beach (5) Service and intangibles (1) Flight , Bus and Check-In: We booked through Transat tours and had a direct flight to the Cancun Airport which was a welcome change from having to be rerouted through Toronto or somewhere else. Flight there was slightly delayed but in fact allowed us to purchase last minute items in the Ottawa airport and have a quick snack before departing. Flight itself there and back was what it was...low budget, but with a friendly crew and in-flight food service (free), a welcome change from Air Canada. Bus trip from Cancun Airport to the resort was about 50 minutes, and our on-bus host was humourous and set the vacation off on the right foot with a few cervaca's (sp?) . Check in and check out at the hotel was smooth, and I was able to use my beginner level Spanish to get rooms very well located near the beach at the main pool area. (2) Rooms: Rooms are beautiful, resort is brand new, big beds, very clean, bathrooms are great, with a large spa tub, sepearte shower (rainfall type shower head), double sinks, and the room had all marble floors with a good sized flatscreen TV, A/C and a minifridge that was always stocked with water, pop and beers. A welcome fruit plate and tequila bottle was a nice touch. Rooms were always clean and had no issue getting extra water, again, a little spanish and courtesy works nicely. Two tips on rooms: try to get one on the second or third floor, especially if you like sleeping in late or during the afternoon, first floor where we stayed was noisy with kids (and adults) running down the hall. Second, any credit card or points card can work in the slot which keeps the energy on when you are out of the room, so if you want AC on all day and a nice cool room when you return, use one of those you aren't afraid of losing since you are only given one room key. (3) Food: Food was really good, buffet was nice, and the Italian restaurant was probably the favourite of our group. Tip: skip the fondue restaurant unless you are looking to kill 3 hours, fondue by its nature takes a long time to get through anyway, but that restaurant was really the only one I'd avoid next time. (4) Pool/Beach: Excellent, excellent beach, very clean, plenty of payapas (umbrellas) and loungers on the beach. Tip: if you have an IPOD and want some beach entertainment, pick up a 60 dollar IPOD player to bring on the trip, it was a great way to meet people and kept our group entertained. Also, there was always a volleyball game going on and thankfully no one hassling you to buy souveniers or take part in the games if you didn't want to. Pools are vast and beautiful, probably the nicest pools of all the places I've stayed at. Older crowd tended to gather around the main pool with the swim up bar and poolside games in the afternon, the Princess team did a good job getting people involved and seemed geniune. Tip: As with all resorts, towel saving of loungers can get annoying, so throwing yours out early in the morning will save you alot of grief. If you can't beat 'em... (5) Service: This was something I was worried about before going having read the negative reviews, but you'd be amazed what a friendly attitude, a bit of spanish and a couple of tips will do. We never had any service issues, and infact, found the staff warm and friendly. ESPECIALLY TO CANADIANS. I had several conversations with employees wearing Canadian flag pins who suggested to me in Spanish that they were big fans of Canadians. Which isn't to say they have negative views of other nationalities....or that all Canadians are nice, because I know many that aren't. The point is, saying your from Canada (even if you aren't) is a cliche travel tip but really works wonders, as does practicing a bit of spanish. The people who I witnessed blowing up at the staff did nothing to endear themselves or their country-men to the people there. Perhaps these people need to take a deep breath, have a pina coloda, and remember they are on vacation to relax. If you don't get your towel in two minutes, relax. Intangibles: Best thing about the trip, was Playa Del Carmen, which is a 15 minute cab ride from the hotel and offers great shopping and night life. The disco is a bit lame, mainly due to the fact that most people head to Cancun or Playa at night, but the 24 hour sports bar is nice and a great place to end the night for an afterhours beer or hotdog, or to discuss that nights events and meet new people. An after dinner cafe con leche or cafecito or cappucino is always available at bars in the lobby area, with great views of the resort and a nice caffeine boost before the all night partying. And make no mistake....the resort IS BIG, no doubt. But here is the good thing about a big resort. First, you don't get bored, and because there's plenty to explore. Second, because you do so much walking, myself and several others LOST weight despite the all you can drink and eat surrounding us thus the walking provides great exercise. Third, there is a trolley service, and although its hit or miss, does exist and I'm sure if you waited long enough there is a trolley ever...30 mins., but we never took the trolley. Honestly, you get used to the walk, and the place is beautiful so SUCK IT UP complainer nation, these same people would complain if it were too small I imagine. To summarize, this was a fantastic vacation. I'm guessing those that have been negative either had specific incidents that didn't happen to me or anyone in my group, or perhaps their expectations were too high given it is listed as a five star. I've stayed in five stars in Shanghai, NYC, and Hong Kong, and granted, this would never compare....... But for an all inclusive in Mexico in a beautiful area, with great food, good brand name booze, and an overall great resort, why complain. Go to the Princess, enjoy yourself, and don't let the negative nancies win!!!!", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "ONTARIO", "Title": "\u201cHAD 4 STAR FUN\u201d", "Author": "bill1134", "ReviewID": "UR14834699", "Content": "My wife and i just returned from a week at the Grand Riviera Maya Princess in a junior deluxe pool suite .We have been to the area three previous times.The room was excellant ,everything worked,the bed and the pillows were very comfortable,great shower always lots of hot water.The only thing we found fault in was the room safe, a flat screw driver is all thats needed to open it after lifting up the label.Because of this ,theft is a big problem at the resort.We talked to few people who had money missing from their room.House cleaning was OK for me ,but not up to my wife`s standards.The beach is very crowded so early towels on the chairs are nessesary .

I read many reviews before leaving. Happy to say that I am glad I did not put much trust in the reviews. The resort is fabulous. Beautiful grounds, nice pools and a very nice beach. Yes there is some rock issues in the ocean, wear proper shoes and who cares you are in a beautiful location with the water and very nice sand and you are on vacation. With respect to the common complaint about the shower leaking. Big deal, use the floor mat towel that they give you. It is not a major puddle of water. When we arrived at the hotel, we checked in privately with platinum. The best way to go. We were told by our travel agent through Manitoba Motor League that we would get ocean view. Uh uh. Our travel agent was useless. Never through motor league again. We managed to get upgraded to ocean view. You just have to be polite, understanding and give a tip. They appreciate this and they will try to accomodate you. Dianne the concierge in the pLatinum lounge was awesome. Very helpful. Thanks to her we got ocean view. It was worth every penny of the tip. Yes tipping gets you far at this resort and any other resort. I gave the maid a tip on the first day and every day the room was cleanned perfectly, little animals were mad and placed on the bed. I tipped the man who stocked the fridge on the first day, and told him what I wanted and voila every day the fridge was stocked. It was so worth tipping. In the plantinum lounge we tipped the bartender and voila again he is your long lost friend. You get what you pay for. It was awesome. The food was good but nothing great. There is plenty of it. Fresh fruit, great ice cream and the soups at each restaurant and room service soup was fabulous. The breakfast buffet was always the same. Got boring. The Japanese restuarant was the best. At the plantinum lounge, you got everyday, breakfast snacks, lunch snacks and dinner snacks. This ranged from cookies and fresh fruit, coffee, etc to smoked samoln, salsa and chips with fruit and various cheeses and various pastries. This was worth the extra price for platinum. The beach dinner for platinum guests was fun and a neat experience. Also with platinum you get a 30 minute massage per person. It was heaven. The hotel is great. Yes it will mature, but for being open since December, it is on the right track. It was worth the money. So in closing, here are the things to remember. 1) Tip 2) Book Platinum 3) Enjoy.

I had been reading the reviews since January and felt I was prepared thanks to everyones comments. At the airport, ignore the lady directing you to a line of booths to your right, they're trying to sell you excursions. Also, there are agents standing outside who told us where our bus was, just double check before you get on. There are locals wanting to grab your luggage to carry it for you for tips, we just pleasantly declined. After the first 2 days of getting settled, we had a very pleasant stay. We checked in at 10:30pm to a room with one King size bed. No other rooms available. A cot was brought that night and we spoke to the Air transat rep Jose' the next morning about it. She worked on getting us another room for the next day, but we decided to just ask for another cot and put the couch and chairs out on the balcony. We had a 3rd floor suite (2227) with no problems. I suggest keeping the king suite as we had our nice big king size bed and the kids were very comfortable with thier cots against the wall. Mosquitos came out a little at night on the balcony, but weren't too bad. Attitude plays a huge part as to whether you will enjoy your stay. 98% of staff are very kind and the resort has alot to offer. No vacation is ever perfect and you can't sweat the small stuff. Jose' with Air Transat was always helpful and worked hard to help us in anyway. If I had any questions I went to her first, she is an asset. I did line up early for the al a cartes so didn't have to wait too long, kind of a lousy system. We booked all al a cartes for 6pm. The Miso and Fondue are awesome, the Italian to a lesser degree, and the Mexican not unique enough to bother with. The main buffet was awesome, I can see how some people might think it was repetitive, but there is so much choice you just try a few new things every day instead of gorging on everything all at once! We would go at 7pm for supper and had no line up issues. The two buffets closer to the beach are open for breakfast and lunch and are less varied. The Sunset buffet changes to La Fondue and the Seafood restaurant at night. We always tipped 1 to 2 dollars every meal and at the bars and a bigger tip at the al a cartes. I had brought 50 american one dollar bills and should have brought 3 times that. The Air Transat beach buffet on Thursdays is awesome, don't miss it. If you are leaving early on an excursion don't forget you can get a coffee at the sports bar, its open 24hrs and even has hot dogs at 6:30am. Also, grab some fruit and yogurt the day before to bring with you. The best deal we got when cashing our American travelers cheques was in Playa del Carmen. Its hard to get small change at the resort for additional tips. I asked the bell boys a few times for change. We tipped our cleaning lady and guy $2/day and they were awesome. A different guy stocks the fridge, so if your not there when he comes, just leave a note in the fridge in Spanish if you can. I would suggest not leaving cash in the safes. There was talk of some theft so I bought a really good combination lock and locked up our cash and credit cards in an obscure suticase. There are 3 Scotia banks in Playa del Carmen, one of which is just before where the buses drop you off and where you catch a cab to go back. Its a 3 story building with the Scotia name at the top. Bring your passport. Its easier to pay in pesos, you usually get a better deal. Bathrooms are scarce so we timed our bathroom breaks for a snack from McDonalds where you can only use the bathroom if you purchase something. Hang a right on 5th Ave. and its 3/4 of the way down. People reserving chairs at the beach and pool at 7am with towels is unfortunate, but if thats the game I had to play a few times to get a chair with a palapa, I did it. So many people including my very fair daughter burnt to the point of blisters after the first few days. We were very dilligent with lotion, but should have started with an SPF 50 and as soon as the kids get out of the water you have to put more on, at least until they get a little brown. There are 3 shallow baby pools, but children are allowed in all pools, even the swim up bar ones. It wasn't an issue at all unless you don't like kids or the kids are bratty and not being supervised. We went on 4 excursions, the best of which was with Altournative Tours, the Mayan zip line. The Company works with local villages to make it a rewarding experience from both sides. We would definatly book the other two tours they offer if we went back. We carried our own luggage for check out at 12pm. We went down the corridors on the Sunset side, found the elevators, went down one floor, made our way through the Sunset lobby, past the al a carte restaurants, and finally to the Riviera check out. No worries about the luggage, and an easy although long walk. The luggage holding room was not kept locked which I didn't like, but again, we kept cameras, etc.. locked up with a good lock in one suticase, and other valuables were carried with us for the afternoon. Unfortunatley there is only one! shower room (with towels) per sex across from the luggage room to clean up in so plan ahead. It does help if you know some Spanish as most staffs English is limited. If we went to the Mayan again with our kids, I think we would stay somewhere else as other resorts offer more for the kids. My husband and I alone would consider staying at the Princess again if the price was right.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Place!!!\u201d", "Author": "ek1969", "ReviewID": "UR14742051", "Content": "We just returned from a family vacation to the Mayan Riviera and had a wonderful time.

When we arrived at the airport in Calgary, my boyfriend and I found out that the air line we were traveling with, transat, had a 20 kilo limit per person, and for every kilo over it would cost us $10 USD. So needless to say we started throwing out things left right and center. (Pack extremely light) ARRIVAL: We arrived at the resort at 10am, and I knew we wouldn't get our room till 3pm even though they said check back at 12, and then 1. My guy was frustrated seeing as how we had both been up for over 30hrs, so needless to say he was cranky. So I highly suggest that you pack a few things in your bag to entertain yourself up until 3pm if you have an early arrival. They did take our luggage and store it until we got our room though so we didn't have to worry about it. And of course the champagne on arrival was appreciated. NOTE: THERE ARE CURTOUSEY ROOMS FOR WHEN YOU ARRIVE. THEY HAVE A SHOWER, SINK AND BATHROOM JUST SO YOU CAN FRESHEN UP. We did have problems getting our actual room though. It was about 4:30 when we finally got a room (waiting in line with everyone took up most of the time from 3 till then). They put us on the sunset side on the third level. Our room was gorgeous but it wasn't the one we had booked. It had two doubles instead of a king so we called to the front desk and told us we had to go on a waiting list for our room. I have to say we were not impressed about that at all, and both very tired too. So needless to say we stayed in that room till about 1am when the AC crapped out. We called the front desk and they put us in another room on the first floor. Surprise, surprise, it had the king bed... This room was beautiful and we ended up keeping it for the rest of our stay. BIG NOTE: I HIGHLY, HIGHLY SUGGEST THAT YOU MAKE SURE YOU GET A ROOM ON THE SECOND OR THIRD FLOOR, DON'T WORRY THERE ARE ELEVATORS. THE MOSQUITOES ARE TERRIBLE ON THE FIRST FLOOR. If you are on the first floor I suggest you spray the outside of your door with bug spray though. The only reason for this is because they have a few fountains that they do not keep running 24hrs a day so the mosquitoes like to have a party there. FOOD: (book the restaurants before 1pm at concierge) There are a lot of places to eat here. I am going to try and make a more legible map then the one that they give you so keep your heads up. There are two buffet restaurants that are open for breakfast lunch and dinner at the front of the resort. The one on the sunset side I found to be a bit better. The food was fresher every time and warmer. There are also two more buffets near the beach that are opened for breakfast and sometimes lunch. The breakfast at these ones are a million times better. At night the one on the left hand side (if you are facing the ocean) acts as the fondue restaurant and the one on the right is the seafood. We went to the fondue one and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots to eat. It is a mozzarella and Parmesan cheese fondue, and for dessert fruit and chocolate, of course. We also had the chance to go to le flure (aka, the international). It is a French restaurant so keep in mind you'll probably want second dinner as well. Very small portions but very good. I ordered the lamb for the main course and it was delicious. The duck and the ostrich are almost like a pate. We also went to Miso. UNBELIEVABLE!!! Ask for seats at the grill. The steak is to die for, absolutely incredible. Do not pass this one up, it is truly worth it, and honestly we probably would have eaten here every night if we could have. There is a 24hr snack bar. It\u2019s called 5th ave and its located on the sunset side. They have two foose ball tables two pool tables and huge screens with all kinds of sports on them at all times. If you have 24hr room service built into your package just ask the front desk for a menu because chances are there will not be a menu in your room. Take advantage of it. It is excellent and they are quick. POOLS: The pools are gorgeous and wined around the resort on each side. On the left hand side the pools are fresh water. On the right hand side (sunset) they are salt water so close your eyes and mouth. I told my guy that and he didn\u2019t believe me. BEACH: Bring water shoes or strap on sandals. The water is extremely rocky. The beach its self is very nice though. If you want to enjoy the water I would suggest going to playa del Carmen or marosa to enjoy the beach and water. PLAYA DEL CARMEN: There is a shuttle that\u2019s leaves the resort at 10am(unless this has changed) that is free and drops you off in playa. It is about a 10- minute drive to there. The shuttle also picks you up at 6pm. If you want to take a cab in to town it will cost you 12 pesos. Mambo Cafe is a great place to go to at night if you want to experience authentic live Spanish music and dance. If you want to go somewhere that has more top 40ish stuff I suggest going to Bali. If you are going with a group of people, guys and girls, I suggest you try and barter with the doorman. There were 8 of us 4 girls 4 guys and we told the guy that we would pay only if the guys had to and the girls got in free and got wrist bands.

Stayed at the resort from Mar 21 - 29 and had a great time. We were prepared for issues thanks to all TA informers so were expecting the worst - maybe that is why we had such a great time. Arrived at 11am and room in platinum not ready until 3pm - given our braclets and room keys and sent on our way. Checkin very friendly but did not really give too much info. No welcome drink or towel but we got our own from the bar. No-one showed us around but I did notice some days people being shown around resort on carts. We changed and went walking. We were amazed at how beautiful it was and very happy. A little concerned when we saw people sitting onthe grass as not enough beds and worried because we needed to sleep after all night flight. Arrived at plat and there were snacks which was great and our 2nd drink! We were lucky to find 3 beds in the shade and parked ourselves to get some rest. We checked our room and noticed one king bed - asked for 2 but we had asked at checking for a bed, that was still not in the room so we asked concierge in plat again and she asked and we got it. It took a couple of days to get a blanket but we did get it. Our room was beautiful with an ocean view. Our soaps etc. were stocked every day with new things appearing all the time. Our room was usually made up early but one day was being cleaned at 6pm. Mini bar only had beer, pop and water but we asked for extras and got it, towards the end mini spirits arrived but we didn't use. It was so easy to go to the plat lounge for dirnks. We split our time between the plat beach and pool. The resort was full with about 4000 people but despite this we found our services to be very good. The plat bracelet certaintly helped but my husband would put money under the saucer at the table, if seervise was slow it disappered if it was good it stayed there. Meals were good but not great, we are used to going to good restaurants and found the food here to be plentiful but not fantastic. The only meal that took a long time was the Seafood - we had the lobster which was great. Dissapointed to find out Thai restaurant closed - not sure why so instead plat had a beach BBQ on the Friday which was nice as we met 2 families and stayed with them the rest of the holiday. Negatives? Well it depends on how picky you are, we did not get all the extra's promised with plat, eg. bath robes, welcome drink, champagne etc. Some people did. But these were minor things to me. We booked all our al a cartes when we arrived, you have to do this but it is hard to change them later as restaurants at this time were busy. Not all tables were full but they did not have the staff. The staff work very very hard and I feel sorry for them as some guests are very rude which I find hard to accept. The platinum concierge tried very hard but could not always solve your issues or request - you never had to wait long to speak to them. Plat servers were great, we had an abundance of food and alcohol and it was great. Pool area small but really nice beds, with towels placed on the beds already in the morning. Plat area on beach was nice, had better mattresses and bar service. Beach was lovely - little rocky in places but we loved it. Lots of security roaming around. There was a shuttle and it appeared regularly at the plat lounge - it was at the side of the resort which is why I think many people missed it. We walked most days to the lobby, it really is a beautful walk and takes about 10-15 mins for the average person. Air Transat reps didn't do much accept book trips, they were very nice but could not help with our questions, we flew in club class but they could not help which I found disappointing. The resort as a whole was beautufl and our stay great. I am not a great buffet person and like really nice restaurants, as this was our first all inclusive the only thing I was disappointed with was the food and booking in advance, I like to decide onthe day where to eat and what time. I am not sure if this resort will ever be a true 5 star, in plat we got close to 5 star treatment but I realise not all guests had the service and stay we had, but I guess we paid for that service. It is very large and with that number of people I fail to see how service will ever be 5 star for all.

My family (husband and 3 kids ages 8-13 ) really enjoyed ourselves, and in my opinion this will definitely be a 5 star property in the very near future. All the positives that have been reviewed already we totally agree with. The only negatives that keep this property from being 5 * now are : --a few of the front desk staff were quite sullen and made no effort at all to be helpful when I tried to make a room change (we needed 2 beds instead of 1 king,etc); however the others (e.g.Sergio) were very polite and friendly and what a difference that made! --the room cleaning could be inconsistent: sometimes no kleenex or not enough towels given,etc --there should be more seafood choices offered (e.g. lobster) --the house wine was not very good, the champagne was better --more staff needed in the restaurants --no tea and coffee available at lunch/dinner buffets Here are some tips that might be useful: --mango daiquiries were best at the bar in between the 2 lobby buffets --warmest pool was on the Riviera side of the main activity pool, with the volleyball net --most of the palapa chairs at the beach were already reserved by 7 am (granted, we were staying in peak season with the March spring break/Easter holiday) --there was not a consistent towel card policy in place: sometimes they took down your room number and made you sign out the beach towels, and sometimes they didn't --restaurant reservations: you line up at any of the restaurants between 9 am-1 pm and can make your reservations for your entire stay, but we had difficulty booking the earlier (6:30 pm) slots so we ended up only going to 2 a-la-cartes --the Miso teppanyaki restaurant was not particularly good, but then we have great Japanese food in Vancouver so I may be biased (our chef Javier was wonderfully entertaining though) --La Fondue restaurant was good (kids especially liked the chocolate fondue for dessert) Keep in mind that these \"negative\" points were very minor in comparison to all the fabulous things about the hotel.

We (wife and two teen daugters) had a great time. Check In: We arrived after mid-night and we were met with big smiles and pleasant \"Ola's\" by both the bellhop and front desk. Had no problem at all getting our rooms and our luggage was delivered within 20 minutes which was great. Lobby was impressive and we were blown away by the grounds when we started to go towards our room. One of their security asked us pleasantly as we were a few steps from the lobby which room we were in and then walked with us to it. The resort is huge and our room was almost as far away from the lobby (very close to the beach!) but it took us less than 5 minutes to get there. There is an electric shuttle (looks like a stretch golf cart) that is available and we saw it daily and often despite what others have mentioned. Rooms: We had asked for two rooms close together and we were given two rooms (6238 and 6248) 10 apart which was fine. Our room had a king and our daughters had two doubles which were both as requested. Rooms are spacious and the bathrooms impressive. Our room was very clean but we did notice some cleaning needed in our daughters room and a phone call to the front desk had someone there to remedy within 10 minutes which we thought was excellent. Beds and pillows were comfortable and the air conditioning was perfect. Plasma TV a nice touch not that we even turned it on much although nice to keep up with the news. Mini bar well stocked daily with pop, water, beer and mini bottles of alcohol (Jack Daniels / Vodka etc). 500ml Bottle of Tequila left in both rooms as we arrived which was nice (even nicer when we took our daughters!). No fruit basket upon arrival as indicated in brochure but who cares - there was so much food throughout the week. There were some mosquitos for sure but ususally mostly around 6-8pm which you wouldn't have wanted to have been on the oversized balcony. We all got between 1-4 bites each which was no big deal and we're sure we got them all within the room likely while we were sleeping. Very few noticable in the room although they were mostly seen (usually only one at a time) in the bathroom. After we placed a small towel over the shower drain and over the drain under the double sinks, they seemed to be not as noticable. Don't think we ever noticed any by the pool or beach or while out for an evening stroll. They were fumigating while we were there. Beach: Beach is incredible with the space and fine white powdery sand. Beach went on for miles and apparently, one could walk to Playa Del Carmen if you went to the right and stayed at it for two hours (yeah - no thanks). Two negatives - if you don't reserve your chairs with towels etc before 7am - you will have a tough time getting one which is disappointing. So many chairs are reserved but not being used for long periods of the day as a result. Other is do heed all the previous warnings about some rocks in the water. They are here and there (hit one about every 6 or 7 steps) and some are sharp. Especially when some of the waves dictate where you'll step next. I hit one that cut the underside of my foot and still have a bruise from but so worth it. Water was a bit cooler than I thought but once in - perfect. Pools: Pools are awesome and seem lightly salted which seems friendlier to your skin. Despite having lots of people around the pools, the pools themselves are not overly used and lots of space to do whatever. Again, had to reserve your chairs early if you wanted one and I apologize to everyone - I was up by 6 each morning placing towels on ours to ensure we had some poolside and hung out there very comfortably all day long. I can't stand the having to 'play the game' but no choice on this if you want loungers. A few more chairs would've have been nice as you could tell this impacted some people that were unable to get chairs. Having swim up bars were terrific as were the 'tenders. Also had the same lady serving drinks each day around the pool which was a nice touch and she was excellent throughout. Food: Every meal, every day was excellent. Whoever said there was no seafood must've missed it. Several fishes etc offered daily (several days had 3 or 4 varieties) as were several offerings of beef, pork etc. Way too many choices. The chicken (pollo) was outstanding but what wasn't. Do try the ice cream - it's premium quality you'd have to pay through the nose to get here and the deserts were way too good. The fruit was excellent (and plentiful)with such strong flavors you just don't get here. This wasn't the first all-exclusive we had stayed at but deifnitely had the best quality and variety of food yet. Service: Whether at the front desk, the restaurants, the maid or anyone else you would come across (you couldn't walk 50' without passing one), they were always cheerful and wanting to help (not just for the tips either - these are outstanding people that we could use a lot more of here). Playa Del Carmen: We took a cab both ways ($13 each way for the four of us) even though we could have taken a free shuttle at 10am (didn't want to be restricted by someone elses schedule) and spent several hours walking 5th avenue. Lots of the same stuff in so many different shops but very varied in pricing. Some pricing is fixed while others is expected to be haggled. Where we did haggle, we were able to 'save' 30-50% and there was no pressure when we couldn't get the price we wanted etc - just a fun part of the experience. We ended up getting some floaties for the pool, two hammocks, vanilla, hot sauce, t's, jewellery, hats, blankets etc which were all excellent. Great atmosphere and we came across two separate vendors that were allowing you to take pictures with your own camera (4 pictures for $5) of the kids holding 4' Iguana's and a Monkey which was a thrill for both of them. Do take the time to go down to the beach while there as it is very nice (just a block or two away). Funny to see a McDonald's, Dairy Queen, Subway, Starbucks etc there - don't be tempted and go enjoy somewhere else. Tipping: We tipped although not a lot and usually just at the end of the week as a thank you to those we came in contact with regularly. If we hadn't tipped, it was obvious it wouldn't make any difference (we still would've received the excellent service) and not one ever hinted towards getting one (unlike one fellow in the airport washroom for passing me a sheet of paper towel to dry my hands with). Flight: We flew Air Transat which was likely the only drawback of our vacation. Most of it expected mind you but still makes for a lousy day. Service was excellent, food was ok on the plane but the seats were very uncomfortable and way too cramped. Recline worked about 3\" (never seen it so little but likely because of how close they have their seats compared to any other plane although they are adjusting this apparently soon). Didn't help one of our flights was delayed an hour but life happens.

Our overall stay was good. The kids had fun in the sun as well as ourselves. We went with another family and met yet another of our family friends when we were down there. Ride from the airport was no problem, as well as check in. We knew that the rooms would not be available until 3pm, and it wasn't long after that that we were able to go to them. The map of the grounds does need some improvement, it has been copied too many times and makes it difficult to read. We were a family of 4 and ended up in a room with a king size bed and small sofa. We called to bring this to their attention, and we were told they would check into it. When they did call us back, we were told this is what we requested and that there were no other rooms available. They would send us some roll away cots and then we could check in the morning for a new room. I asked about moving up to another grade of room and again was told the resort was completely booked. I was also told after some conversation that I would get some type of compensation for this error. One bed arrived, so one of my boys spent the night on the sofa. They did give us an extra sheet so we used that to cover the sofa but had to call for additional bedding and pillows for the boys. We went to the front desk the next day, and was told again that there were no other rooms available. I asked again about compensation for this and it appeared that she wrote something down. I told them that I ddin't spend this much money to be cramped in a room like this. This gal didn't seem to speak english well so I have no idea what happened. We never did move to another room and upon check out I enquired again about a compensation and was told that no one could do that. That was our biggest complaint. Be aware that there is a dress code for the restaurants. Slacks must be worn, no shorts. We were disappointed in this because prior to leaving there was no such information about this on the web pages for the resort. I also read several of the trip advisor reviews and no one ever mentioned this. So we ate at the buffets all week. It did get a little tiresome. The schedule of activites is posted near the buffet restaurants and at the towels buildings. I must say that we stayed at the Great Parnasuss in 2007, and found their entertainment staff to be so much better. There doesn't seem to be a lot for the tweens and teens to do. One of our families brought their own vollyeball for the beach and for the pool, and an air pump. We wished we would have brought a basketball because you had to return any balls by 5pm. This didn't seem reasonable when the kids wanted to play basketball at night when it was a little cooler. The first pool with a swim bar that you encounter on your way to the beach is where the activites occur. Water polo, water volleyball, and various other poolside activies. We were a little suprised when we got into the pool and noticed that the water was salty, not like the ocean but definitely salty. It didn't create any problems with your skin or eyes like the ocean may. The grounds are going to be beautiful. At this point they are pretty, but when the plants start to grow it will be outstanding. There some mosquitos and somethings else that bit my leg a few times. But we are from Wisconsin and are use to these nasty little critters. Any place you go there are insects, so we don't know what the big deal is. There are areas for improvement, but we haven't stayed at someplace that doesn't need something. This place is still very new and they are going through a few growing pains. It will be very good once established. At this point there would be no reason not to go here. It is always good to get some inside scoop from peole that have been there.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor", "Title": "\u201cToo Many Kids!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "not-cranky", "ReviewID": "UR14554568", "Content": "We just returned from a week stay at the Grand Riviera Princess, I have to admit the place is gourgous, but there are many signs the opening in Dec 2007 may have been premature. There are many thing that were done hastily because there are alot of loss tile and crappy craftmanship. As it is now, this resort does not deserve it's 5 star rating. I am a mature woman and was travelling with another female friend and we just wanted to get away from our hectic lifestyle and relax for the week. This was literally impossible, although there were 7 pools on this property, every one of them was swarming with children. If you went to the swim-up bar there was usually 4 or 5 kids there ordering strawberry dacarris with no parents in sight. This is an accident waiting to happen, as the day went on there was always 2 or 3 out of control drunks at bar as well. I don't understand way a resort of this caliber would not have a pool for adults only, after all there were 7 of them. There were children everywhere, even in the evening when we were trying to enjoy an after dinner cocktail there were kids running around in the bar areas, with parents who really didn't seem to care about their bahavoir or the potential danger they may be in. As many other travellers have mentioned before this complex is very large and it does take around 15-20 min to walk from the lobby to the beach area, but fortunately there were alot of amenties down by the pool areas that it wasn't always necessary to go to the lobby. My last complaint would be staffing, especially housekeeping there were 2 days that our room was not cleaned and even after several calls to the front desk we still had to hunt down fresh towels. Also, I had made several request to have our fridge replenished with water & pop which went unanswered. This is really sad, because this place has such potential maybe in a year or so when they get better established it may be worth recommending. P.S. I tried to comment on there website, but there was no place on there webpage for comments...maybe they don't care", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cMuch Better Than We Expected\u201d", "Author": "Uppower", "ReviewID": "UR14538277", "Content": "We (my wife and I and 4 children ages 13 - 19) stayed at the Riviera Princess from 3/13 thru 3/23 in the Platinum Suites. I would like to start by saying we always stay in either 4 or 5 star resorts, and don't book the value trips, as I believe you get what you pay for. As a matter of fact, this was the first all-inclusive trip we have even taken. I contacted my travel agent after reading the negative reviews and she offered to move us to the Moon Palace if we desired.....but we thought we would give it a try anyway. It is a very nice resort and will only get better as it matures. They do have some minor issues that will probably keep them from becoming a 5-star. I would now rate them as a 4-star for the buildings and grounds, only because they may have rushed the opening a bit and some unfinished work is still visable. When complete they will have a 5-star property. I would rate them as a 3.5-star on service because it is obvious that some workers do try harder than others at this point. The minimum wage salary is $5 per day. The employee turn-over has been tremendous and it will take some time to assemble a 5-star cast. The Princess brass was all over the hotel during our stay and the platinum manager told me the resort manager was fired two days before we arrived so they trying to acheive excellence. Meals: The food was very good for an all-inclusive (so I am told). The buffets were very good for breakfast and lunch (not quite the maketplace at Atlantis, but good), but not what I would purchase on a regular basis for dinner. If you order a beer or soft drink at the buffet for dinner, you might get it before you are done eating. The Italian alcarte was very good....we did twice, and would have done more had we known. The grill (or steak) as they call it was not so hot, and definately not worth wearing slacks for (men must wear pants, women & girls can wear cut-off sweats). You really can't get a steak at this place. They discontinued the Thia on the beach for now, but if you are platinum, the best meal you'll have there is the beach dinner they give platinum guests. It was great food and the moon was over the ocean.....picture perfect.....up-grade just for this. Pools: Pools are very nice and plenty of chairs if you don't sleep in til 11:00. Some people were complaining of not getting poolside lounges.....but come'on it was almost noon. Pools are perfect tempature and swim-up bars served up great drinks. The poolside waitresses were very nice and try hard. Beach: The beach is very nice and has nice sand throughout. The reviews about water shoes must be about in the water a ways because I never saw any rocks. I did however see some topless sunbathers. I went to the beach 3 or 4 times and saw maybe 6-10 topless women. Only one worthy of showing them though....she was hot, lol. Also a couple around the pools too. Rooms: Rooms were very nice and cleaned every day. If you leave a $10.00 tip every other day you will be suprised at the servoce you will get. Your room will be cleaned earlier in the day...and you will get towel art on your bed everyday. Throw $5 every other day in the mini-bar with a note of what you want. I gave a $10.00 tip with a note saying I liked Budwieser and my wife liked bottle water and it was overflowing everyday. The complaints about the water on the bathroom floors are obviously coming form people who shower in a bathtub. Lay a towel in front of the shower door and enjoy the mable bathroom for crying out-loud. The bugs are worse on the jungle side. We had ocean view and did not have an issue. Transportation to front: The resort is huge, and it is a 10-15 minute walk from beach to lobby with all the pools in between. The outsides of the resort is a paved roadways on both sides (inside the fence) for service carts and stretched golf carts carrying passengers to the front of resort. The biggest complaint I heard during my stay was not enough transportation to the front where the resturaunts, gym, spa, lobby, taxis, etc. are located. During my stay they got some more new carts. I would guess they had at least 8 or 10 of them....but only two bell boys to operate them and haul luggage aswell. THEY NEED MORE EMPLOYEES FOR THIS. They should have two nonstop drivers on each side at all times fro transporting guests! I hope this was helpfull. Don't change you plans because this is a great resort with alot of potential. Enjoy it while you can afford it.....and make your trip enjoyable by going in knowing the staff is still learning.

The first thing to remember is that you are on your own, the AIr Transat people are only there to sell you tours and offer basic information. We never saw any information as to where and how things run at the resort. You learn by experience and talking to other people. The initial skirmish is when you are offloaded from the bus and have to register. No welcome, just some half mumbled conversation and an overly xeroxed somewhat map of the complex to show you where your room is. Guess what....your room is not available until 3:00. Come back then for your swipe cards........the plain white card goes in the slot by your room door to turn on the power to your room. This was at noon. If you don't have a swim suit or a change of clothes in your carry-on you have a long wait. When we finally got to our room ...no bags. They were still in the lobby waiting for the bell hops to bring them. We got ours 2 hours later. Would be easier to bring them to the room yourself....that is if you know there's an elevator instead of going down a huge flight of stairs. Surprise!....there is an elevator from the lobby to the lower floors. In the lobby you would never know that there is an elevator. It's well hidden and no signage as to it's location. We found it by accident 4 days into our stay. Facing the stairs in the lobby go left around the bar and meeting rooms. It's in the access to the first block of rooms. The hotel has a real issue with houskeeping. Some would say we are being picky but I think not. So, a list. 1. When we got our room there was urine on the floor of the toilet. Needlees to say a trip to the concierge was in order. Waste of time. All talk and no action. Hotel towels work wonders for cleaning floors. 2. One of the sinks had a huge chip out of the porcelain and was cracked. No way to plug the drains. 3. Showers on the main floor (our room) back up due to poor drainage. Another use for towels. 4. Had to rearrange everything on the dresser to get the coffee maker plugged in. 5. Hand held shower coming away from the wall in the shower. 6. Double beds instead of queen as advertised. 7. Something, not mosquitos, was biting us in bed at night. 8. Could not use the patio due to mosquitos. 9. When talking to other guests we found out the safe can easily be opened with a screwdriver if you know how. 10. As Regency Club guests we never did get our robes, slippers and beach towels as per the Transat brochure. 11. The houskeeping staff could not get around the fact that there were 3 people in the room. We always got 2 of everything. The way around that was to fend for yourself. If you found a supply room open you helped yourself to what you needed. 12. No liquor dispenser. The hotel has nice grounds and pool areas. Be ware that it is a long distance from the lobby to the beach.....at least 3 beers by our count. There is supposed to be a shuttle through the property but we never did see it or hear of anyone else seeing it. Be sure to get out early to save a lounger around the pool. By 7- 7:30 am most loungers were already taken for the day. NOTE...the concrete around the pools can be quite slippery when wet. The buffet had good food but became quite predicable after a few days. Not enough variety in the main course. No seafood for one thing. The Transat brochure does not mention that there is a $25 surcharge for lobster in the seafood a la carte. The only snacks available between meals are in the sport bar on the Sunset side of the hotels. The bar in the courtyard between the 2 hotels is excellent. Search out Maria. She's a great waitress and worth the tip. If you paid more than $1000 plus taxes for a week....well you know.

Say hi to everyone on the bus with you. 2. Don't worry about luggage. If there is two of you one head to the line up to check in and the other head to the lobby bar and get drinks while you wait. 3. Don't wait for the bell hop to bring your luggage to your room. You could be there waiting for sometime (cuts into tanning time). Drag it with you.

Just not enough slope to funnel the water back to the drain but again no big deal. Our first impression on day one was \"Wow\" this place is big. It is a good walk no matter where you go in the resort but it is definitely good for you and it is easy to get anywhere. It is very well laid out with easy access to the enormous pools with quiet areas and at the centre of the pools is the activity pool. There is an abundance of chairs and shade areas and of course the need to get up very early to reserve the prime locations whether it be on the beach or by the pool. Past 6:30 am and your not getting a palapa. The beach area was great with lots of palapa's and they built another 18 in the second week we were there so there was no shortage of them. The beach and swimming area is fairly rocky but aqua shoes made it easy. The food was fantastic and the service in all of the restaurants whether it be ala carte or buffet was very good. We expecially enjoyed the Asian as the food was great and the sushi even better. Look for Juan Gabriel in the La fondue buffet for breakfast and lunch and he will serve like no other. He always has a smile. Tell him Senor Ricky from Canada sent you. Were there any problems, of course there were. Our neighbors didn't get there room cleaned twice and I heard of other people not getting the room they requested but eventually did. I spoke with a few of the employees that spoke a bit of english and even they admitted there were some problems. They changed the way you could book your ala carte restaurants three times while we were there but we still managed to get 5 of our possible 6 nights for dinners and they were first class. It was only a 10 minute cab ride to Playa del Carmen so if you wanted to go out and shop or go for dinner it was easy. The hotel itself lacks character but in time it will. Once the plants grow and the vegetation fills in it will be beautiful. When the staff settle in and they get some consistency this will be a first class 5 star hotel. Don't be afraid for one second to book a vacation here, you won't regret it. For those of you already booked look forward to good food, good service and most of all a good time.", "Date": "March 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "edmonton", "Title": "\u201cA Great Experience\u201d", "Author": "lmmgem", "ReviewID": "UR14260082", "Content": "My husband and I read the mostly bad reviews before we booked and like many decided to chance it.

I would totally reccomend staying on the ground floor as it is way easier to get around ... you walk alot so why would you want to walk even more ... The food is stunning .. I would say take in as many A La Cartes as possible sneek in without a reservation one saturday night to Mia Mammia (italian) super good ... Misos was by far our favourite... the buffets are great as well besure to take in the breakfast as they cook fresh omelets and at lunch they make pasta to order and you can choose your own flavour of booze to make the flambae with .. Room service is super good and actually on time they say 1/2 hour its there in a 1/2 hour. I don't want to sit and write a whole bunch about the place .. most people have summed it up very well excepy saying that it is BAD .. it is actually GRAND I found nothing wrong with the hotel... our stay was wonderful and would go back in a heart beat ...

I read all the reviews prior to leaving... knew about the leaking showers, the \"slow\" service, 15 min. walks to lobby... blah blah blah, big deal! I just think (and did see) that alot of vacationers are VERY uptight and expect to be catered to promptly at every second. Let me just say that those are the people who are NOT going to have fun on their vacation. My advice to you: relax, know that everything is NOT going to be perfect, and talk to and treat the workers how you want them to treat you. We booked with Air Transat (who did a fabulous job!) and stayed Feb. 19-26. Check-in was very smooth and considerably fast! And no, we didn't get champagne on arrival...and who cares! Walk 20 steps to the bar and get your own drink. The guy at the front desk was friendly, had no problems at all! I confirmed with him twice that our room had 2 double beds, and it did! Sweet! We booked to stay on the Riviera side but our room was on the Sunset side, which didn't make a difference one way or another! We tipped the bell boy and he took all of our extremely heavy luggage to our room within 20 minutes. When we got to our Deluxe Junior Suite (room 3251), our telephone didn't work.. but 2 guys came to our room and the problem was solved in a matter of 15 minutes! No biggie! Everything in the room was great.. the safe worked, had towels, bottle of tequila with 4 lime slices and a plate of salt waiting for us..niiice! Like most people, we tipped the maid everyday and she cleaned the room to satisfaction! She even folded our piles of clothes and organized our makeup in the bathroom. No theft problems whatsoever...we left our iPods, cell phones, cameras, etc. out in the open and it was never touched. Oh, and if you want to ask the maid for something...act it out like you're playing \"charades\" and you'll get what ya need! Yes, the resort is huge. You'll get used to the 10 min. walk from your room to the lobby area quickly. People complain about how they don't know where anything is located in the resort...how about taking a nice hour-long evening walk around the resort and finding this out for yourself? That's what we did and we quickly knew where everything was in a matter of a hour or 2...plus, we got great photo opportunities of the resort during this time! To me, the resort only smelt of \"sewage\" occasionally late at night when they put the sprinklers on to water the grass. Don't even worry about the smell, it's not a big deal! Oh, and mosquitoes...what mosquitos? I seen so few of them that it's not even worth mentioning. We never had 1 single mosquito in our room and hardly had to use bug spray. I got bit the first night around the lagoons a few times...but I think I was too drunk to notice that I was getting bit.... The pools are AWESOME! And no, you don't have to wake up at 6am to go claim a lounge chair. I was there during spring break where the resort was booked full, and us 4 girls were always able to find lounge chairs in one area or another at any time of the day! Move the chairs around if you have to! We spent most of our time at the \"party pool\" where the Animation Crew did an awesome job at keeping us entertained with dance routines, drinking games, etc! Most of the Animation Crew guys were very easy on the eyes too....! My friend and I got pictures taken with an iguana wrapped around us beside the pool... very cool! If you want the picture, its $15 and well worth it! And by the way, you're allowed to swim in the pools at night.. just keep the noise down so ya don't wake-up other guests! The beach was beautiful, we found ALOT of neat seashells. The water has some rocks in it but its not through-out ... swim over the rocky part and you'll be fine. Try and stay on the beach till sunset one evening, you will get AMAZING photo opportunities!!! The food was GREAT! My friend and I waited in line for the concierge around 10am for about 15 minutes max. to book a la cartes. The a la cartes get booked-up fast so reserve as soon as you can!! We ate the Japanese restaurant and the concierge booked us a table around the grill (without asking for it!). The food there was the best we had on the trip! It was the best sushi we ever ate! We also did Italian which was really good as well. And no, there isn't a lack of food at the a la cartes... I mean, you can order as many dishes off the menu as you want, so I don't see where the lack of food would come from?!?! Buffet were real good as well.... the pasta bar was the best! We went to the Air Transat beach party which is held on Thursdays.. the meal there was super! Great atmosphere and decorating! The sports bar also has really good hot dogs and nachos 24/7, so when you've had alot to drink after the disco, walk on over to the sports bar for a late night snack! All staff members were incredibly friendly to us... there was never one worker who would walk by us without smiling and saying \"Hola!\". We made good friends with some of the Animation Crew (especially Yair and Carlos!!) and danced/partied with them almost every night at the disco! And I didn't find that ANY of the staff members expected a tip..they definitely didn't!! We did tip occasionally, but when we didn't, it didn't seem to affect the level of service we got regardless! We paid for the charges against our room (like telephone charges) the night before we left our resort so that check-out the next day would be faster. You can buy calling cards at the resort for $20..which is a rip-off cuz it works out to be $1 per minute (plus a $3 connecting fee per call) so beware of heavy telephone charges!! By the way, check-out was fast and had no problems! Excursions...we went shopping all day to Playa del Carmen and took the free shuttle bus there (which departs at 10am & 12pm). The shuttle bus brings you back to the resort at 6pm. If you want to take a cab back, tell the cab driver you'll give him $12 which should be fine! We also went on the Xel-Ha/Tulum tour which was unreal! Tulum was the most beautiful spot I have ever seen...I highly recommend this tour! We also went on the Cancun bar-hopping tour one night..crazy fun!!! Lastly, we visited Cozumel for some great shopping via a ferry from Playa del Carmen which costs around $20 round-trip. The resort has about 2 gift shops, which have some nice stuff in them! You'll get the same merchandise cheaper though if you shop for it in Playa del Carmen. Anyways, I've rambled on enough. This resort is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and I couldn't ask for anything better! The service MAY be slow, but be patient and friendly and keep in mind that they just opened. If you expect 100% five-star quality, I'd really like to know why you booked this resort in the first place? Did you not realize there would be some flaws? If you DON'T expect 100% five-star quality..you'll have an excellent time! No worries! It's amazing!

This area of the world is just amazing. The resort is beautiful. We found the staff to be extremely helpful and always willing to help when asked. We didn't get our bottle of tequila or fruit basket when we arrived, but oh well! We were in a beautiful place spending time with friends and each other and that's what's important. I just can't get over that people go there and complain soooo much. Just ridiculous if you ask me. We had great food at the buffet and the a la cartes. Our only suggestion is that the french restaurant serve more food. We were laughing after that we were all still so hungry. We just went down to the sports bar and had a beer and a plate of nachos. Really not a big deal. I think all of us who go down to this area need to keep in mind that we're spoiled in North America and need to be thankful for what we have. Driving around Playa Del Carmen was a good reminder of how a lot of people live in other places of the world. These people make about $5 per day. So be generous with your tips.

My wife and I and two other couples all in the ages of 24-27 stayed at this resort from Mar 1-8th and really enjoyed ourselves. This is the third time I have stayed at an all inclusive and by far the best, if you can get over some minute details. (They are very minute) Please keep in mind that there are over 1000 rooms at this resort and that some might have a different experience than others. I will start with Check in: We arrived at about 11:00 am and it is not that they are not helpfull but because they offer a check out at 12pm (and have 1000 rooms to clean) you can not get an early check in until 3. I personally do not see the issue with some travellers as you receive the wrist bands immediately when you check in. We were told to come back at 3 which we did and getting our rooms took about 20 minutes. ( I can see how this is frustrating if you come in at 6am, but that is something your travel agent can control not the hotel. ROOMS: Very clean, all marble, what you see in the pictures is what you get. Beds a little hard, but all in all very clean, stay at a 3 star and then compare. **If you stay in a lower level room you will have mosquito's as one of our couples did, even so I think she had 10 bites at the most all week...I think I killed one all week in our room. (2nd floor) Travellers have to realize you are in a vast area with foilage and water all around, you are not in manhatten their will be mosquitos** FOOD: Very good, over the top if you compare to 3 and 4 star resorts. The ala cartes are worth it (you do only get three they have totally tightened this up) but be prepared for a 1-1/2 to 2 hr meal. If you compare it to a $300 dollar meal you will be not be that impressed. Also unlike the other poster you can find food at this resort literally 24 hours a day. The breakfast buffets run from 7-10:30 Lunch from 12:00-3:30 and dinner from 5-11:00pm. Their are buffets x2 close to the beach, but since our room was close to the lobby we found out on the 2nd day their are 2 on the lower lobby level. 24hr food at the sports bar...so so. Also room service runs 24hrs a day even thought the menu ends at 11pm (they deliver off of the sports bar menu after this) Service: Very good and very friendly people. The bar,pool, and housekeepin/maint. staff are the friendliest I have ever seen at any resort Canada/US/ or Mexico. Not one walked by without sayin hi! Some of the front desk staff might seem colder, but it is all how you approach them. Think to yourself if someone is literally yelling at them because their travel agent booked them to arrive at 6am and they can't get a room until three...think of three things 1) Can you book into ANY hotel that early 2) At your job how would you respond 3)You are in their country don't be mad if they can't perfectly understand you. Does the guy at the hilton in Miami understand french, russian, arabic ect ect ect (all heard this week. Layout: It is HUGE, I am athletic 25 yo and I found there was a lot of walking, but if you bring what you need from your room, or your room is in the middle it is fine. Everything you could possibly need is located at both the front and back of the resort. I would not recommend this resort to people with mobility problems that do not have a medi-chair or wheel chair. I would say you have at a decent pace a beautiful 5 min walk from lobby to party pool, 8 min walk from lobby to beach buffets, and a 10 min walk at a decent pace from lobby to beach. Beach: (Final I promise!) The beach itself is beautiful, barely any seaweed compared to others we toured this week (all 5star) The sand is amazing with 75-100 huts and 100's of chairs. The water however is very rocky in places. We only swam probably 3 times in the ocean due to this. In conclusion for the price I have paid in the past all about $1100 to $2500 cdn a week (This one was 1360) This was definitely by far the best all around resort! We ended up spending 6 hrs at another 5star(3K a week) due to a delay in a flight returning home, and I would definitely pick the Princess.

Wanted to post as much honest information as I could because I spent the entire month of Feb on these forums reading the numerous threads and reviews and might as well give back a little! This is going to be long ... Checkin: Arrived 9am, all on our bus were herded towards main reception, I just went and told one of the valets that I was in Platinum, he took our luggage down the huge staircase and got us a shuttle trolly down to the platinum area. The Platinum desk guy was really new on the job and didn't know much, he checked our reservation and told us to go and have breakfast and then he would find out about our room. I asked for the bracelets but he said he couldn't give them out yet till his supervisor came back from a meeting. We went and ate at the buffet next to platinum and came back, he kept telling us the room would be ready in an hour or so. I knew it was going to be till 3 no matter what from reading on these forums and in the end it wasn't till 3 that he had our room ready. Only good thing is he was really trying to help us out as he must have felt bad about how he kept telling us \"1 more hour\" each time I'd come back and check on our luggage. In the end he accommodated all my requests of oceanview, kingbed, high floor. Room (5213): Exactly what I requested, probably due to how early we arrived and that I never saw anyone else checking into Platinum that day till late in the afternoon. No one else was there early that day. Gorgeous ocean view, king bed, bottle of champagne and tequila in the room, and a fruit basket. Room was clean. Shower only leaked if water got sprayed over towards the door, otherwise the floor was sloped towards the drain. Minibar was stocked and replenished adequately throughout the week. Mosquitoes were around, I only saw a couple in the room throughout the week, I saw more of the little \u201cnoseeums\u201d. I had no bites till eating at the outdoor Thai beach restaurant, but my GF had quite a few on her legs, which I think were from sleeping with her legs outside the sheets. We were third floor and I would bet there are a lot more on the lower floors. Maid Service: Okay, but not 5*, half the days our room was one of the first cleaned and was cleaned by 9 or 10am. Other days we were on the last of the rooms and not ready till 4-5pm. When cleaned early, they did a much better job and cleaned up dirty glasses etc. On the late days it was very rushed, basically just changed the towels and quickly made the bed (so quick, that one day, they didn't put a top sheet on!). Also didn't cleanup empty beer/pop cans on the late days. I tipped the same and left the room at similar times all days but it just seemed random if it was early or late. Chair/Towel game: Our week was very busy, probably close to full at the hotel. Compared to many earlier reports of tons of chairs and lots of room, now at full capacity, the chairs are at full capacity also. Good chairs under shade on pool or beach were taken by 7-8am. We liked the reserved plat area at the beach and spent all our time here. After the first day, I started getting up and going to the beach at 7 to get 2 chairs under one of the straw umbrella things in the plat. beach section. You could always get a chair somewhere after looking around for a while, but if you came out after 8am, it wasn't going to be in the shade. Only around 11am were the chairs full enough that I saw people wandering for 5-10 minutes to find random empty ones to drag over to their spots. Spent no time at the pools, but chairs looked almost full except around the two smaller/quieter pools. Again at 7am most of the covered areas were taken. Beach: Beautiful, great sand and water was turquoise not \u201cswampy\u201d or dark like others have mentioned. I didn\u2019t use watershoes and never once stepped on a rock in the water. There are large open sandy areas and darker areas with rocks/seaweed. I would just walk out through the \u201clight\u201d areas and never had any issues. But it is so shallow all the way out to the buoy line that swimming is difficult and you\u2019ll often touch ground when in a wave\u2019s trough. Using the boogyboards in the waves was the best way to enjoy the water. Pools: Again, didn\u2019t use them, but as most have said they are large and transverse the entire resort. Center is where music and waterpolo/games are played. 3 swimup bars. Towels: As of Feb23rd they now use a towel card system for all guests except Plat and Laguna who can get all the towels they want. On the 22nd we were able to get towels no problem (even before I got my bracelet) but on the 23rd we were told we needed cards but after speaking to Victor (great guy) from the platinum concierge we were able to get all the towels we needed without a card. Food: Buffets had a good selection. We used the two by the beach for breakfast as it was close to platinum and the beach. After 2nd day we always went to the main buffet by the lobby for lunch as it had more choices of food and it was nice to have a walk over and back in the middle of the day. The beachside buffets are open for breakfast and lunch. The 2 main buffets are open breakfast and dinner but only the Riviera one is open for lunch. Now with the hotel full, the buffets do sometimes line up. This occurs once all the tables have been full once from the first people and all of a sudden there are 50 dirty tables and not near enough staff to turn them over fast enough. I never waited in a line once during the week because we would go to lunch in the first hour once it was open and I never saw a line at the breakfast one. Al-a-carts: We booked all ours on the first day (as with plat you can book every day and all at once). We went to Seafood: not impressed at all with the food, would not recommend it. Miso: Ended up going to Miso 3 nights! It has 3 different parts/menus. So make sure you ask which one you are getting especially if you are expecting the one where they cook in front of you. We ate at the Sushi bar twice as the sushi was good and sashimi was very good. Also no one ever booked the sushibar so you could book it with no notice. Ate at the one they cook in front of you and it was very good also. International/French: This one we had poor service to get our table, we had 7:20 reservation, came at 7:10 and weren\u2019t seated till after 8pm. I almost walked out on this one but once we had our table the service was good, food was good but portions were very small. Went to the buffet afterwards! Dinner on the Beach: This is the beach dinner included with Platinum\u2026.BOOK THIS, it was the best meal of the week.. 5 course meal. This is at the Thai Beach restaurant. But it is a set menu and not the Thai menu. Thai menu costs $$ for everyone. When we were there, there were 2 couples having the Thai and it looked really good and large portions. Cost for Thai was around $20 per main course, $10 for appetizers. Entertainment: Went to 4 nights of the shows in the large indoor theatre. These start at 9:30 and run 30-60min. Most nights it is the Animation team dancing/lipsynching to some theme. Two of the nights we saw were outside performers doing a circus show and acrobatic show. I preferred these two shows as they were a little more professional and entertaining. Also live band starts around 8-8:30 in the center bar between the two main buffets. This is a great setting but hard to get a seat/table unless you come around 6pm. Some nights they had other entertainment here as well (firedancers, jugglers etc). I think these were the same performers that were there for the circus and acrobatic shows. Overall, the entertainment was good and what I\u2019d expect at an AI resort. You can\u2019t expect Broadway or Vegas. Overall we had a great relaxing vacation. The resort is large and was very full during our week. The biggest issue is the lack of well-trained employees. Being in Platinum we avoided the front desk where many reviewers have complained and because we were lucky to get an amazing room we can\u2019t complain. I feel that ones\u2019 experience at this resort will be based on luck. If you sail in and get a decent room and eat at the less busy times, then you will have a great time. However, if you start to run into issues with your room, or want to eat during the busy times then due to the lack of employees and customer service you could have a very different experience during the exact same week. I know it\u2019s confusing to see all the really good reviews and then a bunch of mediocre or poor reviews but with such a large resort this can happen. Personally I won\u2019t re-book at the Princess. I would prefer a smaller resort like the Riu Palace Riviera Maya where we stayed in 2006. An although I stayed at the Riu in only its second week of being open, the service was miles ahead of the Princess which has been open for 2.5 months. I think if people are still getting great prices on this hotel then I would keep my booking and go but if you can book a Riu Palace or something like the Iberostar Lindo for the same then you are probably safer with one of those resorts.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Manitoba", "Title": "\u201chave alot of patience\u201d", "Author": "dbronze", "ReviewID": "UR14130138", "Content": "Stayed at the Priincess from Feb. l8-27.08. .

Again, the platinum section is reservied. Overall, I would not go back to this place. The food was ok. I found the buffet better than the specialty restaurants which need reservations. Very little food served there and you may have to go to the buffet afterwards. Bring another couple, get a group going, have drinks, have fun and like I said enjoy your holiday but don't stress out because remember it is only 3 months old and in need of more staff.

I was very very pleased, and impressed. For a resort that just opened 2 months ago, I had excellent pleasant happy service, beautiful grounds and beach and excellent food! Last year I stayed at a 4* resort that has been runnin for years and was horrible, first bad experience ever in Mexico and mainly bad service and miserable overworked staff... Check in: Quick, pleasant, professional, our luggage was taking some time to arrive as we were eager to change and eat and one phone call to bellman service and they arrived within 5 minutes! Room: Our suite was stunning, very clean and beautifully designed with flat screen tv and jacuzzi tub in open bathroom and on balcony, robes, mini bar, fresh platter of fruit on check-in day, bottle of tequila, beach towels, and if you are missing any of these, I found a few people to whine they were missing some treats, well with one phonecall they are pleased to bring it to you right away... Maid Service: Very clean and usually between 11-3 rooms were cleaned, I use to leave tip till the end of trip but I tipped as I saw her to make sure same maid received my apprecation... Pools: Perfect!! Almost covered the whole grounds left and right side along pathway to the beach. All different energy, one with music and casual games, other pool areas for kids, baby pools, and others for quiet sun bathers with ground room balconies step down to the pools. Mostly all pool chairs are occupied by towels or people by 9:30 heads up. Beach: Beautiful beach lined with huts, plenty of beach chairs atleast by 10 and bed huts and palm trees! Volleyball and water activities, rocks in water to the right so if you stick to the left side hardly any rock as Mayan Coast is known for Coral Reef and still recovering from the hurricane but no big deal. Restaraunts: FABULOUS, FINE DINING, we dined at 5/7, we were slightly frustrated as the reservation system was changing daily, so we were going by first come first serve \"you made a mistake\" for most of those reso's except by the last few days they seemed to have it under control and byt the end they would allow you to book all resos at once for the week so I would definitely recommend that! One nite they had a beach bbq party for Transat packages and that was fun, beautiful and huge food feast bbq and tables all set up on the beach with torches and music, they prepare and setup for it all day, we really enjoyed that and met many people over dinner! BUFFETS: Amazing food, I was very impressed as Im never too disappointed in Mexico AI resorts, food is fine, restaraunts are fine dining and huge large variety and selection. It was not the same every day, perhaps to those who eat hamburgers and hotdogs rather than the seafoods, roasts, huge salad varieties, fresh prosciutto's and variety of fine cheeses, roast, pork, lambs and marinated rice and pasta bar dishes! Huge selection and quality excellent and coming from and Italian Fine Diner from all over! I would definitely stay here again although I know the price will triple so overall I feel fortunate for such an experience for such a small penny!", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg", "Title": "\u201cOk\u201d", "Author": "krislyn5559", "ReviewID": "UR14101037", "Content": "I had read numerous reviews about the hotel before going so I expected things not to be perfect but there were a few things that still got to me. 1) me and my infant son got a bad case of bed bug bites so if you are staying in room 6278 beware. I didn't know what they were until I got back so I couldn't really do anything to warn the hotel there also they don't seem to change the sheets as they had blood stains on them the whole time we there. 2) we paid 25 dollars us for extremely overdone lobsters at the ala carte and honestly they were the worst I have ever had. These thing being said the resort was beautiful, the serving staff was very friendly and willing to go out of there way for us when are son got sick in the restaurant. The drinks are great much better then I have had at other resorts. The asian restaurant was amazing but they don't tell you you need a special reservation for the tepanaki so if you want to sit at the grill make sure to request so at the concierge.

We were a party of 4 in 2 Jr. Deluxe Swim Up Suites on the Princess Side. I had read every single tripadvisor hotel review of this place before we went to the hotel so I know where the problems might crop up and what the issues might be. In a nutshell, we had a great time but there are some bugs still in the system at the hotel. My travel group is pretty low key and we have been all over the world (seen the highs and the lows) so I felt that no matter what the problems were, we would deal with it and make the best of out visit. It helped that we got a super cheap hotel rate. Check in was disorganized but thankfully we were not checking in at a peak time and the hotel was not at capacity so it only took about 45 minutes. Again, I knew this would happen so 2 people stood in line at a time and the other 2 sat and relaxed then we swapped out about every 15 minutes. This kept every one calm and no one was super stressed. We did see 2 sets of people trying to solve pre-existing problems ( one room problem and one billing problem) - it was not going well for them. While the guy checking us in was nice and could speak English - it seemed his grasp of written English is what slowed him down as well at the other counter personnel. No welcome drink as some have mentioned. Our rooms were ready but the desk had no bracelets so we would have to return for those later. As it turned out, 2 of our room keys were not programed so we would have had to return to the front desk anyway. We had to return a third time for beach towel vouchers. Better training of the check- in staff should make it a \"one-stop\" ordeal but that will take some time. I have checked into AI's before with the same long lines so it is not only this hotel. We made a choice to bring our own luggage to our rooms because we heard the bell men take forever. They do and it's because there are only 2 and they are just overwhelmed with arrivals and departures. The map they gave us at check in was confusing but we muddled through, once at the resort for a day we got the lay of the land. I can appreciate how guest arriving at dusk, with kids or at night are completely confused and angry about trying to find the rooms. The place is huge - so if you, have a ton of luggage, young kids, are not able to walk distances well or choose not to then this is not the hotel for you - that is what makes having to go back to the front desk more than once a pain at arrival. Check out, on the other hand was quick and easy. We also brought our own bags out when we left. Rooms were cleaned and refigerator stocked when we arrived but we thought a circuit was blown because none of the lights worked - all was fine you just have to slide a room key into a slot by the door to activate them. Energy saver set up I guess. Maintance came up and showed us how it worked. We felt like idiots but this info was not passed on to us by the front desk. LOVED the swim up rooms. It was so cool to be able to walk out of the balcony and pop into the pool - then pop back onto your private balcony. Yes, there were mosquitos. It's a room right off the water, this should not be a shock to people. But I'm the only one who got bit and I didn't really care to waste time killing them when I could have been at the beach or the bar. Left $5 US a day under the pillow for the maid with a note in spanish for what we wanted in the fridge - go to google translator for some pre written spanish phases and it will make your life a lot easier. Got stocked and then some because of it. A little goes a long way in Mexico so save up on ones and fives before you leave for your trip. Rooms were made up every day but the floor was a bit gritty - could not confirm if it was beach sand or construction dust as other reviewers have said. We did not really care. Why burn vacation time fretting over it - just bring a pair of cheap flip flops. A/C worked and could be adjusted as needed. Toiletries were available and restocked daily. Not a fan of their citrusy fragrence so I used my own - just a personal choice. Ate at the main buffets for Breakfast and one dinner, there are 2. Very good, there was so much selection that if you can't find something than you are the problem. Lunches at beach buffets, there are also 2 - same food slightly smaller selection, smaller space so it was more crowded. Tip your buffet waiter $2 after your meal - you will have personal service for the rest of your stay. Ate dinner at A'la Cartes - French, Asian, Italian. They were ok, not great. Special mention does go to the Beef and Lamb at the French restaurant - great. Tuna steak at the Japanese - excellent. We got reservations for 2 nights but just showed up (9 pm) at the French the first night and they seated us - no line. Would have done Fondue and Mexican but it was booked. You must book A'la Carte at the Consierge. It took a little time ( there were only 2 people working) but not a big process. We were not hemmed into certian times for dinner so if the availability was too late or too early we adjusted out lunch time accordingly. The A'la Carte reservations fill up becuase they do not have enough staff for each restaurant - not because they do not have enough seating. The thing that is very strange about the A'la Carte menus ( no one has mentioned in other reviews ) is the translation problems. Left side all courses listed in Spanish - fine, but right side has the \"English\" translation. At the french A'la Carte they offered Tomato Ice Cream with puff cream. What ?? Actually it was gespacho with a bit of sour cream in the center. It's not a huge deal but weird and you may not get what you thought you were ordering because the translation is off - not the staff. 2 of our party used the spa for massages. Prices similar to prices here in New York. Said Spa was nice and massages were done well, they also dipped into the private Spa pool and sauna. Nice menu of facials and they offer the all important sunburn aloe wrap. Did one it Aruba but did not need it here. It can be a life saver if you get really fried. They seem to also have a full nail and hair salon per the list of services. As far as my experience I did not meet up with any staff that was outright rude or problematic. The staff seemed very nice but I did not have any major problems I had to have resoved. However, even at low capacity they are very understaffed and the people who are there have long days and are run pretty ragged. The problem may lie more in the fact that many of the lower end employees (chambermaid, maintenece, bus boys, security guards) do not have a full grasp of english. They have a 12+ hour work day. The guard at the of our complex of buildings was on duty when I went for an early run (5:30am) and when we went to dinner (6:00pm). Beach sand is nice but chairs seem to fill up. Palapas are spoken for early in the morning so get cracking if you want one. Pool chairs always available. Pool Palapas also more available then at the beach. Designated beach swimming area is roped in. Water was choppy, it because of the winds and you do need water shoes for swimming in it. Hurricane Wilma really messed with the shore line. Water is pretty shallow all the way to the rope barrier. No issues with theft. I have never traveled with jewelry or valuables (ipod, gameboy etc.) so it was never an issue. Did not use room safe (never do) just brought a small lock and locked all cash and travel docs in one outside suitcase compartment and stacked our other suitcases on top of it in the closet. Or - as our travel companions did - place all valuables in bag w. dirty clothes in suitcase. Overall we had a great time. When this hotel is fully staffed and fully completed I won't be able to afford it. But I would go back Playa Del Carmen again. The place truly is gorgeous. Knowledge is power and I would recommend it to anyone who is fully informed about what can be problematic and loves a good deal - hee hee!", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cDevil In Disguise\u201d", "Author": "vitousa", "ReviewID": "UR14013529", "Content": "Everyone's reviews on this place are right on. . . .. Beautiful place, no service. We stayed Feb.27 -Mar.2. We traveled with 3 other couples; we booked the Platnum Suite and they were booked in the Laguna Villa Suites. Upon arrival, the front desk staff basically just ignored us, as we stood there wating to check in. No warm welcome with champagne or towel either, but that wouldn't have made or broke my vacation anyway. We were smiling and happy to be there. . . .full of good energy! When they finally spoke to us, I did tell them that my husband and I were in the Platinum Suites, but they said it didn't matter, we still needed to see them. Their bad energy rubbed off on us very quickly as they said the Laguna Suites were over-booked and they needed to downgrade the others into other rooms. That doesn't sit well when there was no compension and the Funjet Rep. was useless the entire time as well. His only concern was selling us trips. At the end of our trip this was all laughable.. . . just hope someone pulls through for us at home i.e. our travel agent or Funjet Vacations and we are compensated. After the others spent one to two nights in stinky sewer smelling rooms, they eventually got into a Villa Suite, which by the way is wonderful, if your room was cleaned or even just having someone come in daily to make your bed would have been nice, and got the amenties included. They are way understaffed. I can't believe Funjet or any other travel company is selling this place listing all the amenties and knowing that their customers aren't getting them. False advertising at it's best! If I listed them all I would be wasting too much energy on this place. If you do go. . . . Just book a regular room, the cheapest room they've got, and that way you will have no expectations. Tip right away. . . .SHOW YOUR MONEY right off the bat with everything. It sets the mood for the person serving you, and you then will get better service. They expect tips at this place, and will not please you or get you what you want unless you show some money right away. We found that some of the workers actually will work the system because they know to say one thing and then they will get some money from you and eventually give you what you deserve. Also, watch your stuff, they are smooth! The workers are thiefs. My husband's jacket was stolen. I think they were hoping he had something valuable in it, but thankful there was not. I'm just hoping that a little mayan baby was wrapped in it that night and it wasn't just tossed in the garbage after they noticed there was no money. I must say it really is a beautiflul (and slippery) place.

It definitely is a beautiful and large resort. Our room was very nice and modern. It does have the potential and eventually when they have enough trained staff (which I think will be awhile) it should get better. Regardless, we still had a great time and on the most part we did not have any major issues. Check In: It was probably around 11 p.m. We were in room 8101 which is very close to the lobby. It was a good location, but the door cards/keys did not work like many other guests so we needed to have them reprogrammed. When we arrived at our room unfortunately we only had one bed and a couch (there were 3 of us). We had booked a junior deluxe suite so I slept on the couch for the first night with a towel I had brought. The room itself was clean, no towels, water or beer, but hey..we did get the tequila and the fruit basket. (ha ha). It was no problem though because we called and the next day they brought us all of the above. We had hoped we would be able to get a room with 2 beds the next day, but unfortunately they said they were overbooked so we had a cot brought in once I spoke to the Air Transat rep. The front desk staff is not very helpful. Although I did find the ladies always helpful if you were lucky to get one of them. The guy at the desk frequently is on the phone and usually ignores you. I noticed that when guests would go up to the desk. They mentioned several times they were overbooked but I don\u2019t understand that? How can you overbook a resort and not have enough beds/rooms for people? The only issue I have with the cot is they only give you a sheet not any blankets, so if the air conditioning is very cool, you only have a sheet to cover up with. Our room was always clean, so we were lucky. We left several different things for our maid each day including tipping her. We never had a problem. I met several travellers that had so many problems with their rooms. One couple arrived at their room and it was dirty, towels in the toilet, but obviously that was the previous travellers that stayed in the room and left it like that and the cleaning staff hadn\u2019t had a chance to clean it yet. Those travellers that leave rooms like that should really give their head a shake (bunch of idiots). Other people complained about the sewer smell, but we didn\u2019t have that at all. At first when I started reading reviews on TA I thought they were exaggerating, but after speaking with individuals first hand there were many families not happy. The general consensus is that most bookings land up with one king size bed and a couch (not a pull out) and it is pretty hard to all share one bed especially if there is a family of 4 (who I met). If there are only 2 of you travelling, it is great because you land up with a king bed most of the time. The beach was nice, water was ok, but it does have seaweed in spots with rocks in those areas. Pools were great as we spend the majority of our time around them. I found the staff very friendly and helpful to us with the exception of the front desk. We tipped very generously and the service seemed to be pretty good just a bit slow. They do only have one bar on the beach with two bartenders. They were extremely busy and working hard to try to keep up with the unreal amount of travellers standing in front of them. I still found them friendly. Drinks!! Well they were great\u2026tons to choose from and very tasty! We only went to 2 a la cartes. The Japanese and Italian. I loved the Japanese our party thought it was fantastic. Italian, too be honest I didn\u2019t care for it at all and found the service not very great. Buffets, I liked the variety of food, but we did wait some days about 30 minutes in line for pasta. I read many reviews before we left about bugs but this is something uncontrollable. Because of the amount of water that surrounds the resort this is bound to happen.Yes there are bugs you just may be lucky not to get bit. I think they may be sand fleas and of course the mosquitos (which usually come out at night when it\u2019s cool). You have to understand when people post reviews everyone is DIFFERENT. They may be more prone to bites or be allergic so it affects them different. We do have several bites on us, but what can ya do? We did bring repellent and it helped a bit. Our room didn\u2019t have any bugs/mosquitos as far as I could see. I think we got the bites from the beach and walking at night. So overall, just a few minor things which were no big deal, but the biggest problem is LACK of trained staff. They are trying and hopefully in the future they will be fully staffed. It is a great resort but needs a bit of work. It is new so you have to be patient. Oh, one more thing\u2026 The toilets are low flush so make sure to hold the handle down up to 30 seconds. I don\u2019t think many guests realize that because many times the public washrooms weren\u2019t flushed. Grab a cervesa, sit by the pool (closest to the beach) and have fun!

Were supposed to leave resort at 7am for 10 am flight, but got a call aruond 2am from our rep saying we have to check out at 12pm and our bus leaves at 7. Started to bring our bags to the lobby at 12pm, but a nice couple we met down there ran up to us who recognized us from our flight and said Transat was giving us the rooms until 5pm...ran up to the Transat Office and they confirmed we had the room until 5pm. Finally left the resort at 2am for 7am flight the next day. Overall a great experience. We arrived at the resort at 12pm, told checkin was at 3pm. Went back and they gave us room key. We expected our room was not ready and it wasn't...I found our maid and tipped him $5 and we got it around 4pm with our bottle of Tequila and fruit basket. Robes and slippers where there. We were the 3rd floor, in builing 6000 facing the platinum suites with ocean view. Literally a 10 minutes brisk walk to the lobby. I won't bother with details others have already stated so I'll try to give some tips/observations. 1. TV did not work when it rained. 2. You can get all the way to the lobby under cover if it rains. 3. We found the male maids to be not as good as the female maids. 4. Room was not made 1 day. Sometime it would be done at 10am, sometimes 3pm. 5. Front desk staff very inexperienced. Don't expect too much from them like a room change. We met people who arrived late due to their flight by one day and the hotel literally had no rooms for them. 6. Transat gave us our rooms until 5pm, but poor communication with front desk as new guests had access to our room at 3pm. We did take the new bottle of tequila and mini bar alchohol! 7. You can book all your ala cartes on one day...get there at 9am. 8. Exchange your beach towels at the end of the day instead of getting the cards. 9. Get to beach chairs early. We were there at 7am with 90% of chairs \"reserved' with books, rocks, branches, cups...I've never seen that before. 10. Water shoes a must. 11. Take a walk to the left side of the beach to watch new resorts being built. 12. Leave valuables in luggage. 13. Tipping greeter at alacartes can get you in last minute. We had 5 ala cartes instead of just our regular 3. 14. Mango daquiris are a must try! 15. Reserve the beds by the pools early as they get reserved fast. 16. Expect to wait in line at alacartes. Dinner around 8pm is very busy with long waits. Tip: sneak in the back doors near the bar and ask the wait staff for a seat with the $1 handshake...I did it several times. 17. Email resort with room requests before you leave...we got what we wanted. 18. Fave restaurants in order of best to least: Fondue, Asian (sit down), Asian (Tepanyaki), Italian. 19. Thai restaurant was $35 when we went there. 20. Free shuttle to playa every morning at 10am and return at 6pm(I think). Get there at 9am to reserve a spot at the lobby. 21. Bug spray a must for the evening. 22. Shows were very boring. Much like other resorts, but not much interaction with the guests. 23. Ask for extra towels for the leaking situation in the shower. 24. Bring your own kleenex. 25. Worst hotel map ever...photocopies of bad copies. Hopefully they will get some new ones. This place is massive.

Just returned recently from a mostly pleasant stay at the Grand Riviera Princess. I'm glad I went Platinum, but will probably not return to this resort. The weather was great.. Too hot at the pools and beach, just kidding. It was great. If you want shade, claim it early enough. Saying that, the chair game is played here too. There are a lot of loungers and the pools are huge. Actually saw some people doing the bad game of saving more than one at the pool. Shame on you. The beach is fantastic. It is so large (not quite DR large, but large). Oh, there are sand crabs on this beach. The clearish kind that run sideways. They don\u2019t make the little balls when they dig their holes. I was moved to the Riviera side. I thought it looked better than the SS side only due to the foilage surrounding the areas. Also \"heard\" that the SS side had 2 beds and the Riv has the 1 king bed. I am actually glad I got the Riviera side because you are nearer the plat beach section if you choose to lounge there. If you have an ocean view room you can see if the loungers are filling up and hurry yourself to get outside to get your chosen location. I also got to see the moon nitely. Plus there was an eclipse that took place too. My room # 5117.. 2nd floor FACING the ocean. It was actually a great room. There are 4 rooms that stick out a little farther in the center, then I think there are 4 more on either side. There are 2 bridges to the beach. One in the center and one to the side of the Riv (this one is kind of a secret. From the SS side you go thru the restaurant. A few of the Plat Perks Massage, yes. I paid $55 more to make it an hour. Both parties recieved the 1/2 hour massage voucher. A couple prices from the list: Swedish 50mn -$85, Energy Antistress 75mn - $120, Facial 45mn - $85. Besides the regular spa indoor rooms, this place also has little huts situated outside. The huts are open vented, thatched roof, on the lagoon. You can't see inside them. There is a fountain which you can hear during the massage. If it's too hot you may prefer the indoor rooms. Sheets are not used during the treatments, towels are. You\u2019ll see why below (the linen thing). There is a nice pool in the spa. Inside this pool there is a massage lounge. This is not included. To go in here is $18. They also have the \u201cTemazcal\u201d hut located outside. It is: Indigenous Herbal Steam Bath. I didn\u2019t do this. I didn't even check on the dive, but Salvador told me the location was on the beach to check with them. The location is between the SS and center bridge on the beach. you can't miss them. There are DVD\u2019s, but you\u2019ll have to look them over as I wasn\u2019t interested. The AC worked just fine, plus there are \u201c2\" fans in the room that work great. Did not see anything regarding the pillow menu. I asked about it and there is supposed to be info in the room. Turn down service never happened. Didn\u2019t even get a towel creature. (Speaking of beds:: the linens are not cotton. This alone will not make this a 5. That\u2019s my opinion. If you\u2019re in the sun and put on lotions and even after taking a shower, these linens are still hot. The same with the comforter cover. It\u2019s all slippery so be careful). There are the towels, robes and slippers in the room. Internet at the lounge is the other computer is the concierge is not using it. Private check in was great. Premium liquors at your very own lounge. Also the snacks available. Reservations for the dinners. This is great. Victor was so helpful too. I think the welcome gift was the bottle of tequila, plus there was a tray of fruits. Did receive the beach bag plus a hat and Tshirt. It will work for the beach or pool, nothing fancy. Wasn't even expecting it. Ala cartes ~ I did 3. I got the reservations made when I first got there for the 2 I knew I wanted to go to. Then I lucked out with the 3rd on my last nite. Victor got me in there.. Miso ~ ok for the show, the food was ok too. It was hot as it just came off the grill. Mexican ~ loved it. One of my appetizers was TOO hot. I did that by mistake, but it was still good. I asked to split the shrimp and chicken. He said fine. Again the shrimp was fantastic!! Chicken was good too. Fondue ~ made the mistake earlier that day going in to town and craving queso fundido. Otherwise the fodue was good. Beef was really quite good on this plate. I was surprised. I don't do veges too much, so can't comment on those. I heard the seafood was horrible from a few people. There is only so many people allowed in the ala cartes. That's crazy. The buffets towards the beach aren't opened in the evening. Everyone else is stuffed up at the 2 remaining buffets which just aren't large enough for the amount of people staying there. There are lines outside of the buffet waiting to enter. Buffets ~ You don't want to spend major parts of your days standing in lines. I\u2019ve stayed at smaller resorts that had a more adequate buffet set up for the amount of people. In my opinion they are just too small and not laid out well for the flow of people. They have the typical buffet food variety. You really won't go hungry, there is always good breads too. If this is your first resort, it may be ideal for setting the standards to your future journeys. Breakfast they open at 7:30, lunch at 12:00, dinner at 6p.m. The mid buffets open at noon for lunch. This disco is opened 10:30 til 2a.m. The sports bar is 24 hours. This place has 1200+ rooms?? That's a lot of people. There is not enough staff. That equals grumpy guests that take it out on the staff which is there trying to help you. In room Premium bar?? That's funny.. 3 little bottles.. An Orendain tequila, a johnny walker red, and something else. Those are in the fridge, only 3 little plane sized bottles. Then in there is the other beverages ~ waters, sodas and some beer. Have heard of \"no\" motorized sports. There are waverunners down the beach that must be for rent. They were zooming around frequently. Didn't even want to find out about dinner on the beach.. Actually I think that's the one at the restaurant at the beach. Don't quote me on that one. If the place is full ~ thank goodness you are at the platinum. Everything in the evening is up at the front. It is a long ways if you forgot something. Also if you just want to sit with a cocktail in the evening, you have your own lobby bar ~ that was really cool. Plus there are snacks. One of the better things is in the morning there is coffee and fruits and some rolls. Sometimes in the afternoon there is fantastic chilled shrimp ~ it is so good. The main thing was at nite. It is so far up front, but the Plat has ~ your own concierge, beverages, snacks, internet, pool (too small for me, loved the large pools), I also think the room service came quicker. I can't complain about the employees due the the very low ratio. I felt bad for them. It's not the cooks fault at the buffet pasta station or omelet station fault that you're not being served fast enough. This is the same person that's filling up the plates? Another thing was that I didn't hear many of the local black birds that make their nice sounds. One day I almost went into shock cause I heard about 3 birds at the same time. It's just something that is common to hear and see those birds atop huts. I took a picture of one of the baby beds and will post that too. I did see another type, but didn\u2019t have the camera. The air transit beach party looked very successful on Thursday nite. I had also seen it posted at their lobby location. (only mentioning this because a couple weeks ago no one had known of the party). I'm sure I've forgot something or another", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cA thorough and honest review. . .\u201d", "Author": "Noni72", "ReviewID": "UR13907629", "Content": "My sister, mother and myself were vacationers at the GRP Feb 21 - 27, 2008. The Grand Riviera Princess and Grand Sunset Princess are on the same grounds, and they share the pool area, so in reality, this is probably a 1400 room hotel. This was our first time at an all-inclusive and I will attempt to be thorough and honest with my review. We selected the Platinum option for the hotel. There were definately some advantages to the platinum package - location, convinience, quiet, however, not all of the ammenities to the package are in place for guests yet, simply due to the resort being understaffed. We were originally assigned to room 5114, however, switched rooms the next day to room 5118, as the first room only had a king size bed to accomodate three adults (we had requested two queen beds for three adults), we were given a roll-away immediately until we could switch rooms the following day. Despite the hotel being understaffed, all of the staff were incredibly friendly and did the absolute best they could considering the staff shortage. CHECK-IN: If you are chosing the platinum option, please note that check-in does not happen in the main lobby. You will need to go to the Platinum lounge for check in, which is located in the first floor of the bldg you will be staying in - which is at the opposite end of the resort from the main lobby. It is a long walk if you want, however, there is a golf cart stye buggy that will transport you from the main lobby to the lounge. The buggy is located on the floor below the main lobby on the edge of the bldg on the side road, you will need to navigate a big to locate it as it was not clearly marked. You can choose to leave your luggage in the main lobby and have staff bring it for you. At check-in time, there was only one concierge to handle all of the matters (check-in, requests, reservations, etc. . ) in the platinum section. Although the staff was very kind and as accomodating as they could be, it was very clear that the owners/management of the resort has left it understaffed. From the time we arrived, until we were finally in our room, it took over two hours. Highly recommend to do reservations for the restaurants while you are checking in. ROOMS: Platinum rooms are all located in the same building, which is three stories. Not all rooms face the ocean. If you have a first floor room, you will get a larger deck, but your view may be limited. Room 5118 had a great view of the beach/ocean, beds were extremely comfortable, however, they were lacking storage space - lots of room to hang clothes, but no drawers to put things in? Since this resort is new, there are still some growing pains, but every time we dealt with staff they were extremely courteous and kind. RESTAURANTS: There are several specialty restaurants - Italian, Miso, Fondue, Seafood, etc. . in addition to the buffet. If you plan on attending a specialty restaurant - recommend you make reservations at check-in. We were not able to get reservations until later in the evening (7p,8p and 9p), so we did not get a full sample of all the restaurants. I would HIGHLY recommend the \"dinner at the beach\" option located in the Thai restaurant on the \"Grand Sunset\" side of the hotel. You can pay for ordering off the Thai menue, but this beach dinner was included in the platinum package. The ambiance was incredible, it was quiet, ocean side, open air, under a full moon. The food was fantastic, and service at this restaraunt was flawless. One of the perks to Platinum was that the lounge offered continental breakfast every morning with fresh fruit, juice, pastry, coffee, full-bar, along with Mid-day snacks from lunch time to late afternoon which consisted of shirmp, pico de galla, fruit, and other interestingly tasty snack options. There is also a restaurant located adjacent to the platinum building for a full breakfast and lunch menu and/or buffet. We actually took a taxi in to Playa del Carmen for dinner two night, as we have stayed in this area before and the atmosphere on 5th Ave is wonderful for open air dining and incredible people watching oppotunities. You will seen and hear people from all over the world. La Quinta Pasion has great Mexican food, and the Blue Lobster on 5th/12 has AMAZING lobster. SWIMMING: There are several pools in between the Sunset and Riviera that all guests share, some of them consist of salt-water, some chlorine. A couple of the pools wind around and offered a great, quiet swimming opportunity in the morning. The pool/patio area is virtually empty early morning before 8am and after 7pm. There is a \"private\" pool area for Platinum guests, which was fairly small, quiet and located adjacent to the Platinum Suites, giving you convinient access to the Platinum lounge, bathrooms, snacks, and airconditioning . There is plenty of shade options as well at the hotel, however, despite what previous reviews may have said, you will need to get up a \"reserve\" your chair early mornings if you have a preference of where you want to sun. Platinum suites are also located closest to the beach, there is a separate roped off area at the beach for Platinum guests. PATIENCE: Bring some. This is a beautiful NEW resort, and as we came to learn, many of the staff had been hired in the past two weeks, as the resort is just now operating under full-capacity. Also, in speaking directly with the staff, they do not get paid much of a waige, and also, they only get a small portion of the \"all-inclusive\" rate as tips, therefore we tipped as often as we could when the service warranted it. Our favorite part of the trip were all of the wonderful people we met, both guests and staff from all over the world. I personally would not stay again at this resort, but nothing to do specifiacally with the GRP. The \"all-inclusive\" is just not for me, as there is not much of a connection to the local culture, it is way too commercialized.", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cA 3 star ressort at best\u201d", "Author": "seanote48", "ReviewID": "UR13887698", "Content": "My Husband and I just returned on February 23rd after spending a week there. We are not a couple who ae really fussy or sweat the small stuff but this place leaves a lot to be desired. We arrived at 10:30 am on Feb 16th and did not get a room until 7PM. The front desk peoploe kept telling everyone to come back later. I felt so bad for the young families as they looked so tired by supper time. It appears this is an ongoing problem. The main issue seems to be that they are short staffed and very disorganised. Bottom line they maybe should have waited until they were ready before opening this very new location.Normal supplies for the room were hard to come by (facecloths, sheets that fit, coffee, shampoo etc...) until we discovered that if you leave a nice tip on the bed every morning you got all you asked for. The rooms on the main floor smelt like an open sewer when the air conditioning was on. Not sure what the problem is. Mosquitos and black flies were a real issue in the room until we were supplied with a bottle of raid and packets of insecticide wipes which we applied before bed On the positive side the food, beach and weather were wonderful and we spend most of our time at the beach. We have stayed at another Princess Hotel and were very happy so I eally think the problems are due to the fact this ressort opened mid December.

I am greatly dissatisfied the remainder of the resort was unable to sustain that level of excellence. Following is a lengthy description of the quandary ensued by my family and myself on our 3night/4day stay at the Princess on February 18th through the 21st. After our arrival to the airport, we were transported to the Grand Riviera Princess via shuttle. One of the passengers knew a modest amount of Spanish and the driver spend the entire trip to the resort conversing solely with him. Following being disembarked on the wrong side of the resort, we were transferred to the correct side via bellboy. Upon arriving at the lobby at 2:30pm, we checked in and were told our room was not entirely ready. We were advised to go downstairs to the restaurant for a meal and drinks, our room keys would be available upon our return. After returning to the front desk, there were a number of large groups, with several complaints, ahead of us. After waiting patiently in line for 75 minutes, we were told that our room was still not prepared. We were told to return in 1 hour for our keys. Upon our return, we were told that our room was still not prepared however that clerk would give us our room keys in order to place our luggage in the room. When my husband asked where our room was, we were told simply \u201cIt is hard to explain, just keep walking that way until you find it.\u201d Adventurous and fatigued at this point, we took off in search of our room. After several attempts, we were unsuccessful because the rooms were numbered with very little rhyme or reason. We returned to the front desk where we were presented with a crude map that would have proved helpful on our first attempt. When we arrived at our room at 6:30pm, the housekeepers had just arrived and were quite surprised that we were there also. After several attempts to communicate through an obvious language barrier, we called the front desk in order to converse with the housekeepers. We informed them that we were going down to the pool and to continue cleaning the room. Upon arriving back at our room at 7:30pm, we found the room to still be in complete disarray with trash from previous occupants, no soap except one remaining from previous occupants, no shampoo, no towels or washcloths, the mini-bar remained not supplied, and food from the previous occupants was present to mane a few. In addition, the room contained one king size bed and couch instead of 2 double beds. We returned to the front desk where we were informed that a room change was unavailable due to the full capacity. When we inquired for a room exchange for the following day, we were told \u201cProbably not.\u201d Because we were to remain in the same room, we also inquired about the missing necessities and bedding for the couch for our 12 year old daughter. Although we were assured these necessities would be delivered promptly, nothing came even following several phone conversations and trips to the front desk. We removed bedding from the bed in order to cover the couch for her and showered with the small amount of shampoo, towels, etc. that I had brought from home. The next morning, with a new approach, we saw a housekeeper in the hall and showed her what we required, she complied. Because we were given no information, we were often trying to decipher which restaurants were for which meals, their locations, and hours. We were told by several patrons we would figure it out just in time to go home. After figuring out where to go for breakfast and lunch, we were told at the front desk, on one of our many trips, that reservations were required for dinner and available through the concierge only. After waiting through another long line, my husband was informed that since we were only staying for 3 nights, we were only accessible to one dinner reservation, ensuring that our remaining meals would be at the buffets. Many meals were consumed without a drink, even water, ever being presented; except breakfast, were multiple juices were readily available on the buffet. Much to my daughter\u2019s disappointment, she was unable to participate in the Kids\u2019 Club activities. We were not notified or even aware that it existed until Wednesday afternoon at the pool. Nor were we able to partake in any excursions outside the hotel because we were not notified of the locations to sign-up and employees did not speak English enough to understand our questions regarding directions. We were also unable to partake of any of the entertainment around the hotel because of lack of information, including the spa, disco, gym, or live entertainment. We were scheduled to fly out on Thursday afternoon and still had not heard anything regarding transportation to the airport by Wednesday afternoon. We were becoming worried and went to the front desk regarding this issue. The front desk took us that transportation to the airport was not included. Following a debate, we were told to speak with the concierge who responded the same. We disagreed to no avail. We had to return to our room and retrieve our e-travel documentation and present it to the concierge. Following a discussion and viewing our travel documents, he told us \u201cYour XXXXXX rep is over there, you\u2019re going to have to deal with him.\u201d When we went to speak with him, we told him that we were not notified that he was there, nor had we seen anyone in the uniform there or any of our other MANY trips to the front desk. He reported that it was his first day there and someone else had been there on the previous days. He was very helpful and retrieved our travel information promptly. When he inquired about our stay and we gave him a brief overall of a few low points, he apologized. Again, this is Wednesday afternoon around 4:00pm before we were given notice that a Funjet rep was present. In order to go on vacation, we left behind a baby with a family member. Having already experienced issues in regards to high phone bills on a previous stay, we had the foresight to purchase an international pre-paid calling card. After calling to ensure that card would work in the Riviera Maya and given the correct numbers to dial, we felt prepared to call home to order to check on the baby. On our first and every subsequent phone call, we were told there would be a $3.00 USD fee to connect, which we agreed to. Often it would require 4-7 phone calls to the operator for connection before we were able to get through. After inquisition, we were assured we would only get charged when we spoke to a US operator. We had three phone calls home, one each night. Because of all the previous discrepancies with the front desk thus far, we inquired regarding our phone bill on Wednesday before returning to our room. The front desk clerk initially laughed when we requested our balance, then told us the bill would be $10. Although this was $1 more than it should have been, we decided not to push the issue over $1 taking into consideration all of our previous complaints and quite happy we were only being charged $1 over. When I questioned why he laughed when he saw the bill, he stated \u201cIt would be that equivalent to $18,000 in the US, so I know something\u2019s wrong.\u201d The next morning at check out, we were told the bill was $39 USD. After much disagreement with the clerk and many conversations between her and the manager, we asked to speak with the manager. The clerk stated he was too busy with another complaint. When we refused to pay the bill, on concept, we were told we would have to wait a while to speak with the manager. After some time, the manager motioned us over and continued to declare that we owed the $39 regardless of previous conversations with staff members. We were charged for $3 to connect and $4 per minute, only on one call. One call from our second night was not even on the bill. When I explained that we were not trying to elude the bill, we only wanted to pay the portion that was correct, he started to become irritated. After explaining that we were told it would be $3 per connection and that we had checked the balance the pervious night, he wanted to know that name of every operator that I had spoke with and the name of the front desk clerk from the night before! He said that how did he know that we were telling the truth! He even stated on numerous occasions that our calling card did not work in Mexico and we should have bought a Mexican calling card. Even after showing him the card stated both \u201cglobal\u201d and \u201cinternational\u201d on it, he insisted that it did not work in Mexico. After 1 and \u00bd hours, the only way I was able to persuade him that we were correct was by attempting to place another to home from his telephone, when the operator stated it would be $3 to connect without a per minute charge, I had the operator speak with the manager. Because he was speaking in Spanish, I cannot know exactly what was said; however, he was becoming more aggravated by the minute. He even had the operator speak to me again and inform me that it was $3 to connect. I affirmed that we were aware and agreed to the charge; nevertheless they were still charging $4 per minute in addition to the $3 connect charge. He took the phone back and spoke with her again. After disconnecting, he stated \u201cSomeone is going to pay it.\u201d When we refused, he called the operator again and had the manager come up. We explained the situation to her, showed her the bill and the calling card. She promptly corrected the bill and apologized. After she left, the front desk manager was friendlier and stated, \u201cYes, we know our hotel has a lot of bugs to work out. We are not ready to be open.\u201d Lastly, not because this completes our list of grievances but rather I am quickly becoming fatigued of complaining, our flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to St. Louis was horrendous. Due to awful weather in St. Louis, multiple flights that day were canceled and numerous patrons were trying to get on our flight home, much to our understanding and concord. However, the problems began to occur when the boarding time grew near. A gate attendant offensively stated, over the loud speaker, how booked the flight was and that everyone should ensure their carry-on luggage was of the proper size and number due to capacity. Following multiple announcements, the flight began to board in chaos. After few people had boarded, she again announced quite rudely and unprofessionally to ensure the size and number of your carry-ons. She stated that once you were to the gate and your luggage was determined too large, it would be brought below, where there was only room for four more pieces of luggage. She declared that once those four spaces were taken, all others would be flown to St. Louis the following day. While understanding that the day was stressful for both staff and passengers that day, there were no reasons to be distasteful and disrespectful to the passengers. Our daughter did not even want to get on the flight following her multiple outbursts. While boarding, the same attendant walked by with a piece of luggage, all the while yelling \u201cMove to the right up to the door! Then move to the left! MOVE! MOVE!\u201d Then she threw the piece of luggage in a door on the loading walkway and declared \u201cYeah, we love it when they say fragile!\u201d This vacation was my daughter\u2019s first trip out of the US, first flight, first resort, and so forth. I am very displeased to express our dissatisfaction. In July 2007, we booked a vacation through Funjet to Cancun that was splendid and we were anticipating sharing the astonishing experience with her. Had this trip been our first experience with Funjet or Mexico, we would not be returning to either! A response is required and greatly appreciated.

I've always stayed at 5 stars...so far the Barcelo Maya Beach Resort is my favorite. Like the Princess, I went to the Barcelo when it was brand spanking new and the rates were low. I had the vacation of a lifetime... it was to die for. The Princess has all the \"right stuff\" in terms of amenties but misses the mark in terms of service by a long shot. Too bad. Returned yesterday from GR Princess (Feb 17 to 24) via Signature Vacations from Ottawa. Price was right. Travelled with 18 year old daughter. Thought it would be a good choice for a safe and fun vacation. Room: Arrived at 2pm and like everyone else the \"room wasn't ready\". Ok..no big deal, we changed in the bathroom, threw on our bathing suits and headed for the pool. I double-checked that we would be getting a room with 2 beds...anywhere in the resort as long as it wasn't on the ground floor. The really, and I mean really rude staff assured me that was the case. When we finally got a room around 5pm...guess what...1 bed on the ground floor. I didn't want to ruin my daughter's vacation by having a hissy fit, so I told her we'd make due for the night and they would certainly fix us up in the morning. I'd read about the mosquito problem and came armed with a can of OFF. The room was infested. We spent an hour killing them. Next day I put on my nicest face and requested a room change. I got punted from clerk to clerk...and heard every possible excuse which included the following (1) we are over booked (2) we are sending people to other hotels (3) it is an upgrade to move to the 2nd floor...you can pay us $60 US per night (4) Signature Vacations does not get upper rooms - live with it (5) we don't like your rep...too bad for you. Well...that's all I needed to hear. Hell hath no fury....off I went in search of our Signature Rep. Long story short...after tracking down the rep I lost it. (so did several other Signature Vacation patrons who were having the same problem). We finally got a room change....2nd floor...2 beds. Gee was that hard? Actually it was - it took 4 days. I had to check the new room myself...get a janitor to open the room door and make sure it was ready and report same back to the front desk. (it's a hike in a pair of wedgies)...bring those ugly Crocs..you'll need them. Everyone had them on (but me). I'd of sold my first born for a pair....well you get the drift. Solution: Bring in some trained staff...and hire twice as many housecleaners...those little ladies do the best they can with what they've got. The rooms weren't terribly clean....but I felt sorry for them as they hardly had any supplies. It would have changed the whole tone of the holiday if they would put their best food forward from the get go. My daughter and I spent far too much precious \"sun time\" hanging out at that aweful front desk listening to person after person get the royal run around. Some people had specific details of their bookings in WRITING...and were met with a dead pan \"too bad, their has been a mistake with your agent\". I've never heard such non-sense. Everything else seems to fade to the background when they ruin all your vacation joy in the first 5 minutes. Despite the room fiasco, we had a fabulous holiday. Darned if that was gonna get the best of us. We ate till we couldn't stuff any more in our faces. I've done some all inclusives when you can't eat anything but the french fries...not here...lots to chose from....no complaints at all. Spa is lovely...daughter had an aloe vera massage for $99 US. I'm a runner and the gym was great. Too hot really to run on the treadmill, but the facility is as nice as any upscale gym. Lots of paths to run on..but get out there early...it's hot! Pools are plentiful and nice. Lots of chairs...but fewer in the shade. Get out early for a good spot. Oceanside is nice...but bring those water shoes..the rocks were painful. We went canoing...played tennis...played pool at the sports bar...sent emails daily....tanned ourselves silly...and gained 5 lbs. Can't be all bad. Tips: Bring your travel coffee mug (I lost my Timmy's mug on the first day and was beside myself) Bring comfy walking shoes.....like Crocs Don't over pack...no one really dresses up for anything. Bring musquito spray (I left mine behind for the next guest) Bring your own bar of soap and kleenex Tip the maids---it does help Don't put anything valuable in the safe, keep every locked in your luggage Don't expect your cell phone to work..even with pre-authorization from your carrier...it's like a giant dead zone A nice couple from Texas said to us....during one of many sessions at the front desk trying to negotiate a room change \"Get used to it...it's Mexico\". To some degree, I certainly agree...stay home if you are expecting this to be like a five star back home. You either have to let it go and not expect too much...or better yet...head to a real deluxe hotel on the Mayan like the Barcelo Maya Beach Resort or the Moon Palace or the Adventura Spa. ;)", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "kelowna", "Title": "\u201cnot what you expect for a princess resort....\u201d", "Author": "barbaraKelowna", "ReviewID": "UR13821248", "Content": "We just returned from 2 weeks at the Princess Resort. I will start with the positive aspects of our stay. The resort is a beautiful set of biuldings, grounds , pools etc. The a la cartes are very nicely decorated as are the lobbies etc. I am not a great buffet fan but they were really quite good. Excellent selection of fruit and great salad greens. Everything was crisp and really fresh. Desserts were good and wonderful ice cream everyday. You could have freshly made pasta to order that was wonderful but at times you could wait 25minutes as there was only one cook and cooking one order at a time. The drinks were all made with premium alcolhol and were great. The sand area of the beach was nice and had lots of shade palapas ect. We enjoyed the shows and entertainment. Now for the negative: We arrived at around 8PM. No welcome drink or even a welcome. We made sure we double checked upon check in to see if our room was a king (as was booked) and were told it was. After waiting for someone to take us to our room with our bags and up to the second floor in the dark were shown to our room. Guess what? a room with two double beds. We phoned the front desk and were told to stay in that room and call back tomorrow and they would see what they could do. We refused and returned to the from desk and surprise \"a king room appeared\". It was 1 am by the time we were in our room. We were suppose to recieve a fruit basket and bottle of alcohol upon arrival and after asking our travel rep two times it finally arrived on day 5. The entire resort is very short staffed. It continually got worse as our two weeks went by as the resort got filled to the max with tourists but the same amount of employees were working there. There is absolutely no management on duty and no training whatsoever anywhere. We tiped our houskeeper $4 dollars most days and service decreased so we stopped tipping them. One day we actually had to ask them to clean the floors they were so dirty and not done for 5 days !! In two weeks our patio doors were not cleaned once as was our bathtup shelf area or shower...... In two weeks the hallways everywhere were never cleaned, mopped or swept. We had the same red wine spills down the hallway for the entire time. The ants loved the dirty hallways. Elevator in our biulding reeked and was never cleaned once in two weeks...unbelievable for a five star resort. With two thousand people staying at the resort there is one yes I said one bar at the beach and two bartenders that were rude most of the time. Ocean in front of the resort is horrible for swimming, really rocky and my husband cut his foot open the first time he went for a swim on sharp rocks. We stayed in the Riviera side in biulding 6 which was a great locationas it is right in the middle of the resort.. The main lobby bar which was beautiful and huge had 2 bartenders and 2 servers for the entire bar which in the evening held at least 150 people ??? We tried booking a la cartes the second week and were told most of them were booked for the entire week. We were able to get into two but not the ones we requested. The buffet restaurants after 8 had at least 40 people in line till well after 9 so make sure you eat early if you are going to a buffet. We met 3 different groups of people that were literally taken to or sent by themselves to rooms in the middle of the night that were allready occupied !!!surprise !! I met lots of people that moved 2 to 3 times in one week. We did ot get a deal as others we spoke to did on the cost ot our two weeks. We paid just under $7000 for two weeks and did not expect the resort to be perfect but were really dissapointed to find it as bad as it was in the service end. I have been to Mexico 9 or 10 times and this is not even close to a five star in service or cleanliness. Twice we returned to our room to find our cards were cancelled by the front desk. It is a long way to go to the front dest to have them replaced when you just returned from the lobby... The staff in the buffet restaurants worked really hard and we tipped them all the time. The cleaniness was really lacking everywhere you looked. After about 8 days I wiped down the doors between the bathroom and bedroom because I could not stand how dirty they were. The hand dryers in all the ladies washrooms were never hooked up till the last few days of our stay. None of the bathroom door knobs locked or were even attached in the ladies wash rooms anywhere. Some of the ladies wash room doors on the stalls actually had see through windows ???At one point in one of the ladies washrooms of the main buffet restaurants off the main track to the beach there was the entire sink drain pipe and fixture laying in one of the sinks for 3 days.....that washroom only had two sinks and one was in pieces ??? We witnessed lots of people have meltdowns because of wrong rooms, plumbing that did not work, no AC at all and were blown off by the front end staff. It really is too bad as I always thought that the Princess Resorts had a standard that made them 5 star resorts and have stayed at them before and this is no way compared to any I have even heard of. You could actually see the housekeeping staff playing soccer in the mornings behind the biuldings instead of cleaning rooms ,as there are no managers or supervisors anywhere. We did not have any problems with theft but met people that were in the prestige class rooms that had stuff stolen from their rooms. During our two weeks we did see more lighting being installed along paths etc. They advertise that there are two snack bars and an ice cream parlor that do not excist at all. The general store has horrible rude staff and don't even sell books or newspapers.", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mountain View, California", "Title": "\u201cDecent, but nowhere close to a 5-star property (yet)\u201d", "Author": "roadwarrior101", "ReviewID": "UR13811358", "Content": "My fiancee and I love vacationing in Mexico, particularly to Cabo. We had never been to the Cancun area or the Riviera Maya. When looking at spots, this place looked amazing in pictures and the price couldn't be beat (as compared to other nearby resorts). I was a little worried when reading other's reviews, but decided to take my chances anyway. I would say that I didn't have super high expectations and that overall I had a good experience, but there were some issues that you should be aware of. Check in: We had flown all the way from San Francisco on a red-eye flight to Guadalajara and a connection before arriving in Cancun. So, as you can imagine, by the time we arrived at 1:30pm, we were completely exhausted. I had thought that as with most hotels, if you arrive a tad early and there are rooms available, they'll let you check in. When I get there, they told us that we needed to wait until 3pm. No problem. We go to the buffet while we wait for check-in. We get back at 3pm and the line for check in is long. They seemed to only have a couple people working there and a boatload of people waiting for rooms. We get to the front at 3:15 and they mentioned that our room was not ready. What? I thought that check-in was at 3pm. Ok, so we wait in the lobby for 20 minutes, still in our jeans (from a colder climate), where it is hot and humid here. We come back 20 minutes later and found out that we did not get the room we were promised. We booked a Deluxe Junior Suite pool room but they told us we had a 2nd floor room. I tried arguing with the front desk girl (Erika), but she wouldn't even listen to me. Rather, she ignored me and went to another customer, who spoke better Spanish, even though we were before them in line. We got tired of waiting and decided just to take the 2nd floor room, as we did not want to ruin our vacation. Unfortunately, we didn't get to our room until after 4pm. Room: I'll admit that the Deluxe room was nice (albeit without a pool). I liked the clean look to it, the beds were very comfortable (much more so than those hard beds in most Mexican hotels), the flat screen tv was nice, the bathroom with two sinks was good, as was the shower. I do think that they overbooked the rooms and therefore couldn't give us the room we paid for and just came up with cheap excuses to justify this. I will try to get a partial refund from Funjet (our travel agent). Cleaning: We found that the room was not cleaned up to standards we expect. There was grime around the toilet, the bar was not fully stoked (only one beer, a couple sodas and one water) and the floor was dusty. I read earlier reviews and decided to daily leave a couple dollars of a tip to the housekeeper, along with a note in Spanish. It was true that we did get what we want. If we asked for water, toilet paper or towels, they'd leave us exactly what we wanted and they'd always make the bed. That is about it, however. They often wouldn't really scrub the floor or clean the toilet very well. If we forgot to ask for them to do something (such as give us more water), they wouldn't restock the fridge. So, we ended up paying around $20 in tips to the housekeepers throughout our stay and got better service than most but sub-par service to some. Mosquitos: I did notice mosquitos in our room, mainly because the housekeepers left the rooms open for an hour or so when they cleaned. They weren't great, but weren't terrible. I've heard that the first floor rooms, laguna suites and platinum suites had worst mosquitos than us. We did everything, including spraying around the door, killing bugs when we see them, using garlic pills and after bite. It was an inconvenience but not the end of the world. Still, I think they could do a better job in spraying the grounds and instructing housekeepers not to keep the doors open for that reason. Food: I thought that the food was Ok. We went to three restaurants during our stay. We tried the Japanese, Mexican and the Fondue. I thought that the Japanese was excellent (Benihana style) and was the food highlight of our trip. The Mexican was pretty good and the Fondue was decent. The wait was a little slow at these places, but it didn't really bother us too much. Another thing that I felt upset about was that nobody told us that we were only entitled to 3 dinners throughout our stay. I felt that this was a bit of a bait and switch. I had wanted to try the Thai place, but was told that I couldn't, since we didn't have a Platinum suite. None of the restaurants seemed packed (ever), so I think it was mainly because I heard that they were severly understaffed (900 staff short). We mainly ate at the buffets. I thought they were hit or miss. Quite honestly, other guests make them sound great (comparable to the Bellagio buffet in Vegas). I just thought they were so-so. They were large and extensive. The fresh fruits were very good. A lot of the meats and cheeses were as well. However, a lot of the other stuff they made wasn't so great. The scrambled eggs were very runny and undercooked. The bacon, sausage and hash browns were extremely greasy. The coffee was like water (very weak). The made to order food was good (omelettes and pasta), but the lines for this were long. The desserts weren't very good...starchy and not very flavorful. The ice cream was good though. The wine was terrible. I was expecting imported wine from California and France, but the Mexican red wine and white wine was awful and almost undrinkable. Also, the mixed drinks at the pool were not great. The margaritas were blended. One thing I've loved about other places in Mexico were the margaritas, strong with great tequila and on the rocks. It seemed that these bartenders (very inexperienced) didn't even know what on the rocks meant. I hate blended margaritas. The best mixed drink I had there was a Miami Vice at the party pool bar. I'd recommend this. Pools: Pools are very nice and extensive. You really need to get there early or you will not have a seat, let alone one in the shade. It felt a little overcrowded. I liked the party pool, but they do need to vary the music and activities, as they get repetitive with the same thing every day. Gym: Nice gym with good equipment, but they also need to vary the activities. Nightlife: I did not try the nightclub, but heard it was decent. Some of the bars were nice. I especially liked hanging out at the bar at the Sunset lobby. However, I had more fun on my excursions into both Playa and Cancun at night. Internet: Only 4 computers (1 that didn't work) for all these guests. The wait was long and the room was not air conditioned. Also, the connection was very slow. Beach: I think people complained too much about the rocks. When I took other excursions, every other person at other hotels said their beaches were rocky as well. That was an outcome of hurricane Wilma 2 years ago. Still, I thought that in comparison to the sharp volcanic rocks I found at Hawaii beaches, these rocks were bearable and not all over the place. I loved the look of the beach with the light turquoise water and the temp was great. Excursions: It was confusing waiting for day excursions as there were no staff directing. However, the excursions were the hightlight of my trip. We went to Coba and to a Cancun nightclub tour. Coba was great because it is the only pryamid that you can climb (unlike Tulum or Chichen Itza). We also got to go swimming in a Cenote and visit a Mayan village. I would highly recommend this one. Also, the Cancun nightclub tour was great, especially the trip to Coco Bongo. Do not pass this up. I think those that just stayed at the resort and drank for an entire week really missed out. If you don't want to do a long excursion, at least take a cab into Playa Del Carmen. We did that for about $12 and we ate at a great Mexican restaurant in town called La Parilla. We also enjoyed drinks at a bar right on the beach. We thought that overall, the resort was ok. It looks nice but has a lot of things to be improved, mainly with service. I'd hope that when they hire more staff, their staff becomes more experience and they improve their food, it can be great. Although my favorite area of Mexico is Cabo, I'd come back to Riviera Maya again. Most likely, I wouldn't again stay at Grand Riviera Princess.", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cPlan on using a \"patience\" motto\u201d", "Author": "JillM621", "ReviewID": "UR13811454", "Content": "The resort is very beautiful, but HUGE.

There was a lot of entertainment, in the day the animation staff would have activities by the pool and every night there would be shows and music. There was a disco there on the resort but we found it to be a little slow for us, so most nights we headed into Playa del Carmen or Cancun for the nightlife. The food was very good and we ate at the a la carte's as much as we could. However they book up very quickly so make sure you make a reservation as soon as you can. We only had a couple issues - the bell boys are terribly slow, we had to carry our own luggage both on the way in and out and it is a very far distance. And our room was filled with mosquitoes because there was a small fountain right outside the door.

We would definitely go back. The staff at the resort was very friendly and the amenities were great. Upon arrival at noon on the 8th we were given a room immediately. Our wait time at the front desk was minimal 10 mins or so\u2026After check in we grabbed two Pina Colada\u2019s, then one of the porters drove us and our luggage to our room(in an electric cart), he carried our bags up showed us our room and our vacation began. We stayed in a JR Suite. We read all of the reviews and were hoping for the best. Some of the issues we were worried about included. The mosquitoes, the cleanliness of the rooms, the A/C, the service, the beach. Upon arrival at our room we were relieved that the room was clean and cool. We did have a few minor problems with the room initially. Firstly, it appeared that we were the first people to occupy the room. The mini fridge was stocked but not plugged in, not a big deal I just unwrapped the cord and plugged in the unit. Our TV worked but we did not have any reception or a remote. I played around with the TV which was a 32\u201d LCD as advertised and simply Hit Cable Auto Program and that problem was fixed. I then turned to call the receptionist to tell them that the safe was locked and that we did not have a remote for the television and there was no phone. We walked up to the front desk explained the problems and within an hour all the issues were rectified. As for Mosquitoes, we had three in our room upon arrival; I killed them and never saw another one inside the room all week. Collectively we only saw a few more outside at night through out our stay\u2026so for us mosquitoes were not an issue. Our room was on the princess side about 1/3rd of the way down the resort relative to the lobby. The fixtures in the room were high quality, the room was beautiful marble, the beds were comfortable and the water did not smell and was clear. The resort is huge as I stated we were on the Riviera side. The Sunset and Riviera sides are essentially mirror images of each other. The Sunset side had less vegetation in front of the rooms while the Riviera side had some small trees and vegetation. Our block of rooms opened into a beautiful court open court yard with a fountain in the middle and we could see the ocean from our balcony. The nice thing about the resort is that you can walk under cover, from the rooms to the Lobby, the little shops and the restaurants if it rains. Be careful though it does get a little slippery on the marble though. Every morning we left between 5 and 10 USD under the pillow and our room was cleaned thoroughly our mini bar was stocked too. Our room was turned before noon everyday. We had no problem with theft as reported by others. We did lock our luggage, and we did use the safe for some items. Be smart and take some money with you too. The rooms used the same std. 110 V outlets as we do at home. The AC worked great and was quiet. Just note in the type of HVAC system that they have you should leave it running because the rooms do take a little time to cool down, but it works fine. The beach was beautiful, not too crowded. The sand was soft and the beach was clean. The water was a little rocky as reported but we brought water shoes and everything was fine. We walked out about 100 yards and the water was up to our chests. One piece of advice\u2026people leave towels out on chairs to mark their spots for the day through out the resort\u2026so if you want a prime spot you should do that\u2026We walked about a mile each way and the GRP had the best beach out of any of the resorts we walked through by far. The bar at the beach was small and we did have to wait 10 mins for a drink sometimes\u2026but some people had thermal drink holders and the bartenders would gladly fill the containers for you. I would recommend bringing one of those drink holders to minimize your trips to the bar. The bartenders were great and always smiling. At night the atmosphere was great too. Every night at the main bar they would have a live band playing in the courtyard. They also put on a different live show every night in the theater. After we ate we would take a stroll throughout the resort which would take about 20 mins or so\u2026this gave us time to burn some calories and enjoy the grounds. They were working on things every day and you could see the progress\u2026adding tea lights on the bridges, bringing in plants ect. The place is beautiful and will be even nicer. The food\u2026the A la carte restaurants were great\u2026we ate at the French restaurant, the Italian restaurant two times. The service was friendly but a little slow so we chose the buffets for every other meal. The selection of the buffets were great, the food was great and always hot at least from our experience. We did find the princess buffet to be more consistent. We only attended the buffets near the lobby mind you. Excursions\u2026we looked at excursions and chose to rent a car at the resort instead of booking a trip. Everything we read was true\u2026the trips averaged between 90 and 150 USD each. We rented a car for 1 day for 60 USD and drove to Coba to see the ruins\u2026$ 5 USD each to get in\u2026we were glad we chose to rent the car and saved a lot of money. The roads were fine, we had no problem driving at all\u2026We used the car the second half of the day to go to Cancun. One day we went to Playa Del Carmen\u2026took a cab 15USD from the resort and 12 USD to get back. The trip to Playa Del Carmen was about 15 mins. It took us \u00bd hour to drive to Cancun\u2026 Coba was about 1 hour and 30 mins. XCarat and Xel Ha were about 35 mins away and Talum was about 1 hour for reference. The place was beautiful, I am sorry for those of you that did not have a great experience but we really had a great time. I have traveled all over the world and the people were wonderful.

We were very apprehensive about staying at this resort after hearing so many negative reviews. We stayed at the resort from January 31- Feb 8. This was the first time for our son was in Mexico. This is not a 5 star resort and if you remember this when you go then you won't be disappointed. Think the worst and its not even close to that! The atmosphere was beautiful but modern. The restaurants were modern and very sterile...the Italian restaurant was really good. We tried the Mexican restaurant and had the worst service that we left right after our meal (it seemed like we were forgotten). We didn't see any of the shows there as they were late (9:30) and by the time we had dinner we were ready to go back to our room and crash. We had busy days of snorkel trips, day trip to Coba to see the ruins, day trip to Cozumel, ziplining and an afternoon of shopping in Playa del Carmen. We were disappointed in the kids club. No one told us when we checked in what this was about so we didn't get to involve our son in anything until the last evening and by then he was not interested in dancing on the dance floor! We sure would have liked some information on what they provided especially in the evening. We weren't even told about the kids room which would have been great for our son for an hour or so in the evening but again, didn't know about it until the last evening! There are no snack bars anywhere. If you get the munchies hit a corner store and buy some junk food like we did to eat by the pool. The internet room was a joke! No one abided by the time rule. One guy had the audacity to ignore our requests to get off after 30 minutes and I had to resort to getting the manager....which did no good either! That was a joke and a big disappointment. What happened to equality? We were so sick of the buffet food after a few days. It would have been nice if they had theme nights but they didn't. Of course we ate too much but the food was pretty good. The drinks were great too. We got into drinking mojitos which are really good. Also, try the Miami Vice which was a nice change from your standard pina colada. It was disappointing reading all that the resort had to offer but in reality it wasn't ready, ie snack bars, ice cream parlour. The shower does leak! What a mess it makes in the bathroom so make sure you put towels down! We had the best person making our room every day. His name was Juan Carlos. Every day after we got back from the pool or our day trip, Juan Carlos would set up my son's toys in a different way each day. It was very entertaining. We left him a big tip at the end of our vacation. Did you know they only make $6.00 a day! For our trip to Cabo we booked a day trip with Hugo Vazquez who was our private driver and tour guide (not for Coba but for snorkelling). He was great. If you can get a group of you together it is really cheap to do. We paid $130 USD for the day to have him take us to Coba. We paid for the admissions for the ruins, a tour guide, and our snorkel admission and equipment. I think we still saved money doing it this way and plus we went at our own pace! It was great and he's such a nice guy too. His number is [--] cell and office is [--] . Like I said he was very informative, personable, funny, and we had a great time. If you are going with 3 or more people then you will definitely save some money! He can take you anywhere you want to go. The snorkelling we did with him was amazing. Much better than the ocean snorkelling we did near Isla Mujeres. All in all we didn't spend too many days at the resort. The pools were nice. If you want anything to drink, its quicker going to the bar to get your drink than waiting for someone to take your order and then delivering it. Staff are really polite and friendly. All in all, we had a great holiday. My son didn't want to come back! We won't go back there as we found it to be on the big side as far as resorts go.

We stayed in a second floor platinum room, with a partial ocean view. The room itself was beautiful and we really didn't have any issues with the room, sure the shower leaked out the door a bit, but a towel fixed that. My wife loved the jaccuzi tub on the balcony and used it every day. The room was cleaned daily and we did tip the maid pretty much every day.The toilet plugged one day, but a quick phone call had that fixed in 5 mins.

We ate mostly at the al a cartes and they were good with the exception of the La Visque (hope I spelled that right) we waited 1/2 an hour between our salad and main course, don't get me wrong , I don't mind waiting for good food, but when your main course arrives and it's ice cold after waiting a 1/2 hour that doesn't cut it.We just got up and went to the buffet, no big deal. The real issue we had was the thefts that were happening in the platinum area. We never had money taken from our safe, but my wife did have money taken from her backpack, although we had no proof, it was there before we went to the lounge for a drink , and was gone when we got back. Every time we went into the lounge someone was complaining about money, i-pods ect being taken. The people working in the platinum lounge seem to be very arrogant, and if the problem can be fixed easily, they are more than willing to help.If the problem is any bit complex and requires some footwork, they just brush you off. I witnessed many people yelling and screaming at the platinum managers because they were getting no results. The bartender in the lounge was great and always willing to help, but a couple of the managers were just plain arrogant and rude. Overall the hotel is beautiful and most of the workers are great.

Pros and Cons of GSP\u201d", "Author": "MissMassey", "ReviewID": "UR13558827", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Riviera Princess Resort from Feb. 5 \u2013 12, 2008. This was a family vacation with our parents, (65 & 71) and our kids (7 & 9). When we booked back in November, we booked adjoining rooms so the kids could go back and forth between our rooms. Princess was not able to accommodate this request for family travelers with 2 months notice! We ended up with 2 rooms between us. Ours was an adjoining room to the folks we did not know next door. (Not what we asked for, but the kind of hurdle we could cope with). Check in We arrived around 11:00 am, and check in was not until 3 PM, so we were given bracelets and told to return at 3:00. No welcome drink \uf04c, but we found our own. We explored the stunning resort, beach and restaurant areas. WOW! To say this place is huge is an understatement. There is lots of walking to go with lots of eating and drinking. It was really beautiful and we were full of anticipation. Our rooms were not ready at 3 \u2013 we were told to come back at 3:30. At 3:30 one of the two rooms was ready so we moved all of our stuff into our parent\u2019s room. Ours was ready shortly after. Lobby WOW! Beautiful marble as far as the eye could see. Stunning light fixtures everywhere and a large bouquet of flowers in the open air setting. Bar to your left, check in to your right (Opposite mirror image if you are staying on the Sunset side) Just Gorgeous! The Rooms The rooms are beautiful and spacious. We were in a Deluxe Jr. Suite. Room 6265. (3rd floor overlooking the pool) It was well appointed but with rough finishing touches. The shower was not caulked, leaked into the toilet room as well as into the washroom as most others have already reported. Tiles had writing on them (construction workers markings for tile placement or cutting marks?) The large plate glass on the main dresser was put down dirty, with crap underneath making it look soiled, but we were not able to clean it without taking the TV down and dresser apart. Grout was splashed in the bath tub that made it look & feel dirty even when it was not. You could tell that they were hurried with finishing touches everywhere in the resort. Our biggest problem with our room was the A/C or lack thereof. We had maintenance in our room 9 times in the first 4 days to fix it, including a 5:00 am visit because nobody could sleep in the heat and humidity. (It got up to 28 C in our room) They were clueless. One adjusted the direction of the vents \u2013 blowing warm air, one blamed us for having the patio door open and tripping the sensor, another cut the patio door sensor, another blamed us for removing the room card that powered your lights \u2013 telling us we had to leave it on \u2013 even when we left our room. The maids lifted it out whenever they cleaned, killing the A/C again. (Also sounds like an excuse) (Do most people leave their key in the room when they are gone out?) We were determined to not let this A/C issue ruin our family vacation, but after 3 sleepless nights and 9 visits from maintenance; we lost our cool \u2013 no pun intended. We were more than patient but you should not have to endure all this commotion to get basic A/C at a 5 star resort. The worst part was the lack of customer service. The FRONT DESK FOLKS SHOULD ALL BE RETRAINED OR FIRED \u2013 they were not the least bit helpful. After 3 days of this nonsense we were offered another room 2 buildings away overlooking the staff residence building. This was not a compromise that we were willing to make for the sake of the safety of our kids. We knew they would be back and forth between rooms. We asked for a cot or another love seat to be brought to our parent\u2019s room so that we could camp out 5 star style and at least get some sleep. It never arrived \u2013 I think they thought the A/C problem was fixed so they did not bother to bring it. We involved 3 different Air Transat reps in our A/C problem over the first 3 days. One came to our room with maintenance to see why the A/C kept turning off after an hour. She truly seemed to want to help resolve this. The Maintenance Supervisor finally taped open the main valve, and overrode some wiring so that the A/C would stay on. We had him set the thermostat to 20 or 21 C. Boy did that unit stay on. Our room went from 28C down to meat locker 12C. All our windows fogged up, our camcorder stored in the safe quit working due to condensation. We froze our butts off but finally after 4 days we were able to get some sleep at night. We again asked maintenance to fix the A/C as it was now too cold \u2013 they thought we were crazy. I don\u2019t think they ever showed up \u2013 if they did they did not fix anything. We all left with the sniffles, and I\u2019m sure the next guests in that room are in for more problems. Our parent\u2019s room was perfect all week. The Pools/Grounds Fabulous pools \u2013 the best we have seen anywhere! We travel each year and we have been to 12 different Caribbean islands. The set up was fantastic! The grounds were kept beautifully \u2013 once the plants mature and fill in it will be spectacular. When I walked to the lobby at 4:45 am for the A/C problem, I was shocked at the number of grounds workers working in the dark of night to groom the grounds, vacuum the pools, sweep, water and trim. We were in the mid section of the resort, and I saw over 100 grounds keepers. Gave me a whole new appreciation for how hard they work \u2013 in the dark to make it beautiful for when the guests wake up. The Beach The beach was great for walking \u2013 miles in either direction. The water was murky with high waves when we were there. We only used the beach for swimming one day \u2013 I\u2019m normally always at the beach but the pools were so great that now I\u2019m converted. Mosquitoes and sand fleas were there but a little bug spray goes a long way. Our bite tally was Grandpa 0, Grandma 1, Dad 1, Mom 4, oldest child 2, youngest 4. We strongly recommend you always wash the sand off yourself at the showers where the beach and the pool path meet. The ugly swamp at the beach bridge cannot be helping matters \u2013 we were surprised that they did not fill it with sand or soil/sod. It was an ugly stinky scene, in an otherwise pristine setting. The Shows We went to 3 or 4 of the shows. The fire dancers on Friday night in the open air lobby were good and our favorite was Saturday\u2019s Cirque show in the theatre upstairs beside the gym. Kids Club Simply the best part of our kid\u2019s trip \u2013 they do an outstanding job. Archery, beach soccer, pool volley ball, park play grounds, mini disco, play station room, games room. Really top notch. We were worried that our 9 year old had outgrown kids club, but they were flexible to the various ages of the kids and they did a terrific job keeping them happy. Restaurants We ate at 3 of the 4 buffets. All were great. A huge selection of items \u2013 if you couldn\u2019t find something you liked here \u2013 you might as well forget it. They had hundreds of items to select from. The guacamole and pico/salsa were terrific. I ate these at every buffet meal. The pasta bar was our favorite. Made to order right in front of you! The ice cream also deserves honorable mention. Lime Sorbet was great. The cakes and squares were not the greatest, but I find that with all the big resorts. They seem to be mushy soggy gelatin filled. Not my fav. but I think I tried them all just to be sure! We booked into the Italian, the Grill, and the Japanese restaurants with no problem. We avoided the long line ups when the concierge opened at 9:00 and booked around 1:00pm. The Japanese was our fav. We sat right at the grill and were thoroughly entertained. Food was above average at both Japanese and Italian. The Grill was just OK \u2013 we were hoping for a steak but they do not have it! I have never had rabbit or lamb before \u2013 so I guess you could say it was a new experience. The Bars/Drinks We were surprised to have pool side and beach service. We had no problems getting a drink \u2013 longest wait was 5 min. We were happy with the quality of the drinks and they even made us our favorite Kaipurina (sp?) yummy! Excursions We went flat bottom fishing for bone fish. We rented a car and did Xel Ha. (both the car and Xel Ha were an adventure), We did the Tulum Extreme (3 zip lines, repelling into a Cenote, and sight seeing at Tulum.) We also went into Playa several times for tourist shopping. All were good (recommended trips) The Staff Other than the front desk, everyone tried really, really hard to make your stay enjoyable. Everyone and I mean everyone, greeted you all day long with Hola! The people are beautiful, warm, hard working. We tipped well at all of our dining experiences, most of our bar trips (except in our swimsuits), and left cash, chocolates and personal supplies for the maids with a Spanish thank you message daily. Overall I would say this resort is going to be good in a year or so. They just are no where near ready yet. Too many issues, too many untrained staff. No customer focus. There were no signs about shows, directions of where to find anything, no maps given out. We found out about things from word of mouth of other guests. Many people we spoke to had similar problems to ours. More negatives than positives. The public washrooms were filthy, broken down, TP less adventures. Really no reason that Wendy\u2019s or MacDonald\u2019s can get this right but a 5 star resort cannot. This problem was at the scuba/towel building by the Ocean, and in the lobbies. Restaurant areas seemed fine. It was not an anomaly, it happened several times. We avoided public washrooms as much as possible. We tried so hard not to let the A/C problem ruin our vacation, but 3 sleepless nights, 9 visits from maintenance and being poorly serviced wore us down. We will never go back to any Princess resort, and feel that our vacation was significantly compromised by the A/C problems and lack of sleep that resulted from these problems. The resort is a crap chute at best \u2013 if you are lucky enough to get a good room \u2013 you can work around the other 'trivial' issues. If you get stuck with a problem \u2013 be prepared for days of frustration, anger and compromise, not a 5 star experience.", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario canada", "Title": "\u201cPay a little now Its worth it\u201d", "Author": "sierramar", "ReviewID": "UR13555248", "Content": "We just returned from the Princess on the 11th.Our group of 12 booked with Air Transat... !st--Flew on SKYSERVICE..lousy..more cramped than i have ever been..a breakfast thing..that no one ate..half the screens for movie did not work..no pillows or blankets any more....BUT you can purchase a comfort pack for $7..no screens or radio at all on return flight...AIR TRANSAT stop ruining your rep by putting your customers on your competions planes so you can keep yours flying the high profit flights....it will bite you back Cancun airport...QUICK.we bought Coronas just outside for $5....but we had beer on the bus for $3..about 45 minutes to hotel Check in..a little confusing we were there at 11Am rooms to be ready fo 230..they were..Beautiful.our own room had a nasty smell when you walked in but seemed to dissipate after a bit...(probably just got used to it)..1 robe out of 2 slippers stocked mini bar very clean big king bed THE BEST VIEW over main pool.we did ask about changing room on 2nd day but even though front desk OK and arranged it we ended up staying as we heard of other small problems and thought {better the devil you know} Resort BEAUTIFUL BIG REALLY BIG everything top notch.. lots of pools...pool bars...bars...did i mention lots of bars..

Check in: Ridiculous. We got there around 8:00 pm. and stood in line for about 45 minutes waiting to check in. They did bring us champagne while waiting in line, but it was such a long wait that it was too little too late. Room: Our room was disgusting. It smelled like mold to the point that I couldn't sleep at night, and there was mold growing on the ceiling in the shower, as well as all through the bathroom and into the hallway. I called to complain about our room only to be told that they couldn't move us until the middle of the week, and then practically got hung up on. It was unbelievable. By the middle of our week, the smell did get better, and we just lived with it because we were hardly ever in our room anyway. Be careful when you get out of the shower because the water from the shower gets the whole entire bathroom floor wet, and the floors are marble, so it gets SLIPPERY. I had to lay towels out all over the floor to soak up the water to make sure we wouldn't fall. Food: The buffet was really good. Breakfast was my favorite. It's pretty much the same everynight, with a few minor changes, but it was really good. With our vacation we got to choose to eat at 3 of the restaurants. We found that if you go to the conierge around 1:30 the line isn't that long, but make sure you're there before 2 because I went to change a reservation at 1:55, and the girl almost turned me away because she was closing. I was the last one in line, and had been standing there for 15 minutes. If I wouldn't have had a tantrum, she would have sent me packin'! The first one we went to was La Fondue, it took us 3 hours to eat there. We didn't really care because we were drinking wine and having fun, but the service is SO SLOW. We also went to Mama Mia, as well as Miso, and both of those restaurants took 2 1/2 hours. We never got refills on our drinks at those restaurants, my husband actually went to the bar during our dinners to get us drinks. The food is great though, and if they can just get the service a little quicker, so you're not waiting 45 minutes between each course, then it will be great. Beach: The beach is ok. Really rocky though. Pools: Pools are pretty. Can't swim at night, and the only hot tub is in the spa, which you have to pay to use, so that was kind of a bummer for us because there were a few nights we would have loved to sit in a hot tub. Also, the bathrooms by the pool were disgusting. There was no running water, and every toilet was overflowing. Yuck. Also, I went to the restroom upstairs by where they do the shows, and when I went to wash my hands, I pulled off 3 levers on the faucet before I pulled one and had it work! It's not like I was pulling hard or anything, they just fell off! There's a lot of repairs that need to be made. Internet: They only have 4 computers. If you go right in the middle of the day, you can usually get on one, but if you try any other time, you'll be waiting for awhile. 4 computers for that many people just isn't enough. Mosquitos: We got lots of mosquito bites, and our ankles were SO swollen from all the bites one night that we could barely get our water shoes on. We did have some in our room everynight, but you could sit outside and not feel like they were swarming you. And we never used bug spray or anything either, so it was partially our fault. Distance: Our room was 6108, and it was easily a half a mile from the lobby. We walked SO much. I had read reviews on this website saying that they were really good about driving you to and from your room if you wanted them to, but they aren't. We got back from the bar crawl one night at 4 in the morning, and my husband was a bit over-served, so I asked if we could have a ride, and they said no. They also wouldn't come get us the morning we were leaving, so we had to drag our luggage all the way to the lobby at 3:30 in the morning by ourselves. I thought that was crap. Room Service & Cleaning: Our room was cleaned every day, even if we didn't put the hanger on the door. Our mini bar was stocked with water and pop everyday, but the mini bottles of alcohol were never restocked. Room service was pretty quick, and really good. Excursions: We went to Maroma Beach and did the horseback riding, and the wave running/snorkeling, and those were both awesome. We went to chichten-itza one day, and I'm glad we did it, but I wouldn't go again because it took SO long to get there, and it was a whole day's event. We stopped at the cenote Ik-kil on the way there though, and that was the prettiest thing I've ever seen. Go to Xel-Ha, it's awesome. We went ziplining, and that was AWESOME. The bar crawl was fun. We went on the Pirate ship cruise in cancun, and loved it. So definitely do some excursions, they make the trip so fun. Email me if you have any questions.

We've been to the area twice before, and have travelled to many islands in the Caribbean. I'm telling you this only so that you can appreciate that we have quite a few other places to compare the Grand Princess to, and this resort far exceeded our expectations. We booked through Tripcentral.ca, and paid $1335/pp CAD. Which we thought was great value for a 5* hotel. The tour operator was Air Transat and we were also extremely impressed with them. As soon as we boarded the plane a flight attendant immediately provided our 3 year old daughter we headphones, a toy and candy bar to occupy her during the flight. The meals on board were good (for airplane food; atleast they still provide a meal) and the flight attendants were extremely attentive and friendly. We didn't get our room until about 3:30pm at the resort (no big deal the bell boy took our luggage on arrival) and we went for some lunch and walked around the resort to famliarize ourselves with the place. When we got our room we were impressed with how beautiful it was. Lots of room (if your taking kids), jacuzzi tub, double bathroom sinks, large balcony. What more can I say...the room is just as nice as any 5* hotel in the US or Canada. The Food- this is one area that I often struggle with at All Inclusives. I usually find that although I don't starve; by the end of one week I've had my fill of garlic buttered pasta and french fries. I'm not a seafood lover, and usually find that limits my choice at dinner. But, the Grand Princess' food was phenomenal! I found myself thinking of breakfast the next morning each night before I fell asleep and anticipating dinner during the afternoon. This hasn't ever been the case for me at an All Inclusive before. For any of you that have cruised before you can probably agree that the food onboard is great. We found that the quality of the food and the variety at the Grand Princess was as good or maybe better than we've experienced on Royal Caribbean or Celebrity cruises. If your a discerning eater..this is the place for you! They have made to order pasta stations which guarantees you'll get a dish you like, and the al a cartes had great ambience and service. As mentioned before the service in the al a cartes is on the slow side, but the wait staff isn't unattentive...the dinner is just served at a relaxed pace. We enjoyed not being rushed through dinner. There are lots of pools and swim up pool bars. Drinks are plentiful and pretty yummy. The one thing I was dissapointed with happened on the second day of our stay. I went to the beach bar to get a drink for myself and my daughter and the bartender wouldn't serve us. I was the only woman at the bar and the bartender just refused to make eye contact with me or ask for my order. All of the men were getting service. I'm not one to bark out orders (it's the Canadian in me) so I usually wait to be addressed when waiting. I waited about 10 minutes, and everyone there before and after me had been served. I left and asked my husband to get the drinks instead. He returned in about 2 minutes with our order. At first I was insulted...then I realized that not getting service at the bar could be my ticket to my hubby having to get my drinks all week! It wasn't a big deal in the grand scheme of the week, and it was the only time I didn't get treated excellent. For the most part the service staff went above and beyond what should be expected. I found at the staff at the hotel to be extremely friendly and couteous. One tip; any Spanish you can learn before heading down will ensure that you get the best service. Although most employees do speak engligh, there were times knowing how to ask for the nearest bathroom in Spanish came in handy with a 3 year old. The resort itself is beautiful, the landscaping, pools, walkways, lobby...everything is just gorgeuos. We had a wonderful week, and would go back foresure. We did hear people complaining about mosquitos and did see kids with lots of bites. We had a room on the second floor (6258) and never had a problem with them; our daughter didn't even get one bite. We also heard people complaining about the walking distance and the resort is huge, but the walk is a beautiful one (take a stroller if you've got little ones); it's not unmanageable. Most of the complaints we heard during the week from people on our bus seemed unjustified. It all comes down to attitude. We treated the staff with respect and we were treated the same way back. Any tips we gave were always appreciated but the staff certainly don't linger around waiting for them. And, we got good service whether we tipped or not. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel...it is hands down the most enjoyable vacation we've ever taken at an All Inclusive.", "Date": "February 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cA Few Flaws to Iron Out But Overall a Great Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "MimiCalgary", "ReviewID": "UR13455016", "Content": "We just returned from our one week trip at the Maya Princess. We stayed from Feb. 3 to Feb. 10. My sister and brother joined us on this trip. There were six of us as we have two girls (6 and 2). We've read the reviews on this hotel prior to going and kept an open mind and objective perspective. And we were told by our travel agent that the service was sub-par as it is a new hotel but the food was fantastic. We got to the hotel at about 5:15pm, my husband and sister got our rooms right away but we wanted to be close together so we had asked for other rooms. The front desk clerk was helpful and found us rooms right away that were close to each other. We walked to our rooms only to find that my room was not cleaned and the beds were not made. My sister's room had already been given to a family that came in from the same flight. Okay so not the best start to our holidays. Maybe we were jetlagged, kids hungry and cranky, long walk back to lobby but by now my patience was wearing thin. We got our new rooms with no problem and the front desk clerk assured me that our room would have two double beds. My husband, kids and I finally got to our rooms, there is only a king size bed. By this time, I was too tired to deal with the front desk. I would deal with the bed issue in the morning with a clear mind. So we headed for supper. Early Monday morning, dealt with a different front desk clerk. Told him that we requested two double beds in our room. He argued with me that there was nothing written down on their log book saying so. Also mentioned that air conditioning does not work in our room. I asked to either get moved to another room or provide us with an extra bed in our existing room. Also requested more bottled water. Anyway by the time we got back to our room later in the morning, there was an extra bed, the maintenance guy was in our room fixing the air conditioning and we got more bottled water. The air conditioning worked on and off. We had another maintenance guy come in on our third day to \"fix\" it again. Well by the fourth time the air conditioning didn't work, we just decided to figure it ourselves. My husband eventually realized that the air conditioning only goes on when the door to the balcony was open and that it shuts off when the door closes. Don't know why it was wired that way. Should be vice versa. Air conditioning solved. Food: The food was fantastic! We also dined at three of the seven a la cartes. The Grill, The Seafood and the Asian Restaurants. All were awesome! The service at the buffet restaurant was way better at the Sunset side, very friendly. Make sure to tip!!! And yes there are restaurant staff that don't know how to speak english but that didn't bother us. We're more than happy to learn their language. We spent more time by the pools then at the the beach. We spent time both on the noisy side of the pools and the quiet side. We had a great time on both. Our kids loved the disco for kids. Starts at 8 every night. The Animation crew did a great job! We also saw three shows, the Mexican, The International Variety Show and the Cirque de la luna. All great! Overall, the place is beautiful, the food is great. The staff is great! This hotel will only get better. The only other snaffu I would say is the inconsiderate guests that the staff have to deal with day to day. We are not the only ones there as we like to think. I personally think that the Mexicans are very hard working people and they make minimal money for what they do.

While this is already a beautiful property it is very new and will no doubt be even more spectacular when all the vegetation grows in. It is huge and spread out which is a problem for those who are a little less mobile. The walk from the main lobby to the beach is definitely a 15 minute hike at a brisk pace. The shuttle service is on request and can be hit and miss depending on how busy the bell men are. Overall we enjoyed ourselves but here are some of the good, the bad and the ugly. Check in: They need a better and more informative welcome package about the resort that should be provided when you check in especially given the size and layout of the property. The small photocopy map with little or no explanation does not really cut it. We arrived at about 3:00 in the afternoon and our rooms were ready and all in the same part of the hotel as we had requested. Rooms: We stayed in a Deluxe Junior Suite. The room is spacious with a good sized balcony. The bathroom is huge with a jacuzzi tub, walk in shower and individual sinks. There was a problem with drainage in the shower. Not sure how they can correct this. Lots of closet space and the digital combination safe where you set the combination yourself. No key to lose. In room mini-fridge was restocked daily with water, pop and beer. They do seem to be short on housekeeping staff but we just got clean towels daily and did not ask for our room to be cleaned.

The French, Italian and Seafood a-la-cartes were all very good with quality meals, good service and unlimited vino. We went to the Mexican a-la-carte on our last night and were very disappointed. The service was indifferent and the food was terrible. Skip this one. The Mexican food on the buffet is better. Bars: While they could use more experienced bar staff they are eager to please. The bartenders in the lobby bar were exceptional. Premium brands are available on request. The Mudslides were awesome. Pools and Beach: Great variety of pool areas to choose from. Always spots available. We found it much breezier at the beach so spent most of our time pool side. The rocks in the water were a definite deterrent to swimming in the ocean. General: Did not find the mosquito problem to be as bad as others had indicated. Obviously the spraying they are doing is working. Remember you are in the tropics. They are still going through growing pains but I can see by the more recent reviews that things have already improved considerably. I found this resort to be very good value for the price we paid. I would come back again but I fear that next time the price will be out of my range.", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brampton (Toronto), Ontario, CANADA", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely beautiful place\u201d", "Author": "VallartaCat", "ReviewID": "UR13429053", "Content": "Buenos dias My husband Bob and I were at the Grand Riviera Princess for 1 week and back home Tues., Feb. 5. We had an awesome visit. We upgraded to a swim-out suite (I highly recommend and the sun shines in that area all day...unlike the Sunset. They get the sun at the back of the units. We never did see anyone in the water in front of the Sunset swim-out units). Our suite had a jacuzzi in bathroom, 2 double beds (there is a choice), large plasma TV, living room area leads to private porch with 'wicker' table and matching chairs and 2 chaisse loungers. The suite had a safe and the mini fridge is stocked daily by the maid (however she needed to be reminded...a few pesoes helped). The currency is 20 pesoes to 1 Cdn./Amer. dollar. Across from our swim-out are many chaisses and few covered cabanas with thick mattresses for an afternoon nap. Put your towel on one of these to \"reserve\" as they go fast and people will leave their towels on them while they go to the party pool for a few hours. All facilities are shared with the Sunset. The entire complex is actually 1 huge complex with an imaginary line through the centre from East to West with the Princess to the North and the Sunset to the South. Mosquitoes were not a problem however we did take body spray and used when sleeping. There were mosquitoes in the room after the maid had cleaned but we got a (large) can of House & Garden spray from the Concierge in the Lobby. There are 4 Buffets each located in each corner of the entire complex. The food is the same (a huge variety of meats, salads, desserts etc.) in all 4 and you should eat at the 1 that is nearest to your room. Our favourite waiter was Toni and we tipped him well. Our main buffet was La Fondue. There are restaurants that require reservations (Italian, grill, Japanese, fish) made through the Concierge. To eat at one of these restaurants truely is a fine-dining experience. The plate presentation is beautiful. There are many pools with the main one in the center of the entire complex. This is the 'noisy' or 'party' pool. Lots of fun here!!!...learn a dance, contests, aerobics etc....even a few topless gals. The beach is at the Eastern end of the property. To get there you cross a footbridge over a swampy area (apparently the entire coplex was built on a swamp but for some reason they left this small area untouched...maybe they will fill it in someday). The beach is nice for sunbathing with lots of lounges and palapas...also a beach bar...however if you want to swim in the sea you might want to wear water shoes...rocky! The construction appears to be finished at the hotel except for a few minor things light paint touchup and adding more overhead lights. There is an employee residence being built behind the Princess but all heavy machines are gone and the inside is being worked on. We took a taxi to Playa del Carmen ($12 Cdn.) each way. There is a bus that leaves the Princess at 10:30 a.m. but we wanted to leave earlier than that. Playa del Carmen is beautiful. Fifth Avenue is the stretch that has the shopping areas. Very clean and quaint. We walked to the beach (1 block) and watched the parasailing. The sand is like beige icing sugar. There are no vendors on the beach. In town there are many time-share operators. We are aware of them from previous vacations to Mexico so didn't engage in conversation with them at all. All in all we found the Princess experience very enjoyable and the staff very helpful. The place is very large so good shoes are a must. The walks are wide and bicycles are available. At night the Palm trees lining the walks are aglow with rope lights wound around the trunks. Very romantic. In the lagoon (beside the lobby) are cabanas in the water with cuddle wicker chairs. A good quiet place to be intimate.

This is a beautiful piece of property but is still not fully completed. We arrived around noon and we were not allowed in our rooms until 3:00 pm. If this happens to you, the hotel does have some courtesy rooms near the lobby to change into some beach wear and we were allowed to eat lunch etc. We had no problems with the daily maid service and our room was cleaned ever day. The air conditioning was not the best however, the room was comfortable later in the evening. Something happened to the power in our room one day and we had no lights, air or fan. They did make some repairs but it took two hours to fix. The air came back on and they had to bring in some lamps so we wouldn't be left in the dark. The problem was repired the next day. Make sure you go around the room before you go to bed and kill all of the mosquitoes or you will get eaten alive. It was evident that people have been smashing bugs all over the walls and ceiling. We had a bathroom with a leaky shower whereas, water ran out into the rest of the bathroom, so we had to put a towel down on the floor to stop the water. You're lucky if you get a room where the water does not run out all over the floor. Be prepared to walk every where. It is a long way from the front of the hotel to the beach. It's a little better if you hang out at the pools. The landscaping is new and looks great. Our room key cards had to be reprogramed 3 times in a week and this causes a lot of extra walking. I guess just three times isn't bad. I spoke to one couple who had to walk to the main desk and have their room key cards reprogramed 8 times in one week. The food was OK. The beach sand needs some grooming and cleaning. It's common to step on old drink straws on the beach. The ocean was always rough and the roped off swimming area is very rocky, so bring some beach socks. The water is dark with seaweeed and sand and, it's not a good place to snorkle. Our experience was OK but we would not go back. The staff is trying hard but this is NOT a 5 star hotel yet.

We believe the price will go up and it gains popularity. overall - a great place to relax, not too far from Playa and other day excusions. i agree that it would be worth it to upgrade to Platinum for privacy or if you have kids and need to spend time in your room at night. the mositoes were a nuisance but not too bad. this is a great resort with a few minor problems.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cEverything is 95% - 100% ready\u201d", "Author": "BTek", "ReviewID": "UR13286145", "Content": "This hotel is truly a 5 star. There is more marble and granite complimenting the amazing architecture to build another Taj Mahal. It's a large complex but if you plan your day there doesn't have to be much walking around involved. ROOMS: We stayed at the Regency Club suites with pool access and they were simply fantastic. The pools are the best I've ever seen and the rooms were large and well furnished. The Jacuzzi was nice but the pool just outside our window was always more inviting. The layout of the hotel allowed for a lot of privacy if you wanted it or a ton of people partying if that was your preference. Between our 3 rooms we had no real issues with minor details still to be ironed out. The mosquitos are a problem in much of the riviera this year following their wet season. Still, a bottle of spray at night will suffice. FOOD was amazing, you are guaranteed not to even try a little bit of everything they have to offer in a week, might want to go for 2 weeks. The buffets are the best with plenty of choice and quality. At this time they also offer all kinds of premium liquor, Cognac, Premium brands etc. Not sure if that's permanent. This complex is actually the Sunset and Riviera Princess together side by side and they share a lot of the facilities. You have access to everything for even more choice. BEACH: is very large and spacious with more than enough shade huts and comfortable tanning beds. The sand is very nice but the entrance into the water still has some small rocks, this will improve with time but in exchange you get a rich collection of large shells right at your toes. ENTERTAINMENT: is excellent, both of the shows we saw and the evening (plaza) entertainment were top notch. The Disco at the hotel is also quite good, we went there a couple of times and it was also quality, even in comparison to the bar trip to Cancun we took one night. STAFF generally good and hard working, the Animation team, bellboys etc are great. The front desk is occasionally swamped with 3 buses of guests arriving at a time, but I'm not sure which hotel would handle that any different. Please keep in mind that Check-In time is 3 PM and Check-Out time is at noon. For new travellers that means that if you arrive at 9 AM your room will probably not be ready until 3 PM. You will be able to store your suitcases and change into your swimming gear though and you will get your bracelets so that you can use all the restaurants and facilities. There is also a store on site, but short of medication and tanning lotions everything there was considerably more expensive than in Playa del Carmen. A cab ride to Playa is a standard rate of $12.50 dollars or 125 pesos, but please ensure you agree on this rate before driving off. Cab drivers will vary in how fun and friendly they are. WHINERS: We did hear of a couple of unhappy visitors where the room may have been less than 100% or some of the staff made a mistake. This is normal at any hotel, but this is also Mexico where the minimum wage is 5 USD per DAY and these people are often new to the job. There will be inconsistencies in service but having another mohito or two will usually solve the problem. On top of that, some customers are simply out of their small village for the first time in their life and don't know how to treat hotel staff with respect. KIDS: this is a great hotel for families with kids of all ages, there is so much available to them that you may not see them much during your vacation. Still, thanks to the size and layout of the grounds there is a quite space for anyone seeking it. This is a top notch hotel and you will have a great time if you have the right vacation attitude.

I went with 4 other couples. We arrived at the hotel at 11:00 p.m. and we were basically the only ones checking in. I had heard about the mosquitos on the 1st floors so tried to get a 2nd floor room. No go. I tried everything. One of our couples was very aggressive and said that they wanted a 2nd floor room and nothing else so they got it. The rest of us got screwed with 1st floor rooms far apart from one another (forget trying to get near one another). As I entered my room I started killing mosquitos (probably about 10 the 1st night). The same with my friends but 1 couple didn't even have a shower door and the other couple opened their door once with their key card but could not get back in. The TV didn't work either in most of our rooms. Some of us got Tequilla and others didn't. Some got fruit but not all!!! So you can be lucky but if you are the unlucky one it really sucks!!!! Walking and blisters are a big part of this resort!!! Everything is so far apart. We were closer to the beach. If we needed to go to the front desk, it took a good 10 -15 minute walk. No carts passing through. Not enough employees!!! We tried several days to get into one of the buffets near the beach but one was always \"full\" (which it wasn't) so we had to go to the other one!!! They looked so empty but they didn't have enough waiters to serve you. The swimming area sucks too!!! There are so many little rocks you need swimming shoes. We walked several times about 10 minutes to find a beautiful swimming area in front of a new resort beeing built. The \"a la carte\" restaurants were not good. The only good one was the Italian Restaurant. We went to the Grill, International and also the Seafood. The International was not bad either, but make sure to snack first because it is really \"fine\" cuisine. The entertainment was not good. They try and do a danse show every night but it is very amature. There is a small show outside before the formal show which is a little better. There is a lot of construction going on. It is a beautiful hotel but I don't suggest this hotel yet. It might be amazing in another year. I have learned that going to brand new resorts are really not a good thing. You get for what you pay for. I probably will never be able to afford to go back once it is up and running to its full capacity. Good luck to all those who have already booked.

After reading the terrible reviews we were a little worried and adjusted our expectations.

That being said, we couldn't have asked for more out of our vacation. The people were friendly, the food was excellent, the cervasa was cold!! The resort was absolutely beautiful. If you don't like to walk, stay somewhere else. It is very large but very well laid out. We actually prefer the walking just to get rid of the calories from all the food and booze. There are 3 buffet restaurants and 7 a la cartes. Our favorite was the Italian and Japanese. The room was beautiful and our bar fridge was full every day. There are so many pool areas it is difficult to choose one. There were 3 swim up bars in 3 different areas. One was loud and the other two were quiet. If you were at a quiet pool, no one bothered you to play volleyball or water polo etc. If you were at the loud pool, you had lots to do. We didn't bring our kids but there were many there and they had SEVERAL shallow pools for them as well as an excellent Kids Club. Some parents said they didn't see their kids for most of the day because they were having so much fun on their own. I do have some mosquito bites but that was my fault for not spraying myself with \"OFF\" every night. They weren't bothering me at the time but I probably have about 30 bites right now. No big deal.

Nothing to report there! Transportation to the resort was also a breaze. Everything went very well. We got to the resort at around 11:00AM. It is clearly indicated that check-in is at 3:00PM. You leave your luggage with them (no issues there) and you have full access to the resort in the meanwhile. We did get our room a bit before 3:00PM. They do enforce that rule. Say hi to Augustin at the entrance, he went out of his way for us all week with luggage transportation and the transportation on the resort! Great kid! Rooms Deluxe Jr Suite with Pool access My first room #6077 had a really bad swamp smell but everything did function properly. We went back to the lobby to get another room. No issues, they gave us room #6052! Great room! That one was awsome had no smell and everything was functional! We did bring our fruit basket and bottle of tequila to our new room! Surprise when we entered our new room, there was a bottle of champagne there! Bonus! Cleaning Staff; This requires some work. BIG TIME. They need a checklist as they forget a lot of things. 1.They rarely restock the fridge. They did once, the rest of the time, I had to ask or do it myself. 2.Toileteries were a hit and miss also. We almost ran out ouf toilet paper, they didn\u2019t restock other stuff like shoe polish, kleenex bug wipes etc. We also had to ask for towels but they are usually good for that as they know we need one for the shower door as water will go underneath it. 3.As far as cleaning goes, it\u2019s just OK. They really need to go through every room and clean everything. They just sweep the floors, make the beds and wash very quickly the washroom. 4.The only person that has access to the room is the cleaning staff supervisor, they steal the tips off the pillows, and the maid gets nothing. Leave the tip under the pillow. This was reported by many people around. If it happens to you, report it to your Rep and at the check-in counter. 5.Some reported the room safes had been tampered with and money had been stolen (early January). 100% TRUE, but they found the person and fired him. No issues when I was there. It is safe now! 6.They have until 6:00PM to make the rooms, be patient and again, leave the tip under the pillow. Restaurants A la Carte Restaurants, only tried the Italian and it was awsome! Have the veal medalion! The pizza, that wasn\u2019t so great and the vegetarian canneloni, that was not so great either. But that\u2019s just me! Buffets are awsome! Great selection and quality is even better than here in Canada! The deserts need a bit of work but overall, it\u2019s fine. The soups, the best I have had! You will definitely eat well there! Service was intermittent. Good some days horrible other days. We tried to keep our same servers all week. We tipped a lot, no difference. We also speak Spanish. One girl at the breakfast grill was really horrible and rolled her eyes at everyone ordering an omelette. We tried to engage in a conversation with her in Spanish to try to get her to smile and it was like talking to a rock. This was the buffet near the beach Riviera side, (I think it\u2019s the Swiss restaurant at night). The wives also got refused entry at this restaurant for lunch while other people walked in, they were really rude to who they felt like wasn\u2019t worthy of going in. Bars Bars, well, no shortage of that and the premium liquor is always available! Mmmm Courvoisier! Beer, drinks everything was awsome! Beach and Pools The Beach is gorgeous; the ocean was nice for the first few days. Lost of BIG rocks and boulders so watch out! Some yellow sulfur was coming out of the ocean ground and changed the quality of the water considerably. So, the last 3 days of my vacation was spent in the pool! The beach is nice, the ocean wasn\u2019t. Watch out for broken glass! Pools are simply huge and gorgeous! Very clean and lots of space! The water temp is getting warmer everyday! Grounds Aboslutely breathtaking! This resort is really nice and in a few years when the vegetation starts to grow, it will be out of this world! Prepare to walk as their transportation is not ready yet. You have to burn those buffet calories anyway right? If you need a ride, go to the main lobby and ask at the entrance, they will give you a ride! The setup for transportation along the resort is not ready yet, should be done in a few weeks or maybe sooner! Activities Activities, get informed as they do have them here and there. We didn\u2019t do any of them. Entertainement is good! We went to a few shows and they were fun! I'm sure they will improve as time goes. Tours I did the Coba tour and it was great! A lot of walking and ate in a Mexican restaurant near a croc infested lake! :o) You also have the choice of paying for a taxi at the ruin site. Basically it\u2019s a poor guy on a tricycle giving you a ride from the start to finish or you may walk to get there and hitch a ride back for 65 pesos. This is paid to the company that owns those bikes and I\u2019m not sure if he even pays those poor guys. When I payed, the guy recommended I tip the driver. So I did. I thought he was going to die poor guy. A 3km run with me and the wife, I gave him a good tip! He was really happy! Some people didn\u2019t even tip, not cool. Conclusion The Hotel itself is absolutely breathtaking! I have never seen as many marble floor/walls in my life! Please tip as most of them there make $5 a day. (That marble is like ice when wet, so watch your step!) I was very disapointed with the ocean. The beach is gorgeous, watchout for broken glass, there is a lot! Rocks and boulders in the water, some are huge, not safe at all. Mosquitos and Black flies (no see-ums) were there for sure. The rooms do get some as they leave the door opened when they make the room. I have a few bite marks and the women got some on their legs and feet. Bring repellant and after bite! Overall I am very satisfied, had a great vacation but they do need to iron out some things.

We decided to visit the resort and our impression was that it is very grand and will be awesome in time. People were having fun in the pools and the dining rooms looked 5 star.

We got amazing vacation. Food---\u00a8never eat that much in all inclusive resort. Amazing choice at the buffet and WONDEFULL service too. A la carte was also unbelievable we tried Japanese, Grill and Italian restaurant. Service also great meanly with baby they even asked us at witch course we wanted the food for our daughter! Wine was too hot but we asked to put it on ice and they did it. Waiters are waiting for tips but what is 10pesos/meal when you are able to put that much on a vacation! Resort--It is huge and wonderful. My husband has arthritis and walking around was ok. Service--Maid was not really good. The room was made around 4pm. We did not try the room service (we never used it in any hotel) Check in--very smooth greeting with Kir Royal. Room was not reading (1pm) but like almost every hotel in the world check-in is at 3pm even if you arrived early morning. Beach--sand is amazing but need shoes to get in the sea. A little disappointed (1st time on our 3rd visit on the Mayan Riviera.) Mosquitoes --few but it is a resort surrounding by Laguna and maids are leaving the door open to do the room (like every where else cart don\u2019t fit in the door!). In some room expect to go hunting prior sleeping. (In case of our room not my parent's one). Room ---our was great. We had pool access witch we found that is one of the best investment we ever made in vacation including a veranda on a cruise ship. It was our first vacation without oceanfront room and in that case we didn't miss it.

The grounds are absolutley beautiful. When we arrived, it was cloudy and rained on our first day. If it rains make sure you wear shoes that have grip as you will fall like I did. I am however, clumbsy by nature and I did not see anyone else fall down. Check in is at 3:00pm, but the bell boy will put your bags in a locked room for storage and you are able to shower and change. While we waited for our room we were able to use all amenities of the resort so it was not a big deal. I am only dissapointed in my travel agency for telling me I would not have to wait for my room when I asked them specifically about this check in time. Food was awsome! There is 4 buffet restaurants (2 in the main building and two closer to the beach). The buffets closer to the beach turn into a la carte at night however. Food was always replaced when it looked like it was getting old and the variety was nice. The buffets in the main building had more selection than those close to the beach. A la cartes were good. The French restaurant was my favorite. Make sure you do not eat before you go to these resaturants as they are 4-5 course meals. The room was very beautiful and everything functioned properly. We were told to place a towel at the door of the shower as water will creep into the bathroom. This is not a big deal and we found that the cleaning staff would leave an extra towel just for this reason. We stayed in the deluxe junior suite and I highly recommend this room. It is located half way through the resort so you are never really that far away from beach or the main building. From the main building to the beach it takes around 5-8 minutes to walk, unless you were walking REALLY slow. There is a shuttle that will take you if you do not want to walk. Misquitos...When we first arrived in our room there was quite a few misquitos by the window. We went on a mission and killed as many as we could. A lot of people are blaming the cleaning staff for letting them in when they leave the door open, but I believe this is not the case. After we had eliminated most if not all of the bugs, we opened the sliding doors and put the screen in place so that no bugs could get in. Not more than ten minutes later there was a ton more misquitos in the room. After investigating, I noticed that where the screen connects at the bottom and on the side does not connect properly, leaving a 1-2 centimeter gap where misquitos could get in. We never opened that glass door for the rest of the trip and never had any more problems. If you want to see what alot of misquitos really means, go my lake, that is alot. There was just a few at the resort. Service...I found every person VERY friendly and eager to help you. There is a bit of a language gap sometimes but it was always figured out. We tried to learn a little bit of spanish and it helps tremendously. I felt bad that I could not tip every person that helped me. They provided better service than most places here (home) and in the US that I have been. I ordered room service a few times and had no trouble. They were always available and were very quick to bring the food. I noticed a few people complaining about service, but it always seemed to be the people who were not very nice to the staff and did not even attempt to understand them. You have to give respect in order to get respect. Our room was cleaned everyday not problem. The minibar restockage was random, but if we wanted something to be put in we just left a not in spanish and it would be there when we came back. Overall they were a spectacular staff and were very fun to talk to and get to know. Your vacation is what you make it. Please take every review with a grain of salt as every experience will be different. If you go and scrutinize every small detail, you will not have a good time. It is a beautiful place with a wonderful staff and I am sad that I had to leave....", "Date": "January 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gatineau, Quebec, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Large Resort, some great features, a few things yet to work out\u201d", "Author": "Qcwoody", "ReviewID": "UR13050539", "Content": "We just came back from a one-week vacation (January 19-26, 2008) at the Grand Riviera Maya Princess and in short, we loved it. That is not to say there aren\u2019t a few things that still need to be worked out, some overall training and minor finishing work is still required. Overall it was a very positive experience that I will attempt to resume in a few bullets below starting with what needs work, then outlining all the positives, finishing with a few bits of advice. What needs work 1. No proper briefing at check-in 2. We were issued wrong ID bracelets and were deprived of some prepaid privileges because of it. Just for the record the Laguna suites are premium level of service with black bracelets and these people have paid to have premium service and full access to all reserved areas including platinum lounge and pools and private beach area which is not clearly marked. Service at this beach area includes servers bringing drinks but they tended not to want to bother going into the area probably because of the ropes which are at the perfect height for guests to have to do some calypso moves to get to the beach. This area should extend right down to the water and have more access points. 3. We were not issued the upgrades that we had paid for until we figured out we had the wrong bracelet and then it was a bit late to do anything. 4. There are some concerns with security. Our friends had money stolen from their safe by a staffer that watched them punch in their personal code. It is sort of difficult to believe but to the experienced thief he could easily see the number punched in peering from a distance. The police were not even called in and we believe the hotel wanted to downplay the whole thing. The bottom line is about $500 missing dollars and one fired cleaner. He\u2019ll probably return next week or start his business at another resort. (Remember that YOU have to enter your own code. The code you are shown 1234 is not to be used!) 5. The three lobbies (Grand Riviera/Grand Sunset/Platinum) were confusing to the transporters, tour buses, the guests, and more importantly to the staff and we were taken to all three before finally being able to check-in in the second one we visited. 6. Room was not cleaned daily, nor the mini-fridge restocked. 7. When the room was cleaned it was in a perfunctory way and hygiene rules were not followed. The glasses and coffee cups in the room were rinsed off in the sink using the same gloves maybe even the same rag used for cleaning the toilet! Scary yucky. These should be taken away to be machine washed and clean ones brought in! 8. No light in the shower area (wires are there but not the light fixture) Don\u2019t touch wires kids. 9. Electricity cut off for a short while 10. Hot water was turned off for the best part of one day and the water was brown that day 11. The beach is beautiful but the sea bottom is too shallow to swim and very rocky (bring footwear, surf socks worked for us). Better yet enjoy the beach try the wading a bit then head to one of the dozens of pools. 12. Overall staff is fantastic but training is required for all with the possible exception of the kitchen/dinningroom staff which is extremely professional. They need to learn about providing information to the guests up-front and issuing the right packages, also the resort seems to be slightly understaffed at present, especially cleaning staff 13. Mosquitoes! noseems, black flies, dear flies, and more centipedes than we have ever seen anywhere. 14. The marble floors and staircases are extremely slippery when wet for some types of shoes. Please be careful folks. The good stuff 1. Beautiful room, fantastic decor, comfort galore 2. Beautiful resort, great care to decor, finishing and furnishings 3. Huge Jacuzzi tub (Villa Laguna) 4. Fun design for the shower (Villa Laguna) 5. Walk-in closet with large self-coded safe (Villa Laguna) 6. Tons of buffets and \u00e0 la carte restaurants (Japanese grill was our favourite, La fondue our least favourite, but we did not get to try them all (see What needs work #2 & #3)) 7. Food was delicious, plentiful and varied with loads of choices for seafood lovers 8. Premium drinks, friendly bar staff (our consumption of their delicious mudslides was astronomical) Cheers to the Laguna pool staff they are very nice and the bartender we had most of the time was extremely skilled and very nice to chat with. 9. Wonderful concierges for the Villa Laguna (by the pool), helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. 10. Amazing Spa section (free facial, massage, pedicure & manicure with Villa Laguna, make sure to ask for it) 11. Beautiful beach with roped-off platinum/Villa Laguna and lounger-side drinks service 12. Amazing pools and loads of free lounge chairs 13. We only took in one of the nightly shows but it was fun, very professional and the ballroom/Entertainment room was beautiful and well set up 14. Great atmosphere, loads of conveniences, a stroller\u2019s paradise (it is a LARGE resort) In closing, our friendly bit of advice 1. Bring a copy of your sales agent\u2019s prospectus or web page describing the package you purchased and make sure you get everything that is listed at check-in. Double check with other guests in your area if you have the correct colour wrist band. 2. Ask questions starting with: Where is our concierge? The answer to that could be one of four (Sunset Lobby Concierge, Riviera Lobby Concierge, Platinum Lobby Concierge, Villa Laguna Pool concierge) 3. Be careful with your valuables and do not operate the safe with people in the room (ask them to wait outside instead). Don\u2019t use obvious codes either like 1234 or 1111. 4. Your tour operator will probably tell you not to book with the onsite excursion organiser (at the back of the bar in the Sunset Lobby). We booked a trip to Chichen Itza with him and had superior bus and lunch package compared to what tour operators were booking for their clients. Our trip was with Apple Tours. They are very professional and insured. They also provided a university level historian to describe the Mayan culture which was far beyond any tours we have ever taken in any country. 5. Bring surf socks or some swimming footwear 6. Bring bug spray and insect repellent lotion as well as Stopbite or Lanacane bite relief ointment. Spraying is happening on the resort now but there is still a mangrove area that borders the beach which probably accounts for the mosquito factor. 7. If you want to book the \u201cBeach feast, Thai dinner\u201d you have to book two days in advance\u2026 why take a chance? Book the first day you arrive 8. After your trip you need to hand in your blue towels to get the cards back to hand in at the front desk at checkout. They will give you a checkout slip that is needed to leave on the airport bus so don\u2019t loose it. 9. Give the staff a chance to adjust to their new jobs in a new resort \u2026 [--] guests sporting their best \u00ab offended royalty \u00bb scowls are a turnoff to everyone 10. Have a fantastic time, take an excursion, and enjoy the elegant surroundings, the great drinks and wonderful food.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "kelowna", "Title": "\u201cpositive experience\u201d", "Author": "kelownagurl", "ReviewID": "UR12921248", "Content": "We just returned from a one week all inclusive stay at the Grand Rivieira Princess. This resort just opened in Dec 07....Because of that there are still a few quirks to iron out, but for the most part we had a wonderful stay there. The resort itself is fabulous, marble flooring throughout the entire hotel including the rooms. Unfortunately as beautiful as they are they are also very dangerous when wet. I am surprised no one has hurt themselves yet....Although I do beleive it will happen sooner or later it is inevitable. So be careful. The two very large buffets are excellent tons of variety. We also enjoyed a couple of the ala carte's....Those were amazing as well....They offer six or seven ala carte's and we didnt hear anything negetive about any of them......Although we did get stung for the lobster at the seafood one. 50.00 U.S We werent aware we would be charged for anything but lobster is not included in the all inclusive. That was a rather unpleasant surprise....I do recommend you attend the meeting the morning after you arrive at the resort ...Your rep will give you all the info you need to find y our way around the resort and will fill you in the the little details that we missed ....They did mention at that meeting that we would have to pay for the lobster....But because we did not attend we learned the hard way....The pools are wonderful they meander through the whole resort and are very clean. There are three swim up bars and a bar at the beach. Not to mention the bars in the two massive lobby's There is also a disco and a sports type bar with pool and ping pong tables for the kids.....THis resort when done will house 1500 rooms. They are still in the process of finishing many of them but we were never disturbed by any construction noise at all......And it is not obvious that this hotel is not complete....It is definately ready to be open.....The service was very good. We waited all of 10 mins for a roll of toilet paper....and the lobby was quite a distance from our hotel room....They were prompt and courteous at all times....The few things that we found to be not up to par were, that on more than one occasion we were unable to exchange money at either of the 2 lobby's which meant that we were unable to tip as well as we would have otherwise done.....We got the run aound on that a few times....sending us from one lobby to another saying that the other lobby has it when they didnt and vise versa......So we recommend you have your tip money in hand before you come......And try to have all your money exchanged for that matter.U.S and pesos are accepted equally so either one is fine. We also found that there was a lack of quality entertainment at nite......THe bars close at midnite and the disco then opens and goes until 2am....after that all you have is the sports bar from which you can only get beer at that time of nite...and It is not a place you really want to hang out as it is more practical environment for kids......So after 2 am there is virtually nothing to do....You are secluded at this resort ....without taking a taxi or shuttle somewhere, there is nothing within about a 15 min cab ride.....Playa Del Carmen is a great little place with lots of shops and restaurants etc....It is a 15 min shuttle or cab ride from the resort......shops are open till after 10pm so lots to do and see there. You want to go to 5th avenue....That is the place. All in all we had a wonderful vacation and would definately recommend the Princess....Like I said the service was great and the hospitality of the Mexican people was awesome......I think as time goes by and the resort gets closer to completion it will be a fabulous place to vacation.....We got a very good deal because of the \"underconstruction\" type thing.....We were told it will be twice what we paid when things are fully completed.....It was more than I expected honestly.......", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon", "Title": "\u201cMosquitos and single beds for two weeks\u201d", "Author": "saskwatch1", "ReviewID": "UR12919847", "Content": "Stayed there Jan 8 to Jan 22 2008 Mosquitos, wrong room, single beds, leaky ceilings, dangerous wiring, bad smells, no robes or slippers, no tequila, no fruit basket, poor room service, dead mice in fountains, dead fish in ponds, poor dirty beach, no beach parties, shows in gymnasium setting, etc. etc. etc.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Grand Riviera Princess All Suites Resort & Spa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d796925-Reviews-Grand_Riviera_Princess_All_Suites_Resort_Spa-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$165 - $293*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Prolongacion 5ta.
