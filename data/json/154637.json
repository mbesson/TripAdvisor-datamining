Comfortable and spacious rooms could do with a make-over, even if only the soft furnishings. Great food in the restaurant and very helpful waiters. It was disheartening to see the Maitre D' unable to speak a word of English. Upon checking out, several of my meal bills had been altered by staff. Tip values were increased, in some instances to double what the actual coffee or meal cost. Management dealt with it promptly, but you do need to check your slips carefully.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roscoe, IL, USA", "Title": "\u201cRooms are lackluster but the hotel is nice. 24 hour restaurant and excellent fitness center.\u201d", "Author": "Matt P", "ReviewID": "UR125058924", "Content": "My room is small, boring, and a bit worn out.

The hotel feels safe and is in a decent location. It is close to shopping and restaurants but a taxi is necessary. The room was big and modern. I think the bed was a little hard, but there is a large flat screen tv and the bathroom was very nice. The restaurant downstairs is decent. The menu is not big and the service is a little slow, but the food is fine. My biggest complaint about this hotel is the wireless internet service. It is horrible! All three days at the hotel- the service was spotty at best. I called the front desk and I believe they know they have problems with the wireless internet. (internet with an ethernet cable is not available). The front desk was very rude about the problem as it seemed as though they are also frustrated by it.", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGood experience, but...\u201d", "Author": "Dreloso", "ReviewID": "UR14548179", "Content": "Stayed a week at the Royal while visiting my daughter who is a college student in Mexico City. Overall a very good experience. Price was same as I booked via Travelocity and the room was very nice and clean. Service was very good and the lobby restaurant was exceptional for a lobby restaurant. Nice pool and spa. Now for the however....lots of street noise at night even though the room is quite some distance off the street. The location is in a business complex area with no shops or restaurants within walking distance, so a taxi ride is necessary for everything. Finally, I arranged through the front desk for a taxi the airport at the end of our stay at a fixed rate. The driver did the classic and raised the price once we got to the airport.

The hotel has nice installations, good pool and rooms. Its has several big meeting rooms and it seems this is one of its principal attractions. The room was not very clean, with stain marks in the bathroom. It had an old air conditioner and few TV channels. They offer wireless Internet for about $10 a day. The principal problem was they bill you for several of the accesories other hotels give you for free, like the toothbrush. I have no problem for this, but you can't differentiate between free and non-free accesories. You have to ask. Check-in services is good and speedy.
