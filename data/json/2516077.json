I was happy to be so close to the airport for an early flight so in that respect this hotel is very convenient. However there were several different events going on at the hotel and their was a long wait just to get on the elevator. From watching the elevators it appeared that at least two of the elevators were not currently working or operating and one of the other elevators that we ended up on got stuck on the 7th floor and took several minutes of people slamming on buttons before it continued. After watching the way other people were slamming on the elevator buttons these problems may not have been the hotels fault in the end. There were different elevators for the parking vs the room floors which seemed to confuse other people staying there. The parking alone was a pain as there was nothing to tell you if there were any spots still available on any of the floors so we drove around for a good ten or fifteen minutes just trying to find a spot and there is an additional charge of 25 dollars for one night of parking. We tried going into the bar for some food and drinks and after sitting at a table for five to ten minutes without anyone coming over to take our order we decided to walk down the road to try somewhere else. We asked who we thought was the concierge at the concierge desk for directions to a store and after he gave us directions that apparently included a back alley and another less then attractive road, the actual concierge came running out telling the other worker no that was not the way to go and they did actually want to see us again and make it back alive. So be careful who you ask for directions. The room was average overall, it was clean and the beds were comfortable so it was about all we required it to be for one night. Only drawback was we seemed to be in a corner room that must have been near some type of utility room because there was a lot of machine type noises that kept coming on and off.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tilba Tilba, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel - Great Service\u201d", "Author": "BMOL", "ReviewID": "UR129172382", "Content": "I stayed here on my way to NYC from Sydney, to break up the trip. We were planning to stay at another hotel in LA on the return trip home, but enjoyed the Hilton LAX so much, that we stayed here for on the return trip. The service here is very good. All the departments are great, and we particularly were surprised in the landings bar at how good the cocktails, and waitstaff were. The room service waiter was also very exceptional, a pleasant surprise. The hotel is very nice. The lobby is great, and has these massive amethyst and quartz crystal clusters throughout. The rooms were spacious, and very comfortable. My mother had a room that opened onto a courtyard, which she enjoyed very much, and I had a room on an executive floor, that had nice views. The decor is very elegant and understated. The executive lounge views of the runaway were good, though the lounge, as typical in US Hiltons, offered pretty disappointing food etc. The meals we ate in the restaurant and downstairs were very nice, and also from room service in the two times we stayed there. The price of this hotel was very reasonable. There is an airport shuttle that runs every 10-15 mins to and from the hotel. This was very convenient. There are buses that you can take to Venice Beach, and other places, and we also went into LA city quite easily by bus with the directions from the concierge. We both really enjoyed our stays at Hilton LAX, and actually were very pleasantly suprised at this hotel.

We took the free shuttle hoping to go to the Hilton Gardens near LAX. It was past midnight and dark. Our flight just got canceled. We got re-booked for the next flight in the morning. We were traveling with two young child: ages 2 and 4. And we had two big suitcases, a stroller, and three carry ons. The shuttle driver was friendly but she innocently dropped us at the Hilton LAX instead of the Hilton Garden Inn. It was so dark and we were tired so we did not know we were in the wrong hotel. We found out when we checked in. The lady at the front desk (wish I remember her name) told us to take the free shuttle back to the airport at the drop off, then walk to the area for free pick up to find the right shuttle that will take us to the Hilton Garden. Are you freakin serious? Past midnight, with two young child, exhausted with tons of luggage back to the airport for pick up. We begged her for sympathy and told her about our situation with young kids. She just stared us like a cold hearted person and told us \"NO.\" She told us we can pay for our own taxi and did not bother to waste another second with us. So we were fed us. We took a cab: paid $12 plus tip to save us some time and trouble. When we arrived at the Hilton Garden Inn, the front receptionist apologized for what happened to us. She said she would reimburse us for the taxi if we had our receipt. She said that we did not have to go through all that trouble. She said that the Hilton has shuttles that they can call to take us directly to the Hilton Garden Inn. She apololized many times. It was not her fault. That night, we were not the only one that experience this horrific treatment. There were two young ladies that actually did not take the taxi and went back to the airport waiting for that shuttle: they ended up waiting for more than an hour and they got fed up and paid for a taxi which they took to the Garden Inns. We are Hilton members and got treated like this? We will never return to the Hilton at LAX ever again! We will make sure we never recommend this hotel to our friends and families because we do not want anyone to experience what we went through.

Be it vegas, Oregon or California, I have not had a good experience at the Hilton. This hilton is first of all impersonal and rude. We checked in and asked for two beds and were told \"there are no more rooms with two beds.\" After checking into an old outdated room with a little tube TV, we called to request a room with a standard flat screen and were offered a room the following day with a flat screen but told that there were definitely no rooms with two beds. After having a ten dollar drink downstairs in order to cope with our misery, we went to the front desk for one last try. We begged to get a room with a flat screen TV. Well, we were given a room with two beds. We were not hassled nor was it hard to find a room with two beds when we hit the front desk for our third request. Why? The room with two beds was all that we would expect for a 3 star hotel. This hotel claims to be a four star. I have no idea why. The room was okay but there was trash sitting outside someone's door when we left for our conference at 8am. When we came back at 10pm, the bag of trash was still sitting there. We went to go check out the pool. I have never smelled such a poor smell nor seen such filth. The route to the pool is bad enough but the filth in the rooms you use to get to the pool was inexcusable for a four star hotel. The smell- the smell was jet fuel. Jet fuel fumes are trapped in the pool area and I don't see how people even use the facilities. Finally, Parking is over priced. You are charged $25 per day to park. The parking garage makes you drive your car five floors under the hotel and the spaces are tiny. IF you want valet, be prepared to spend $38. I have traveled all over the country and in Europe and have never confronted such parking prices and such a high star rating for such an undeserving property. Not even Turtle Bay on Oahu is so price with parking in comparison to the quality of the hotel. How can this hotel keep the four star rating?

I was placed on the most recently renovated floor. The room was OK, but the bathroom was approximately 6' x 7' and circa 1950. Additionally, the bathroom was filthy with poor water pressure. The shower and toilet were obviously not touched with the renovation and helped to make the bathroom a complete disconnect from the room . The Hilton should have reduced the room size and increased the bathroom size to create a more modern and updated bathroom. Service was horrible from the front desk to the restaurant. I had communicated with a Front Desk Manager named Tim early the day of my arrival to pre-assign a room which was given away to another guest when we arrived. The front desk clerk lied and said the room was not ready only to be told a few minutes later by a Manager that the room was actually assigned to another guest. Why did it matter? It mattered because I was with my wife and 2 children and needed a room with 2 double beds and was given one with a king instead. In the morning when it was time to catch a shuttle to the airport I encountered a long line that I waited in for 30 minutes before deciding to take a cab to the airport. I barely made my flight. Anyway, the Hilton LAX simply does not need to care about service as they area very busy airport and convention hotel that gets booked solid and sold out frequently regardless of the rooms/service. It amazes me within the major chains that wear the names such as \"Hilton\" that the chains allow such discrepancies from hotel to hotel within the brand that are simply inconsistent. There are certain chains such as the Ritz Carlton or even the Hilton Garden Inn's where consistency amongst properties seems to be much more predictable. For people needed to spend a night at LAX who want a reasonably nice room that is updated and modern I suggest the Westin LAX. If you can afford to spend a bit more the Ritz Carlton Marina Del Rey is about 10 minutes from LAX, but a really terrific property.

Really sick. Ready to cry, wanting mommy sick. So by the time I retrieved my luggage and boarded the Hilton's shuttle (which arrived within moments and featured a very helpful and kind driver), all I wanted to do was crawl into bed and sleep. But check-in wasn't for a few hours and I worried that there might not be a room available for me. No need for the worry. While the hotel was bustling with people and activity, check-in was swift and a room was ready. The hotel clerk was very sweet and made the process painless. Within minutes, I was in my room on the renovated 9th floor and enjoying much needed slumber in a wonderfully comfy bed. And the room was quiet! I didn't hear a thing until my alarm went off hours later. Truly, the HIlton was a godsend to me. When I finally did arise and look around, I noted that the room was modern, very clean and extremely comfortable. There isn't free WiFi, but that wasn't important to me on this trip. My view was of the pool, which was closed for renovation but, I wasn't in need of a pool, so that didn't bother me. I could see the airport, which was kind of cool. If I really listened for it, I could hear planes landing and taking off, but it was faint noise and nothing that bothered me. There were complimentary ear plugs in the room. I never used them. Two days later, I was feeling much better and treated myself to the breakfast buffet. The options were many overall but I'm gluten free and, therefore, basically had fruit, scambled eggs and some bacon. It was quite a pricey breakfast and the quality was just average, but that's pretty typical of hotel food. I wasn't expecting more. The service was attentive and it was pleasant to sit, sip coffee and read the paper. There was a big conference going on the weekend I stayed here but, again, I wasn't bothered by any noise and got a kick out of seeing the unique attendees for this less-than-mainstream event. And even though the lobby was crowded, I never waited for service, got cabs quickly and felt well taken care of (many thanks to wonderful Tim in customer service). I took a trolley car into Manhattan Beach for $5 -- a cab would have cost me $30-- and that worked out well. The trolley stop is just outside the entrance of the hotel -- buy your ticket at the valet desk. The free shuttle to the airport was an excellent perk and eliminated any need to rent a car. I'd stay at the LAX Hilton again, happily. By the time I boarded the plane to return home I was feeling so much better.

It was AMAZING! I am an airplane freak, and this room provided amazing views of aircraft on final to the south complex! (Next time, I will request a corner suite on the west side of the building, as it will provide you with awesome views of LAX and the Pacific Ocean! Many tours leave right from the hotel doors -- literally! We took the 4 1/2 hour LA tour ($65), it was amazing! They let you get out and walk around at Rodeo Drive, the Farmers Market, and at Santa Monica beach (we didn't that day because it was raining -- but we still saw it!) Sleeping was no problem, as the walls are very well insulated! (I didn't sleep much, as I was watching a bunch of red eye/international departures! :) The next day we got up and had breakfast in the lounge (very small and crowded but provided a nice breakfast!), then went down and caught the 10:00 Ocean Express to Manhattan Beach (It stops right outside the hotel, and is only $5 roundtrip!!) We spent an hour at the beach and on the pier. It isn't as cool or fancy as other piers such as Santa Monica pier, but it is very nice and everyone is really friendly! We caught thr 11:30am Ocean Express back to the hotel and got back around noon. Just in time to catch the very nice airport shuttle to LAX, in time to catch our 3:00pm flight to Omaha (via Denver)!

You pretty much know they will be high-volume hotels which offer the basics. Due to my job, I am put in this hotel often. And it's fine. It's good for a shower and a night's sleep. This is an old hotel....like 1970s old. But they are in the midst of a room renovation (sorely needed), which is making it a little more liveable. The old style tube tvs are being replaced by large flat screens, the stained carpeting is being replaced by a fresh new design and the overall new room style is modern and boutique-ish. The bathrooms do still feel old, but they are clean and offer the new Peter Thomas Roth bath products. This Hilton offers 2 dining options - a 24-hour cafe that offers pizza, salads and sandwiches, and a full-service restaurant. Both are not that great, but there is nothing to eat in the area (except for fast food). The Landings Bar also offers some food options. I've never had the room service, but that is available as well. The bartenders in the Landings Bar make great drinks and are friendly. There are large crowds at this hotel. There are often lines for the airport shuttle and the hotel hosts large conventions with weird people - just imagine a hotel overrun by people dressed in anime outfits, stuffed animals or wizards. Most of the staff are pretty friendly and handle the weird crowds well. However, the front desk staff are a little irritable at times, and you can tell they are tired of the chaos and just want to go home. Eventhough the hotel is located right at the airport with views of the runways, it is fairly quiet. I've never had trouble sleeping here, except for some of the noisy rooms next to housekeeping closets. I have also had a couple rooms with heat that didn't work. On cold nights, it kind of sucks. Both times it was late and I was tired, so I had to run the shower at full heat to steam up the room since it was so cold. This is a perfect hotel for one night before or after a flight.

Very convenient; it is very close to the airport LAX. Accessible to other establishments like Costco, Target, Gasoline station, restaurants, bars and clubs. They offer shuttle services (Free to small fee) not only to the airport but to any local areas as well. The hotel however is hard to find. If it's your first time here, you might miss the small street opening to the entrance of the hotel. Parking: 3.5 stars. $20 self park (validate your ticket for all day in and out parking), $30 Valet per day. Parking lot can be full especially during conferences or weekends but so far, I really have not had an experience where there was no space for me at all. Their parking structure is underground, 4 levels and a bit narrow but hey, it's better than nothing. Imagine staying at a hotel with no parking structure? Some hotels mandates valet parking for $25-30 PLUS tips. So really, this one is not bad. Price. 4 stars. You can actually book $100/night on weekends, which is pretty good considering it's very close to LAX. I think you can get better deals online as well. Room and Decor = 3.5 stars. It's clean, well stocked, comfortable and smells clean. Sheets are above average. I find their room decor/theme simple but pleasant. They have triple thick curtains so if it's pulled shut, the room is pitch black, great for those who need to sleep during the day. I've stayed here multiple times a year, never had problems with noise factor. Sometimes you can hear muffled sounds of planes but not enough to wake me or bother me. Service = 4 stars. Hit or miss for front desk and concierge service. Quick, friendly and accommodating chambermaids, bellhops and valet service. Multiple times, valet would permit me to park at front, just to pick up (or drop off) something in my room or to change clothes. Sometimes, my car will be sitting up front for an hour and there was no hassle from them. TIP: You can request NICELY for a small fridge to be sent up to your room and as far as my experience is concern, it's free. Food = 2 stars. The Cafe and Bistro in the first floor, as well as the room service are expensive and the food are not worth it, but convenient esp. at late hours. Biggest issue I have about this hotel is their telephone service or front desk guest list system ---It's always either broken or in chaos. I have to take 1 1/2 full stars for this nonsense. Not once, twice or three times but almost everytime I'm here, I cannot be contacted by outside parties. If I don't give my room number directly to friends/family who are going to meet me or call me, 8 out of 10, I cannot be reach due to number of mishaps as follows: 1.) Front desk informs my guest that I'm not checked in yet or that there is no such guest at all or I have already checked out! 2.) My guests calls is connected BUT to a wrong room. 3.) My phone room simply doesn't work. It will not ring at all on my end (ringer is on, yes, we checked this multiple times) yet my guest have been calling or trying to reach me. And when they request assistance from them about this error, front desk argues that maybe I'm not in the room or have fallen asleep. Seriously! There's 2x they had to change my room phone when they found out it was really broken (after multiple troubleshooting). This use to frustrates me but now, it's almost comical. I swear, my guest makes fun of this mishap now and have learned not to call the hotel to reach me anymore. Thank God for cellphones! Unlucky for those out of the country visitors who doesn't have local cellphones. TIP: If you don't have a cellphone, make sure to call your party as soon as you are in your room and give your guest your room number. Inform the front desk that you are expecting an important call. If they could not reach you, give them permission to knock on your door. Overall, it's really not a bad hotel. For 3 years now, we have been staying here 2-3 days at a time, 5x or so a year.

Great deals on bed &breakfast and the buffet was first class. They had something for every one. Healthy fruit both dried and fresh. Breads, buns, eggs, yogurts, cereals. The list goes on. Even strawberries which was a luxury. So if you get the b&b offer you must take it. I didn\u00b4t get top ups of coffee as regularly as i would have liked but i know if i had flagged down the staff that would not have been a problem. Dining hall is pretty full of people in mornings but there is plenty of seating arrangements and it means food is always fresh and plentiful. Staff very friendly and helpful at all times. The valet guy even used his own phone to ring my excursion company when i couldn\u00b4t find my bus. That was very nice. All in all i would most definitely go back. I was very pleased and even if you spend that little bit extra you get what you pay for.

There is no way I wanted to fight with LA traffic in the rush hour with 3 kids in the car. So I chose Hilton (LAX) as always when allowed by company's policy. The hotel location was simple enough to find (with GPS). Found a parking spot under ground P5 level. It was late when we checked in, all of us were pretty tired and just wanted to washup and went to bed. To my surprised, the TV was a 27\" tube. I thought I was in the wrong hotel for a moment. It did remind me of the HIE chain elsewhere. The next morning when I was ready to check out, I found out that Hertz has a office here as well. But I needed to move my rental car to P6 level. If I had known about this before hand, I would of park on P6 the night before. Anyway, I wasn't aware of any other HHonor incentives like other reviewer's mention until now. My kids had some cereal for breakfast on the lobby level. The shuttle (every 20 minutes) took us to the airport.

They were building a large facility for the Air Force. They put thermostats throughout the building and even connected wires to them, but the wires from the thermostats dead-ended above the ceiling. The thermostats were merely there to entertain the occupants, not to actually control the temperature. The Hilton Los Angeles Airport seems to have employed this same construction company\u2026. While the fan control in the room does indeed control the fan speed, the thermostat seems to have no effect on the temperature of the air coming out of the vent. The air is cold, regardless of whether you turn the knob all the way to left to 60 degrees or turn the knob all the way to the right to 80 degrees. I mentioned the problem to the front desk the morning of the second day and was assured that the problem would be fixed. However, the second night was just as cold as the first night. Be sure to bring your thermal underwear because they only provide a very thin foam blanket for the bed. Other than that, this is a pretty functional and well maintained Hilton property that is convenient to the airport and reasonably priced. Here are some tips: 1. Parking \u2013 if you are going to drive a rental car, you can pay for your parking in advance on their website and get a slight discount. After that, your credit card functions as your entry and exit card. I found this feature very nice. (See https://www.airportparkinglax.net/ for details) 2. Breakfast on 16th floor - If you are a Hilton HHonors Gold and above member, you can have a complimentary breakfast in the 16th floor lounge. Breakfast was a simple continental type (toast, pastries, fruit, cereal, hard boiled eggs) but it was adequate and the view of airplanes taking off was really pretty. It does get a bit crowded, but if you are patient, you can get a table when someone gets up to leave. I ate at the lounge both mornings. 3. Nice CuisineArt single/double coffee maker in room with Lavazza coffee. 4. Free internet for Hilton HHonors Gold and above. 5. Local Area \u2013 if you are planning to drive around and look for local shops and restaurants, the areas to the east and south of the airport are scruffy and uncomfortable. However, the area just a few blocks north on Sepulveda Blvd is very nice with extensive, shiny new retail and nice, well maintained neighborhoods. 6. Dinner \u2013 I had a very entertaining dinner at the Buggy Whip Restaurant, about 10 minutes north of the airport on surface streets. The address is 7420 La Tijera Blvd and it is next to Interstate 405. This restaurant is an old establishment and is sort of a time-warp back to the 1960s. The hostess was delightful and served me personally in the bar. I had two excellent martinis and a very nice steak dinner including a salad with Green Goddess salad dressing (their specialty) and a bowl of home-made split-pea soup. The atmosphere was very nice. As I walked out, I noticed that they had a display of several posters of movies that had been filmed there.

It sort of reminded me of an underground, military installation of some sort. Once in our room, it also looked sort of dim, gray and tired. Throwing open the curtains revealed a \"view\" of an interior shaft that was open at the top ... so no view and no natural light to speak of. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and room was spacious and as clean as old furnishings and carpet can get I suppose. I don't no if it has just been my luck, but every time I've stayed there, we've had to wait 20 or more minutes for the shuttle to the airport.

The televisions are those absolutely huge ones you got rid of 5 years ago for a flat screen - not exactly HD - more say circa 1990. Oh yeah, and the furniture is not of Hilton quality, I think they picked it up at a closed down fairfield inn!!

I had a pleasant (and unplanned) stay at the Hilton LAX a while ago and based on that experience and wanting to give my mother a chance for a decent rest, decided to try their day rate option, $92 (with taxes) for a twin room (double beds) guaranteed available between 9am and 6pm. This turned out to be an act of genius on my part. I have colleagues who recommend other airport hotels but for us, the facilities at the LAX Hilton were fine. What do you want on a layover like this? A reasonably sized and clean room, comfortable beds, hot shower, early check in, and easy to navigate base for a bit of stopover shopping. Most importantly, no hassles. And the Hilton LAX delivered for us on all these elements. Since my last visit there have been some upgrades, the TV in our room was flatscreen with full cable options, and the bathroom amenities seemed better quality. Staff were very helpful and friendly, we were able to check in at 730am which was greatly appreciated, room was large and clean and the shuttle service was again excellent - very professional. The hotel is always well-staffed and the lobby areas are very well appointed. It was great to be able to have a shower and sleep for a couple of hours in comfort, do some shopping then get ourselves organised for the LAX to Sydney flight. We even had time for a cocktail in the bar. For the price it was a sensible investment that kept Mum and me happy after one long flight and before another. Minor downside was the pool closed for renovations but we wouldn't have used it anyway. Our floor (level 3) smelt quite strongly of cigarette smoke but the room did not. There are no in-room safes or mini-bars, and wifi is charged by the day ($12.95) or hour ($5.95). With a couple more upgrades to the rooms the hotel would be improved but overall I was pleased with the rate, service and facilities.

The guest services guy was very funny and nice when I called him to ask for pizza recommendations. Also, we had breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant - which was very clean and busy.

Hilton has a nice product and while this is not a \"resort\" type property, it is a good business hotel with plenty of amenities for a quick vacation stay, too.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat for an overnight stay in LA, nothing longer\u201d", "Author": "TeejMcTeej", "ReviewID": "UR118548110", "Content": "We arrived in the morning at LAX after a 14+ hour flight from Australia, intending to rent a car from LAX and drive to San Francisco. We thought it would be worth while spending the night in LAX to get over some jet-lag and acclimatize, especially with 2 small kids. After reading some reviews on tripadviser and deciding on this hotel, we managed to get a very good deal using credit card points (for an overnight stay at the LAX Hilton) Although we arrived at the hotel at 08:30, the man at the Hotel Check-in was kind enough to let us check in very early (09:15), which was several hours before the standard check-in time (3pm?). To our delight we were upgraded to the \"concierge level\" whereby we were entitled to use the free buffet business/meal area. While we were waiting for our room, we had a lovely complementary breakfast with the kids in the concierge lounge. Once finished, we called reception, and found that our room was ready on the top floor. We had a fantastic room on the top corner level overlooking the run-way at LAX. We had a mid-day nap, in exceptionally comfortable beds (2 x queen beds). Surprisingly, there was very little noise from the overhead aircraft, and we had a great rest. Later we had a swim in the central pool which was clean and maintained well, but very dull and quite dated (this didn't bother the kids who were happy with any swimming pool). I don't recall any staff or facilities (bar/grill) in the pool area. Later we went back to the concierge lounge for drinks, and a light snack, and put the kids to sleep. I went to grab a coffee from Starbucks in the main lobby (worst coffee I have ever had, and a total rip off for $4.50). My wife and I had a terrible room service meal which was totally overpriced, and very disappointing (steak sandwich with fries). Unfortunately most hotel food is very poor, so we half expected it, and didn't bother complaining, and go through the whole ordeal of talking to the manager, only to wait another hour for a simple sandwich and fries. Overall the room we had on the concierge level was great, and the beds very comfortable. We didn't have much interaction with the staff other than at check-in. The public areas of the hotel look a bit tired and dated, although I saw some signs in the lobby advising on a long awaited and well needed \"face lift\". Hilton is very much hit/miss in the USA with very inconsistent standards in the USA, so i was interested to see how this compared to other Hiltons I had booked for our vacation. I would stay at this hotel again, if I could get the same/similar room on the concierge levels, overlooking the awesome LAX run-way, for a decent price or deal. I would definitely not stay more than one night at this hotel, as there is nothing much to do in the area, but it is good for a break in a long flight. They do need to improve the standards of the room service meals, and the food prices are ridiculous.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Haven, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cIt seems to be slipping\u201d", "Author": "withkidstravel", "ReviewID": "UR118469413", "Content": "I have stayed here many times and it has been fine, but this stay is slightly more revealing.

Of the airport hotels in the area I find this property to be as good as or better than the others. The Sheraton nearby wasn\u2019t nearly as nice a few months ago. The Radisson (the old Hyatt for those of us in our 40s) looks terrible from the outside, but has been redone inside. The Westin , while nice on my last visit, has received mixed reviews and it is the newest one on the strip of the major hotel brands. The Marriott, as old as the other properties was nice when I had an unexpected missed flight several months ago. All in all, I\u2019m happy at the Hilton. The executive lounge on the 16th floor is open for breakfast and then again in the evening. I'm not sure why they close and do not allow access to the lounge during the day, but I found this to be a downside. It can be nice to go to the lounge during the day for a beverage and regroup before moving on to other activities. The lounge does have a nice view of the airport and it can be fun watching the airplanes land and take off from the venue. When we made our reservation we opted to upgrade to a larger suite upon check in. We ended up having one of the suites with two adjoining rooms. Since we were traveling with our children the extra space always comes in handy. The large dining room or boardroom table in the middle suite area worked out well for a morning breakfast. The hotel is older and that means small bathrooms. I don't know that the property can overcome the small bathrooms by remodeling. For now, and probably the future, the hotel will have to suffer with the bathroom that is barely large enough for one person. The furniture feels dated, but the room was clean and acceptable. The bed was comfortable. While I seldom use a TV when staying at a hotel, I was surprised that the TV was so dated. The hotel works great when you are getting into LA late at night and you are on a different time zone and need a place to sleep. It also works great if you are visiting LA and want a hotel that is convenient to places both north and south. Yes, traffic can get bad in LA, but I have often found this hotel a good place to base when visiting the city. I used the Parking Spot garage next door and the parking was only about $18. I didn't park at the Hilton because I had a large SUV and it wouldn't fit into the garage area. What was nice was that while I was taking the SUV into the self-serve parking garage the gate shut and I was given plenty of warning signs that my car wouldn't fit.

The hotel is large, maybe too large, which means as an airport property, a lot of people are arriving an leaving at all hours. Check in was smooth. As a Hilton Honors Gold member, I got a room near the top floors facing south towards the south runways of LAX. I found very little noise creeping into the room. Overall, the room was 3.5 stars, definitely not a 4 star, due to its very basic room, amenties, decor, and bathroom. The desk area was not the best lit for work but not so dark that I couldn't see my paperwork. The bed was comfortable, with good lighting on the nightstand. The carpets were clean and the furniture not all beat up like what one often sees at airport properties. The bathroom, which can often make or break my star rating with a hotel after the bed and the room cleanliness, was quite basic, nothing to brag about or a place where you want to leisurly take care of your bathroom and vanity responsibilities, but was efficient nonethless. Due to my status with Hilton, the room had upscale bathroom products (Peter Thomas Roth), which are very nice and I'd say a step above the standard C&E products at most Hilton properties. The following morning around 7:30 am I went down to the lobby area to partake of the complimentary breakfast buffet that was included in my rate presumably due to my status. It seemed to be chaos with no one at the front podium to handle the greeting, and a lot of people surrounding the buffet tables piling on the food like most buffet lines. I immediately left, went up to the Executive Club, and partook of the Continental breakfast offering up there with a nice view of the airport runways to boot. It was the best decision I made that day. Another drawback: The elevators in this hotel are clearly inadequate in capacity and number, which can lead to long waits for an elevator car, especially during the peak morning hour when everyone seems to be heading to the restaurant. I waited close to 5 minutes for an elevator on my way down to the restaurant. Several hotel staff were waiting for an elevator car to transport their service carts to another floor and when I left the downstairs restaurant and went up to the Executive Club, those hotel staff were still waiting to get themselves on an elevator (not sure why they weren't using a service elevator, if they are available). Check out was quick and painless. It's a good airport hotel but not much else. Best part was the Executive Club where it was quiet and peaceful with a satisfactory Continental breakfast spread.

I mention this since this hotel can get crazy busy and then there are long queues for the staff to deal with. Can be quite time consuming if you have locked yourself out of your room :) The hotel has pretty much everything you might need such as a pool, gym and three restaurants depending what you are in the mood for. My only small annoyance about the gym was that the treadmills squeaked a lot while you run. After 5 miles I was really missing my IPod! Other than that, everything was clean and I enjoyed my workout. The hotel's food was really good, I especially enjoyed their Italiano Pizza, really a different bit of a twist to an old favourite. Breakfast was in the form of a buffet and everything was well prepared and tasty. There are no fridges in the rooms so be sure to not take too much take aways! My only real complaint about this hotel is the noise. I cannot fathom why the hallway noise permeates into the rooms so much. If someone opens their door across the hall, it sounds like your door opening. I did a little test and I could hear my wife approaching on her flip flops while lying on the bed almost as soon as she steps out of the elevator.

It is a very convenient Park And Fly hotel (I booked through Park Sleep Fly). It is located on Century Boulevard, a short distance from the Los Angeles International Airport. You would certainly not consider this a resort destination, but for the business traveler it is a solid choice. Every time I\u2019ve stayed here it seems to be really busy, but the staff is personable and I\u2019ve never had to wait long to check in. They have a responsive valet staff to meet you and get you in and out of your automobile. There is also a dependable shuttle service to the airport that runs 24 hours a day. One time we stayed here and took the shuttle service to Manhattan Beach and really enjoyed walking around and dining in that cute beach community. This is an option I recommend if you have time and want to get to the beach. The Hilton Los Angeles Airport has 55,000 square feet of meeting, banquet and event space. Being located in a dense area of Los Angeles, it is used a lot for business and personal events and meetings. Weddings, cincineras, anniversaries, as well as business meetings and large conference events have been in evidence every time I\u2019ve stayed here. I\u2019ve never been into these facilities but thankfully, have also never heard loud noise from them either. Although it always seems busy, it also looks clean and well maintained in both the public areas and the rooms. This hotel gets a lot of use and doesn\u2019t let that wear it down. We were hoping to spend some time by the pool, but it is smallish, lots of concrete and little shade and really has nothing much going for it other than it is a pool. It is quite exposed and to me is not a good place to relax. We didn\u2019t stay long. Like I said earlier, this is not a \u201cresort\u201d type of hotel, so don\u2019t go there expecting that kind of a pool area. We had drinks in the bar, enjoyed talking to the bar tender, but have not eaten in any of the dining facilities, so I can\u2019t speak to the quality of the food. There aren\u2019t a lot of dining choices within walking distance of the hotel. Denny\u2019s is the only one that comes to mind. This is a busy commercial district and I don\u2019t feel real comfortable strolling around the neighborhood. Our room was clean, comfortable and reasonably priced. The bedding is high quality with plenty of pillows, which were a bit soft for my taste. Nice big flat screen TV, coffee maker in the room, quality bath accessories\u2026 all in all a comfortable place to relax and sleep. There\u2019s a decent sized desk area but you have to pay $12.95 extra for internet access. This really annoys me, especially when much lower quality hotels and motels provide free internet access. That's like charging extra to watch the TV. The room was quiet considering the proximity to the airport. You can sort of hear the air traffic, but with the thick, double pane windows and sound proofing, it is barely noticeable. The website says they have 24-hour room service, which we did not try. Nor did we try the complimentary 24-hour Fitness Center. I\u2019d describe The Hilton Los Angeles Airport as upper scale utilitarian. Clean and functional, with everything you need, but not a resort.

While noting the comments in my profile (high floor; away from elevator), he assigned a room that was near the power-up end of one of the runways, and all evening, all night, and all the next morning I heard jet engines revving to capacity every 1- to 2-minutes. I tried several times to get guest services or an operator, but the phones just \"rang and rang.\" Every time I attempted to obtain any service, it was an interminable delay. I was told by multiple people who work there that this is a common occurrence. This is not an employee problem; it is a greedy management problem. It also took me 20 minutes to check out (again, the Honors line), and not all of my charges (room service lunch) had been posted to the account. Some guests were in line for over an hour to check in (the \"regular line\"). Everyone was friendly - but overwhelmed and only marginally competent. The manager of this hotel should be fired at once.

The Hilton rate was $128 but I got a better rate booking thru Hotwire at $77 a night, so I booked for 3 nights/4days. Upon checking in, the lady at front desk made it a point to mention that I had booked thru hotwire, not sure why/how it was important, but she seemed to put emphasis on it. I requested at that point a smoking room and was told that technically that hotel is non-smoking, but that they do have a few smoking rooms. I thought to myself then why dont you technically put that on your site then instead of suprising folks at check-in. She did give me the option of instead of a smoking room, to get a room on the 3rd floor with a patio door to the pool where I could go out and smoke. This turned out to be a good thing, as the room that we got was a non-smoking room with two doubles. Being that it is summer, I didn't mind smoking outside in the tables they have immediately outside the rooms overlooking the pool. I wasn't looking for a room with a view, so I found this to be an added bonus. The room was very spacious, clean, and well-appointed. We kept taking various showers throughout the day, so we asked for and immediately received extra bath towels. The couple times we visited the pool/jacuzzi area, they had plenty towels available by the pool, which are a different color (green) than the room towels. What I found rather disturbing was the fact that on our 2nd night, my friend and I were outside our room having a conversation around 10pm, and shortly thereafter security came to our front door, asked me for my ID, then told me to please keep our loud noise down as they had got a complaint that my friend and I were being too loud. I am not sure how a general conversation at normal tones is considered loud. I understand Hilton has a responsibility to its customers and as such they have to look into any type of complaint, but I just find it disturbing that there were others having conversations outside in the tables, yet we were the only ones to get a visit from hotel security. That was a total mood killer as we went on the rest of our trip literally whispering to each other at the risk of being complained about again. I travel alot and have stayed at this property before, but never had any issues, until this trip. One thing that I also did enjoy was that we were able to use the free hotel wifi (public areas) inside our room throughout our entire stay without having to pay the daily fee for internet. It probably has something to do with the fact that we were immediately next to the pool area, so the signal of the free wifi extended into our room. I can't comment on the food as we always went out to grab a bite to eat for Breakfast and Dinner. All in all it was a very good stay, and would have been all around great had the incident with security not occured. I would definitely stay at this property again, and most certainly would be nice to once again get a room on the 3rd floor with sliding door to the pool.

The special dining area for breakfast and dinner drinks was very convenient as we do not like leaving the kids. The only negative thing was it was raining so hard there was water in one of the rooms. We did not appreciate the wet towels in the room but all in all it was a well spent time and we would do it again.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pinconning, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "gittinsj", "ReviewID": "UR110863212", "Content": "I will approach this review from a different perspective since I stayed here after missing a connection at the airport.

Pros: *The hotel has a lot of amenities in general. They have a gift shop, several restaurants on site, valet parking (if that's your thing), a business center, a pool, four jacuzzis (also if that's your thing), a gym, and so on. *The bistro and room service options are 24 hours. *I felt that the gym was well-furnished and convenient. My only suggestion for improving it would be to provide bottled water instead of a water cooler. *All of the staff members that I encountered were friendly and personable. *There are two self-serve kiosks in the lobby so you can check-in for a flight and print your boarding passes. *The bed was comfortable. Cons: *The pool is small and outdoors. It is heated but it didn't seem to be practical for anything other than kids who want to goof around. *Parking can be a headache. It was difficult for me initially to even find the self-parking entrance and if you skip the valet service, you will be parking way down in the depths. You must keep the parking ticket they issue you at check-in to be able to get into and out of the parking garage every single time. *The lines at the front desk were generally long, even at strange times of the day and night. *There seemed to be drama with the elevators constantly. At one point, only two elevators were working and the lines of people waiting to use them were insane. *Room service was a major price gouge. For two people to eat basic, small meals, it was $50. I expect that in NYC, but not so much in LA, particularly when the quality was not good. I did not get sick from my food but my friend did. *The bistro is over-priced and of similar dubious quality. If your choices are limited or time is not on your side, you can chance it but if you can go down the street, you are better off. There are convenience stores, a Subway, a Taco Bell, etc., within a short distance down Century Blvd. I ordered a pizza at the bistro and it was swimming in orange grease. They charged $15 for what seemed like a $2 microwave pizza. *I could not get anything in the \"business center\" to work. When I went in to make a photocopy, another hotel patron was trying to send a fax and he told me that he had not been able to get the copier to work either. *When the maids cleaned the room each day, they never provided an extra roll of TP. Upon arrival, I discovered some long hairs in the bathtub and some make-up smudges on the sink. *The size of our room itself was good but the bathroom and the closet were tiny. *The hotel is constantly busy and there is constant noise. It never stops. This is understandable, of course, but the walls are thin and there is a gap between the door and the floor. You can see the shadows of people coming and going down the hallway and before we checked out, at some point in the night, someone slid a bill under our doorway. Honestly, a gap that large under the door does not make me feel particularly safe or that I have privacy. If you do not sleep with ear plugs, you will get no rest. The noise factor is very high. You might expect it to be airplane noise but it is the loudness of guests plus the thin walls. *The location is good in terms of closeness to LAX and the rental car companies. I definitely think for business travelers, it makes sense. For leisure travelers not so much. *I know this will sound kooky to some people but we had some odd experiences in our room. To be specific, there were strange noises we could not account for (dog growling when there was no dog in the room, the sound of footsteps dragging across the carpet when none of us were moving) and we felt creeped out. If you don't believe in the paranormal, feel free to disregard this part of the review but if you do believe, I personally think something other-worldly was going on in our room. I wouldn't stay in there again if someone offered me a million dollars.

This is our second stay there and it is trying to hard to be inoffensive in design and decor that it just becomes the most boring hotel on the planet. Everything is beige with the occasional splash of taupe. For more then a few hours it is a very depressing colour scheme / decor. We checked into the room, very large, comfy bed, nice view of some air con units and carparks - but then this is an airport hotel so you don't expect views. We headed down to the 'Sports Bar' for some wings before retiring to bed. They say sports bar, yet more beige everywhere. And the plasma TV's on the bar showing some sport make it a Sports Bar. Still very good friendly service, and excellent wings so we ate and enjoyed. Back to the room and to bed. Jetlag got the worse of us so up early we decided to download the new series opener of Dr Who ... incredibly slow internet connection! But we managed it and plugged the iPod into the TV and enjoyed.

LAX is two hours from my house so I just needed a place to stay. I bid on priceline for a 3 1/2 star hotel for $55 and got the Hilton Los Angeles Airport. The hotel was relativly outdated. It had that motel style TV with 20 or so channels, and the movie menu. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. A big problem was that I needed the internet for work, and it didn't function. But I have no complaints about that I suppose because the hotel generously refunded the internet fee. The parking price is slightly absorbant but I do recomend using it, as opposed to the cheaper surrounding parking complexes, because 1. It's convienient to take an elevator to your car (even if the car is in a maze 6 floors underground) and 2. The area around the hotel didn't seem like the safest place to be walking around at night. The front desk people were pretty friendly. An important fact might be that you can hear each time an airplane takes off. While this didn't bother me (I might even consider it soothing), the noise has the potential to keep some insomniacs up all night. The bathrooms were pretty small and had a \"motel feel\". I personally had a nice view of the airport and got to see all the planes take off in room 1147.

The parking situation is pretty insane. There are separate elevators for the parking structure even though it's directly under the building.

It's not that big of a deal but this, combined with the difficulty of getting in and out of the garage, really makes you think twice about leaving for something small. Speaking of the parking garage, it's probably the worst laid out garage I've seen. The first three levels are for valet but there are literally 30+ spots on each level blocked off just for the sole purpose of telling you that it's a valet level. Try to find a space on level 4 (the first self-park level) because anything lower than that requires you go through a maze of turns at each level to get out. The garage, for lack of a better term: sucks. Ok, but the hotel! The hotel is really good. The rooms are modern and clean.

It's not that the hotel is outdated, in fact, it's really modern. It's just that the common area looks like it's heavily trafficked and often. Common area carpets need a very good cleaning at the least, but probably replacement. Don't let this scare you away though. The hotel doesn't feel dirty in the least and it's pluses overcome it's negatives by a long shot. I'd give it an 8 out of 10 overall.

The entire first floor was a rat race because of a conference held there, so it wasn't exactly easy to get around. Getting an elevator was crazy at times. The most disappointing aspect of our stay: Towers Level Concierge breakfast. We did pay more for a concierge level room. With that, guests should have had fully stocked breads, pastry, fruit, and juice choices. Upon our arrival, the platters were wiped out. We could have selected some wheat bread for toast and I saw 5-6 slices of cantaloupe. The orange juice pitcher had enough juice to fill 1/2 glass. We looked for a table or lounge area to wait for more food to come out, but every empty table was stacked with used dishes, etc. After about 10 minutes, the croissant platter was refilled and the orange juice was refilled, but the other platters remained empty. We moved dirty dishes and wiped the table clean ourselves so that we could sit down. This sort of experience is easily found at a budget motel, not at a concierge level service where guests have paid to be there. I found it inexcusable.

Had just come from another conference where I stayed at for $70/nite at a LaQuinta about 2 blocks away and frankly I preferred the La Quinta for service and value. Not quite sure what it is about the \"brand name hotels\" that requires you to pay more for the room and then pay again for everything on top of that. Want to dial a local call or a 1-800 $2 to start and then another charge per minute. Want the internet - pay $12 something per day. Want one stamp from the convience store on site for a letter - no problem but you can only buy in packs of 2 and for almost double stamp face value. No fridge. No microwave. The shower was worse then the one at La Quinta... the bed however was definately better as was the view. Hint for you all though, be sure you are not given a room ending in the 01-02-03 range on any floor here or you will be beside the nexus center of all wings of the hotel for laundry chute, garbage and housekeeping which means lots of doors, clanging, noise and social chatting early morning - late afternoon. Night was okay... I did mention the bed was nice though right ? The thing that really pissed me off though this stay is I got an email after my initial reservation asking me if I was willing to accept an upgrade at time of arrival if available. Sure. Nicer room, view and free executive lounge access. So I arrive, its my lucky day, I get the upgrade but then Im told that the executive lounge is closed for renovation on my floor and a temporary one is on floor 2. I ask if I can pull out from the deal as that isnt what I signed up for. Nope - its too late. Whatever. The \"special room\" seems just like everyone elses room - nicer headboard but not sure what else ? The view was definitely stunning. Full marks for that but Im at a conference - I get to look out of it for 1 min in the morning and 1 min in the evening before bed.. so the real upgrade, was for me all about the executive lounge access. But the temporary \"executive lounge\" turns out to be a small meeting room with zero ambience and far too small for the number of people using it. Routinely people are standing up to eat or just leaving and eating somewhere outside of the room as there is no available table space. Breakfast is fine - bread, pastry, cereal, fruit and hard boiled eggs (LaQuinta's was far better!!!). But the evening snacks were a problem. Although advertising as available 5- 7pm they routinely were emptied out early on and there was little to no interest by staff to request refills so night after night I arrived to bare cupboards with nothing left to eat at all .... Frankly, I just dont get it. Although many were in the lounge for free as part of their points reward system... I PAID FOR THIS and I simply didnt get what I paid for.. in fairness though - at 7 they would bring out desserts and they were usually to die for and extremely yummie... but... I usually dont eat desserts ... I wanted food ! So at the end of the day what the \"upgrade\" turned out to be (after taxes) was $17.10/day for a hardboiled egg, toast and fruit for breakfast... not a particularly good deal... one would hope things are better than this when the lounge renovations are completed....but in the mean time.. not worth the upgrade... The conference facilities were nice and the lobby area of the hotel is very homey with lots of places to sit and mingle. The rooms are okay. Nothing bad but nothing to die for.

Not so. From arrogant, unfriendly and wanna-be unhelpful front desk staff to rude bell hops to housekeeping staff who did not know sufficient English to understand my requests, the stay was just one unpleasant experience after another. (The security staff were, without exception, friendly and helpful though.) My initial impression of the rooms I was in was of dark, and a faint smell that I finally identified as smoky. The bathrooms were tiny and uncomfortable, given the star rating of the hotel, and I certainly expected better space in the room itself. Although the nightly rate is good, once you're at the hotel, everything costs. Local phone calls, refrigerators, laundry etc. all cost far more than other hotels of similar class. And they don't even necessarily work properly: the fridge in the first room that I had froze everything that I put in it. Although the website does state that there is a smoking floor in the hotel, it does not indicate that non-smokers on other floors will still be required to share the smoking experience in the form of smelly bed linen. The towels in the bathroom stank of old kitchen oil. Having asked for a room in a quiet part of the hotel, I was given a room on the floor that serves the airline trade. Apparently the staff were doing me a favour by giving me a room 2 hours ahead of the usual check-in time (I had been travelling all night and was tired of falling asleep in the lobby). But until midnight, I had to listen to knocking on doors and 'Housekeeping', 'Housekeeping' calls. I eventually asked for a different room and was given one on a quieter floor. My booking was for a room with a king-size bed at a specific rate. At check in, I was told that this was my preference only, and that it was subject to availability. First I've heard of this. Most insulting of all, however, are the constant reminders around the hotel to please rate them a 10 out of 10. This extends as far as separate boxes at the check in desk to drop your room keys in: one if you rate the hotel above an 8, and the other for less than 8. The final bill that is slipped in under the door also has a long discourse about rating the hotel favourably. No surprises which box my keys went into.

We arrived in Los Angeles a day prior to boarding the cruise ship and spent the evening at the Hilton Los Angeles. Everything was going wonderfully. We checked in, hung a few clothes in the closet, called our niece who lives in the LA area to join us for dinner, had a night cap, and then bedded down for the night. The next morning we packed up, checked out, got all our luggage loaded up and headed out to the cruise terminal at Long Beach. So far, so good, right? Well, after checking in for the cruise, once in our stateroom, we started to unpack and put everything away for a wonderful week at sea. Upon opening our suitcases, I start wondering where my suit was? Where were my wife\u2019s dresses which were hanging up? All my dress shirts, and dress slacks? After the panic subsides, I start retracing our steps in an attempt to figure out when I last saw them. I realized I hung them up in our room back at the Hilton so they would stay pressed and fresh. I now realize, I had forgotten all about them and left them hanging in the closet in our room at the hotel. After some prior bad experiences with my wife leaving some clothes at the Hilton in Pensacola, FL, which we never received back, I was certain these would be gone by the time we returned from our week long cruise. We didn\u2019t have much time from when we disembarked off the cruise ship to make our return flight back to DFW, so we did not get the opportunity to call, let alone stop back by the LAX Hilton. Again, more reason to believe the clothes were gone for sure. But I want to tell you, I was very pleasantly surprised when we got back home and I called about the missing clothes. From the front desk personnel who said Security would be the place to check, to the Security personnel who had them and once I gave my room number and date of stay, he knew right where they were. I would like to give the Housekeeping person doing up the room to everybody else involved right down to the Security person who mailed the clothes back to us, the biggest thank-you. If there were some way for you to track down the individuals involved and provide them with some form of recognition, you should really do that. It is employees like these that provide the right kind of customer experience. We too frequently focus on individuals only when they do something wrong. If we focused on their positive practices, the positive experiences would continue to multiply. I know that I will be choosing to stay at a Hilton hotel when provided the opportunity. If I have a choice, and believe me I do, your hotel is the place for me.

We waited over 45 minutes, with a greeter from our tour operator, for the service bus to pick us up. It eventually did at close to 11 p.m. I thought this was because it was close to the Fourth of July holiday, but our greeter assured us that this extensive waiting was happening regularly for her clients. She was right when she said the contracted bus operator picked people up at the three terminals before ours and then was filled and turned on the \"express\" sign and drove past us. This happened, no kidding, 5 times. Our greeter called the Hilton twice to complain and finally a service bus picked us up. My husband says that this is a function of Hilton not putting their foot down on the operator. LAX is a nightmare of an airport anyway, and there are busses, vans, taxis, all doing things-driving like crazy and almost hitting people- that I swear would not be allowed at JFK or Logan airports. On to the hotel: When we arrived with our 5 bags for our overseas trip to the Pacific, there were NO people to open doors and no one to help us with our luggage. There were just two staffers at the check in counter, which was mobbed. We have Hilton Honors program, too, and our wait was about half the time waiting (20 minutes) that the other group had (we saw them still in line after we checked in.). The front desk was clearly understaffed and overwhelmed. The best part about the Hilton was its proximity to terminals. The worst was just getting there via the \"convenient\" bus, and then getting checked in. The hotel's breakfast room was fine, and up to the standards of Hilton. The corridors looked as if they needed vacuuming, but our room was comfortable. We were worried that the service bus would not be able to get us to the airport on time, but it did.

Well, that wasn't quite correct, and we were faced with having to try and carry all our bags through the garage and take an elevator four floors up to the lobby from the parking garage. We decided to leave our bags in the car and check in first... and the front desk was very apologetic when we asked for a bell cart. They sent a bellman all the way down into the parking garage with us to help with the rest of our bags we'd left in the car. They recovered very well from this oversight. We felt completely safe and very taken care of here. A few things to note: the garage ceilings are VERY low.... our Ford Explorer barely made it to the regular parking spaces. There is a sign that states if you have a high profile car, you will have to use the valet parking. Food in the restaurant and cafe is a bit pricey, but there are plenty of choices to be had. They offer complimentary printing of boarding passes in the lobby, which was great! We had no problems catching their free shuttle to the airport at 8AM, but when we returned to the hotel, it seemed the outbound airport shuttle had at least a 30-40 minute wait. Plan appropriately to get to the airport on time during busy shuttle hours. There is an outdoor pool on one of the upper levels, but it's quite small and of course there's lots of airliner noise to contend with.

Shuttles: We ran to catch the shuttle before it pulled away but the driver signalled it was full. As I looked up there was another shuttle pulliing up so no wait. The shuttle is shared with the Four Points LAX that is very close by. The path seems to be LAX Arrivals>LAX Hilton>Four Points>LAX Departures. The schedule is posted as every 15 minutes from the hotel. Check In: Hilton Honors line was short and the agent was friendly enough. Since my rate included breakfast I slected internet as my Hilton Honors Gold property ammenity. This created confusion as the check in lady said I would not get breakfast as my rate was too low and she upgraded me to the towers floor. I told her to check again as my rate did include breakfast and I didnt care about the towers level. She did find the info and gave me the breakfast certs. She did not downgrade me to a regular room though but it did not matter as I consider US lounges useless. Room: Nothing special here...same old room I remember from before only with a little newer carpet and a much more comfortable bed. Dining: We arrived late and the bar is open late but has a limited menu after 10PM but enough for us. The service has always been good at the lounge and the prices pretty reasonable for a hotel. There is fast food within walking distance but not much else unless you want to walk over to the Four Points. Breakfast was standard Hilton buffet fare and again nothing exciting but they will make eggs to order for you if you ask and the service is generally pretty good in the cafe. They also have a 24 hour cafe that is basically pizza, sandwiches and coffee which is also convenient. Car rental: I used the Hertz that is located in the lobby on this trip and have used it in the past as well. I got a rate of about $25 all in for the day and always had pretty good luck with the person running the rental desk as Hertz Gold member he basically tells me what he has and lets me pick. I was expecting problems when I checked out as the internet was on my bill but it was quickly removed upon check out.

If you have an early flight the next day then it is probably perfect for you. We weren't. We got the room on Priceline and were excited that it was only going to cost us $50 a night. Well after the fees it was $65 a night. When we checked in we were told our truck was too big for self park so we were required to use valet. So now it is $85 a night. (We also factored in that there was no included breakfast which basically brought our rate to about $115 because we had to buy something to eat). We paid the $20 self park rate instead of the $30 valet rate, which sounded like a great thing. Until we needed our truck. We were in and out of the hotel all day each day and the wait for valet was not terrible, but very inconvenient for what we needed. Factor in the fact that this hotel is big so it took us longer to get to lobby from our room. Getting into our car took us about 10-15 minutes. Which may not seem like very much time, but if you think about how long it takes you to get from your house to your car it is an eternity. Not to mention we were lugging hockey equipment along with us. The hotel was very busy both nights we stayed. They were having some kind of convention and when we walked into the lobby around 9:30pm it was like walking through a nightclub. Crowded and loud. Food in the cafe was pricey and line moves very slowly. We won't stay there again simply because it was too inconvenient for us. However, the staff seemed nice enough. We decided that for us, staying on the other side of LAX in El Segundo is more our style, there the hotel may be $90-$115 a night, but no valet, no conventions and breakfast included. And for 5 of us that sounds easier. All in all, I would recommend this hotel if you have a flight to catch, or if you are sightseeing and have no time table. It's not a bad hotel.

I got this property for $47 a night on priceline for a 3-night stay in LA. Wanted a somewhat central location to venture out to various areas. My joy was shortly tempered when I realized I'd have to pay $20 a night to park and $13 a night to use the internet. Thus, the room quickly becomes $80 a night. The location is ok but would have preferred something closer to the 405 and without a horrendous parking garage with spaces so small you could literally park and not be able to open your doors. I don't know who designed parking garages in the 70s and 80s but this is one of the worst. Check-in was relatively fast and friendly. Got a great room overlooking the airport on the 13th floor so I could watch the planes land and take off...wonderful view! If you don't like some plane noise I'd advise against a room here but it didn't bother me at all. Once you closed the curtains you couldn't hear it as much. Oh...and those curtains! They almost completely black out the room! Best hotel curtains ever.... I woke up at 10:30am and thought it was the middle of the night...excellent if you want to sleep in! The shower was incredible in the recently remodeled bathroom. You could practically hear the reservoir draining which made me feel a bit guilty so I tried to cut them short but the pressur and flow was amazing...best hotel shower ever! Unfortunately they use Evelyn and Crabtree bath products so you can smell like your grandma all day long. The hotel is busy and there are several annoyances.... fees, getting to your car, etc. There is no fridge in the room, not even a mini-bar. My room seemed pretty fresh and clean and maid service was good. Would hesitate to stay here again given all the fees.

What destroyed the experience was the check in process. I arrived at 9:30 PM on a Friday night and the line to check in went from the front desk almost out the front door in the lobby. If you have been to this Hilton, you know the length of the lobby is a good distance. The line was 1 hour long to check in. The automated check in kiosks kept bombing out and would not let me check in. The front desk was simply way understaffed and overworked. For the weary traveler, this just made the entire experience all the more unmemorable and left an incredibly bad impression. Due to the fact that the vast majority of the reservations are made in advanced and the hotel is aware of how many people need to check in on a given day, the Hilton LAX management should have been on top of this issue. While we are on the complaint wagon - a general warning. You do not want a room anywhere near the eleveators. I was the second room over and I heard the elevator cars running all night long. If you work in a mine shaft and enjoy the background noise, you may be ok. Otherwise insist on being in a room away from the eleveators. One other thing to note on this property - this is not a deal killer, but if you experience the aforementioned hassle, parking is not cheap. The parking garage is extremely tight and is $20 for self park and the garage clearance is only 5' 8\". You may not use the airport parking rates as they impose a minimum stay and of course if you move your car, it voids the rate. Hilton and its private equity owner, Blackstone, need to realize the branding and service is all they have to win over the business and casual traveler.

We were offered the option of pre-paying for their breakfast buffet at $15 (inclusive of tax). Apparently, by pre-paying we saved over the regular price. Overall, we liked the breakfast. The servers, however, were not attentive and I'd rate their overall restaurant customer service as poor. My wife and I used the gym (located on the lower level). It was well-appointed and up to standard for this type of hotel.

It was a good decision. First off, the shuttle to and from the airport is free, runs 24 hours, takes all of 5-10 minutes and was an absolute breeze. It's also located close to most of the car rental spots, so renting and returning a car was easy (hotel self-parking is $18/day). All the staff I encountered were friendly and attentive, and a couple service requests were taken care of seemlessly. There is a fitness center and it's free, although I didn't use it. Also, I didn't eat at any of the restaurants. The rooms (at about $110/nt) were clean and of good enough size, even if a tad bit dated. For my purposes it was perfect. I wasn't in LA to hang out in the hotel, and the city is not for walking so to me, since I was driving, it didn't matter where I was staying. The 405 freeway is right down the street, so getting around was pretty easy (notwithstanding the LA traffic). The only potential downside to me is that if your room is facing the airport (and mine was) you will hear some noise from airplanes taking off, but it didn't wake me up so I didn't consider it a big deal but I am a fairly heavy sleeper. On the whole, LA is a monster, so the ease of access to LAX made the airport location really ideal. And the value for the money was really good. Just stay here and drive to and from everywhere you want to go. And when it's time to leave, that'll be a breeze.

I\u2019ve stayed here many, many times in the past as this is my airlines\u2019 designated \u201ccrew\u201d hotel at LAX for short stays- and this stay was yet another one-night LAX layover. I really like this hotel. For starters the lobby is large and expansive and inviting... Not a typical hotel-lobby... Even the driveway leading to the front doors are grand-- and very large and quite busy... The main lobby is tastefully done in light taupe colors; very relaxing and cool in feeling; a nice change from the heat and humidity of the LA basin... Check-in was swift as always\u2014as an airline employee our rooms are pre-paid and pre-assigned, and check-in is always hassle-free. My room was fitted with a standard sized king bed\u2014complete with down-filled comforter, cover sheets and bolster pillows. The color palette is similar to that of the lobby\u2014natural light woods, light taupe and shades brown.. Most all rooms are also fitted for those who need to do a little business as well.. There is a full sized business desk, complete with multiple electrical outlets and good lighting. The TV was a remote flat screen with full range of domestic and selected foreign language programming. A small sitting chair and coffee table, as well as a personal sized coffee maker with complimentary supplies were a nice touch... The half-sized closet allowed me to hang some clothes and there was mini ironing board and iron inside. The bathroom was equipped with a standard tub/shower combination. Water runs hot with excellent water pressure. They stock a good range of complimentary pre and post-bath toiletries, along with a full sized anti-fog make-up mirror with an attached wall mounted hair dryer. My specific room was one floor above, and facing the outdoor swimming pool... Despite this location, you could not hear *anything*\u2014pool noise OR overhead low-flying aircraft, thru the double-thick glazed and tinted glass... One nice feature that I really liked was the floor length \u201cblackout\u201d drapes, that when closed render the room near pitch dark regardless of outside light conditions\u2014nice for people like me who have to catch a nap during the daytime. The hotel has three restaurants on property; a 24/7 bistro that serves small snack\u2014both hot and cold-- as well as a range of beverages.. There is also a traditional coffee shop-like venue and a more formal sit-down restaurant that serves primarily Italian fare. The hotel has a mini-exercise room, filled with workout machines, all in one windowless room\u2026 Good for a workout? Yes, but makes me a bit claustrophobic without a view outside\u2026 I do like the large outdoor pool which has several small 2-person tables where you can enjoy a poolside meal, snack or beverage.. Even the rooms just adjacent to the pool get very little, if any, discernible pool noise.. The sound insulation *is* that good! Since I don\u2019t have access to a car while here, I normally walk along West Century Blvd. to one of the local restaurants along this busy street. For a wider selection I can also very easily take a short taxi ride to any of the close-by shopping centers if I want something different or specific. LA really is a heaven for \u201cfoodies\u201d.. Overall, I really like this hotel.. Everyone on their staff treats their guests well and knows what a \u201croad warrior\u201d needs and expects from an airport hotel... You\u2019ll get a reliably clean room with a good bed and furnishings- everything functioning properly; nice in-house amenities and guest services.. While I would like to see a better selection of on-property dining options, the hotels\u2019 location makes walking (or a short taxi ride) to many area restaurants quite easy... I give this hotel very favorable rating and would recommend them without hesitation. ** PROS: This location knows what it takes to be an airport hotel and is constructed with that in mind. Excellent sound and light insulation make getting some decent rest very possible. Staff are always polite, willing to help and generally cheerful. ** CONS: Since it\u2019s close to the airport, there aren\u2019t as many options for casual dining or shopping that are within true walking distance. Not a very large selection of on-premises dining options.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cNickel-and-dimed\u201d", "Author": "Baggins42", "ReviewID": "UR52022780", "Content": "The service was fine, but the hotel itself fell way below my expectations from such a respectable establishment as Hilton. They were nickel-and-diming me all the way. 1. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty. 2. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made 1/8 cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it 8 times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea. 3. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so. 4. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another 1/10 of a cent. 5. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not 3 words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. 6. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending 10 minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you 150% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly. Summarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again.

We had two rooms with three people in each room. The special included a voucher for the \"buffet\" breakfast each morning. As it turns out, the \"special\" only includes breakfast for two people, and not three. We were never told this when we made the reservations, yet we clearly told them we had three people in the room. The buffer runs $21.95 per person and is not worth half that amount. The so called \"buffet\" is a glorified continental breakfast. When we made a comment to the desk clerk we were told \"Reservations is a different department.\" We also had a waitress attempt to charge us $20 in tip for a party of six at the same buffet. Luckily a register operator asked us if we were \"ok\" with the tip. We told her we had been told that it was included for parties of six or more. As it turns out, the tip was optional.

I recently booked my fifth or sixth stay with them and have only had problems with the foreign female front desk staff-they take delight in assuring you the hotel is full and only the third floor is available-Deborah even \"showed\" me the booking screen-as if to say \"see I am not lying to you\"...but she was---as proved only a few minutes later when miraculaouly another room was found after my protests regarding the third floor rooms assignment. She was quite patronizing in explaining that Hotwire clients do not receive the same priviledges as other guests...wow....what a high level of service from this major chain. In this economy it is hard to believe that any property is willing to treat guests with such disdain. I travel 50 weeks out of the year and even two star properties are more customer friendly. (I also stay at many four and five star properties) Is the Hilton doing so well that they can afford to leave their rooms empty? And by the way, the room I was given had one broken light and no tub plug...must have looked long and hard to find a room in need of repairs for this Hotwire client.

Sorry cant comment on pool,restaurants,business/fitness centers I didnt use these services... CHECK-OUT: Was nice and easy I did the Zip-Out which takes all but 1 minute. Just pick up the phone and leave a message telling them you're leaving and leave the keys in the room and thats it. SHUTTLE: Not a good experience at all. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a pick up...Then when leaving we told the driver what airline we were on but he drove pass it then stopped the shuttle about a mile away and me and my husband had to walk aways back to our airline terminal..with alot of luggage I might add.

This was for a two night stay on a Saturday and Sunday night (rate was fully pre-paid and non-refundable). The good: -Right next to the airport -Free shuttle service 24 hours a day -Beautiful lobby -Clean -Nice restaurants -24 hour bistro located in lobby for hot food, snacks, drinks, coffee -24 hour room service (menu is limited between 11PM and 6AM) -USA Today newspaper delivered to your door -Room service breakfast was very good, and delivered to my room 15 minutes after the call on a busy Monday morning The bad: -Right next to the airport (bring earplugs) -Look at my photos.....This was a very weird room with the smallest window in a hotel I've ever seen. How do you like the view? -The free shuttle service runs at random intervals. When you call the Hilton and ask about the shuttle service, you will be told that it runs \"every 20 to 25 minutes after the half hour\". This is absolutely false--do not rely on this. The shuttle service is not a Hilton shuttle. It is an LAX shuttle, and many of these mini blue buses serve most of the hotels and motels around the airport. When you catch your bus curbside outside of baggage claim, many of these buses will drive by---you need to look for the bus with the bright orange digital display that says, \"HILTON LAX FOUR POINTS LAX\". This bus stops at both the Hilton and the Four Points by Sheraton around the corner. -When the bus drops you off at the hotel, be prepared to stand in line to check in. Everyone on the bus is doing the same thing you are---checking in. If there are 25 people on the bus, then there will be 25 people in line. (My advice if you don't mind spending a few extra bucks is to skip the free shuttle and instead pay a taxi 10 bucks to take you to the hotel. Same thing for returning to LAX because the shuttle bus shows up \"when it gets there\"---there is no set schedule). -If you are flying on Virgin America Airlines, you can not print your boarding pass from the kiosk in the hotel lobby. For some reason, they do not have this airline in the system yet even though VA has been in service for over a year. -In order to understand my strange room, you need to picture how the hotel is built. Imagine a big \"plus\" sign, and this is the hotel. On each floor, there are four rooms (on at each corner) in the middle where the \"plus\" sign meets. All four of these rooms (on each floor) will be small and have the weird window as shown in my picture. My room number was 1042, so make sure you ask when you check-in if they are putting you in one of these rooms. I asked the clerk at check-in for an \"airport view\" so that I could watch the planes takeoff and land. He said \"no problem\"---and look where he put me! What a joke. I might try this hotel again, because it was clean and the service was good. The downstairs coffee shop was good also, and they have both a breakfast buffet and a dinner buffet. The steakhouse is only open Monday through Friday (to my disappointment). Housekeeping also did a great job. Besides the strange window and the horrible view, my last gripe would be the bathroom. Take a look at the picture and you will see that not only is it small, but the wallpaper is peeling and there are black mold spots throughout. It is a very old bathroom, with a water knob like I have never seen before.

First Stay: I flew into LAX on a Thursday morning and arrived at the Hilton at around 10:00 in the morning. I thought $17 for self-parking was a little expensive (I thought it was more like $12 when I made the reservation), although this does allow in & out privileges. They allowed me to check in at mid-morning with no problem, gave me a room on the 13th floor in the south wing of the building facing west (above the pool). During the day I was a little concerned about aircraft noise, but it was not a problem at night. I could hear the departures, but it was not overly loud and did not keep me awake. The room was pretty standard for a full service Hilton. The exercise facilities were free and very nice. The facility is open 24 hours, and had a large selection of new equipment. As at many full-service hotels, there was a charge for internet access. The business center was undergoing renovation, so was closed while I was there. Because I'm an HHonors Diamond VIP member, I was given access to the executive lounge. During the afternoon they had coffee, soft drinks, and a few muffins available. It was nice to have someplace to sit quietly and get something to drink. In the evening they had a couple of hot dishes, cheese & crackers, etc. available. Alcoholic drinks were also available, but were not free as they are in some hotels. Later in the evening cookies were available. At breakfast, there were no pre-made hot items, but there was a good selection of fruit, muffins, danish, cereal, toast, bagels, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, etc. Checkout was quick and easy. Overall this was a good stay. Second Stay: I returned with my wife a couple of nights later. Since we were flying out early the next morning, we planned to drop off the rental car later that evening and take the hotel shuttle back to the airport in the morning. I didn't want to pay $17 to park for a couple of hours (or even $6 to park for the 1 hour minimum), so I attempted to pull into the hotel entryway to unload the bags and check in, then park on the street until dropping the car off. Most of the entryway is blocked off with orange cones so you can't pull over. I pulled over where there was room (and where they told me to pull over), but in the 2 minutes it took to get most of our bags into the front door, they were already complaining about my car being there. I parked the car out on 98th Street (there are a few 2-hour spaces on the street behind the hotel) and carried the rest of our belongings from the car back around to the lobby. It is absurd that you can't park for 10 stinking minutes to check into the hotel without paying a $6 parking fee. Either let people park in the entryway for a few minutes to check in, or allow guests to park in the garage for 30 minutes for free to check in. If you have a car with you and don't need to park it there, I'd recommend choosing another hotel. This time we were given a room on the 11th floor, still above the pool, but in the west wing facing south. The carpet and wallpaper in the hallway looked really grimy. I seemed as though if I took a wet towel and rubbed it across the wall it would come out black (I didn't actually try it, but that's what it looked like). I felt like I was in a budget motel that hadn't been renovated in 30 years. In the room, the beds were the new Hilton beds (which are comfortable), but the other furniture was badly worn, and packing tape was holding up the wallpaper. One of the water glasses had never been replaced, and there were no bottles of water in the room (all HHonors members are supposed to get water, to say nothing of their top-tier members). Although this room was only around the corner from the previous one, aircraft noise was much worse. The loud booming of departing aircraft woke me up about 5 times during the night. Apparently the south-facing rooms catch a lot more noise than the west-facing rooms. Because this was a weekend, the executive lounge was closed. Instead they gave us vouchers for a free appetizer in the evening and continental breakfast in the morning from the hotel restaurant. The appetizer choices were chicken wings or a quesadilla. I had the quesadilla, which was quite good. We left before breakfast the next morning. The shuttle van back to the airport worked well. It runs every 15-20 minutes 24 hours per day. It stopped at one other hotel to pick up passengers, but only stops at terminals where someone needs to get off. Even though we stopped at most terminals, the trip was still pretty quick (less than 15 minutes).

Registration was fine, and the staff was polite. However, the hotel was packed--it is, after all, a conference hotel. Being sold out is not a problem if the elevators were working properly. Three out of the six elevators were not working for over three days. On the second day, the hotel had to place guards at the elevator entrances to prevent riots. Getting to one's room took a very long time. In addition, after paying premium prices for a room, the room was small with very low ceilings and an antique television.

I've had very good stays in the past but this one was lacking as far as rooms go. The first room I was given was on the Executive Floor. It was tucked in a corner, near the elevator(contrary to the what I always ask for) with a very small window on the side wall of the room. It seemed that this room was almost an \"afterthought.\" I went down to the front desk and very politely asked for a different room. The woman who helped me was very nice. Due to the hotel being very full, she offerred and I accepted a slightly smaller room on the 4th floor. This room had another very limited view but this time it was of what appeared to be a courtyard between the towers. It was again very close to the elevators which I don't like and they were doing construction on the tower I was in. The floor was covered in plastic and they'd laid plywood over it. Everytime someone walked by it was noisy. I didn't hear any construction noise but this set-up was \"low-rent.\" The room looked ok on the surface but after being in it for awhile I noticed some deficiencies......it was very humid and the room never did cool down to my preferred comfortable sleeping temperature. The TV needed to be repaired or replaced - - the sound was awful. The shower in both the original room and my second and final room needed to be cleaned or have the caulk replaced. One suggestion I have for the hotel if their representatives read this is to reconsider the placement of the small table they have which holds the coffee pot and ice bucket. The placement of it is in the direct line you make from the bed or desk to the bathroom. I ran into at least twice. Finally, despite my displeasure with the room situation, the staff at that hotel is wonderful. The bartenders are great! One of them very kindly gave me a book he'd finished reading. The breakfast room service delivery gentleman was polite and kind as he'd been for my previous stays. The staff that work the front desks are alway pleasant and do their best to be accommodating.

First, when I went to shower the night I checked in a large, nasty clump of hair floated up from the drain. I took it down to the front desk the next morning and they handled the situation, but it wasn't an auspicious start to my stay. The second thing that happened is that I got food poisoning four days into my stay and spent a day vomiting (among other things). Since I had only eaten one meal anywhere other than the hotel (and that three days before), my belief is that the illness was caused by the hotel's food. Again, the hotel staff tried to make things right, and if my stay hadn't ended so badly, I'd actually be writing a positive review. The worst problem I had was that they got my rate wrong (to the tune of $350). I had originally booked at a rate of $209, but called the hotel a month and a half before my stay to change it to a rate of $139 that was available because of the purpose of my trip. When I explained this at check-out, I received the worst customer service experience I've ever had at a hotel. The front desk manager on duty was surly and unresponsive, despite my opening the conversation with a smile and cheerful \"good morning\", she never cracked a smile. Well, when I angrily asked her \"Is this how you want a guest to leave your hotel?\", she did shrug and smirk a bit. Ultimately, she refused to adjust the rate and I had to catch a plane. I faxed a complaint to the hotel the next week and spoke to someone who actually seemed responsive. He asked me \"What can we do to make it up to you?\" and I thought he'd correct the issue, but, ultimately, he too refused to adjust the rate, despite it being the hotel's screw-up to begin with. The \"explanations\" I received had to do with policies and the computer \"not letting\" the rate be changed. If this is truly the case, I question why Hilton employs human beings at all, since they're either unable or unwilling to exercise judgement and discretion. Their actions are, frankly, nonsensical, since I estimate they'll lose over $7000 in business from me and my colleagues over the next year. This is neither good customer service nor good business.

Everyone had claimed their luggage and was waiting for the shuttles before any showed up. Actually we waited and waited and waited and waited. After over a half hour another shuttle driver for a different hotel took pity on us and dropped us at the Hilton. Then there was the check in. There only appeared to be two people ahead of me in line so I thought it would go smoothly. Over an hour later I was checked in.

I spent one night at the Hilton LAX Airport. In comparison to most airport hotels, this Hilton is a real Gem. Walking into the lobby is the first sign that this is a well maintained Hilton with lots of Marble and a roomy inviting lobby. Check in was smooth and easy for both myself as a Hilton Diamond member as well as my coworker and customers who did not hold any status. I would recommend this hotel, it rivals any Hilton on the US I have stayed at. (This was a welcome change after a few nights at a very unacceptable Doubletree in Torrance) I stay at many hotels during work travel, and not many hotels get glowing reviews from me like this. The elevators were quick and plentiful. My room was of adequate size and given I was on the top floor, I was very pleased that there was no disturbing noise from overhead aircraft, nor from any rooms around me. The room was very clean and appeared to have been updated rather recently. The room had both feather and standard pillows, a comfortable bed, small sitting area, and a nice sized work desk. The bathroom was not huge, but had plenty of room for toiletries and other necessities. Of course the view was nothing to speak of, but it is near the airport. The hotel has a rather nice gym that rivals any that I have stayed at (other than resort / spas of course). There are about 5 treadmills, 5 elliptical, and 3 bicycles, all with individual TV screens. There is also a nice area with weight machines, free weights, etc. The only negative of the gym is that there most cell phones will not work there. The hotel also has an acceptable outdoor pool and 4 hot tubs. Though I did not partake, I understand that the hotel has an affiliation with a bus that provides free transportation to Manhattan beach if you are looking to get away from the hotel for short while. They also have a Hertz rental car location on site, if you want to rent or return your car to save a few dollars on parking or an extra days rental. The business center is rather small, and the charges are high, but copiers, faxes, internet access, printers, and computers are available for a fee. I did not try to use the high speed internet access, as I have my own broadband card. The hotel has 24 hour room service, and a nice selection of dining options. They have a more upscale Italian dining room, a bar / casual dining, and a 24 hour bistro / coffee shop. Airport shuttle service runs about every 15 minutes 24 hours per day. Though I did not take the shuttle from the airport, the shuttle to the airport was prompt and efficient. If you stay on the executive floors or are a Hilton Gold or Diamond member, the hotel has a very nice hospitality lounge, and it is in a controlled access room so that it is not overrun by guests who should not be there. The lounge has a nice breakfast in the morning with standard continental and one hot item, evening hospitality with two hot items, cheeses, fruits, etc. They also have a two hour window with very nice desserts available. They also have non alcoholic beverages as well as bar service. All items are complimentary with the exception of alcohol. The hospitality suite has a nice view of the runway if you are interested in watching the planes take off.", "Date": "October 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hove, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood quality airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "SussexUKTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR8723742", "Content": "We stayed in the Hilton LAX on August 26th.

With one teeny-weeny window, the rest of the room looked like a basement ... low ceilings and lots of wall. Oddly, at the very end of the bowling alley ... err, room ... was an itsy-bitsy bathroom. But, after having kicked off my shoes and heading to said loo, I found the carpet to be absolutely soaked. \"Yikes!\" I thought ... and pushed out any thoughts of potential liquid substances that could be on the floor. I called to explain and was transferred three (1, 2, 3!) times, explaining my story each time. Finally, the third gentleman apologized and said he would move me to the club floor if I would go back to the front desk and get my new key. I did that, but upon reaching the front desk was told that a bellman had just been sent up to my 4th floor room with my new key to take me and my bags to the 12th floor. That's impressive ... but I wish I had been told that in the first place. So, they issued me new keys there and off I went to push button \"12\" in the elevator. Upon exiting the elevator on floor 12, I met a bellman. He looked at me, I looked at him. This knowing exchange could mean only one thing: he was the one sent to move me in the first place. We exchanged info and, indeed, it was he. But he had been sent to another room on floor 4, which he told me was occupied by a China Airlines flight crew who knew nothing of moving to floor 12. \"A\" for effort ... but the devil is always in the details, Hilton. The room itself, like that of the fourth floor room, was fine. It's a 3-star airport hotel, so my expectations were not overly raised to begin with. The furniture is d-a-t-e-d! The bed is quite comfy looking and modern-ish in a hotel bed-esque sort of way. It was a mismatch to the otherwise plain and cheap other furniture in the room. The bath, too, was dated. Plastic countertops and a cheesy showerhead didn't make, or ruin, my day. It should be noted that this hotel's lobby is drippy elegant for an airport hotel. Lots o' marble here. Hmmm ... I think they should have put some of that marble in the guest room bathrooms. Overall, it is what it is. The LAX Hilton isn't anything I'm itching to get back to or anything I would necessarily avoid in the future.", "Date": "August 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottesville, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay at this Big Airport Hotel\u201d", "Author": "caneshockey31", "ReviewID": "UR8505631", "Content": "Well, when i arrived via the airport shuttle i walked into the large front entrance/lobby area.

I needed a hotel near LAX for a Sat night for easy get together with friends traveling elsewhere at same time as me as we all passed through LAX. and being joined by locals. Booked through Hilton site (after comparing rates at obitz, etc.) $140. One king bed, non-smoke. Hotel was nearly full, most others nearby were sold-out. Didn't do priceline/hotwire as I wanted location right by airport and those sites' close-by hotels are in 1-5 mile radius so includes Manhattan Beach 15 minute+ drive further which would have made schedules too tight with friends. positives: Desk said in phone call that shuttle from airport only comes by every 20-25min. But it came as promised, my wait was only 10min. Check-in was quick, very friendly and helfpul. It was a crowded time, but there were four or more working desk, so went quickly. I needed to 4pm check-out and had been warned by phone reservations that would likely be a $99 charge for anything after 1pm check out. (Standard check-out is noon.) However, at check-in I was able to get 4pm check out for $25 charge. Biggest positive: Room was cleaner, more attractive, more comfortable, more plush than I'd expected. Linens and mattress, in particular, were excellent , visually and pleasing to the touch -- really wonderful. Comfortable furniture, including a great high-back swivel leather desk chair. Robes in closet. Better compimentary toiletries than usual for this price room. nice view of runways. 15th floor. I think because I had Hilton Honors membership (their frequent traveler program I barely remember signing up for, but desk staff found my membership), I was given room on one of a few floors served by a guest lounge on the 16th. Lounge nicely appointed, complimentary continental breakfast was typical but sufficient, fresh fruit was good. I didn't get back there again, but apparently snacks and tourist tips offered there all day, warm cookies provided at night before 11pm closing. Good exercise room on lower floor, below ground level registration level. Lots of machines, a number of treadmills w tvs, etc. 24-hour snack/pizza/deli shop on registration level. Room service expensive but not overly, just like every other nice hotel. Appealing lobby area, comfortable furniture, marble and fine art, la bit of a luxury hotel feeling. mixed: pool had bonus of four hot tubs seating four each , one at each corner of pool. Pool was clean and lots of chairs, towels provided. Pool was on 3rd floor sheltered from wind. However sheltered from wind also meant no sun on pool until sun is just about directly overhead. So I'd guess pool in sun only from 11:30am to about 2:30pm. (For some that could be a plus.) To get some sun for a few minutes at 11am I sat in an outdoor chair in another patio on same floor as pool,. That area was kind of empty and was not that inviting. Negatives: Online access, hard-wire or wireless, costs $10/day. Maybe that kind of charge made sense a few years ago, but with every cheap hotel offering free wireless now, Hilton should offer this free as well. No refrigerator/mini-bar in room. (But used ice bucket provided and ice-machine at elevators to chill water. Also, two free waters provided.) Not much in the neighborhood. Not a resort, just a travelers lay-over hotel. Next door/walking distance: Carl's Jr fast-food, open late. Next to that: Nude female dancers/sextoys and porn shop. parking is additional cost, underground-covered self-park: $14/day for hotel guests. more for valet. Friends visiting: $5 first hour, $10 second hour. after 2 hours: $14/day. More for valet. interestingly: In the block past Carl'sJr/Nude dancing is Parking Spot business charging $17/day for covered self-park for LAX travelers.

Our rooms were fantastic - huge big beds, ultra white bedding, soo clean! \"One of the best nights sleeps I've ever had\" was the comment from all of us! (just dont wear false tan!! my Mother-in-Law had tanned herself before we departed the UK and left her mark on the white bedding!! hehe!!) The common areas were beautiful - all marble!! We were staying here before we went on a cruise the next day, and 3 coach loads of us arrived from LAX and the hotel had every door key ready for us and we had to wait a max of 5 mins to get our door key!! The porters were great bringing our cases to our rooms, and again the next day they collected all our cases and had them arranged in one of the fantastic ballrooms for our departure. One of the couples in our party accidentally left her duty free cigarettes in the room, and only realised when we got to San Pedro!! One of our reps rang the hotel and the cigarettes were located and brought to the dock within an hour!! now thats what I call good service! We ate at the hotel for dinner and then breakfast the next morning - again very pleased with everything. Before we headed off to San Pedro we had a morning free and decided to head off to explore a bit of Santa Monica - the doormen were most helpful in getting us taxis, they even arranged to get us a special taxi to accommodate my mother-in-laws scooter!! On our return trip, our cruise line had arranged for us to use the facilities at the hilton before we headed off to LAX for our flight. When we arrived they had a beautiful buffet of hot and cold food waiting for us. Outstanding!!!

I was given a small room facing north on the 9th floor... view of rooftops. The only reason I didn't lose my mind entirely was that it was one of the renovated rooms, so the beds were comfortable. Still smoldering from the being ignored experience, and the lack of an upgrade, I instructed the night supervisor to have the GM call me in the morning. He indicated that he would pass that message along. I did not hold out much hope. At 11:30, however, I went downstairs and asked for the manager (by name), and was presented with an assistant. To his credit, he was polite and affable, he offered a discount and/or lunch. As a frequent traveller, however, I don't want something for nothing - I want sharp, crisp service. I declined, and told him to have the manager call me. He indicated that he would. Hope springs eternal, so I was of the considered opinion that it may happen. At 3:00, it was time to check out - and no phone call. No way to contact the assistant either. He was in a meeting. I left a message on his voicemail, and returned home. The epilogue here is that the manager called me the next day and made a number of excuses for why things were the way they were - and again offered a discount. Now, I may be an anomale, but I stay in upscale hotels for the amenities, not to complain, then have the rate reduced.

As a Hilton Diamond member (their top level), you'd think I'd be treated like royalty - think again. My last trip found me on a lower floor, my room key wouldn't work to get me into the executive lounge and they didn't even provide the complimentary bottled water they promise to Diamond members. I asked at the front desk if they could send up the water and after about 10 minutes of whispering in the back room (what on earth could they be talking about?) they promised they would send it up while I was out to dinner - but of course no such luck. I even double checked to make sure they had my Hilton number on the reservation. They had handed me card when I checked in with the Service Manager's name and email address so I sent her an email asking her about these and a few other problems. Admittedly, these were fairly minor problems but when you spend 100 nights a year in a Hilton you do expect to be treated better. I got back a form letter with a promise of a better response from the \"department heads\" but it's been several weeks with no response. They are doing a remodel of the rooms - thank God - the old ones were very very dark and you could not read to save your life. I used to have to go into the bathroom to read anything the bulbs were so dim. The remodeled ones are nicer with upgraded bedding but are still very average in size. Location is very close to LAX but of course so are about 20 other hotels. The noise from the planes seem to be much worse here- I don't know if the construction or if small differences in location around the airport make that much difference but it's always very noisy here.

The tub was discolored in many places but was covered in non stick film to hide it. It was so gross my wife wouldn't take a shower.

Mind you, I was fully prepared to give this hotel a horrid rating based on all the reviews I've read on the net. But surprisingly, I had a very good stay! I checked in at the Hilton Honors desk (blue card). The clerk was quite nice and didn't give me any priceline attitude. She gave me a room on the 10th floor. The hallways looked great from the recent renovations. Even so, I braced myself for the room itself. Pleasant surprise! The room was decorated in a sage/khaki/cream motif. The carpets were new and clean. The beds were lofty, piled high with a thick mattress, down comforter and 4 pillows per bed. There was an executive desk and chair, another chair by the window, coffee maker and a 25\" or so Phillips television. The bed was so comfortable, I didn't want to wake up in the morning. There was definitely noise from the planes at LAX, but it wasn't intolerable. The bathroom was clean but small. Neutrogena products available. Water pressure was fine. The shower had a large dial control, which I think would be easy to manage for people with limited use of their hands. The fitness center is temporarily located 1 floor below the lobby (it will be on the 3rd floor when it's finished). It's open 24 hours. Pretty good equipment. Video terminals on every cardio machine (bring your own earphones). The front desk accomodated me for a late check out. All in all, I can't complain one bit about this stay. Granted, I might have lucked out with a great room because of the Honors card or because I checked in at 9:45pm when the crappy rooms were gone.
