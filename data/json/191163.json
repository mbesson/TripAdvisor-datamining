{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Awesome stay! Stayed at the J and J for three nights in mid August. Awesome stay. Had a room with a king size bed overlooking a small court yard. Only three rooms had access to the court yard which was great. Absolutely beautiful stay, breakfast was decent but not the best but it is included in the price so why bother complain. Only down side was the noisy air conditioner in the room, constant humming got to be very annoying after a few hours. Washrooms are tight quarters and they should really have a soap dish in there not to have to leave the soap on the ground.Reception staff was quite nice and spoke english fluently. Would stay and recommend this hotel to others. Awesome local restaurant at the corner of the street called La Pentola dell'oro!", "Date": "Aug 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR917229381", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MarieMontreal"}, {"Content": "fairly nice boutique hotel       balcony", "Date": "Aug 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR680489570", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "patsydog"}, {"Content": "Some Kind of Wonderful Make no mistake, the J and J is a hidden gem of a hotel. Location-wise, it's perfectly placed within walking distance of the main sights, but far enough away to give you a feeling of serenity when you're walking back down its quiet side street (Via Mezzo) at the end of a busy day. A former 16th century monastery, it retains enough original architectural and decorative features to give you at least a flavour of a serene monastic retreat, and the little courtyard is simply gorgeous. If you want a romantic retreat (like my Partner and I), and are brave enough to ditch the predictable comforts of the Hiltons and Marriots of this world, you should definitely check this hotel out. It seems as if many of the previous polarised reviews (either extremely good or extremely bad) were given on this basis - i.e. that the JJ doesn't live up to it's 4* status. If it's that kind of predictable luxury you're after, don't even consider this hotel. But in our opinion, it's the many differences and quirks it offers that makes it so charming. It's also in a really cool, slightly-studenty area, with many great eating establishments within easy walking distance. The area is also very 'non-touristy', so learn a few words of Italian, and try your best to mix with the locals. My only grumbles about the place are that the breakfast buffet is adequate rather than impressive, and the bar bills are outrageous (6 euros for a coke?!), but you live and learn. As some of the other reviews pointed out, the rooms really differ in style and location within the hotel. Rooms 1 and 2 are right on the communal courtyard, so if you're shy, it's probably best to avoid these! We had a superior double, and it was lovely. It felt like a private apartment rather than a hotel room.

A very spacious and beautifully decorated jr suite, wonderfully quiet although in the heart of the city, was our airconditioned luxury home for one hot week in August. It was a delight to wake up for the generous breakfast buffet in the morning. The elegant and timeless interior of J and J is perfectly matched with a subtle modern touch such as a discrete plasma screen tv in the room, and a very inviting mosaic bathroom. The friendliness, professionalism and absolute customer dedication of the staff is normally only found in global five star hotels. Nevertheless, the little J and J has managed to keep their hotel atmosphere very homely and informal, which is just right when you are on a holiday.

So, we put in our credit card information and also, all the contact information necessary to contact us while in Italy and thought we had a place to stay. And if the hotel were to have difficulties, they would be so kind as to inform us before we even arrive or to have then to provide an alternative at the same rate and at least same standard, as --- customer service have defended this hotel.Check it out yourself: Is the Hotel Monna Lisa, really the same rate or same rating as Hotel J and J in Florence, Italy?And if we were given the opportunity to book another place or the Monna Lisa Hotel ourselves, it would have been at least, $44 less per day.Aside from this price difference, we did confront the Hotel J and J front desk about being charged for a four-star hotel and being put in a three-star hotel. They ignored us. Even with cc correspondence from traveleurope, they still ignored us. In fact, in that evening, after we had checked in at the Monna Lisa, the guy at the front desk of Hotel J and J, tried to look for our reservation and we didn't even show in their computers in the messed up room that they needed to fix. They lied and they pocketed the money.We will never book this hotel regardless of how pretty it looks. We have been lied to and cheated by this management.In fact, next time, we will rather stay and pay the correct rate at the Monna Lisa Hotel because it was very, very quite and had a very nice courtyard.

I was somewhat nervous about staying here due to the paucity of reviews available, but was drawn in by the website and my pre-booking contact (via e-mail) with the staff. We had such a wonderful experience with the hotel and every person with whom we dealt (especially Deepak - he deserves a raise!). The JJ is located on a quiet street, yet close to pretty much everything. We were able to walk virtually everywhere in Florence that we wanted to go. We were a group of 7, and had 3 rooms, all double deluxe. We found our rooms to be reasonably sized and loved the updated bathrooms. The only tiniest bit of a complaint about our rooms would be the somewhat dim lighting in the bathroom. Not a big deal. The common areas were a great place for us to meet and relax while enjoying a bottle of wine. The only other tiniest bit of a complaint is that there were only 2 red wine options available at the bar and we exhausted both options the first night. Wanting to try something different, we returned from shopping the next day with a couple of other wine options. We were not permitted to drink them in the common areas. Since the wine selection is so limited, perhaps charging a corking fee (which we would gladly have paid) for guests wishing to consume other wines would be a way to deal with this issue? Perhaps there is some sort of restriction that prohibits this, who knows. The hotel staff was warm, welcoming, and always courteous and friendly. No matter who was on staff, we always received recommendations for restaurants and activities that were consistent with our requests. They took care of museum tickets in advance for us. They also recommended a driver to us who carted us around to various locations. She was a delight, as well. All in all, I would definitely stay at the JJ again, and would recommend it to anyone considering going to Florence. Having said that, I believe I know which room the person complaining about the hotel was referring to - the one on the courtyard. It does not look like an ideal place for privacy, but insist on a room not on the courtyard, and you should be fine. The JJ is, in my opinion, a hidden gem and a delightful place to relax in Florence.", "Date": "Jun 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR664747140", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Don't accept Room 1 The communal areas of this hotel are as in the website pictures - very attractively decorated and furnished. The service is friendly and the general location is good. However, we were allocated Room 1 which was not a room whose pictures appear on the website. The bedroom is on a Mezzanine balcony within the room which has the attraction of being unsual but is accessed by a very narrow stone spiral stairway which is definitely not to be negotiated after a bottle of Chianti. The TV is upstairs in the bedroom rather than downstairs in the sitting area. But the biggest problem is that this ground floor room looks out on to the communal courtyard and the breakfast room. This means that it is impossible to open the curtains because of privacy and hence the room gets no natural light. Despite all this it has the space of a Junior Suite and is therefore priced on this basis. I know we should have asked to move as soon as we arrived but we were tired after the journey and there was nothing so bad as to render the room uninhabitable. It was just that it was nothing like the other rooms shown on the web and as such it was a big disappointment.

We had an awful experience with this hotel, and ended up switching hotels shortly after our arrival in Florence. Prior to travelling to Italy, I sent an email to the hotel to confirm our reservation, the type of room we had reserved, and the rate. I received a reply email back, and being excited for the trip, I visited their website again to view pictures of the room. However, I noticed that room we had booked was listed for a lower price during the same dates we were staying. I then emailed the hotel and asked if they would honor the lower rate advertised on their website. They replied back saying that the rate listed was for a different room, but for the same price as the double deluxe room they would upgrade us to a junior suite. I was absolutely delighted! When we reached Florence, however, our delight turned to horror. We were shown our room, which was extremely small (even by European standards), had shabby, run-down furniture, had a dirty bathroom, and looked like a bat cave (nothing like the website). We obviously were not upgraded, so we went back to the front desk to inquire about what happened. I showed the woman working at the front desk the printout of the email I received, and she merely shrugged and made a motion with her hands to tear it up. She informed us that she had sold the suite and that we would not receive the upgrade.To say that we were furious that an offer in writing wasn't honored was an understatement, and we couldn't believe how unprofessionally we were treated by the woman at the front desk. She even went into our file and accused us of making up the email, as she couldn't find it (and she was the one that wrote it!).After much arguing with the front desk, another person working at the hotel (who was very nice and professional) offered to move us to the suite (which wasn't sold after all?!?). By that time, however, we were so upset (in tears) by the initial treatment we received and the hotel's failure to honor their offer that we contacted another hotel (which ended up being wonderful!) and moved.
