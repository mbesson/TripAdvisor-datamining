Front door is really just a doorway in a narrow back street. At reception we were greeted by the owner. We had 4 bags and we are not young by any means. We were given our room key and instructed how to get to the 3rd floor. Firstly take a lift to the first floor with your luggage (no help offered or forthcoming) Then exit that lift and proceed to an elevator circa 1920s for the third floor. The probl;em with the cage lift is it is not large enough to take luggage and people. Eventually we made it to our room. Clean recent refurbishment. However,later, on inspecting the bar fridge, we noticed that the contents, water only was not cold. Further inspection revealed that the fridge had no wiring. On enquirng re the fridge, we were advised that it is a water storage cupboard. The next person on reception indicated that if we required tea or coffeee he would prepare it for us in the bar, adjacent to the restaurant. Later when we did ask he indicated that it would not be possible? The room itself whilst clean and tidy measured only 3.3 X 3.4 plus bathroom and a useless narrow hallway leading into the room. We attempted to use the internet at the hotel, however, the owner had great difficulty in the concept. Several other guests attempted to assist however, the keyboards are so old that the letters have been worn away. One of the better experiences at the hotel were the breakfasts, very good food and service. Towards the end of our stay i inadvertently caught the \"cage\" lift to the ground floor against instructions. I found myself in another hotel entry with an entirely different street entry.

The hotel is situated on Via Magenta just less than 5 mins walk from Termini station and approx. 50mins from Fiumicino airport (for international flights), which is convenient especially if your arrival is late at night. Getting there Take the Leonardo Express from Fiumicino to Termini for 11 Euro per person (30mins) or take the regional train from Fiumicino to Ostiense and change to metro (Piramide) to get to Termini for 6.5 Euro altogether. This takes 50mins, but it's very well signposted and easy to find your way to get to Rome city centre. The regional trains run more often than Leonardo express which comes at every 30 mins. When you arrive at Termini, you need to train right at the exit and cross the car parks and a main street to get to Piazza della Indipendenza. Via Magenta is on the first street to your right. On arrival On arrival, we were greeted by an old Italian man at the reception desk. You will need to show your passport and fill in the necessary paperwork to check-in. The old man proceeded to tell us in good, but rather fast(!) english about all the best places to visit in Rome, what to avoid and recommended places to eat. It was rather amusing to follow, but it makes for a nice welcome! He'd also gives you a city map of Rome that marks out all the main attractions to see in Rome. Our room We were given a twin bed room on the first-floor, which easily slept four. The rooms have been recently refurbished and looks quite modern. It has a large ensuite bathroom with a basin, two toilets (normal for Europe) and a shower. You'd get given towels - these are quite thin and seems a bit like tablecloths, so you may find it is not sufficient for your use if you are used to using soft and thicker towels. We'd also found that where you stand in the shower it was a bit blocked, leaving you standing in a puddle whilst having a shower so the plumbing system is not so good. The room had a TV (all Italian channels) and a fridge cabinet underneath. You'd get given free bottles of complimentary mineral water. There was a walk-in wardrobe in our room where a safe was also available. There was a telephone to call the receptionist and acted as an alarm if you requested the reception to wake you up at a certain time. It also has the usual dressing table and a small dining table. There was air-conditioning in the room, but it is centrally operated and you needed to ask the receptionist to switch it on. The air conitioning when it was on made the room quite comfortable to sleep in - not too hot or cold, but you do need to get use to the noise at first. The view There's not much to look at outside. Our room faced the street, which was surprisingly quiet despite being near to the main hub of the city. Each morning we got woken up by the sound of church bells, but I think this is inevitable as Rome is full of churches! Breakfast The breakfast room is on the first floor past the lounge area. The breakfast bar was small, but it consisted of a continental buffet of cheese, ham slices, pastries, bread, yoghurt, selection of cereals, juices and fruit - pretty basic, but enough to fill you up with a full stomach until lunchtime. The staff were very friendly and brought you tea or coffee. You would need to get there at least half an hour before the breakfast finishes at 10am (opens 7am), because otherwise you'd might find that there's not much choice of breakfast left. Getting around As mentioned before, the hotel is conveniently located near Termini train station, which is also the main bus station that serves the city centre and surrounding areas. It is also relatively within easy walking distance to the main sights in Rome (that's located in the North East section or Colosseum and the Roman Forum. For example, it takes approx 20mins to walk to the Colosseum. It costs 1 Eur for a ticket lasting 75 mins to travel on any metro or bus routes. Local eatery There are lots of eating places around the hotel because it is situated near to Termini. Invariably if you eat at the station (mainly fast food, including McDonald's) it is a little more expensive. The receptionist recommended Florian's Cafe, which is located on Piazza della Indipendenza just round the corner from the hotel. We went there on two nights and enjoyed the meals. You can get a pasta and secondi, plus water, for two for 25-30 Euro. Local amenities Apart from those just mentioned, there's a BNL Paribas bank on Via Cavour that takes Visa cards and you could withdraw money. Most of the shops are in Termini and you could get an international telephone card from the Tobacconist stores. Checking out We'd just handed our key card at the reception desk (you'd also need to do this everything you leave i.e. go out of the hotel; even if you are just stepping outside to buy something! And pick it back up when you go back). You could leave your luggage in a small room, which is locked, if you still have a bit more of a day to spend in Rome before catching your flight. Overall impression We'd enjoyed our stay immensely and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind forgoing a bit of luxury, and just want a comfortable and convenient place to stay, whilst on a budget.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "essex", "Title": "\u201cPerfect base for seeing rome\u201d", "Author": "teacherstravelling", "ReviewID": "UR38699232", "Content": "This hotel is a perfect base for seeing the sights of rome.

Not too much more expensive and well worth it. There is a fantastic little pizzeria just off Via Nazionale opposite the Forum area on the left hand side as you walk up the road. Its in a little alleyway and is cheap but excellent food. Spend most evenings around the Fonatana di Trevi area - just breathtaking and sooo buzzing with activity. Best tip for food is to go to the main piazza or place you want to be and then just walk out on one of the roads and turn a corner - that's where the best restaurants (populated by locals rather than just tourists) actually are.

Our taxi pick-up was waiting, as arranged with our names on a board, and we were transferred to our hotel, the Giorgi. As we were checking in it became apparent that things had now gone incredibly wrong. The night receptionist, who was very helpful in informing us about places to go and things to see, told us that we had been booked in to two single rooms. We told him that we had booked a double room (why would a married couple celebrating Valentines Day in Rome want single rooms?) He told us that he could not supply us with a double room that evening and we would have to spend Valentines night in single rooms. He would sort it out in the morning. We went tour rooms which were 16m apart and began carrying clothes from room to room because we had only taken one suitcase. We awoke very early the next morning and asked about changing to a double room for the remainder of our stay. We were told it would be impossible to change rooms because the hotel was full. We would be able to change for our 3rd night. We telephoned Expedia, who promised to follow the matter up straight away and telephone back. They did not sort out the problem, nor did they phone back. On our third day we again asked to change rooms. The reception chap again said it was impossible because the hotel was full. My wife lost her temper at this, explained that our luggage had not been unpacked for three days because we were waiting for a room swap. At this point, and probably because of all of the broken promises, the receptionist said that he would give us a double room. He gave us the keys to a room that had just been vacated and told us we could move our case into the room. The room was lovely but the incompetence of the receptionists at the Georgi Hotel had spoilt our break. Rome is incredible.

If you check out the hotel on Expedia, you will see that the Hotel advertises things such as Climate Control, High Speed Internet, and Bathrobes. The front desk controlled the air-conditioning.
