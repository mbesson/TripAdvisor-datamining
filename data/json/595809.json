{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good basic hotel Stayed here Feb 22 and 23. Searching the web, it was hard to find reasonable accommodation in Sydney that weekend for less than $200 a night. Eventually, I found this hotel on Tripdavisor. It was not in the area I wanted to stay, but at $140 per night the price was right. Phone contact was very postive and the speedy confirmation by email was reassuring. Subsequent experience of the check-in staff was very positive, efficient and friendly. The room itself was good, but not luxurious. However, it was very clean and the furniture was good, new and functional. The room had obviously been refurbished recently. The bed was comfortable and the bedding crispy clean! As commented by others, the bathroom was small, but fully functional. There was no aircon, but there was a ceiling fan. The room opened onto the back of the building and it was quiet enough to sleep with the windows open. I noticed a bit of loud partying in the rooms at the front, so when booking it might be worthwhile to enquire where your room will actually be. Sydney districts seem to change names every few streets, so whereas the hotel might technically be in Potts Point, it was effectively Kings Cross.", "Date": "Feb 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR174892849", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Chaucer"}, {"Content": "Worth a try Good points; Obviously recently renovated and to a high standard. Our double room was really comfy with a fridge, big tv and nice clean bathroom. The kitchen was well equipped. Bad points; The wooden floor of our room was really dusty - they obviously don't clean that bit. Similarly the floor of the ktichen was dirty and sticky (although the rest of it was clean) We were given fresh towels daily but our room was not serviced/cleaned during our week long stay. I would not recommend this place for people with kids as the walk between the metro and the hotel is through an incredibly seedy area. However I would generally recommend this place as I thought good outweighed bad and it was a reasonable price.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR374043498", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Lingheadcrumple"}, {"Content": "Decent Budge Hotel Springfield Lodge is a clean, well priced hotel situated in a quiet street close to Kings Cross and Woolloomooloo. While austere in its furnishings it has all the basic requirements you would expect of a budget hotel (minus an ironing board in room, but there is one in the laundry downstairs). Guest rooms are located on three levels one of which is a basement level that it would be best to avoid if possible as it is stuffy and unappealing. Avoid checking in late at night as the key is left in a safety deposit box that is very difficult to open and close.The staff were friendly and polite :)Pack your own tea towel and face washer if you require them as they are not provided.This is a good hotel for people who will be spending most of their time out and about as it provides only the basic facilities. If you are looking for cheap accommodation close to the action in Sydney then Springfield Lodge is a good option. A friend who was staying in another place nearby ended up relocating to Springfield Lodge after she had a look at my room, which was much cleaner than hers. I have stayed at Springfield Lodge twice while on business trips and would stay there again.", "Date": "Nov 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR380737959", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Pleso"}, {"Content": "Just a hop skip and a spring away from skanky kings cross We arrived in Sydney on the plane, late Saturday night when the Robbie Concert was on. This meant that all hotels were booked up or charging the fees of \u62e2500 dollars a night. However when we went on the internet at the airport hotels.com had this room for $100 a night. We snapped it up, only to find that when we rang them up (it was 11 oclock Sat night) they had shut the front desk down and didnt actually have any rooms. They could have very easily fobbed us off but they said the caretaker would wait for us and give us a key to a room that they did have, luckily. When we stayed there the hotel was really in the middle of being renovated and i suspect the room we were given had never actually been used before. It was in the attic really stuck in the corner, the stairs to get up to the attic were really thin. But needless to say it was a perfectly adequate room. Anyway, the room is small and had the smallest bathroom you could ever imagine but it was really clean, it had wooden floors (which i prefer as its much cleaner) and if you stood on your tip toes(we are both short) you can see the bridge. It had a fridge and kettle and a tv that worked. I suspect though that having a view was a perk of this room and the majority of other rooms dont have this. Having stayed in some similar priced hotels over the past couple of months, im beginning to understand whats important in a room to us and whats not, and cleanliness certainly is a priority which this does. A tv that works with a remote is also our 2nd priority :-) and a kettle is 3rd. I would certainly recommend this. Especially as staying in a double room with no bathroom in a hostel around the corner is about \u62e2100 dollars cheaper for the week. I would much prefer this lodge and sometimes you can even forget you are staying in the not so nice area of Kings Cross.", "Date": "Jan 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR716468720", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Poppy12"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d595809-r13823929-Springfield_Lodge-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "595809", "Price": "$47"}}
