Positives - the room was quite large by European standards, and was clean and well-appointed. The front-desk staff was kind and helpful, if a bit too pushy when recommending a car service immediately upon our arrivel (which turned out to be a nightmare, actually, but we won't discredit the hotel for that). The hotel does have a lovely rooftop terrace to enjoy a bit of calm and relaxation after a busy Rome day. And, of course, the location is superb - right at the top of the Spanish Steps, it couldn't be beat in that part of the city. Negatives - Though the web site, and the front desk staff, claimed our room had a view of the Spanish Steps, this was lacking. We could really only see the side of the steps, and our tiny balcony wasn't large enough for two to really even stand on. But, the rooftop terrace made up for that. Breakfast was ok, but somewhat underwhelming when compared to the others we experienced while in Italy. In our specific room, the shower head was broken, and it appears it had been for some time (there was a putty-like substance what was supposed to hold the head to the fixture, but it didn't work at all - the shower head lay on the bathtub floor for our entire stay!). And, we felt that the price was quite high at 270 euros for what we actually got. You really are paying just for the location. Overall, the positives and negatives really balanced out for us.

I did a lot of research before my trip, and the reasons I chose this hotel were for the reasonable rates (especially for Rome and most especially for its location), the location, and the fact that it had a roof garden. I was really pleased with every aspect of the hotel and would highly recommend it. First of all, being there nine days, I met all the desk staff and without exception, they were all friendly, responsive and extremely helpful. A large breakfast is included in the rate, and even though it may be called continental, it had a lot more than continental breakfasts usually do: yogurt, breads, croissants, cheeses, meats, eggs, cereal, etc. You can have the breakfast in the dining room or in the lovely roof garden, which has a beautiful view over Rome, including St. Peter's. The roof garden is a great place to escape at night or even during the day to get some peace and quiet from the craziness that is Rome. While the area outside the hotel is crazy busy, once you're inside and especially in your room, it is very quiet. There is no reason to spend a ton of money for a \"better known\" hotel. How long do you spend in your room anyway? The Scalinata is charming, small (18 rooms), clean and comfortable. Here is a tip: The hotel is at the top of the Spanish Steps, but a secret is that there is an entrance to the metro at the top, as well. There is an elevator that will take you down all the way to the street level, and of course you can take the elevator from the street level to the top as well, so you don't ever need to climb the steps if you don't want to.

Rooms were very clean, mini-bar with space, plenty of closet space, CNN, safe-deposit box, extra blankets, comfortable beds, hair dryer, adjustable height shower in the bath, big towels, amenities(shampoo, soap, shower cap, q-tips), dry cleaning. Fabio and everyone who worked there was so very friendly, we were made to feel welcome. Fabio is a wealth of information regarding restaurants, buying tickets for soccer matches, the easiest way to get to X, and will even arrange for airport transfers if you need them. He always responded to our e-mails promptly, he responded immediately when we were arriving(checking-in) late and worried our reservations would be cancelled. There's a PC in the TV room off the lobby free for the guests to use, and free Wifi in the rooms as well. The breakfasts were amazing! Every morning we had delicious(!) hot scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, and bacon, freshly cut fruit, a choice of cereals, ham, raw ham, salami, cheese, fruit yoghurts, granola bars, and best of all, the hotel has a bakery so we were treated to still hot from the oven cornettos(croissants), filled with jams, compote, chocolate, or plain vanilla cornettos covered with powdered sugar! We enjoyed using the fancy electronic espresso/coffee machine to make our own cappucinos(the Signora will cheerfully make your first cup and show you how it works), teas, and hot chocolates, there was blood orange juice, pineapple juice and milk available too. No matter how tired we were from traipsing around the cobblestoned streets of Rome the day before, we were rewarded with the sweet smell of bread being baked each morning. The breakfast room upstairs had lots of light and a beautiful terrace. The location is very central you can walk to most sights, take the Metro, or the bus(the Republica bus stop is about five min. away on foot). Half the buses don't have maps or stops listed inside the bus so if you can get a hold of a bus map, do so. Unless you are driving to church, the taxis will take advantage of you so it really is important to be located centrally in Rome. There are always taxis present in front of the hotel(waiting for the Hotel Hassler guests) so if you do need a taxi no worries.

I can't think of a good comment for the concierge at Hotel Scalinata di Spagna.... They are all very unprofessional! The welcome at the hotel is enough to give you the worst impressions: there is no porter! We had to carry our own lugagge as the concierge, a man called Lorenzzo, was to busy talking on his cell phone. The room he gave us was small, but clean and bright. We unpacked our things and after 10-15 minutes the concierge knocked at our door saying that he may have another bigger room at the same price (Why didn't he show the big rooms in the beginning?! Maybe it's just a scam to fish for tips?!). We checked out the room and we decided to move to the new one. As we we walking towards the new room (Lorenzzo this time helped with the lugagge), I apologized for making a little chaos in our first little room and gave Lorenzzo 5 euros to give the girls that cleans the room. He said it wasn't necessary (but he had already put the money in his pocket) as he personally would have cleaned the room. We arrived at our room, the concierge placed the lugagge on the bed and than he started talking about these wonderful city guides he knows, that he can organize; he had the best restaurants already booked for us etc. DO NOT follow anyone of his advices! Although i have a lot of experience in the field I fell for his \"kind advices\". He kept talking and talking and wouldn't leave our room.... insisting that he gave us a better room, a superior and he saved us 90 euros etc. We had to give him 20 euros to make him leave the room. The guide he recommended practically knew less stuff on the Sistine Chapel than myself and charged us 180 euros! The restaurant he recommended \"robbed\" us for 290 euros for a bottle of wine, coke, pasta and meat. Please, do not use their offers! Find you own guide (the next day we took the Green Line buses...it was cheap and perfect), go to the known restaurants from Frommers guide book or other, use a taxi instead of the limo service (it's a lie ...there is no limo it's just a 4 year old Mercedes). Tha taxi has a fixed price of 40 euros from the airport to the centre of Rome, use the taxi..you save almost 50%. After 3o min in our second bigger room, on our way out of the hotel, we saw a young woman was cleaning our old small room, not Lorenzzo as he said when he took the 5 euro bill. The next day we asked the maid if Lorenzzo gave her something from us and she confirmed my suspicions: he didn't give her our tip and he didn't even clean the room as he promised. The other concierge are pretty much the same: there is one that talks 24/7 and smokes like a chuchu train... , the night shift concierge is a young guy with no tie and a very wrinkled shirt . Breakfast is quite nice maybe a little poor, the view from the terrace is great and the girls who serve it are quite lovely. The same girls clean the rooms also. If you want to tip someone, tip directly that person...there is no guarantee that the concierge will give the person you wanted your gift. We left a detailed letter for the owner (unfortunately we left it to Lorenzzo ) describing all our problems, wrote all our numbers and emails, but no one wrote back! Probably Lorenzzo never passed the letter to the administrator.

We booked directly with the hotel website (some friends of ours had already been there). When we arrived there we were given a nice room.

Everything seemed to proceed well in the beginning: the staff was helpful, but not professional (the guy at the reception never stops talking about his life (who cares?!)), the lobby is small, but very chic, they had free WIFI in the lobby and room(that's cool), breakfast was rich and the girls who served it were very helpful and friendly. The last days we had some ugly surprises: we went on the terrace garden to have our usual quiet breakfast and found all tha tables full of plates and nobody was there to clean them. This happened around 10 am. We waited for 15 minutes and nobody showed up, except other hotel guests. We went to the concierge to refer to him the problem and after 5 minutes a young man (the waitress had probably the day off) showed up and said that he would come on the terrace right away. After other 5 minutes he came up and cleared 1 table. We wanted to eat our usual eggs, cappuccino and croissants...but surprise: the eggs were burned down, there was no bread, the cappuccino was brought to us after 12 minutes(other guests kept coming for breakfast on the small terrace (only 4 tables) and they formed a big queue in the hall and the breakfast room). There were no more croissants, either. There was only some fruit and cereal to eat. We got back to the concierge explained to him that this treatment is unacceptable, waiting all this time for breakfast compromised our tour at the Vatican and told him that we wanted to leave earlier to go to another hotel. At this time another surprise: the concierge (the guy that talks a lot about himself) threatened to charge us for the remaining period. We left right away! I do not know yet if they charged my card, but i will definetely fight this. Other things: the hotel is clean, has the best position, but the staff has zero hotel skills.(not all of them: the concierge in the evening is very polite, helpful and funny, the waitress and the cleaning girl are too) ...

The Hotel Scalinata di Spagna is very clean & comfortable, the staff goes out of their way to accommodate any special requests, and the location is amazing. Also, I found the wireless internet to be a plus. Like others have noted, the concierge is able to point you to great restaurants that are filled with locals (not only tourists). True, there is no restaurant or grand lobby, but who needs that when fine shops and restaurants are only a staircase away? I will definitely stay at this hotel again largely due to its charm, location, and service, and will freely recommend it to friends.

The hotel arranged a car to pick us up at the airport and when we arrived (we had arrived very early ) they offered us breakfast on a wonderful terrace (Saint Peter's church can be seen from the terrace) and and took care of the luggage while we began our sightseeing tour. The rooms are decorated in a classic style, the whole hotel has an interesting classic tone. The persons that work there are very kind and helpful. They gave us precious advice on the restaurants and museums. At the end of our journey we were very satisfied by the friendly atmosphere of this hotel.

Upon arriving at the small and dark hotel, located next to a hot dog stand at the top of the Spanish steps!, we were shown into our room on the ground floor(not what i had requested!). It is more of a youth hostel type of one star room. It was extremely small, the bathroom had not been properply cleaned, the bedding was stained, the carpet filthy - absolutely shocking. We walked out and pointed out the problem to man at the desk, who didn't care. This is absolutely not a four star hotel and i am so surprised that is it recommened in guide books. If you are looking for small, dark, old fashioned, tired and a really depressing hotel, then this is for you.
