Overall it was a pleasant experience, the building has a certain level of charm. We booked a 'your way get away weekend package' which included a $200 gift certificate.and upgraded to a suite .The accomodation was very good and staff helpful and courteous.TV viewing in the lounge part of the suite not the best with seating off to the sides of the TV. Good for reading though. We had beautful walks along the Humber River .If you are looking for more things to do then this area will not cut it. But we really did enjoy the peace and solitude. We ate in the Old Mill restaurant - free continental breakfast was just right. We chose the Terrace in the dining room - not a big fan of live music for an eating environment!.I think if we were staying longer than the two days - the choices on the dinner menu could have been a challenge. What we had was very tasty and well presented.For our anniversary dinner the dining room manager had placed unlabelled flowers on our table (Previously arranged by our daughter). It was a complete surprise to us - in fact when we sat down we asked our server if we were at the wrong table. The manager came over and explained. One hitch with the dinner which ultimately worked out fine - I asked questions on the two pasta dishes on the menu and ended up being served the one I had not ordered. Our server was most apologetic and wanted to bring me the other one - but with my wife sitting there waiting to start her meal I declined. The pasta dish was delicious so all was well. We had planned to have the Sunday brunch with family members to celebrate our anniversary and we tried to reserve a table to guarantee seating only to be told reservations only for a minimum of 8. The dining room desk staff told us not to worry seating would be no problem for early March. I had some concerns with this approach, so when we went for our anniversary dinner I spoke with the Dining Room Manager and explained the situation and that we were staying at the Inn. He arranged a reserved table for us. If he had not done so my plan B was to book for 8 and not use the spare seating - should not have to do this. It worked out fine. It was so busy next day we would not have gotten a table.This review could have been totally different - alls well that ends well. Overall rating then - very good. It is far from cheap. I did not mention parking - a construction site is part of the parking lot!!! We went by bus and subway to avoid any issues. Old Mill are expanding I think so when it is complete parking could be a real challenge. For those coming along this summer there could be real issues - dont know where all the construction materials and traffic will fit. I guess we will find out at our daughter's wedding in Oct. 2012.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOld World ambience with mod cons\u201d", "Author": "Typenut", "ReviewID": "UR126426749", "Content": "There's a reason why the Old Mill Inn is rated so highly in the list of hotels in Toronto -- it promises the \"Wow Factor\" and delivers it with elegance. My wife and I decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary with an overnight stay featuring the Old Mill's \"Romance Package\" and were impressed from check in to check out -- and with everything in between. Let's start with the check in: we asked for early check in and were advised to phone about availability on the morning we were to arrive. First pleasant surprise: we called at about 10am and were told, \"Come in anytime -- your room is ready!\" We live just outside Toronto and were able to check in by noon. Regular check in is, like most hotels, 4:00pm. An immediate four hour bonus! We also obtained a late check out to 1:00pm and thus had a 25 hour stay -- unlike the usual, short 20 hour \"day.\" Unlike many hotels, parking is free with check in. Second pleasant surprise: when we asked if an upgrade was possible we were advised, \"We've already upgraded you to a Luxury King Suite.\" And what an upgrade. The suite consisted of a large bedroom with super comfy bed and a view of the Humber River; a delightful sitting room with fireplace; a large, separate dining room with huge windows on three sides and seating for six; plus an elegant bathroom with two-person whirlpool tub, twin sinks, and a very modern glassed-in shower. Soft, easy-listening jazz was playing throughout the suite, and there were good sized (though rather out-of-date) TVs in both bedroom and sitting room. The Romance Package included a bottle of chilled Chardonnay, some delicious chocolate, and a supply of bubble bath for the Jacuzzi. The minibar was very well stocked and didn't seem quite as exorbitantly priced as some hotels. And there is an in-room safe. In the evening we had an excellent dinner in the hotel's dining room. This is classic dinner-dancing and usually features big band music. For a change of pace after dinner we walked along the hall to the Home Smith Bar where the superb jazz singer Heather Bambrick and her trio was playing. Altogether a wonderful and memorable evening. (Ask the bartender for a Royale Martini -- a delightful blend of vodka, champagne, and cassis.) The next morning we enjoyed a complimentary Continental breakfast in the bright and airy Terrace Room. A good variety of breads and pastries, fruit, sliced meats, smoked salmon, cereals, yogurts, and juices. And of course the obligatory bottomless cups of fresh-brewed coffee. After breakfast we enjoyed a walk through the hotel gardens and beside the river. The Old Mill is very supportive of jazz in Toronto and features top musicians at the weekend and many nights of the week. Check the hotel's Entertainment Calendar on their website. They also have a strong tie-in with JazzFM91, Toronto's great jazz radio station. Kudos to the excellent management and staff at The Old Mill Inn. They are doing it right. We look forward to our next visit.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cYou will not be disappointed, top class hotel\u201d", "Author": "Bijoux12", "ReviewID": "UR126424502", "Content": "We purchased a voucher for our stay at the old mill through jaunt, we weren't sure what to expect- would be treated differently because we got such a cheap rate? but when we arrived, we were treated so exceptionally well.

Previous reviews made us apprehensive, but the location is close to my sisters house and we had to stay close. On previous visits, we typically stayed at the Four Seasons in Yorkville or a similar hotel. The Old Mill will be our first choice for all future trips. Loved it here. Our room was unbelievable. Gorgeous. The restaurant and bar were great to have. I had the continental breakfast daily that is included in the room stay. My husband had an omelette on two mornings. That was the nicest looking plate. No complaints. If u can, have Sunday brunch here. The seafood station was quite a surprise, especially the fresh lobsters. For dessert we fell in love with the bread pudding and chocolate mousse. We also had lunch here on Monday. Did not expect as extensive a lunch as we had on Sunday, but boy was I wrong. There were even more choices. The only dinner we had was a late one where we opted to skip another buffet and instead ate a small meal in the bar area. Nice. By the fireplace. The grounds are beautiful here, even in March. The location is a good one, with a subway stop close by. Toronto has a great transportation system. The hotel concierge was quite helpful when we asked for weekend entertainment options. The front desk looked after our every need including our luggage. Wish we had stayed here on previous trips. Will b back.

We arrived in the afternoon for a couples massage, which was a great experience, and had afternoon tea in the restaurant. Tea was good, but quite expensive (>$60 for 2), considering the amount of food. We ordered room service for dinner and breakfast. Having seen great reviews for the restaurant, we had high expectations for the food, and were extremely disappointed. My wife had chicken fingers and fries - the fries were soggy, and chicken fingers were clearly frozen from a box. I had the butter chicken - chicken was dry, sauce watery. Dessert was mediocre at best. We ordered room service again for breakfast. Not as bad as dinner, but nothing special. Overall we spent over $700 for 1 night, 3 meals and a massage. The only part of the stay we truly felt was worth the money was the massage. When asked at checkout about the stay, we mentioned our issues, and were told to fill out a comment card.

As a VIP member of Ontario's Finest Inns & Spas, I said \"I know just the place\" From the moment I made contact with Brad at the front desk, who was very pleasant & efficient, I knew I was in for something special. Our suite was probably the nicest suite I have ever stayed in and unfortunately, for any future visits, The Old Mill has set the standard to which I will compare. Everything was impeccably clean, tasteful, sumptuous linens, and a bathroom of my dreams. The bottle of wine and note welcoming us was a nice touch. We had a casual dinner at the Home Smith Lounge and met some nice people. They had a jazz ensemble playing live music (jazz is my favourite) which was awesome. To be quite honest, I didn't want to go home. We will definitely be back, perhaps in the fall. I imagine the autumn colours are beautiful in the Humber Valley. The proximity to the Bloor subway is perfect to scoot downtown, and with free parking at the Inn, this is a \"no brainer\".

It was a 'babymoon' for us (I was 6 months pregnant) and also my 30th birthday. The room we had was very nice, with a king-sized bed, whirlpool tub and a view... of the subway station. Ah well. The Wag Jag had also come with a voucher for dinner, and we chose to eat in the piano bar, as opposed to the main restaurant, which they said was busier, and thus louder. The menu was interesting, with a number of twists on pub food (grilled cheese with brie, etc). My husband and I enjoyed dinner, but when the entertainment started (jazz combo) we found it to be a little loud and moved into the back room where we could hear ourselves talk. The next day I had a massage in the spa, which was great! They even had someone who did pregnancy massages, which was especially worth it! While I had my massage, my husband explored the grounds and buildings at the Old Mill, and then he took me around afterwards. It was really neat to see all of the old-style buildings and rooms that have been restored to look like they would have a hundred or so years ago, and there were some neat garden areas that we also enjoyed... but... There were OVER 14 WEDDING-RELATED EVENTS GOING ON. Yes, 14. Everywhere we turned, there was another wedding party having photographs where we would have liked to wander, or take pictures, or hang out... When we explored the main building, almost every room was set up, or being set up for a wedding, bridal/baby shower, or other event. Which is fine, because we did choose to go on a weekend, but there really isn't anything else to do, or anywhere else to go if you're not part of a wedding. We were constantly turning around, trying to avoid being in someone else's wedding photos, and waiting our turn to take pictures in front of the fountain, etc. Don't get me wrong, the Old Mill is a great location in the middle of Toronto with some really picturesque spots, excellent staff and great rooms, but there really isn't much to do on site, and there's even less when they book 14 weddings on one weekend, to perhaps the detriment of the other paying guests.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Location": "3", "Value": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga, Canada", "Title": "\u201cneed to update furnitures , frames, carpet and pianos in the reception hall\u201d", "Author": "bravososa1812", "ReviewID": "UR124355195", "Content": "We have booked the old Mill for a wedding reception. we thought this could be a nice elegant venue .

We have been to dinners, weddings, showers etc before at this beautiful Inn but have never stayed there before. Our room was really lovely with classic decor, tray ceiling, crown moulding, built-in fireplace, and TV above, built-in drawers and desk. The bathroom is big with a large jacuzzi tub, separate large shower, vanity with sink and separate room with toilet, another sink and even a telephone. We were on the 4th floor and had a great view of the Ravine. I also like the fact that you can open the windows and get fresh air into the room. We had requested earlier check-in at 2:00 pm and our room was ready when we arrived. We went to the hotel bar for a drink and appetizer before heading off for our special function at 4 pm. The Bar was quiet but the Inn restaurant was really busy and packed with Christmas parties and other special celebrations - apparently Sundays are their busiest days around this time of year. The continental breakfast the next morning included everything you would expect along with goumet cheeses and fresh fruit. We really enjoyed our stay and definitely would come again The only draw-back is that there is construction going on across the street. They are building a condo and the street is messy and noisy during the day. There really isn't much around the Inn to walk to other than the park.

Unfortunately, our experience was ruined by our dinner in the dining room that night. I had made a reservation and our table was ready on time our server gave us a wine list, which we ordered from, we ordered our dinner and it was all downhill from there. I ordered the Halibut and my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 ordered a trio of meat dish. Timing was a little slow on the food but when it arrived I was surprised that when taking a bite of my halibut it burnt my mouth! It was way overcooked and upon return of the server (an older German man) when I told him about my fish he just kind of shrugged and walked away. Needless to say I did not enjoy my meal. When my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 cut into his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153medium rare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd steak he discovered it blue rare and could not eat it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discovered however at the same time as my fish. When we informed the server again about the steak he took it away and returned back to the table only to argue that it was the cut of meat and it was cooked properly. He could clearly tell we were not happy with our meals and asked the manger or Maitre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122D to come over. He only spoke to my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even acknowledge me which I found very rude, especially because I paid the bill! At the end of this awful experience we were offered dessert on the house (which we were not going to order anyway). To top it all off we were charged an $15 admission fee each which we also had no idea about. At this point we knew no one really cared so I paid the bill and we left.

We arrived at noon on a Saturday and since the check-in was at 4:00 p.m., we had our baggage stored by the hotel. The parking was across from the hotel and the cost was included in the price of the room. The room was large with a king-size bed and seating area. It had an electric fireplace and Sony TV. The bathroom had a Jacuzzi, a large glass shower, and sink. There was a sliding door to the toilet and second sink. There was a safe in the closet. We had dinner in the dining room and it was excellent. Both my partner and I ordered the prime rib and it was cooked to our specifications. The wine selection was excellent and so was the dessert. There was a singer and band for those who wished to listen or dance. There was a $15.00 per person cover charge for that. Our evening at the restaurant was fun and the band ended at 11:00 p.m. which was the perfect time for us. Most of the people in the dining room were 40 years old and up. Our continental breakfast was included in the price of the room. We like to start our day with a bowl of fresh fruit and they had that at the buffet. The fruit tasted fresh and there was a good variety of fruit in the fruit salad. The only two areas for improvement would be that on Saturday, there was only one working elevator as the second one had over-heated due to the hotel being filled to its capacity. The second improvement would be to use brighter light bulbs in the lamps on the night tables to assist in reading at night.

If you have the same experience I had they will wait until you have already checked out of the hotel to charge your credit card. My partner and I stayed at the hotel for four nights and were accused of smoking in our room and then charged $200.00 four days after we checked out of the hotel. When we first learned of the charge we had not checked out yet. We talked to the front desk at the hotel, (since there was no manager in the hotel on the day we checked out), and after some discussion we were told that the charge was not going to be put through on our credit card. We then checked out of the hotel thinking the situation had been resolved, boy was I in for a big surprise! Four days after checking out the charge appeared on my credit card. When I contacted the hotel manager I was told all kinds of things that were never disclosed to me when we checked out of the hotel. When I quizzed the manager on why I was not told any of this information when I checked out she really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an answer for me and just kept telling me she would use this experience as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feedback\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for her staff.

After finding out that they would not reverse the charges I filed a complaint with the BBB, they had two chances to respond to that complaint and did not file a response to either request.

My advice, if you have any problems while staying at this hotel make sure you get the resolution in writing from either the front desk or the manager.

The staff were all phenomenal, friendly and helpful. From the reception, through to the catering staff, no one could have been more pleasant. All made us feel as though they truly cared that we should have a great time and were willing to provide friendly directions if we appeared lost. We did not dine in the main restaurant, but had Speckled Trout in the Home Smith bar, primarily to hear the jazz trio since the main room had a 'tribute' style band. I'm sure that they were fine, but just not we were looking for on our Friday evening. The meal was very good, right sized with some very fresh veggies. The cheese tray as savoury to finish off was wonderful and, I thought, a great deal (not that we were looking for 'deals' here) artfully presented with lots of fresh bread slices and flatbread wedges. We booked a Deluxe King Room but were toured through the Luxury King Suite at our request, since we have booked this for our wedding. So nice was it that we decided to extend our stay on the wedding weekend in the suite. The only drawback (and to be sure there is nothing the Hotel can do about this) is that, given the topography and former use of the Hotel as a mill, this was not a pretty time to visit: some areas flooded, difficult to clean up the flotsum and jetsum and pointless to do so given the spring ebb and flow that is bound to occur from the river.

We booked the Old Mill because a family member was getting married there and although the price quoted seemed rather high, we thought it would be worth it to stay on-site of the wedding and wedding reception. Five other rooms were also booked by other family members and we were shocked to find out that we were quoted a price that was $100 more than what they were given for the same room. Of course, we called the hotel and only after a number of phone calls and emails, we too were given that rate but it was made clear to us that there would be no other bookings at that rate. My advice to brides--to avoid angry wedding guests, make sure that all guests will be given the same room rate. We also had another issue: early check-in and the availability of rooms. Because we were coming from out of town, we requested an early check in so we could get changed. We were told to call the day before so we did. That person said she had noted the request but couldn't guarantee anything but to call back on the day of the wedding at noon. We did that and were told that we wouldn't be able to get into our rooms early. So, we arrived at the Old Mill 2 hours before the wedding and sat in the lobby waiting for a room--they had told us they would call us when the room was ready. In the meantime while we were sitting in the lobby, other family members came and were able to check in. We kept waiting and eventually had to leave to go to the wedding (not looking our \"wedding best\"). Apparently rooms are pre-assigned and if your room is ready, then you can check in. If it is not, too bad. Okay, but for guests who are arriving from out of town for a wedding and wedding reception that is being held on site, wouldn't best practice be to check people in to rooms that are ready rather than making them wait for a specific room that might not be ready for hours? Again, brides, you might want to consider discussing this policy as out-of-town guests appreciate being able to freshen up before attending the wedding ceremony.

I felt like I was not being trusted. Hotel already had all of my credit card information, so I didn't get why that was necessary.

The problems really began when I suddenly got a violent case of food poisoning. Just to be clear - the food poisoning was NOT contracted from eating at their restaurant - we had eaten at another establishment. We called down to the front desk to ask if they could bring us something to relieve the nausea and/or pain. They explained that they did not sell any such items at the hotel and that policy forbade them from giving us any medications from someone's personal supply. Fine. The hotel is not really locted near any shops, so we asked if there was a nearby store that sold pharmacy items, but they were very unhelpful and said there was nowhere within walking distance. To make matters worse, room service was shut down for the night and they refused to even send up some tea to help settle my stomache. I'm not usually a demanding customer, but for $500 a night I felt like somebody could have jumped into a car and driven 5 minutes to pick something up, especially considering the fact that we had no car (we take public transit) and that they had absolutely nothing on hand to deal with an emergency that is not all that uncommon. My opinion was sealed the next morning though, when we went down for our free continental breakfast. Stale croissants and warm fruit salad, with a dismal selection of beverages. Not that I was eating yet anyway, but still. I did mention my complaints to the clerk at the front desk while we were checking out. He was sympathetic and courteous, but ultimately I received no apology, discount or special offer for a future stay, which I think is poor business practice, especially considering the amount we paid for the night.

The Inn is very beautiful and the suite we reserved for our two night stay was really stunning. We were both very pleasantly surprised by just how nice it was. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful and everyone we encountered seemed to be set on ensuring that we had a great experience. Our room was very clean and extremely well maintained. Housekeeping was attentive and able to work around our busy schedule on the day of the wedding. And when we discovered that the speaker knob that controls the music in the bathroom was broken maintenance came and fixed it right away. We were worried that the room might be loud because there are a lot of weddings there every weekend and they also have live bands at their restaurants, but the rooms are far enough away from everything that the noise was hardly noticeable. The catering staff did a fantastic job on our wedding and all of our guests were impressed with the venue and the food. We are still hearing raves about that weeks later. They have a chapel on-site so we were able to have the wedding there, the reception in a room just steps away and take the photos on the lovely grounds. Having it all in one place really helped make the day run smoothly. While we were there we visited the spa and were quite happy with the services we received. Everything ran on schedule and it was clean, quiet and very relaxing. It's a bit more expensive than some of the other spas I have visited, but that's to be expected with this sort of hotel. We ate at The Terrace restaurant one night of our stay and found that the food was really wonderful and the service excellent. The Terrace is a little less pricey then the other restaurant on site, but the quality is still high. The grounds are very pretty and this restaurant looks out on the patio and the fountains, which is nice. They have a continental breakfast buffet for guests in The Terrace each morning and it was very enjoyable. They have breads, cereals, fruit, yogurt etc. It's not a huge selection, but it was tasty and more than adequate. For a romantic getaway, a wedding or a honeymoon I would highly recommend The Old Mill. You definitely feel like you are escaping from the city with the beautiful surroundings and the lovely rooms.

The place has charm and character. The main dining room for dinner on Thursday, Friday and Saturday was accompanied by entertainment, music and dancing - very exuberant music and entertainment. If you want a quiet dinner this is not for you. We gave it a miss and went to the bar where they also serve meals. Unfortunately, on the same nights they had live jazz, advertised for Friday and Saturday but this week including Thursday. The jazz fans gave you stony stares if you tried to chat or laugh while the groups were playing. The evening food choice was therefore reduced to going out or ordering room service. We had one lunch in the dining room that was so bad on so many levels that they gave it to us for free. 'Wow'. And I might add we are the sort of people who rarely complain. We had a King room, not much of a view, but clean, pleasant and well serviced. It's not the sort of place we would stay again unless attending a wedding. As you might expect it's very busy, the corridors full of guests, flowers, aging aunts, drunken uncles, photographers, pipers and all that you might expect from multiple wedding celebrations.

The hotel provided bubble bath along with the usual shampoos, etc. Given that we were on the first floor in the dead of winter it was a bit chilly in the room, so I'd suggest bringing warm clothes when staying in January. When we turned up the heat the vents were a bit noisy. I have to mention that I love how the music from the cd player also gets played in the bathroom if you want it to. It was nice to be able to listen to tunes while soaking in the tub. Further note--if you want to hear the music you'll have to turn off the jacuzzi jets. The fact that it was so quiet in our room made us feel like we were miles away from the world. When booking there are various treats you can order and they'll put them in your room before you arrive. A nice way to surprise your spouse for his birthday! When you do arrive and have a look around, you'll receive a call asking how your room is. The service at this place is very professional and worth the price if you want to treat yourself to a cozy get-away. Oh, if you want to have a banquet here, I can vouch that this place is gorgeous.

Also a five-hour open bar was included, although we had to pay for an upgraded beer package for our guests who enjoy less common ales. There's ample free parking and coat-check service for $2/coat.

Music was provided by Raymond Gould, the organist, and it was lovely. The chapel at the Old Mill is beautiful by candelight, although a bit dark for photography, and since it's small (seating just about 100 people) it felt very cozy and intimate. The reception was held in the Garden Room, which has access to the photo-friendly grounds. The catering staff provided excellent French service for the meal and were very courteous. The food (what I managed to eat during all the excitement) was very good and our family and friends all raved about it.
