The check-in process was quick and easy (Michelle has the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen). We stayed here for three days. You can purchase theme park tickets here (much easier than the lines at the parks). The ticket prices are cheaper but not by much. We had a full kitchen with microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher, stove, coffee maker and most of the kitchen items you would need for meals. Minuses : The air conditioner will only go down to 70. The shower head in the master bathroom was terrible and clearly cheap, builder grade.

This 3 bedroom apartment also had the benefit of overlooking a small lake with fountain (309B) and was really quiet.

The beds were also of a high quality and really comfortable. All the rooms had good sized TVs (particularly in the lounge) and the staff we met throughout our week long visit were very helpful and pleasant and made our stay just that bit extra special. The pool was just fabulous. A great temperature and well designed to suit the more serious swimmer in one section as well as the kids water park area in another which seemed to keep everyone happy. The jacuzzi was very popular on occasion with good reason - great temperature and a really sociable size. The gym was well equipped. Judging by the range of guests from families to business men and women alike it is a venue that suits everyone. Located at the southern end of International Drive it is also great for access to all the Orlando attractions. Close to both Disney and Sea World and Aquatica and only about 15-20 minutes from Universal. The Premium Outlet located nearby and excellent supermarket complete the essentials.

We chose Floridays over a Disney hotel because of cost and room layout. We had a 3 bedroom suite for 4 adults and 2 kids. The layout was perfect, the room was very spacious. Similar size rooms at Disney cost well over $1200 per night, we paid less than $200 here. The convenience of staying on Disney property would have been great but not for the cost. The drive to Animal Kingdom took the longest- it was approximately 20 minutes. Magic Kingdom parking lot was 15 minutes, Epcot was 10 minutes- this doesn't take into account the time it takes to get from the parking lot to the entrance to the park which was another 20 minutes for Magic Kingdom. We were there during a non-peak week so we didn't have to wait in traffic lines so it may take longer depending on when you go. For the travel reasons, if we go back in a few years we will probably stay on property and give up the room conveniences of Floridays- but for this time with young children the hotel was perfect. If we go back to Orlando for SeaWorld or Universal I will definitely be staying at Floridays again. I recommend it to any parent who wants some space for the kids to play and wants their own bedroom.

Firstly this place is absolutely superb value for money. The apartments are two or three bedroomed with two bathrooms including a huge jacuzzi bath. Fully equipped Kitchen, washer & dryer, dining area, comfortable sofa & chairs, TV in every room and a balcony. Hair dryer in each bathroom too. Totally home from home comfort for the same price as you pay for a standard bedroom with just two double beds in it at the rip off Disney resort hotels. I've stayed in both the Dolphin and All Stars previously so speak from first hand experience. Hot tip from me, after a few days you're 'parked out' so to escape the over saturation of Disney etc it's an absolute haven to get away from it by NOT staying in a resort hotel with it down your throat 24/7. Even with young kids like mine (6 and 8) you do need to escape it after a few days - trust me on that, you'll thank me for it I assure you. Staying at Floridays be sure to ask for a room from the third floor upwards. The reason for this is becauseprice along on the ground floor apartments are completely closed in by a protective black screen which is claustrophobic. The second floor apartments all have a 4ft brick wall instead of railings on the balcony so when you're sat down you're staring at a solid wall - awful. Kids will also be standing on chairs to look over the wall, I've seen it - dangerous. From floor 3 upwards you have railings so you can sit down & enjoy the views of the lakes & watch the turtles bobbing about in the water etc. The bistro cafe is basic so don't expect anything other than fried junk - burgers, pizza, chicken wings etc. the Caesar salad is pleasant enough but this is not by any stretch of the imagination a restaurant like described on the website!!! It's a few chairs & tables inside a shop and a few outside on the patio by the bar. I emphasise not many, literally about six or seven tables, absured for the size of the resort, so get there very early. Lots of restaurants nearby though, some very nice ones on Vineland Avenue, literally the first right hand turn from the resort. Go out exploring, it's brilliant fun! There is a Bennihana restaurant within walking distance which is handy & quite good fun. If you haven't tried Teppanyaki style cooking then give it a go, it's fresh & enjoyable. If you want to be near the main pool and the bar/bistro then ask them for a room in either building A or B. but to be fair, it's not all that far to walk from the other buildings, just with the intense heat it feels a bit much that's all. Once you acclimatise it's nothing. You won't go wrong with this resort, it's excellent value for money. Smart, well maintained, clean. The staff are friendly & helpful and the best tip anyone can give you is buy your park tickets in the USA and absolutely NOT in advance in the UK despite all the sales blurb. We saved almost \u00a3400 buying them here & you can get great deals not only from the hotel concierge but from no end of shops along International Drive, don't let the travel agents in the UK rip you off. Booked this hotel through booking.com and delighted with their price, do some price comparisons and I'll wager you find their deal to be the best. With that and reading the comments left on trip advisor I booked this hotel well informed and we have not for one moment been disappointed. I strongly recommend this place.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cFloridays - loved it for what we needed\u201d", "Author": "KoolkatMichigan", "ReviewID": "UR128624048", "Content": "Our stay at Floridays was quite nice and more than expected for the price. Traveling with three adults and two children, the two bed, two bath was perfect. After reading reviews, I wanted to have a room in building B, 3rd floor or above. (close to the pool and have a view). We ended up in building B but on the 1st floor. We were facing the pond and actually enjoyed this room very much. No waiting for elevators, and only the first floor balconies are screened in which was great for bugs. People do walk past your room but we enjoyed listening to the conversations. We had a four and five year old traveling with us and the location in relation to the parks was perfect. The pool was heated and the girls loved the pool. We would go to the park in the a.m. and then head home for a few hours for naps and then go back to the park. We packed a little cooler to take to the park so we didn't buy hardly any food at the park. One day we took red bulls into the park (for the adults) and sooooo many people asked us where we bought them. They were disappointed to find out we brought them in ourselves. The hotel food at the palms cafe was a bit overpriced. $5.50 for a beer and I think $7.50 for a mango margarita. One night I had a blackened grouper sandwich and it was $12.50. We did order a pizza also and it was about $19 for a large. It was burnt and the cafe replaced it no problem. Since the rooms are more like a condo, shop at the publix for groceries. Don't forget the drinking water because we used our bottled water for the coffee and then wised up and bought a gallon of drinking water. I wasn't fond of the tap water. Be sure to buy or bring with you the kruger K cups if you drink coffee. They supply a few and offer them in the cafe to buy but it's cheaper just to bring them. All groceries are a little bit more expensive down there (compared to MI). bring some of your favorite dry goods if you can fit them in your bags. Also bring a few dishwasher cubes. They supply you with 1 dishwasher box of powder for one load. Again, this is just one more thing to bring that's no big deal and will save you from buying it at the publix. There aren't a lot of dishes in the condo so we ran the diswasher each day. There are little shampoos and soap there but they won't replace these once you run out. We will be going back to Floridays again for our next Disney trip; especially since we alternate days at the park with days at the pool. They do have pool towels so we didn't need to bring the towels that I packed. If you're having a pool day, get to the pool early if you're picky about your pool spot. We needed to be near the kids and those locations for beach chairs fill up. It wasn't too bad but I'm crazy organized so I staked our pool spots before 9am. We weren't at the pool until 11am. On the flipside, if someone had moved our stuff than that would have been fine. unless your sitting in the chair, all chairs are up for grabs, even it it's my chair I'm saving.

For this stay in April, we had 2 nights to make up before we moved to our regular condo resort. Due to the great reviews on TA, we decided to try this resort. I'm going to start out by saying, if you have not had any other experience staying in a condo resort in this area, Floridays would probably come off looking very good. But as I had the unique opportunity to stay at 2 resorts in one trip, I can make some quick comparisons. Location: This resort is on the south end of International Drive, but very cose to SeaWorld, Aquatica, and the Disney parks. You will likely be better off renting a car in this area, as there are not a lot of restaurants within walking distance. A Walgreens, and Publix is very close, and you could walk to these. The Premium Outlets are also only a few minutes away. Rooms: I found the rooms to be nice...just nice. The are relatively new, and the furniture is in good repair. We were 4 adults and 1 child in a 2 bedroom, and had plenty of room. The porch is not screened in, and you can only fit a few chairs on it. Now the down side...the beds were extremely uncomfortable, with what could only be called \"crinkly\" linens ! My son asked us to stop moving around in the bed at night as the linens made soo much nosie !! I was grateful that I only had 2 nights to spend on them. Grounds: Very nicley landscaped, but not a lot of \"lushness\" as was prsent in our next resort. Pools: The main pool was very nice, but I did think it looked larger in the pictures on line. There is a sand area for kids to play in, and towels were readily available in a hut by the pool. There is a second small pool at the rear of the resort, and it was very nice. Restaurant: Yikes...only eat here if you have lots of time ! Limited tables to eat at, and service is next to none. Smoking area is at the restaurant, and there were a few people puffing on cigars while people were eating. If that's not your thing, be aware. In all, the resort is very nice, and the price is right.

Our first visit, since the hotel we normally stay at was unavailable. Staff was very friendly and the location is convenient to local attractions - about a 10 minute drive to Disney World property. Our two room suite was fine for myself, my wife and 16 year old son, but the furniture seemed a bit crowded. We requested a room on the top floor and had no noise problems, despite the construction going on all around the property. So on the plus side, an adequate \u2018base of operations\u2019 for visiting the surrounding resorts. And the Publix supermarket right next door is very convenient for stocking the kitchen. There were a few negatives, however. First and foremost, the water. To be blunt, it smelled like it was pumped directly from a swamp. Borderline nauseating. We used bottled water for all drinking, and taking a shower was frustrating because the odor of the water competed with the soap. We left all looking forward to getting home and taking a shower where you came out smelling clean instead of musty. The appliances left something to be desired as well. The sink compactor jammed the first time we used it and stopped up the drain, though the maintenance staff fixed it while we were away at Disney. The electric stove burners were all warped, and pans were always wobbling when you cooked on them. We ran the dishwasher once, and saw that the soap was still sitting in a glob at the bottom when the cycle was done, so we hand-washed everything from there, using the machine as a glorified drying rack. Another thing is the odd \u2018service fee\u2019 you are charged daily for things like having your beds made and towels changed (the extent of room \u2018cleaning\u2019) . This fee does include Internet access, which most other suites charge extra for, so we did not mind. Still, it was a bit off-putting that additional cleaning (vacuuming, dusting and such I assume) is billable. And speaking of cleaning, when we arrived there were children\u2019s handprints and smears on the glass tables, and my son stepped on a splinter of broken glass on the carpet, after which we found a few more pieces of glass on the floor. So I assume they don\u2019t give the rooms a good cleaning between visitors, which we found unsettling.

We found the pool area to be a little on the small side, but perfectly adequate for the time spent there and my granddaughter loved the water play area. I think the other guests are correct about the sun lounger and chair criticism, as there is nowhere near enough for all potential guest that may turn up at the pool and I guess the management plan on that not happening.

Our son is 2, our daughter is now 4. Floridays offers many fabulous reasons to choose them for a Disney vacation, it would be impossible to highlight all of them. As someone who has traveled extensively in my career, I have become very choosy with my hotel selections. I was apprehensive about Floridays because it seemed like such a great value, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of everything from the room to the pool to the top-notch customer service. We stayed March 1-8. Room was very nice size, we had a 3 bedroom suite in building A. There was no view to speak of, but when you're in Disney doing parks all day or spending afternoons by the pool, I am not sure this matters. Rooms were nicely furnished, plenty of closet and drawer storage. The kitchen had granite counters and stainless appliances, and a KEURIG coffee maker (such a plus) Everything felt very clean and new, I found nothing that made me doubt the cleanliness of the hotel. Washer and Dryer were used almost every day, we were able to pack lightly because we knew we could wash our things. My only \"complaint\" was that the bathtub in the room was a jacuzzi whirlpool tub, which was very difficult to bathe the young ones. The 2nd bathroom only had a stall shower. But I wouldn't consider this to be a big downfall. The pool area was fantastic, the zero entry spray-ground was ideal for parents with wading toddlers. Having the outdoor cafe and bar with plenty of table seating was also a plus for families. Service took a while, but if you ordered ahead of time you could still enjoy the pool while you waited. Prices were not outrageous either. A game room and arcade, in addition to a RedBox video rental unit, were great too. Everyone I encountered on the property was fantastic---The Floridays staff seemed to enjoy their job, and would go out of their way to say hello or ask if you needed anything. We had two small maintenance issues in the room that were addressed within SECONDS. I've been to Hyatts and Four Seasons where it could take days. Location, location, location...the old cliche but totally true here. Less than 10 minutes to any of the parks we wanted to hit, which was fantastic. Just a five minute drive to Downtown Disney. Publix and walgreens are literally across the street. We ordered groceries to be delivered upon our arrival, but the convenience of having shopping nearby was great for the rest of the trip. All in all, I would recommend this property and will likely choose again if the price is right. I cannot understand why people spend the same amount or more on a Disney Property when all you get is 2 beds, a TV and a tiny room....at Floridays you are getting more for your money, and the drive to the parks was absolutely a non-issue for us.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evergreen Park, Illinois, United States", "Title": "\u201cSecond time here!\u201d", "Author": "Vickie B", "ReviewID": "UR127959292", "Content": "We love it here.

Very good resort to use as base to visit Orlando area. Reception and especially the concierge were very helpful with directions, tickets etc. We had 2 bed suite and it was perfect for our family of five. Daily Towel change and beds also made up daily. Full clean every week. All included in resort fee. Based on previous reviews I asked for block A or B but busy period and put in block C overlooking the lake and the swimming pool which we thought was much nicer. Only two minute walk to reception/ pool area. Tip - In any block try and avoid rooms overlooking car parks as can be relatively noisy at night. Construction work on new road nearby started 7.30am but did not bother us as we were up early anyway. When finished should improve access to the resort as existing entrance easy to miss at night. Only complaint would be the market place restaurant which was not great. Food OK but not a very comfortable area to sit and eat. However seemed to be used mainly as take out or by families using pool area. Pool area was busy as Easter time but we never failed to get sun loungers. Resort also supplied towels at the pool hut to use around pool area. Pool itself not deep and very child friendly. However no pool attendant or life guard. Nice gym but did not get a chance to use - too busy at theme parks, resort pool or day trips to both coasts. Resort is on southern end of International drive and is much quieter than northern end. In my view you do need a car here. Theme Parks - nearer to Disney than Universal but very accessible to both(15 minutes). Ask concierge for best directions as Idrive traffic heavy at times and there are faster routes. Check out Gatorland as we thought it was brilliant. (total cost EUR115 for five of us and we spent almost full day) Shopping - Premium Outlet closeby on Vineland, (another up by Universal). Mall at Millenia on Conroy Road worth a visit.

When we book hotels, we always look for suites, so that the adults can have some adult time after the kids go to bed. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment and it was more than big enough for a family of 4. The location was very nice, a really short drive to Sea World and not far from the parks at Disney World. We had a rental car, so I can't comment on the shuttle service. Publix was less than 5 minutes away and the Outlet Mall was close too. There was good parking possibilities outside every building, and there was no parking fee. We stayed in building D and I think we used a maximum of 3 miutes from our building to the main pool and lobby. We had an apartment facing a parking lot. In the evening we could actually see some of the firework from Magic Kingdom from our balcony. I realize that it's better to be at Magic Kingdom to see this, but it was quite nice anyway.. :) We had breakfast in our apartment every morning, but tried the Cafe Palm for lunch a couple of times. The food there was ok, maybe a little expensive compared to what you get. The kitchen was well equipped, my husband made really nice dinners for us a couple of nights, and didn't miss anything. The pool area was so much fun for our kids (3 and 5). They had a little \"beach\" area by the pool too, were the kids could play. The only downside about the pool area was that it was really crowded, and that it was hard to find sunbeds. Seemed like everyone else was up around 6 and put towels on all the sunbeds and then hit the parks. The days we spent by the pool, we could see sunbeds with towels on them, without people there, for over 3 hours. As far as housekeeping goes, they came every single day and changed our towels, made our beds and took out the trash. If you wanted full housekeeping, they charged $40 extra a day. We have 2 kids, at 3 & 5 and stayed for over a week, and the housekeeping that was included was more than enough for us. They gave us more shampoo/conditioner/body lotion if we vere out. We always left them a little tip, and they gave us new detergent and dishwasher soap. That was all we needed. We had our own vaccumer, but I never used it. My husband used the fitness room a few times and said the equipment was top notch, but no free weights. My kids liked the game room and it was nice that you could rent DVD's there, but kind of unusual not having that option directly on your TV. The little contact I had with the front desk, was very friendly and professional. We were all very happy with our stay at the Floridays and I would recommend it to anyone.

The room in general just needs a good ol' cleaning, thorough. Lots of dust on the furniture, etc. The furniture was pretty banged up as well. Lots of scratches and knicks. Pool area - The pool area is nice. Plenty of clean pool towels always available. The pool was a little smaller than I expected, and it got full at certain times of the day. By the middle of the afternoon there was a lot of trash on/around the pool deck (straws, wrappers, etc) which was kind of gross. I never really saw anyone out there tidying up so some sort of pool attendant would be nice to see. Nothing worse than stepping on trash when getting in/out of a pool. The poolside bar offered some nice pool drinks but they are pricey and add up quick. The front desk staff was super friendly and cordial.

With the addition of the livingroom/diningroom and complete kitchen it was so much nicer than having 3 separate hotel rooms. There was also a washer/dryer and dishwasher. We took advantage of the resort shuttle to go to Disney and it worked perfectly. The food at the cafe was delicious, although be prepared to wait a bit after ordering. It was definitely not fast food. Sitting around the beautiful pool was very relaxing, and having the bar close by was an added bonus. The second pool, which happened to be closer to our building, was also quite nice. Depending on which building you are situated in (we were in the furthest away) be prepared to do a bit of walking! This is a large complex! (I believe my GPS indicated that it was half a mile from our building to the main entrance.) There is a Benihana restaurant right next door, and the outlet shopping is just a short drive away. The staff at Floridays was VERY friendly and courteous. When we requested additional towels, they came up right away. And when we ran out of the supplied Keurig coffee and wanted to use a regular coffee maker, they brought one to us. (We had already spent a week in a house in another part of Florida and wanted to use up some of the supplies we had left.) Would we return to Floridays during our next visit to Orlando?

It is a very spacious condo and the full kitchen and laundry capabilities in the room are so useful for longer stays! The hotel is VERY clean, the rooms are nicely decorated and laid out well and all the staff was very friendly. The master bath is killer! A couple of small nit picks are that they don't provide but 2 dishwasher soap pouches and only one laundry soap package. I didn't ask housekeeping if I could have more, but they probably would have. Just a heads up to that there's not even the most basic thing in the kitchen (like salt and pepper). Also, there is no airport shuttle to the hotel and it's a $50 cab ride which hurts. But these are minor issues in the overall scheme of the ammenities that DO come with this fabulous place. it's a great location and you can readily get to Walgreens and a grocery store right up the street. The outlet mall around the corner is SUPER nice too. Very high end outlet shopping. I would most certainly stay here again!!!! I couldn't live with myself though if I didn't issue one big fat warning about Dollar rent-a-car. Floridays has a partnership with Dollar and they provide a promo code which gives a \"too good to be true\" discount on a weekly rental. It was half the cost of anywhere else I called so I was like \"awesome! sign me up!\". It was nightmarish dealing with the Dollar agency offsite from the Airport at the Palms Resort. It was required that I use this location (and not the airport) when I made the reservation and since they were \"just up the street\" on International Dr., they had me call them once I got to the hotel and they'd come get me with their complimentary shuttle. They assured me they are open til 8pm, but be warned that shuttle service ends at 6:30pm. That was really important information that they left out since I called at 6:35. I actually called many times before 6:30 while waiting for my luggage at the airport, but no one picked up or it went to a FAX machine which was super annoying. The one woman desk at the Palms Resort is a long LONG ways away on International drive in the heart of a God-awful area traffic that continues til past midnight. The lady at the desk was a real Ms. Nasty to work with and delivered high pressure sales on all the insurance, etc., that is NOT included in the quoted price. They mysteriously dropped my reservation since I didn't pick up at the airport so I got a no-show charge. What the? Then I was advised that now there would be a charge to drop off at the airport when I left. I was ready to break something. In the end I was out the same amount as I would have been using Enterprise (who I love) right from the airport, plus I was out $50 of cab fare and 2 hours of my vacation getting there and back.

The front-desk staff are polite, professional and willing to do whatever a guest needs. The Concierge was quite accommodating as well, but I simply cannot excuse the problems areas listed below:: THE GOOD: As stated earlier, the staff are very polite. The gameroom is nice. My 4-year old grandson enjoyed playing the air-hockey game. The pool is very nice for small children. The zero entrance and spraying toys were a hit with the children. There are plenty of clean towels around the pool area. The food at the cafe was good (We had a couple of pizzas). The beds were comfortable and the linens were clean as were the towels. THE BAD: Upon arriving we found our 3-bedroom suite in building C (floor 4) to be dirty. The floors had not been cleaned as there were food crumbs throughout the kitchen and living-room areas. This is inexcusable. The in-room safe had been left in a locked mode. We waited for somebody to come up and open it but the wait became too long, so we opted to call the next day. The man who arrived to open the safe was very polite, professional and had the safe open in just a few moments. The point is... the room was not prepared for our visit and because of this, it caused us time and frustration. The kitchen was missing all of the frypans. When I called the front desk, they apologized and sent one to the room right away. The pan they sent looked like it had survived a war. It should have been disposed of years ago. The non-stick coating was nearly gone. I would not use a pan like this at home. There was one light bulb out over the table (still out to this day), and the dust on the hanging lights over the kitchen island was thick enough to grow plants. The wide-screen television in the living room did not work properly. The colors are out of adjustment and could not be adjusted to make the decent proper. The picture does not fit in the screen area and the remote control batteries were held in with black electrical tape. The furniture in the living area is in need of replacement as it is nicked-up and worn. The pool area restrooms were not maintained throughout the day. The cafe coffee is good in the A.M. but later in the day when I purchased coffee, it was cold in the carafe. Trash was full and floors were quite dirty. Along the walkway to our building there was a plastic bag and a used Skoal can that stayed there during our stay. These may seem to be small things to some, but I consider this inattention to details that add up to a less-than-average establishment. The one thing that would make this a better hotel for kids (as there were a lot of little children at this hotel) would be a play area with a play-set.

It was easy to find and about 20 minutes from Orlando airport. Check in was simple but since we didn't check in until about 8pm, buildings A, B and C were booked - which turned out to be just fine since they are close to the noisy main pool area. We chose bldg # and room 307 overlooked the pond which was nice. It was also right next to the smaller \"quiet pool\" - which is only quiet if there are no screaming kids in it. But for the most part, it was pretty quiet and relaxing for adults with a few kids in it. The small pool is open from 8am - 10pm and had plenty of seating and a small hot tub. The suite itself was nice, two bedrooms with two separate baths..the master one had a jacuzzi tub which we did not use. It has these awkward folding windows between the bed and bath which allow you to watch tv from the bath but also allows lots of noise between the two rooms. the kitchen is full with the basic dishes and cookware, full sized fridge with icemaker. They leave you 6 k-cups of coffee for the kuerig maker, one small bottle of dish soap, two packages of automatic dish soap, a sponge and one small box of tide for the clothes washer/dryer. Note: there are no spices of any kind, even salt/pepper. The clothes washer is small - like enough room for 6 items so don't wait until your last night to do laundry. The location is right on International Drive but at the far end and close to SeaWorld. It is very close to a 7-11, a Publix grocery store and the outlets are just down the block. You can use the I-trolley to get around, there are stops just in front of the hotel but we had a car so did not use it. We booked the car through the hotel link to Thrifty and it was about 50% cheaper than other rates! It was an easy pick-up and drop-off at the airport and well worth it. There are hundreds of restaurants around so we did not bother with the hotel cafe - we did eat several meals inside the room as well. Not much to do here for kids, except the pools and a small video game room. Inside the suites are DVD players (rent RedBox movies from the 7-11 for $1.00, instead of $5 from the resort) and you can hook up the PS3 or whatever to the tvs. One tip about SeaWorld/Aquatica - just buy the SeaWorld ticket online and save a few bucks then inside the park, you can get an Aquatica ticket for $25 at the \"upgrade booth\" just inside.

The room was perfect- 3 bedrooms, a full kitchen, washer/dryer, living room, balcony, etc. The staff brought up two cribs and a high chair. The room was clean, the pool area is ideal for young children (a gradient slope for kids to walk in as they please), the hotel bar offered food at a reasonable price and there was a Starbucks. There is a Walgreens, a publix, Dominoes, a 7-11, and an Outback literally within a mile. Very convenient to stock up on food and baby stuff. My husband needed a taxi which they arranged for 4:30am Monday and it was right on time! The concierge is Wonderful! He helped us get a Princess luncheon at Disney immediately and we booked within 24 hours. The service was great at the hotel, we did feel bad since we felt the bar/food area was under staffed since it took over an hour to get an order of chicken fingers, but we did go at prime time. Our only constructive thoughts would be the Shuttle service and cleaning crew. The shuttle is punctual, right on time, courteous, and expedient, but I think they need more times to come home since sometimes they get booked quickly. With the cleaning staff, we left for Disney at 8am and arrived back at 3. We called 3 times for them to clean the room but they never arrived until 4 (while I was there with 4 kids under the age of 4). They made the beds and left. They did not wipe down any countertops or tables. I found them at the next room and asked for cleaner. So the woman proceeded to show me how to use the degreaser and pillowcase to clean the counter and tabletops and bathroom counters. They again have so many guests and that is probably why the cleaning crew is so busy!!! Wonderful stay and miss it already! Would stay again. Oh and the AC works so incredibly well!!!

First of all the good, the apartment itself in our case a 3 bedroom was excellent. Large, clean and homely. It was the perfect size. It was well equipped with almost everything we needed. The pool area is kid friendly and really designed solely for the kids and family. It is mainly shallow not overly deep and with a number of water spraying devices to be enjoyed. The apartment is well located, about 300 meters from Publix ( Supermarket) and 500 meters from Outback ( restaurant which was really good and not expensive to eat at. The bad...well really it was the people...the exception being the front office staff ( they were excellent from start to finish) First of all the Concierge...what was their problem??? 1. Ask for a recommendation for Dinner, I requested somewhere with ribs and told them we were a family. They organise Texas Brasil $28 cab ride away on the way there and $48 on the way home? WTF ??? by the way Texas Brazil is not a family restaurant and there Ribs are dreadful ! But the card concierge gave us had us seated right away...I wonder why! $279 for dinner 3 adults 2 kids 1 bottle of wine ($43) We use Conceierges car service R J Tours Transportation who charge us $28 there and $48 on the way home....same distance, different price = argument and complaint. All we can say is don't get in a car driven by a Haitian driver, you will be ripped off. (Be careful there are lots if them....after 2 days of them I decided to never get in a vehicle driven by a Haitian ever again and didn't...shame really! Second Concerge problem, ask to be booked on shuttle to Magic Kingdom...no problem it leaves out the front of the hotel in 20 minutes, its called the Orlando Trolley......The Orlando Trolley does not go to Magic Kingdom, it actually just travels up and down International drive.. So we finally get on the Magic Kingdom Shuttle from the hotel and organise pick up for 6.15pm..so we are there at 6.05pm and are told there is no seats available, wait for the next shuttle ...This is after our name was booked on the 6.15pm shuttle. It appears first in best dressed wether your names in the list or not. Finally on the night before we left, we decide to order room service from the Palms Cafe...dinner for 5...half way through ordering Edwin (employee) decides to become a smarty on the phone. Edwin tells me I'm ordering from the old menu and not the new menu and I cant have what Ive ordered. So I tell Edwin ..Im ordering off the menu in the room which is all I have to go on and he keeps being a smarty. Even when he delivers the new menu to the room he wants to be smart. This all ended up with us ordering off a local restaurant instead. I really do hope our experience was the exception and not the rule here, as the apartment is perfect. Unfortunately the staff at this resort are of the opinion that being the No 1 resort on trip advisor means they don't have to try at all. ( Again the check in and out staff are not included in this, they were fantastic ).

In the strip mall there is the BEST Pizza, and gift shop, Liquor store, Subway and a few more stores.At about 8 blocks away(walking distance) is a huge outlet mall where we bought discount tickets for a few things we were going to do.

Tickets can be purchased at the hotel for $4. per day and a schedule where it travels to. They do sell the trolley tickets for up to two weeks. We rode it just one day.

They come and replace your towels and make your beds and empty your garbage daily. The room also come with a washer and dryer which I didn't think we would use, but we did a few loads. They have two pools, a smaller one with less traffic, and a larger one which was busy most of the time, a lot of fun. There is a bar right there next to the pool just to kick back and relax and listen to the music. One night there was a guy singing which was very nice to listen to. I do have to say we did not do the whole Disney scene scene we have been there a few times before and the boys are older, we traveled to Kennedy Space center which was great then to Cocoa beach that is only 45 min for Kennedy center.

I checked TripAdvisor reviews thoroughly when selecting Floridays and found the reviews to be very accurate and helpful. We were there for one week March 15th-22nd. First, when traveling with kids, the 2-bedroom condo was great-- plenty of space, 2 bathrooms, full kitchen with all needed items including corkscrew. Well-kept and clean. Pricing for the unit was also very attractive. The pool area is very good, with an excellent zero-entry kid's area with splash features, etc. Staff was always attentive, friendly, responsive to requests. We were in Bldg B, which is close to the pool, cafe, etc. Bldgs A and C also very close and convenient. Buildings D, E, and F were not as far from the pool as some reviews lead me to believe-- easily walkable though some reviewers talked about driving to the pool form the back buildings. I don't think that would be necessary at all. Pool is HEATED which is great-- stayed at Animal Kindom Lodge last year and that pool was not heated-- pretty cold in early March! I appreciated nice, comfortable water temp here. Room service was reasonably priced and food was delivered in a reasonable period of time. Having the washer and dryer in the room was GREAT-- we didn't have to pack as much stuff, just did a small load every day or 2 days. Not much noise -- did not hear anyone in adjoining units. Our rooms did not overlook pool but I don't think there'd be much pool noise even on that side, especially higher up . Now, a few small complaints -- but not significant compared to the upside of this resort: 1) maid service was erratic-- one or two days no one had come by 4 PM when we returned to the unit. Usually we were there when they came at 9 AM or at 4 PM so it isn't as easy to have them make beds, etc. 2) Sink in the master bath drained very slowly-- slow enough to fill the sink bowl if you left the water running w/ drain open. I called twice for service, and someone came quickly, but I was not able to wait around while they were there; found that the problem was not resolved either time. Inconvenient but not disastrous. I decided not to worry about it and other than shaving whiskers not rinsing down the bowl due to slow drain, not a big problem. 3) installed hairdryer in master bath did not work-- short in it. Staff brought a hand-held which worked fine. Small matter, but I hope they do fix that dryer for the next visitors. 4) Check-in time is 4PM which meant we had to wait a bit-- nut in retrospect, it takes time to clean and prepare a 2+ BR condo unit for the next guest after someone has been in there a week. 5) Was not able to get the room assignment requested (based on other TripAdvisor recs we requested blg B, 3rd floor or higher, with west view to see Disnet fireworks) but that was a very minor thing-- enjoyed our room a lot. They also offered to check availability for our request and let us move later if we wanted, but we liked the room and didn't want to pack up for a new room. Nice that they offered to try and get us the assignment we wanted even if it meant moving us after a day or so. Bottom line-- I enjoyed the stay very much and felt the cost was very reasonable for the amenities. Well-located, we were able to reach all destinations quickly and without difficulty. Staff was always friendly and helpful w/ all requests, directions, etc. Good heated pool with nice area for kids. I would most definitely stay there again, or recommend to others-- as I am doing now. I spoke with several people there who have stayed at Floridays every year for 5+ years in a row-- must be consistently good. Five stars from me and my family. Not perfect-- but what is?

Our Room had a funky smell almost moldy smelling, once you were in room for 10 minutes you couldn't smell it but everytime you walked in the door you clearly did. Pillows were small and not too comfortable. Staff was friendly, however room service was lame. Our place was near small pool and we stopped by for a quick dip and their were no towels nor person maning the pool area. For what we did it was fine since we spent little or no time in the resort. If I was staying here for extended period time or with my entire family for vacation I may have rated it lower. Since there are so many options within the Orland Area, I do not think I would stay here again or recommend it to any one.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLovely, immaculate small condo resort for families\u201d", "Author": "WiensFamilyTravels", "ReviewID": "UR126495986", "Content": "The cleanliness of this property, from the rooms to the common areas, impressed us and made our stay very enjoyable. The condos are large with balconies (we stayed in building C third floor).

Master had California king and was lovely. Linens were very nice, beautifully washed and replaced every day. The pool area is really magnificent and we appreciated the lush landscaping and some shaded areas - important for fair people like ourselves who burn easily and WONDERFUL for small tots who should never be in strong sun. The patio/bar area as a direct extension of the pool is just amazing for families. Front desk staff were very helpful and pleasant. A word of advice: room location, view, noisiness will vary from building to building and will depend on your tastes; some people like a quiet room away from the action and some people like to look out on the central and boisterous pool area. The rooms are given first come, first serve, The earlier you arrive, the more choice you may have. However, all buildings are nice and very clean. Location was excellent for us, a bit of quiet oasis, and we rented a car but a shuttle is available - WDW, Sea World and Universal all very close. Large grocery store and large outlet malls just a block or two away. We had every breakfast in the room, on our patio and saved a great deal on meals by preparing in the room, very well equipped kitchen, so we splurged on nice dinners out.

The accommodation was very roomy and very clean. There was a big kitchen area with a washer and dryer and they also provided washing tablets as well. There was a dinning table and living room area opening onto a terrace. The master bedroom was amazing, huge and comfortable bed, amazing bathroom with Jacuzzi bath and shower. The only slight let down was the quality of the sofa bed, which was very lumpy and bumpy, but definitely not a huge issue. We stayed in Tower F, which was a fair bit away from the main reception and main pool. There is however a small pool area by this building which was very nice, quiet and clean, so was perfect for us. We were given a ground floor room which we normally would not be happy with, but the resort seemed very safe so we felt secure enough not to make a fuss.

The tub fills fast and was luxurious!!! The shower was nice size, and the bathroom counter was big and spacious. The kitchen has all the utensils needed for cooking breakfast prior to going out for the day. We also bought drinks and such for the kids and the regular size fridge was great. We were in building A right across from the bus pick up and the pool, this turned out to be ideal!!! The room was just restocked with towels each day and the garbages dumped, no other cleaning done, which was fine with me. The pool is smaller, and does not have enough space for all the guests. I am assuming they are expecting everyone to be gone all day, we came back early for some sun, and there was no chairs and no place in the sun, kind of disappointing/ The only down to this resort is the cafe!! We ate there one night, waited 40 minutes for our food and it came out in card board boxes with plastic silverware, and cost as much as hitting up a regular restaurant with real dishes!! The bartender works very hard, and is commended by me for trying to speed things up, but the people working in the back just didn't have what it takes to keep the customers happy. So we tried again to eat at the cafe, it was 9pm after a long rainy day and we were all too wet and tired to go to a restaurant... well we didn't get our food till 1030pm!!!! The bartender couldn't believe it... he had to go back there and make our food for us!!!

I chose Floridays because of the #1 rating on tripadvisor. When we arrived I was surprised not to pass trough a security gate.A resort that caters to children with no security gate?? Front desk staff was friendly, we were placed in building D. As we were taking our luggage from our car to the unit a minivan almost hit one of my children while speeding through the parking lot, the lady driver could clearly see us. I can see that if people think they are checking into a hotel why they would be somewhat impressed with the units. They are just average condos for this area. Our unit was clean,(Finger prints on the tv) worn but acceptable. After returning the first evening we were greeted by the couple next door fighting. This went on from approx. 9pm to almost midnight and he kept turning the tv up to block out her voice, which was futile because she continued to get louder and louder. Our toilet ran on and off until finally I had to turn it off. After I managed to get a few hours sleep I was expecting a nice hot shower.The bath is basic with walk in shower whirl pool tub. What I got was 4 flows of either extremely cold or hot water from the shower. When I turned on the bathroom fan I thought it was going to fall from the ceiling. Being fortunate enough to be invited to another resort for the day we proceeded downstairs,and to try to put this behind me. I was welcomed by management and cleaning staff arguing with each other,not the right time to bring the problems to there attn.!! What another great start to my vacation. Returning that evening around 5pm, we arrived to find cleaning staff in our room. No big deal but a little late in the day I would think.I took my kids over to check out the pool ,and a family arrived and proceeded to throw a foot ball right in front of us almost hitting my daughter in the face. No apology basically telling us that the pool was no theirs. No problem we had spent the day at a far more spectacular facility.Let them have their time!! Now for our second evening. From 7 til approx. 10pm the people next door again continued where they left off the night before.(It appears someone likes the track!) Outside the door it was a continuous flow of running? , shouting, doors slamming as what appeared to be people arriving for the sporting events. Finally around 11pm , getting settled down, I figured I was in for at least one deserving night's sleep seeing as now I was going on 3 nights of my vacation without any sleep due to other inconsiderate and rude people. At approx. 1:30 am someone decided they were going to go swimming the gate must of been locked and they ended up almost in a brawl in the parking lot. Finally there friends? arrived to take control of the situation,no security arrived. In two days I can't recall seeing security in this ungated?? facility. The last morning my daughter went to turn on the hair dryer in the main bath and it began to smoke,I unplugged it and left a note for house keeping. I guess no previous guests used the shower bath fan or hair dryer ?? I am glad that by the reviews many received and enjoyed a wonderful stay at Floridays Resort, it appears the staff and management go out of their way to provide adequate vacation experiences for their guests. It must be our bad luck whenever we travel at some point we always end up having others around us that consider themselves more important and lacking respect for those that are paying and deserve to have the same accommodations.Before leaving I wanted to bring the difficulties we encountered to front desk,but as you guessed there was some one there arguing about resort fees that are CLEARLY STATED!!! I must disagree with tripadvisors #1 rating! I am not sure how this is determined.There are far worse misleading places to stay as we found the hard way. I can assure you that I have and will continue to stay in far superior accommodations than provided here for the same or less price.

Literally our only disappointment was that the pool was too cold for our toddler to enjoy it. After 10 minutes he was turning blue and shivering. They said when we checked in that the pool was 86 degrees, but I think it was colder than that. My son's pool at swim lessons is 90 degrees and he does fine with that. This seemed way more than 4 degrees cooler. My parents ate breakfast at the cafe one day and said it was really good. Anyway, that's about it. I'm sure we will probably be back. Love this place!!! A couple small negative to report: our shower head did not work right. My husband managed to fix it. But we also had to turn it off REALLY hard in order for it not to drip.

According to previous reviews it is the \"number one\" hotel in Orlando. In my opinion it is average...nothing great about it and nothing too bad about it. We have been going as a family to Orlando for 15 years and we have stayed at several different resorts in the Orlando/Kissimmee area. Where Floridays is located is good...but we have stayed previously at the \"Fountains\" next door to Floridays and Vistana Villages across the road from Floridays and I would stay at either one of those resorts before I stayed at Floridays again. Honestly, it is just a \"bare bones\" resort, nothing fancy or fun. My kids are older now and they enjoy tennis and pool...not just video games and an air hockey table. Floridays just has two pools and the \"children's pool\" is quite busy but the quiet pool is OK...there are no fountains or slides on the property. As far as our unit was concerned..don't be content with a unit on the second floor! (the balcony is half stucco). We were and we were disappointed about how dark the unit was. When we arrived the check in was very quick and easy! When we got to our unit we knew the unit had been cleaned throughly because the smell of bleach and disinfectant was overpowering. After opening all the windows the smell left the unit 24 hrs later. The unit is smaller than others we have been to in the Orlando area. Master Bathroom is very large and a big waste of space. The unit was a 2 bed room for 6 people yet the cutlery and dishes were only enough for 4 people. All in all it was just OK but I would not return to this resort.

We've stayed on Disney property before, and weren't sure about staying off-site. But, with the price difference, and the wonderful reviews on Tripadvisor, I figured it was worth a try. Boy, we were so glad we took a chance. Floridays is an uber-clean resort - staff is accomodating and friendly, and the prices were competitive. One of th reasons I was concerned about staying here was the price seemed too low for what we got (the 2 bd/2bth condo). Once we checked in, our concerns went away. The rooms are better than the pictures, really. They are impeccibly clean, roomy, and have all of the amenities you need for cooking, doing a load of laundry, etc. Since I don't want to repeat what is already in the 4-5 star reviews, I wanted to make some comments that might help you make your decision. First, the reason I didn't give Floridays 5 stars is because of 2 things. First, the building location (E) was near the \"quiet\" pool, but a fairly far trek to the fun pool. Not that we couldn't walk it, but I was sad that we weren't in a closer building. Second, the onsite food situation is odd. There is onsite starkbucks, but not a full-blown starbucks (don't expect to be able to get a frappe or specialty drink). They just brew starbucks brand in the cafe. Also, the meal options do show breakfast/lunch/dinner that is available via room service, but there is no option to really eat anywhere onsite. This is fine since you'll probably eat out (or in your room), but for nights you just don't feel like cooking or going out, there is nowhere to really go. Another note -- we had a 5-year old with us, thinking we'd put him in one bedroom and us in the other. The bedrooms are actually fairly far apart, and (for us, at least) the room with the king bed was furthest from the front door. We just didn't feel safe leaving our son alone in the room nearest to the front door. We wound up putting him on the pull-out couch right outside our room, which was fine. But, this also posed a problem because the slider to the patio was right there, so we stacked pillows, etc. to make sure he couldn't escape at night. Paranoid, I know, but we just didn't feel right having him down the hall. So, if you have the same line of thinking, be prepared. Other that those minor things, our overall experience was wonderful. I would recommend you look here first before booking anything more pricey, and not as roomy.

I found Floridays while researching all the suite-style hotels that were within a 10-15 minute drive to the Disney parks. Needless to say, when I saw it was the #1 rated hotel on TripAdvisor, I was intrigued yet skeptical. After spending the past week in one of their 2-bedroom suites (2 adutls, one child), I can honestly say we were blown away by the overall value of the resort. For half the price of a Disney Deluxe hotel, we got a huge, beautiful suite that was even bigger than I had expected. Plus, it offered every amenity (refrigerator, stove, oven, microwave, dishwasher, washer/dryer, etc.) we could ever need. The hotel buildings & grounds were attractive, well-maintained and clean. The pool was much bigger than I expected and the entire pool area was very attractive, relaxing and had a much more \"tropical resort\" feel than I was expecting. The main pool IS heated (I read reports that claimed it wasn't). The location of this resort was also wonderful. It's on the south part of International Drive, so it's away from the hustle & bustle and congestion that Int'l Drive is known for. We brought a GPS, but I didn't even need it to get to the parks - the resort is a quick 10-15 minute drive to the parks requiring one turn - hang a right from Int'l Drive onto 536 (World Drive) and that's it.

Sorry night staff for night experiencing your kindness and wisdom... Background: My family has vacationed annually at Floridays for the past 6 years, (we missed last year for health/economic reasons). We stay in the B building. This is my first review of a space for tripadvisor. This year our trip was from Wednesday February 22, to Wednesday February 29th. (a good time to miss a few days of school, and get the cheapest airfares) Experience: Over the past 6 years, the space has remained the same... it's getting to know the people behind it all that makes it all so much better all the time... The resort is so close to Publix and the premium outlet malls... Moms and shoppers... pay close attention to that... On vacay, I'm the shopper of provisions... so I appreciated that. My wife loves to spend my family's money, so she practically lived at the outlets while we were goofing off at the pool. I have 2 children... a 6 year old princess and an 8 year old demanding \"prima don\", the male version of \"prima donna\". As much as I hate to say it, my son had a nighttime accident in bed, actually during the week stay he wet his underwear two times. Housekeeping and having washing machines en suite were critical to making it \"no problem\"... The only thing that got a little getting used to was... having more than 6 light switches in the common space... I still to this day can't tell you which switch went to which fixture/fan the like. This trip I met a lot of people and will quickly profile how they made my trip better... Identities sort of masked... to protect the innocent... Front desk: 1. JC: checked our family in. Most professional and kind, the night shift front desk guy... always willing to help when he could. Believe it or not, I call him my mystery (my wife has never met him) friend... He to this day is one of the few people who can consistently make me smile. And we've already been home for almost a week... 2. NF: like a second aunt to my children. made sure my kids were happy, the princess of service and smiles 3. Binz: the queen of all service. Cafe: background: I am a starbucks junkie and probably spend 200-300 a month in NJ on starbucks... Your next best options are the K-cups and use the in room Keurig coffee machine... SWEET... I mainly ordered hot chocolates for my kids, and one breakfast platter. All the smiles and momentary full stomach was deeply appreciated. Caveat emptor, (buyer beware) Their prices reflect the convenience... 1. Foster: one heck of a laugh and laugh maker... Possibly takes more water out of the pool, if he did a cannonball like me 2. All the folks were very accommodating. Not that you should do as I did, but I asked for cooking oil, and fried some frozen dumplings in olive oil... ROOM AMENITIES: Being able to cook in your room, have an awesome coffee maker and pack a bag of food is and always makes our family vacations bearable. We packed 16 individual servings of homemade short grain (sticky) rice. Without it, my wife goes into SRW, (sticky wife withdrawal). We stay in a cavernous 3 bedroom space, travelling with a family of 4 is underwhelming, in the past we have slept 9, (six adults and 3 infant children) in the same space. Concierge: 1. Nilda: she overheard a conversation I had at the cafe. I am a ketchup snob, and only enjoy Heinz ketchup. She saw me the next morning and brought me about 6 Heinz ketchup packets from home. AWESOME! 2. The other partners at the concierge desk always were helpful and kind. Efficient and smiling. Love em all! Engineering: 1. BC: the salt of the earth. Willing to give his shirt off his back to help his fellow man, or woman... Misc: 1. RA: in her dungeon, always pumping out the right paperwork to make our lives better and richer. Great smile and disposition. 2. Carlos: code name for the pool guy... his real name really starts with a K. Kept me in stiches, talking about all the the fun things that he's seen in the pool... secret secret... we all have some secrets. To Floridays and beyond... We spent 2 days at Universal, and 2 days at Disneyworld. The parks are about 10-20 minutes away. Very convenient. We spent 4 days at the pool and playing air hockey and other amusements in their arcade. The guests were AMAZING. Met a family from Norway poolside and my son was a kindred spirit to their son. A match made in heaven. I met a big guy from Uruguay, we had an instant bond as well. Such a family friendly and guest friendly haven... What a joy, and what a relief... Can you tell that I hate family vacations? The only reason is my children always expect more each and every trip... That is one thing that is hard to deliver... All the best to those at Floridays, and to you patient folks who have read this review for the past 123 seconds... Good luck to you and yours, and enjoy Floridays as we do and will do in the future... Final cost to me for this amazing experience: drum roll please...

I found out about this hotel from it's #1 rating on TA, and booked a two bedroom suite, bundled with a mid-sized car from Dollar, via Expedia for $1007. I think the posted room rate was $149/night, so I feel like I got the car for free.\u00a0 Floridays is centrally located for families visiting theme parks, about 25 mins from the airport on the south end of International Drive between Seaworld (15 mins) and Disney (25 mins). There are 3 tolls on the highway between the airport and the I-Drive exit, so you will want to have ~$5 USD cash for the drive. There is a plaza next to the resort with a Publix grocery store, Walgreens drug store, Subway, and Chinese take out (Citrus Gardens). Some reviews called it walking distance, and while I suppose you could walk it, I can't imagine doing that while carrying anything heavy in the heat. There is also a Benihana in front of the resort, and a 7-11 gas station across the street. The Premium Outlets are just a few hundred yards down I-Drive on Vineland and there is a McDonalds there. Lots of options for food nearby, including the Palm Cafe in the resort (which we didn't try). We checked in around 8pm and got room 107 on the ground floor of building C, which is a short walk from the family pool area between buildings A and B. There is lots of free parking around each building. There no porters to help with your bags, but our building had two large luggage carts stored near the elevators.\u00a0 Our suite was great! It had a fully equipped kitchen with everything you might need to cook almost any meal, dining area with a table for 6, washer/dryer, and living room with a pull out couch and \u00a0flat screen TV. The small bedroom had two beds, and the master had a king, both had CRT TVs. The master has an on-suite bathroom with a jacuzzi tub that opens onto the bedroom so you can watch TV while you soak. There is also a safe in the master bath closet. We were a little worried about the noise from the hallway and elevator but didn't find it to be an issue as the master is located at the back of the suite, and my son sleeps like a rock under any circumstance. We also had a balcony with table and two chairs overlooking a lake with a fountain. All of the ground floor balconies are screened in, but higher floors are not. Some reviews complain about the sound of the fountain, but I actually appreciated the white noise.\u00a0 Service at the resort was good. Check in was friendly and quick, and they called us an hour later to make sure we were happy with the room. The maid service was ok - they just make the beds, remove trash, and replace towels (there were always lots) - if you want additional cleaning you have to pay a fee. There are always lots of beach towels at the pool. A couple of pointers - if your party drinks a lot of coffee, bring kriug refills with you, as they only provided 7 for our entire stay. They also only provide two loads of dishwashing detergent and one load of laundry detergent, so if you expect to be doing more than that bring some. You could probably buy all of this stuff in the shop in the main building, but I bet it would be expensive. Wifi is free fast and reliable, but there is a resort fee of ~$12 per day that you pay on checkout. I called one night to report a couple of burnt lightbulbs and they were replaced the following day. The pool between buildings A and B is great for families. It has zero entry with water features for kids, along with a deeper section for lane swim, and a small hot tub. The pool is heated to ~83, so it's warm enough to swim on cool days and in the evenings it is open until 11pm. No Lifeguards. There were lots of lounge chairs available, and an arcade for rainy days off the pool area. There isn't a tonne of shade, so bring sunscreen, The music played in the pool area is lively, so the rooms facing the pool might be a little loud.\u00a0 One misc note, I always find the water in the southern US has a smell to it, so I bought a lot of bottled water for drinking and making coffee etc.\u00a0 Check out was painless, I didn't even have to return to the main building. I just called to confirm the charges and left the room keys in the room.\u00a0 To sum it up, Floridays is a sure thing. Good location, great suite, efficient service, all the amenities you need, and the price is right. We would definitely return, and will be recommending Floridays to friends.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hingham, MA", "Title": "\u201cAnother Admirer\u201d", "Author": "Dofnay", "ReviewID": "UR125543868", "Content": "This was rated #1 on tripadvisor and It is worth it.

We were never disturbed with any noise until the last 2 days from our upstair unit we heard some pounding noise early in the morning (8am-ish)-sounded like kids running around or pulling furniture. we loved the palm cafe, esp the bar. they make really nice cocktails there, and their food wasn't half bad either. my husband loved their chicken wings and margaritas. i had the mediterranean salad which was excellent. i have to say something about front desk staff now-before arriving i called to add our friends' names to the reservation so they can check in before we arrive. it took 3 tries to get this done. i was given the run-around the first two times, sending me to different people's voicemail to leave messages. nobody called back either time. third try i actually told the guy not to transfer me and to help me on the spot or else, which he did, right then and there. which made you wonder why the previous 2 people were not willing to help me if it was that simple. bottom line is if it's cheap enough for you to overlook some of the things i find lacking, then stay here.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cTop Quality Orlando Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Winning55", "ReviewID": "UR125414102", "Content": "Just back after staying a week in Floridays.

Seriously! Service is EVERYTHING in a hotel/resort, and Floridays definitely excels at it. Folks working there seem sincerely happy and are extremely helpful. Our first \"shocker\" was the young gentleman that helped us take our bags to the 2-bedroom suite we rented... it was past midnight, our kids were exhausted and crabby, and he was so nice and funny that by the time we got to the suite the kids were giggling! Then, when we offered him a tip, HE REFUSED IT (now, THAT is a first!) and stated that his reward was joking around with our kids (\"Your kids made my day!\") Yes, [sadly] shocking nowadays, but sincere and wonderfuly refreshing. The suite was GREAT! Tons of space, great beds, great--and lots of--pillows, TONS of towels of all sizes, a fully-stocked kitchen (including a Keurig coffee machine and several k-cups)... and the list goes on and on and on! We were planning to stay 1 night, and ended up staying 2 because we really wanted to spend an extra night in that suite (we had nothing planned for the next day). Something that worked really well for us was ordering breakfast to the room that 1st morning. They have a small, but well-appointed list of breakfast choices. The French toasts that the kids had were delicious, and the breakfast sandwiches that my wife and I had were freshly made and very satisfying. This got us on our way to Disney early and with a full belly! Highly recommended, and for about the same price of a breakfast elsewhere (but in your pajamas! :-) ). Also, the gentleman that brought us our food order was extremely polite and a true pleasure to talk to. To sum it all up: all the reviews and other people's positive comments are very accurate. We've decided that we'll be back, but next time for a few more days!! BTW: we stayed in building E, on the 6th floor, and had a nice view of the fields behind the hotel, with cattle roaming around (!!) It was quiet and we had lots of parking space because that is one of the last buildings in the resort (i.e., towards the back) I will most likely request the same building next time we are there. Also, there is a small pool right next to it (we didn't, however, have time to enjoy it this time around). As a side comment: I was in a \"luxury hotel\" (Sofitel) just a few months ago, for a whole week, and the service at Floridays is 100 times better. Quite a contrast, to be honest...

We were offered service the first day, at 4:45 p.m. By that time we were tired and if felt odd to have someone making our beds while we were in our rooms. I know this is a big place, but from our experiences, Floridays may be understaffed in this regard (we were here on a fairly quite time of the year). Finally, the resort fee seems disingenuous: The room prices are very good, but a fee of this type for 2 pools (1 small and not heated) is a bit silly. There is a game room for the kids, but one has to pay to use the arcade type games. That's as far as the 'resort' aspect of Floridays goes.

They've always been clean and unless you have housekeeping service it's your job to keep it that way. All the supplies you could possibly need are at your fingertips. Every piece of kitchen stuff, washer & dryer...you name it. I think of it as renting a condo rather than a hotel room. Rooms are basically the same for 2 & 3 bedrooms. They literally pop a 3rd bedroom on the larger unit....aside from that they are exact same in size. Location is great on South International Drive. Getting in the place can be a little challenging the first time, after that you've got it no problem. There is a Publix grocery store a few blocks away. Driving would be easier, but you could walk it. I don't think it has a sidewalk all the way. Also in the area: a walgreens, domino's pizza, Bennihana and a ton of stuff. Plus the Premier Outlet Mall is less than a mile away, so shop till you drop. We love bringing our kids here. They have space to move around while we're not at the parks.

They used a queen sheet on the king bed, so the bottom foot of the bed had nothing on it! Would you believe that they even made the bed the second day that way too? REALLY? It was my fault for not looking under the sheets and notice it until late night on the second day, but since we were leaving I didn't say anything. Why bother? They obviously did it on purpose. I also found hair in the shower (but no mold, which was a plus). It's the little things that really do matter. I wish these places took more pride in what they are doing, but maybe they don't have to. Who knows. Would I stay there again? Maybe. The price was right (about $179 a night for a two bedroom).

I would have given it a 4-5 star until our last encounter. Some things to note for people who do stay there: * if you need items for cooking, we found many were missing from our unit. We had to call the front desk for our items and they did arrive quickly. * on our first night there, we arrived a bit late (after 8PM). We needed a playpen and it took 1-1.5 hours to get one to our room which was rather inconvenient. * We had no issues with the towel/trash service during our stay. We also had a full cleaning while there. * If you have small children, be aware that the toilets are more oval like in their shape. Our portable potty seat just fit over it but really slid around. * We did not use the pool during our visit so I can't comment on it but it did look nice. Issues we had with our room: * no batteries in the TV remotes (we bought our own) * master bedroom phone did not work * main bathroom toilet wasn't sealed properly so if an adult sat on it, it would leak. As a result, only our children used it Unfortunately on our last day there as we were getting ready to leave, a cockroach was found in our kitchen and went under the cabinets. We grabbed our stuff and finished packing in the hall! No idea if it was there earlier, if it came in when we opened the door and we somehow didn't see it or what. But having been to Florida every year for at least 2 weeks since 1999, this was the first one we had encountered. I had booked our upcoming stay for there but have canceled our reservation. And to top it off, there is a cancellation charge of about $4 that will appear on our credit card (NICE!) I did fill in a survey from our stay and Kevin Ryan did attempt to contact me but it was our cell number/home number and we were not there when he called. I then responded back with that information and also my work number but have not heard back. I know he was on Christmas holidays and have pretty much now given up on hearing back.

Also, although clean and spacious, rooms could be better illuminated (light bulbs are weak, possibly to save energy, but this also could be reached by changing to economic bulbs).

After spending a day touring a theme park, it would be nice to return to a nice quiet hotel room. You can't do that if you stay in the wrong building at Floridays Resort Orlando. We made the mistake of agreeing to a top floor suite abutting the pool area. Even though we were six floors up, we could hear music in our bedrooms throughout our entire one week stay. Management keeps loud music blaring around the pool area, usually until the pool closes around 11 pm. We called the front desk to complain on several occassions but only noticed a decrease in volume once. There is no escape. The average: The accomodations are large but average with basic older white appliances in the kitchen. Basic utensils are provided that should meet most of your cooking needs. The laundry is a small combination upright washer dryer unit requiring multiple loads if you have more than two people. The good: Staff is very helpful and friendly. The concierge is a great resource for information and assistance. If you want to stay in a quiet place, don't stay in buildings A or B. The price is reasonable.

A couple months after booking this package deal, I contacted Universal to add an extra Night to our stay. After a lifetime on the phone they said they couldn't accomodate this request for the extra night. So when we checked in at Floridays I asked if we could extend our stay for an extra night (which happened to be New Years Eve). They were extremely accomodating but said their rate wouldn't be the same as through Universal. Believe it or not, their rate was nearly $100 less than what I had paid through Universal! And what about the accomodations? Superb! Since there were 8 of us, we stayed in a 3 bedroom suite. It had 2 bathrooms, Kitchen, Dining, Living room areas, plus a balcony where we could watch fireworks from one of the theme parks at night.

If you are planning a vacation to Orlando; I don't think you can go wrong by choosing Floridays Resort.

We awoke to neck and back stiffness several mornings) my mom and I chose Floridays due to the trip advisor rating. I am sad to report that we were not pleased. My mother has severe asthma; therefore we requested a suite that had not previously had pets in it. We were given a suite in building D. The room was not clean. We found pet hairs behind the door in the bathroom as well as the main entry door. We called the front desk and they moved us to another suite in building A. The suite appeared to be cleaner and it was closer to the game room and the pool. (We were sadly mistaken) The carpet had stains. The vent in the hallway was FULL of dust and VERY dirty. My brother and his wife pulled the sheets back in the master bedroom to find that the blanket had blood on it. About an hour later I pulled my sheets back and the comforter on my bed had blood on it. I called the front desk and let them know. I told them that I pulled it off of the bed and put it in the hallway with the dirty towels and that they could get it in the morning. After a long tiring day at Universal Studios, I came home to the SAME comforter folded up in the corner of the room. I called the front desk again, this time they came right away to pick up the soiled comforter and offered another one. I declined\u2026 The next evening, after a long day at Islands of Adventure I came home to another bloody comforter on my bed. I was NOT happy\u2026 I called the front and they removed it again. The next couple of days went by blood free!!! On our last night my mom woke up due the pillow being so uncomfortable; when she switched the pillow to the other side she saw 3 little dots of blood. She could not go back to sleep. We reported this when we checked out. I think that Floridays should review their cleaning policy. The housekeeping staff and the maintenance staff should be more closely monitored so that Floridays can maintain its #1 spot on trip advisor.

We had no view to speak of but we did not care; we were out and about with our son who is in school nearby, or at the local parks. The housekeeping was as promised: beds made and fresh towels daily. Nothing more. That was okay with us. We had a quiet suite, no noise at all. The only less than excellent thing was the outdoor hot tub by the pool. We went at around 4 and found the water was actually cool. Other guests had notified staff and maintenance was to fix it, but it was not much warmer when we got out close to an hour later.

As many reported you definitely want to be in building B. We requested building B, 5th floor but wound up with the beautiful pond view in 508 (5th floor of B-which also allows you a partial view of the pool too-the best of both worlds), so glad we didn't get pool side-very loud at night. TAKE YOUR OWN COFFEE POT & COFFEE! The coffee maker is a Keurig 1 cup coffee pot which takes 3 minutes to brew. Be warned you will only get coffee the 1st day, after that you must buy your own. So if you're like us and have 3 people all clamoring for the first cup you will be frustrated. We went to Wal-Mart, spent $14.99 for a 12 cup coffee pot and were all happy after that. We were very impressed with all the dishes, pots, pans, glasses & extras in the kitchen, the best we have seen for any condo we've ever stayed in, they really had it all (electric mixer, blender, mixing bowls, measuring cups & spoons, strainer, etc.). Housekeeping is very limited (bed making & towels), they do not clean! We didn't mind this at all, however sometimes lots of towels were left for us and other times just enough. We did not have a problem with this as we always had what we needed, but found this lack of consistency a bit odd. There is usually a different housekeeper each day. We also found the beds & pillows very comfortable. You can walk to the outlet malls-only 1/2 -1mile away, as well a, the Publix grocery store, this property is also ideally located for accessing all the parks. Check your bill before you leave, glad I did. The cafe accidentally charged a purchase to my room 508B instead of 508D, I let the receptionist know we did not charge anything to our room and within minutes she resolved the issue with the cafe and the charges were removed. All in all we loved our stay here and while seeing all the other resorts around, we would stay here all over again.

The master bedroom was totally quiet, while the front bedroom, which was by the front door, did get a bit of noise in the morning from housekeeping and other guests. Our room, in building C, overlooked the pond and so was away from the noise around the pool area - a definite plus. The kitchen was well-stocked with plenty of dishes and things for cooking, and there's a nice little patio off the living room to drink your morning coffee before heading out to the onslaught of Orlando theme parks. The service was great - our bartender Brittany was fun to chat with as we had cocktails and waited for our meals in the cafe, and the front desk was cordial and professional. We called up for an extra blanket one night which was delivered in about five minutes. The cafe is lovely with plenty of Starbucks options and also has a number of groceries available including a freezer full of Ben and Jerry's. Floridays is in a great location that is close to all the parks but not so close you are trapped in theme park craziness. Don't make the same mistake we did and take the \"scenic\" route on International Drive, which was a ninety minute expedition to Universal Studios (we took nearby I-4 the next day which took all of 15 minutes). There were two things that made our review a four star vs a five star: one, we were in a room right outside a housekeeping station, and the noise level in the mornings was enough to wake our two boys. Second, they could use an upgrade on some of the furnishings (the beds were quite old and tables had some loose legs and were a bit scratched up).

We chose floridays because of the great reviews. Reading reviews helped but if we had known more about the hotel beforehand it would have been very helpful. Check in was quick since we booked it beforehand. The hotel was definitely worth it for the price. It's in a great location near almost all theme parks- we went to Universal and Disney. It is very important that you get either and A or B building. If you get E or F you will really regret it because the hike is really long. We thankfully got in the B building but it was still a long walk for the young children. The pool is nice and has good spaces for exercising (swimming laps). It's not always crowded so its great. For younger children, there are sprinklers and fun play areas. There is a medium temp hot tub which is not too hot so its good for younger children. However, the main pool is very warm. This is not good because when you get out of the water, the air feels much colder than it would for a normal pool (b/c of air temp. difference).The five year old in our family wanted to leave after 10 minutes because the water, although warm at first, felt cold. The entire long walk back he was shivering like crazy. Make sure to bring extra towels- and have a dip in the hot tub before the walk home. Floridays has a shuttle service to disney, universal, seaworld, etc. we used it and it was very useful. Reserve it a day before or you may not get a seat, especially for universal.To disney there were two leaving times- 8:10 and 10:45. We tried both and the 8:10 is great for getting into short lines but is very hectic to wake up to and the 10:45 bus is super crowded. I would recommend the 10:45 so you don't feel rushed like we did in the morning. At night the returning times where 6:45, 8:30, and 9:45. Leave early from the park to the bus because they come right on time. Once we came 1 minute late and watched the bus leave. We missed it and had to wait until 9:45. We came home at 8:30 and ate dinner then (cooked it at home). Nearby the hotel is a Publix supermarket which we took a 10-minute walk to along the road. Going there for food is recommended so you can cook instead of buy dinner every day. Service is sometimes slow because there is only one person working at night. We waited 10 minutes just to ask a question once. Besides that the staff are very friendly. Family trips are recommended, pool hours are good, property is very big, location great. Make sure to get a close room and lock doors (security is not the best) and leave notes for extra towels. The view from the spacious balcony is pretty good but watch out for spiders. Cleaning people just change your bed, fix bathroom, and add new tolietries and towels, so dont expect them to pick up your trash.

One tip: When you go grocery shopping, buy some of those K cups for the coffee maker, in coffee or tea or whatever you like. They give you a few, but the extras in the marketplace were kind of expensive. The pool toys were actually more reasonable in the marketplace at Floridays, and the bartender blew up our pool rings with a compressor for us. The pool is very nice--a spray area for kids, and it is pretty large. If I could offer one suggestion, it would be a slide of some sort. Kids love slides. The shuttle to Disney and Universal was very helpful. Just make sure you book a spot with the concierge a day ahead. They say sometimes the shuttles get full, but ours never did. We checked out Gatorland while down there, and ended up spending 7 hours there and having just as much fun as at the big theme parks, at a fraction of the cost.

We came to Orlando as part of an event and, as a result, we were able to view many properties surrounding the Convention Center. What makes Floridays Resort stand out from its competition is both the quality of the accommodation and the management. We stayed in a two bedroom condominium, our friends in a three bedroom. Our request to be located close to each other was happily accommodated by check in staff. Units are owned by private individuals/corporations and can be used for up to six months by the owner. For the other six months, they are placed in a vacation rental pool where the owner is allocated a share of the profits. The units are large, amazingly comfortable and well maintained. The Master bedroom in each style has a king size bed, lovely view, and Jacuzzi housed in a huge bathroom. The additional bedrooms have two double beds and share a second bathroom. Other amenities include large flat screen television, DVD/tape player in living room, balcony with chairs and a table, washer/dryer, dishwasher, coffee machine, and toaster. Elevators to the units are spacious. Between the A and B buildings is a terrific swimming pool with outdoor cafe and bar. The staff at the property is professional and friendly. Responses to problems (like losing your key) are practically instantaneous. Everyone from the gardener to the front desk staff has a smile and friendly word. And the friendliness is contagious. It is a tribute to the management that they are able to hire and train such an excellent staff in this very competitive marketplace. This property maintains the highest standards in every respect. Kudos to every single employee who work hard to make this a first rate property. The location is fabulous at the quiet end of International Drive, very close to Sea World. Benihana is almost in the parking lot for a convenient go to restaurant after a busy day of Orlando activities.

Also, you may want to bring extra coffee--the coffee makers are those fancy Keurig things, so for us \"common\" folk, it was too pricey to buy it just for our vacation. They give you a starter kit of a few packs, & then you can buy more at their little on-site store. We just got instant at the publix next door. We got our Universal Studios tickets from the on site concierge & they were $50 cheaper than the Universal website!

I booked through AAA and could not beat the price at Floridays. The units at Floridays are a great value considering what others charge per night for similiar units. Our unit was clean with a great view of the lake and pool and plenty spacious for our family of 4. The \"refresh\" housekeeping was plenty adequate for us and I would think would be more than enough for most. We did cook in our unit and found plenty of utensils, pans etc. to get the job done, however, the pans are showing some wear. Our non-stick pan was pretty rough to the point my wife would not use it, so I called and within 10 mins someone was at the door with a pan - great customer service. Also, the handles on some of the pots were loose, so I had to use a butter knife to tighten the screws - no big deal, but I shouldn't have to do it, and for management, this could be a huge liability issue for you if someone dumps a pot of boiling water on themselves due to a loose handle. My only other issue was the coffee maker. They have switched over to single cup Keurig coffee makers which probably seemed like a good idea in theory, but if you have a couple of coffee drinkers in your group it is painful. Each cup takes 3 mins to brew and when you are waiting for that first cup and have to stand in line, that can seem like forever. If you can stand the wait, go next door to Publix and buy a box of K-cups for your stay. We brought coffee and filters from home and were suprised by the single cup maker, but once again I called, and within 10 mins someone was at the door with a regular 12 cup coffee maker - again great customer service. It sounded like they were going to keep a stash of the old style coffee makers around for requests like mine. That's it for my negatives and they are really minor - overall we could not have been happier with our unit. The location is also wonderful, you are really close to everything. We had a rental car, but it looked like you can get around without via the trolley and resort shuttle service. Publix grocery and the outlet mall are around the corner as well as a few places to eat - also the outlet mall has a huge food court with a variety of options.

We were close to the little pool and it was never crowded there. The main pool was a 15 minute walk away and was very festive with music playing and a little more crowded. The only room service you got was that they emptied the trash and replaced old towels daily. The employees were nice and pleasant. But I only had one issue with this place. They locked the thermostat to 72-76 degree F only, If you wanted it hotter or colder you would have to call them every time because their system won't let you change the thermostat within that 5 degree range. After calling them twice to change the temperature we just bundle up in the morning til it got warmer during the evening, Even when it was set at 76 degree it still didn't feel like 76 degree inside the room unless it was warmer during the day. Very inconvenient. I don't recommend staying here on colder days especially if you don't want to wait on maintenance.

This should be the number 1 ranked hotel in the area. We just returned for a four night stay in a three bedroom suite. The hotel was inexpensive for what we stayed in, crystal clean, very convenient and easy to get to the parks, grounds were fabulous, staff was amazing and helpful and things couldn't have been better except for the Kitchen. While the kitchen was fully set up for cooking simple meals the hotel provided a Keurig coffee pot and service. This is a coffee pot that you make one cup at a time in using a prepackaged coffee packet. The hotel provided the first two packets free ( ie two free cups of coffee for 8 adults) and after that, you had to go to the Marketplace on site and buy single 1 cup packs for $1.65 apiece. Or you could buy made starbucks coffee at the Marketplace which we did after day one since we had four plus coffee drinkers in the group. Given a choice since we were eating breakfast in to save money, a regular coffee pot would have been preferred so that we could have gone and bought regular ground coffee at the close by Publix and made a pot every morning. I do not know if this was the situation in every room, but in a three bedroom suite that sleeps 8 adults, two cups of \"free\" coffee did not go very far and while we do like starbucks coffee, all things considered would have preferred to have an option for brewing our own to save some $$$$. That said, I cannot say enough about this place. Would definately go back and recommend to family groups but might tote my own coffee brewer next time.

We wanted to give Floridays a try as well because of the Trip Advisor ratings and because our famly of 6 would be better able to spread out for a few days. We were disappointed. The room just didn't seem clean. The carpet seemed dirty and it's probably do for a refurbish. I found hairballs behind doors in a couple places. If we were staying there longer I probably would have put the cleaning closet to use and given it an overhaul myself. I also found my allergies acting up by the second day, probably due to it being a pet-friendly property.

Its a very nice place, great price, well located, nice amenities, clean and updated. Nice pool - kids were able to swim because it is heated to 83 degrees. I did not mind that there is only light housekeeping because I don't like people in my room while I am there. There is a washer and dryer so if you are determined to have fresh towels everyday you could always throw them in the machine. But really, do you wash your towels everyday at home? The only thing I didn't like was that the suite is long and narrow so there is not a ton of room around the dining table and in the living room. I have stayed in other 2 bedroom condos that have more sq footage or a different layout that is a bit more spacious. Also, this is hard to describe but to get to your room you walk along an outdoor walkway - you are not walking down an indoor hall the way you would in a hotel - this is not a problem but one of the bedroom's windows is right on the outdoor hall so you hear people walking right by your bedroom window. It was not a big deal for us because it was pretty quiet when we were there but some people may not like this. The staff at Floridays are top notch - very friendly and helpful. Took the shuttle service to Disney one day when hubby went golfing - it is a good service, takes 10 mins to get to Epcot but from there you have to take a monorail to Disney transport hub and then another monorail or Ferry to Magic Kingdom. Not doing that again if I can avoid it. Lots of people, lots of waiting (60 mins from hotel to MK) for something that would have taken me 20 mins to the gate by car. Bring your own pool towels, some Keurig coffee packets (they provide a few but you can buy at Publix around the corner if you don't bring extra and don't want to spend a lot at the convenience store onsite) and if you have little kids, plastic cups/bowls or do paper, cause the dishes are the real thing.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMemorable stay at Floridays\u201d", "Author": "Gqjanitorial", "ReviewID": "UR121137615", "Content": "Comfortable, functional and convenient.

The rooms are nice - probably 3-star rooms with 4-star decor. We had a 3-bedroom condo, and it slept 6 comfortably. It had a full kitchen, which was nice - the full-sized fridge gave us plenty of room to keep drinks and leftovers cold, while the oven and microwave were great for reheating. The bathrooms were confusing, though - the master bathroom, accessible only through the master bedroom, had 2 sinks, 1 for each person that room could hold. The other bathroom, which was between the 2 other bedrooms, had 1 sink for the (up to) 8 people that those rooms could hold. Both bathrooms were one big room - the toilet, shower, and sink were all in the same place, with no way to separate them. If one person is using the bathroom, it's pretty much useless for anyone else. The master bathroom also had plenty of counter space, but the other one barely had enough to hold a few cups and a bar of soap - hope you weren't planning to put any toiletries in there. Add in the complete and total lack of towel racks/shelves/anything, and you'll end up keeping your clean towels on the floor. Full disclosure - they gave us a handicapped room, so maybe they just felt that handicapped people don't deserve reasonable bathroom design. The pools were nice, as were the hot tubs. We went in October, so they weren't very crowded, but I can imagine that they would be in the summer (honestly, what in Orlando isn't?). The complex is huge, so don't expect them to be right next to your building, but the walk's not bad. The location is good - Disney World is a few minutes away, and Universal is ~15. There's a decent selection of restaurants ~10 minutes away - closer would be good, but I can see how they would have had trouble getting a plot of land this size closer to the restaurants, They do have free scheduled transportation to and from the parks every day. I don't think reservations are absolutely required, but I would certainly recommend them. You can get the times from the front desk, or they may have them hidden somewhere on their website. The transportation was good, but run by a 3rd party. This is great, because there will always be enough room for everyone - if there are too many people to fit on a bus, they can have another one there in just a couple minutes. It's also horrible, because you never know what kind of vehicle you're going to get. Our first day, we rode a nice comfortable bus to the park, but crammed into a 15-passenger van for the ride back. If you've never climbed to the back seat of one of those, trust me - it's a different game than walking down the aisle of a bus.

I had a choice of booking two hotel rooms, north of Orlando, closer to the college or this condo, which even though being south gave us the comfort of a kitchen and relaxing on the balcony. Ummm Hard choice right? I had already booked a car so the extra 10 minutes on the I-4 wasn't a big deal at all, especially as how convieniently this resort is to everything. I would not hesitate to come back here again. The girls on the front desk are some of the most personable & friendly staff I have ever dealt with. ( I have travelled all 5 continents now) I felt at ease from the moment I walked through the front door & nothing was ever a bother & no question was too stupid. I explained my parents had travelled all the way from Australia for this trip and all we really wanted was a room with some sort of a view. please, no carpark. NOT a problem, I have the perfect room for you! I was so suprised by her attitude. She was so happy to be able to help me make this special! We all know those staff who can make us feel like an idiot. You will not find them here. The condo was very spacious, 2 bedrooms, 1 with a massive king bed, whirlpool bath, shower big enough for 2. (Yup! My folks scored that one) The second bedroom 2 queens with a large enough wardrobe,plenty of hangers and a second bathroom next door. Flatscreen Tvs in both bedrooms and the lounge area. Beautiful balcony over looking one of the lakes. My only peeve was there were three of us booked into the room, yet only two chairs for the balcony. No biggie, we dragged out a captains chair from the dining table and cocktails in the afternoon, watching the ducks and tortoises was a hit! (The dining table sat 6 mind you) The kitchen is fully equipped with all of the plates, cups, glassware, pots & pans you might possibly need. Unlike other condos I have stayed in there is no extra charge for this, it comes standard. I could never understand why places charge you for a \"vacation pack\" That is why I am renting a condo. Duh! There is a Publix supermarket, 7-11 and drug store within a 4 minute walk to pick up supplies. You are no more than 5 minutes from I-4 and 3 minutes from the outlet stores. Yet it is quiet enough to be away from the hurdy-gurdy of Orlando proper. The pools and main hotel areas look great, I just didn't use them so don't feel like I can comment honestly. I asked for a late checkout on our last day at the last minute, as we were flying out at 7p.m. and it was absolutely no problem, no extra charges. Wow I was expecting at least $50 to be added to the bill. Yes there is a resort fee, but they are up front about this when you book. Read the fine print. We had a few maintanance problems while we were there, but nothing I felt important enough to call down for, really trivial stuff. I left a list with the front desk when we checked out, and I have full confidence they have been addressed. I have never done that at any other hotel I have stayed at. This is the feeling I got from Floridays. Whether I am right or wrong I feel that they really do care that, we the travellers, enjoy our time with them. I really feel like they want us to be happy and more importantly to come back.

Admittedly, there are quite a few tower blocks on the complex, but it is well spread out and you rarely see anyone - with no noise, either! Rooms were big, perfect for our family of 4. Everything exceptionally clean, a little dated (not tired), but really, given the location and purpose of our trip, who cares. Full size kitchen, dining room and living area. Bedrooms big and very comfortable and bathrooms huge. Pool was good, though we were so busy out and about, we did not really spend much time there. Great location for the various Disney parks and there is a shuttle bus that takes you there from the resort, which was great, but we ended up relying on taxis mostly and occasionally the i-trollley. There is a Walgreens and Publix supermarket about 10 minutes walk or the i-trolley ride, which goes basically door to door. Every bit of junk food, lolly, etc your kids have ever seen on an American TV show, all there. Bliss! (Cheese from a can is seriously under-rated.) Additionally, there is a large outlet mall - Ralph Lauren, Coach, etc. We bought masses - with the dollar at parity, it is very cheap - go with empty suitcases. There are a few restaurants around - Benihana actually at the entrance to the resort. If you stay, make the effort to go to downtown Orlando. There are some great restaurants - worth making the effort for. As ever, the trick to Disneyworld/Universal is to go early. Be there 15 minutes before the park opens. Harry Potter was amazing, but VERY crowded, even at 10am. We got the park hopper tickets but, to be honest, given the logistics to get from one park to another, whilst not excessive, will take at least 30 minutes. Would recommend doing all the Disney parks. However, kids and husband were not overly impressed with the water parks. Wetn'Wild in QLD better, apparently. During our trip of a month, we stayed everywhere from uber trendy hotels in Miami, very grand resorts in the Bahamas and some down-to-earth places in between. Floridays is not grand, but it is really well located, the staff are seriously helpful and nice. When we returned there on our last night, before heading home, it felt really good to be there again.

From the outside, the resort is rather unspectacular and at first we thought we had picked a dud. On entering the 3rd floor room however, I began to understand the very high ratings the resort had on this site. Pros: -The queen sized master bed looked so enticing after a long flight and was always well made on a daily basis. The separate beds in the second rooms were huge! -The air conditioning remained a wonderful remedy for the heat. -The staff were always ready to assist before you even asked. -The resort was so comfortable that once we decided to stay in all afternoon! Great huge microwave, fridge/freezer and kitchen utensils. -The resort is close to Publix, a supermarket, which stocked virtually everything we needed. We shopped so much given that the prices were great that it was a welcome relief that our suite was by the lift on the 3rd floor (which was usually nice and quiet all through). --It is also close to Outback Steakhouse which a taxi driver said was the best around (sadly I didn't manage to visit) and Benihana and the south branch of the Premium Outlet (although we decided to take the 20min drive to the other branch). -The shuttle service to the attractions (SeaWorld, Universal and Disney). Cons (more like little blips): -On arrival, no one offered to assist with our suitcases until we asked. As the saying goes, ask and you shall receive; and we did receive assistance without fuss. -The rooms are not really cleaned; only the beds are made and towels replaced. -The TV's were a bit dated, but few would care really as there wasn't much time for TV watching (managed to catch the Manchester United v liverpool game there though which was wonderful). -I ordered some dinner from the cafe and requested that they ring me when it was ready so that I could pop down to pick it up. 50mins or so later, no one had rung. I went down to the cafe only to be told that the food had long been ready (getting cold in the corner) and they had rung me repeatedly but no one answered the phone. I explained that I was sat next to the phone for nearly an hour and no one called. I had a look at the slip which he had printed out and noticed that the room number on it was wrong; clearly they had been ringing the wrong room! I drew the fellow's attention to this, but unbelievable, he said nothing and rudely walked off! He was the sole embarrassment to a fine resort. -The shuttle service only departed after 10am, so if you want to beat the initial queues and get there by 9am (as we did on day 1), then I suggest you take a taxi if you don't have a car. If so, you'd be advised to get the number of the taxi from the airport and use them or the taxis outside the attractions instead of booking through the resort ($25-$28, as opposed to $40 per trip). Also, the shuttles have a fixed early evening return time; which is no good if you/the kids want to see the famed Disney fireworks display at 9pm, for example.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat - in line with other reviews\u201d", "Author": "frank a", "ReviewID": "UR120706840", "Content": "Reviews on Trip Advisor were spot on.

I think, that should be included in $15 of daily RESORT FEE !!! The RESORT FEE is just hidden costs that add up and make your stay more expensive. just skip the resort fee and make the price of the rooms a 'real' price.

Don't know if that will be the same in busy season, but we had nothing to complain about here. I said the location is not as convenient but it's not bad at all : 7 minutes from Seaworld, 20 minutes from Universal (didn't go to Disney but seems the same) with our car : that was probably less than waiting for the bus and the long ride you have from most Disney's hotels to the parks. Only difference, you pay for the parking and it's expensive (15 to 20 usd per park and per day). But it was so flexible... Kids enjoyed the very well maintainded swimming pool (the big, we didn't try the small one). Restaurants and stores very close (5 minutes walking).

There are hotel fees to be paid at check out too, about $10 per day plus tax. We were a family of 5, stayed in building B with a pool view. When our balcony doors were opened you could hear some noise from the pool but it didn't bother us at all. Pool was lovely, opened from 7am till 11pm which was nice after a long day at the parks. Children had lots of fun using it. Concierge in hotel lobby were very helpful at sorting out any concerns and booking shuttle buses to the theme parks. The hotel is situated at the south end of International drive which happens to be the very quiet end, is near to Publix (grocery store) and Walgreens (pharmacy) and a few other shops, about a 10 min walk from hotel. We choose not to drive on this trip and relied on the I trolley as well as the local Lynx buses, there a bus stop right in front of the hotel. The I trolley is good if you only plan on going up and down International drive but if you plan on venturing out then the Lynx buses would suit you better. The lynx buses were not as frequent as we would of liked which made journeys seem very long especially with young kids so if you can afford it I would advise you to hire a car, it would make getting around easier and quicker. The housekeeping service at Floridays is very limited as other reviews have made mention of, beds are made, trash bag changed and towels replaced. Their policy is to do a full clean, 7 days of you being there, if you wish for your room to be clean thoroughly everyday then you have to pay extra for that service. They provide you with a vacuum cleaner, mop etc and a few starter kits for dishwasher, washing machine etc. Overall we had a good stay and would recommend and stay there ourselves again.

We stayed in the second bedroom that was immediately adjacent to the hallway (with a window to the hallway), which was a bit noisey in the evening. We go to bed early, and we could often hear families with loud kids walking by as we were trying to sleep. I needed earplugs. We were also close to the elevators, so you could even hear them being used. This hotel was close to a couple of sights, including: a helicopter ride attraction practically across the street; Sea World; Orlando Premium Outlets on Vineland Ave. The latter outlet was our favourite shopping destination in Orlando, and it's less than a 5-minute drive away from this hotel. Although it's not as big as the Prime Outlets in Orlando, I found it had a better selection, it was less sprawling, less busy, and more importantly, had better prices. For you Canadians out there, it also has a Lululemon outlet store.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cperfect holiday hotel!\u201d", "Author": "AlanBai", "ReviewID": "UR119373027", "Content": "When i reached the hotel, i realised i left my passport on the plane and immediately the staff called the airport and the airline and located my passport for me.

The kids will get plenty of Disney by being at the parks trust me they only care about water, not that the pool is shaped like a Disney princess! From having stayed at the Disney properties, most people take the shuttles and there is always a wait, just rent a car and bring a GPS you are only 5-10min from the parks staying here and the value is great, more $$$ to spend at the parks! There is a Publix right down the street so get yourself some groceries and make your own breakfast and keep snacks handy and it will save you some $$$ , you can even reheat anything later you bring home from dinner! They also have a grocery delivery service, though we didn't use it, where you can have your groceries for when you get there, this would be huge even if you just used it for diapers and stuff so you didn't have to pack it!

If you need the Disney experience I understand I've done it myself, enjoy paying for it though!

Fully stocked kitchen with granite countertops (includes dishwasher, microwave, plates, glasses, silverware, cookware, coffeemaker, etc.), apartment-sized washer and dryer, large dining table with glass top in separate dining area, nice living area with flat screen TV, regular TVs in bedrooms, and balcony. Resort is about five years old and very reasonably priced. Maid provides clean towels each day, empties the trash, and makes beds. You can pay extra for full maid service but if you straighten and wipe up as needed, that shouldn't be necessary. We had a little problem getting enough towels and a few other things for the room but when we called the front desk, someone from Housekeeping brought what we needed right to our room and Guest Services called afterwards to confirm we got what we requested.

Game room for kids and a small exercise room. Staff was very friendly. Only downside is business center. It's run by an outside firm and you have to pay via a machine to use the computer for a certain number of minutes and pay 75 cents a page to print from it. It's frustrating to use and I would advise against trying to print your airline boarding passes -- that would probably run you 10 bucks for a family of four. This area of International Drive is still not real developed but there are drug stores, gas stations, a grocery store and similar businesses just down the road.

Wow, we got an incredibly spacious 3 bedroom/2 bath condo (approx 1100 sf) for $143/night with balcony. Master bedroom had king bed and a large bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub. Other two bedrooms had two queens and shared a large bathroom with shower. All beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows. Individually controlled a/c. Full kitchen with granite counters, fridge, stove, microwave, and dishwasher. Stacked washer/dryer in unit. Lots of utensils, glasses and dishes. Cookware is limited, so I recommend checking what is available before you plan your meals (for instance, no large pot to boil pasta for 2-3 people, and only small frying pan). Customer service is excellent. Any question we had was cheerfully answered. The concierge went out of his way to print e-tickets for us. Every need was met (and followed up on by the front desk). Except for housekeeping, the customer service exceeded every expectation. I can understand why previous reviewers are disappointed with housekeeping. Here is what you need to know. Daily housekeeping is limited and includes only making the beds (with existing linens), replacing bathroom towels, and emptying trash. I was prepared for this, so not too disappointed. For short stays this level of service is adequate, but not impressive. The bed-making skills are basic at best - wrinkled sheets, covers a bit askew - but not that big a deal. There is a tiny (and I mean tiny) trashcan in the kitchen that is emptied daily, but no extra trash bags are provided. We found it helpful to save grocery bags to use for kitchen trash as there is just not enough room in that tiny trashcan for even a day's worth of refuse. Providing extra trash bags would be a simple, but very useful addition to housekeeping service. If you stay for a week, or have several kids, you would need to either be prepared to do some extra kitchen and bathroom cleaning or speak to the front desk about paying for extra housekeeping. Two packets of dish washing detergent and one packet of laundry detergent (nice unexpected touch) were provided. The main pool is very large, clean and nice and includes a hot tub area (6-8 people). There is a pool bar (which I didn't try), but we brought our own adult beverages from the room and no one questioned us. Plenty of towels at the pool (thin quality, but decent size). Plenty of chairs. There is also a second smaller pool at the back of the complex near building F. The main pool also has a small gym and a game room (limited video games and air hockey table). This is a large complex with 6 buildings. A is the closes to the main pool, F is the furthest away. We were in F. On the plus side, it is nice and quiet (away from International Drive). The downside is the long trip to main pool and entrance/exit of the resort. We had a lake view. I would not have accepted a room in this building with a view of the parking lot (far away and bad view would not be worth it). The smaller pool near building F is fine for some and borders on a man-made lake. However, if you have kids, or if you want access to a pool bar, you will need to go to the main pool. You can either walk (10+ min) or drive. The drive from building F to exit the premises was the only annoying thing about our stay. It is not a direct drive. You hit multiple speed bumps, stop signs and turns. It gets really old after a few days. This is a planning problem that the resort could solve by paving a back exit to International Drive. Resort is 10-15 min from the Disney parks; 5 min from Sea World/Aquatica; 10-15 min from Universal. Great central location. Resort provides park shuttles, which we didn't use since the times didn't fit our plans. Parking at Floridays is \"free\" as is WIFI. But, really its included in the mandatory $12/day resort fee. WIFI worked very well in our room. Overall, a great value for money. Clean and comfortable with a great central location.

It is only about a 10 minute walk to the Publix supermarket so it was nice to have some more home-style meals in our room rather than eating out all the time. We did get a bit sick of the food at the hotel (quality is fine but limited choice). There is a Benihana near the hotel car-park that was just fantastic (the chef cooks in front of you and puts on a great show). The apartment also had a 6 person dining table, lounge area with flat screen TV and balcony. We had the 2 bedroom apartment which also has 2 bathrooms (1 with corner spa). Everything was very clean. Having a washer & dryer was just fantastic as we were travelling light and washing often. The pool area is just wonderful and we struggled to get our 11yo out of it. We were only there for 6 days and spent 4 at Disneyworld and 2 at Universal. Take my tip and book extra days just to enjoy this wonderful RESORT! The only downside of our stay was the transportation to/from the theme parks. There are limited times to/from Disneyworld and they only go to Epcot. It can then take you a while to use Disneyworld transport (bus, monorail or boat) to the other \"worlds\". There were more bus times to/from Universal. The bus services a number of hotels so be warned that the trip can take a while (best was 25 minutes and worst nearly an hour). We were also disappointed that despite being booked on a bus one day (as they insist), the bus left without us. The concierge said we were late by 2 minutes but my watch said we were dead on time. Since we were booked for the bus, couldn't they have waited 2 minutes for us?

We enjoyed making dinner together and even baked a home-made cake for our birthday girl! It was a great deal when packaged with our Universal tickets. What a special treat not to be stuffed like sausages in a tiny hotel room. The last time we stayed in Orlando four years ago, we stayed at a Universal resort close to the park. That hotel was plesant and the Tiki theme was cute, and we took advantage of the Luau. But, our room there had no charm whatsoever and it really put a damper on our fun. There were two adults and two kids and the room was so tiny we could barely move about without banging into furniture. We were miserable, and didn't sleep well at all. We woke up sore, crabby and stiff. You could tell the room was designed to motivate families OUT of the room and into the $$$ areas of the hotel and park. WHAT A DIFFERENCE AT FLORIDAYS RESORT!! From the minute we pulled in, we were impressed with how beautiful and well-kept the grounds were. We felt like we were at someplace more exotic than Orlando, that's for sure, and the break from the commercialism that is the life-blood of Orlando was a welcome relief. The kids were so excited to see the size of the room and really enjoyed the beautiful swimming pool! We were able to live comfortably during our visit, just like we were at home. There were five of us this time, four adults and one teen, and all of us had our own private space and our own TV. We could really kick back and BREATHE! Even the happiest of families need to spread out a little bit after being jammed into an airplane seat for a few hours, then packed into a rental car and cozied up on rides all day, right? The jacuzzi was heaven after a long day enjoying ourselves at Universal, and being able to relax at a real dining room table over a reasonably-priced, self-cooked dinner was divine.

The kitchen has everything that you need to make the kiddos breakfast before you head out to the parks and there is a Publix grocery store and Walgreens within walking distance to get everything that you need. The pool is beautiful and the children's area is perfect for letting the little one's play with other children and giving you an opportunity to have adult conversations with those from all over the world. We had a great time meeting a family from the UK and it was nice getting to talk with them. Overall, I would recommend this resort to anyone travelling to the Orlando theme parks and say that if you want to feel that you are \"home\" during your vacation, choose Floridays.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Lansing, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "CGlenday", "ReviewID": "UR118178303", "Content": "My daughter and I loved staying at the hotel.

They also provided coffee and tea on the counter, along with dishwasher and washer dryer cleaning supplies. Yes, the room also had a washer dryer which was nice! Room service was once a day. They provided fresh towels, removed the trash and made the bed. They DO NOT clean dishes. We were more than happy with the room service. Plus we cleaned our own dishes or used the dishwasher. I think they have additional services for a fee but I\u2019m not sure what that was. We were very happy with room service. My only issue was with the d\u00e9cor. I wish that it was a little bit more updated! But regardless of the d\u00e9cor, the resort was excellent. POOL The pool was nice and it had a little kids section which was great. They provided towel at the pool. Right near the pool was a caf\u00e9 and bar. The frozen drinks were about $6.50, small pizza was about $8.50, and hot dog meal (w/fruits and juice) was about $7. They also provide a pump to inflate all pool equipment. It is located right in front of the caf\u00e9. FACILITY: Pool, Jacuzzi, workout room, arcade, small bar and caf\u00e9.

Tips: The gas station near the resort offered 2 donuts for a $1, coffee for a $1, etc... For a quick bite. The resort offers high chairs. We requested one for the room. The caf\u00e9 also sells some pool equipment and medicine such as Tylenol, etc. The Publix grocery store sells beer and wine. A six pack of Yuengling was only $7. They also have pool equipment and Disney themed gifts. The balloon ride at Disney marketplace is about $18 a person. It goes up about 400ft. It was completely gated so kids can go on it. Not very exciting but something to do. Bongos is a good Cuban restaurant at Disney Marketplace. Animal Kingdom was really nice \u2013 About $95 a person. Parking was about $15. $50 to rent an electric scooter for the elderly with $20 deposit. Safari was excellent. Holy land Experience was awesome. \u2013 About $35 a person.

Wonderful view of the man-made lake with a nice fountain lit at night and also a view of the smaller \"adult\" pool.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating the room was spacious and spotless, the pool was outstanding, the fitness center was great, the arcade was a ton of fun...I could go on and on. The best and most important part of the whole Floridays experience (drum roll please), IT WAS AFFORDABLE!!!!!!!! We could not believe that there was so much available to us for such a great price! We stayed at another resort last year and the rooms were signifcantly smaller, there was less to do, the pool was in poor shape and it cost about $700 more than Floridays. Another plus for Floridays is that they offer free Wi-Fi in the rooms. At the other resort, we had to pay $5.00 per hour to use the internet in the lobby and even more to utilize it in the room. Floridays has several buildings, but the closest ones to the main pool area are Buildings A and B. However, if one stays in the other buildings, they have a staff member that will pick you up in a shuttle and take you to and from the pool, lobby, fitness center, etc. How accommodating! The Disney parks and Sea World were right at our fingertips! Every place we were interested in was also close by and just a short drive away. The location of Floridays was perfect for us! My teenage daughter and her best friend loved Floridays as well and they had a blast! They were able to go places and do activities on their own, which allowed my husband and me to spend some time alone together. But we were able to do many family activities together, which was great fun. My husband and I have told all of our extended family members and friends about Floridays. We were planning to return this October, but because of work schedules, it looks like we'll have to wait until next year. I usually want time to move slowly, but I'm anxious for next summer to get here so we can go back to Floridays!

We seem to find ourselves in Orlando with the kids a couple of times each year(Springbreak and Thanksgiving -This year it will be 3 times since we elected to visit over the 4th of July). Long story short, Floridays is awesome. Staff goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome, from the front desk, through housekeeping, groundskeepers, cooks, bartenders etc. From what I have gathered from the staff, it all starts with Rob(i think it is Rob) the GM. I don't know Rob(although he has been pointed out to me as he out walking around checking up on guests and having casual conversations with the staff- no wonder they love him) so please don't think I am one of those folks who is helping out a friend. We are a family of 5 (3 kids ages 5,7& 10) from Iowa, occassionly we bring along my mother or mother in law. Each visit has been exactly what we expected; very clean, spacious( we usually book a 3 bedroom, but have also stayed in the two bedroom), well maintained, wonderful place. I travel extensively for work , therefore I am confident my opinion is a good one. By the way, I hate to say it, but we were drawn in to stay at the neighboring property(very colorful name) ealier this year and couldn't wait to get back to Floridays - we won't try that again. In addition to the outstanding accomodations and staff, the location of Floridays is perfect. We are annual passholders for Seaworld/Aquatica(make two seperate visits and you are money ahead with a annual pass) and also buy 10 day non-expiring Disney park hoppers(did i mention we love Orlando). Floridays' location allows us to be at either location in less than 10 minutes. Grocery store is close, drug store is closer. Great restuarants withing 5 minutes, although if you are arriving late(after 11:00PM) be prepared for pizza rolls from the nearby convenience store. Pizza places leaving coupons under the door are horrible. Cocoa Beach is 55 minutes to the public beach (our kids love it, be sure to stop at Ron Jon and the SandBar)and the gulf, if you are headed west, ) is a little more than an hour( I recommend Siesta Key). Anyway, I could go on and on about Floridays, but I wiil stop and hope what I have shared is enough info for you to take my word. One more disclaimer-- this is my first trip advisor review, although I use it extensively. I usually throw out the best and the worst reviews to hopefully get the truth, but I hope you dont though this one out. You will not regret it. Maybe I will see you over Thanksgiving; My wife and I will be sucking down a \"Miami Vice' from the pool bar while the kids are laughing their way through the Hula Hoop contest before Thanksgiving dinner poolside in Aquatica.(dont think that doesn't upset the rest of our extended family who will be carving up the traditional turkey and fixins back in Iowa, while the snow flies).

It was just the sort of place we needed for our first week in Orlando (our second week was on a Cruise out of Port Canaveral) as we had our days pretty much mapped out before we arrived. Therefore, at the end of a busy day, it was a pleasure to get back to our suite to 'chill'. We booked a 2 bedroom suite and we have 3 children, so tow of the kids shared one of the double beds in the twin room. The suite was very spacious and had all mod cons. We did eat out most of the time but found the kitchen to be equipped with all that was needed for out stay. the huge fridge with ice maker was fab at keeping the bottled water and beer cold. Didn't think I'd use the washer/dryer as I wasn't planning on doing chores whilst on Holiday but it came in very useful towards the end of the week ready for our weeks cruise. The kids ate in the pool cafe a couple of times and the food seemed great, well the kids didn't complain. We stayed in block D which was a short walk from the main pool area and resort reception. Towels are provided at the pool, so need need to pack your own. This place is excellent value for money. Being a family of 5, we generally have to book interconnecting rooms at hotels unless we have the kids sleeping in our room which is not much of a holiday! this can also be pricey, so staying in a suite resort is a very good alternative and how else would you get a decent place to stay for around \u00a395 per night for 5? We really enjoyed our stay, infact we enjoyed it that much that we booked a suite for the day we returned home. We had to be off ship for 9am and had already booked a private transfer from ship to Seaworld but changed this halfway through our first week.

There are great places to eat within minutes from the resort. The apartments are great as we had 2 bedrooms at less than a hotel room rate . We had an en-suite attached to the main bedroom and my 2 teenage daughters had a double bed each with tv and their own bathroom. Both pools are more than adequate and never get overly busy ..... There is always a lounger to be found. I would definitely go back without hesitation. The only down sides that we found were as follows....... 1. The beds are made up and towels changed daily but the room is not vacuumed and there is no vacuum cleaner so you could have crisps food etc on your carpet for 2 weeks. This can be easily sorted by the management within the service charge which i believe is excessive 2. The Bar Tenders are generally poor with Carolina being exceptional and very attentive and acknowledges your needs and gets into a conversation . Apart from her the others just make you wait and do not acknowledge you and in 2 cases even ignored me to my anger . They have no system of who was first to be served and just serve the first person they see . they also have their friends or colleagues around the bar which I find unprofessional and distractive. When it comes to settling the bill they become friendly and smile as they want their tip ............. They don't deserve one for the service they provide . If the management can sort out the 2 issues mentioned this a 5 star excellent place to stay but all in all you don't have to use their bar .......

TIP: BOOK DIRECTLY THROUGH FLORIDAYS WEBSITE. I seriously spent several hours going through every single third-party agent and Floridays gave the best rate using their Website options. Floridays\u2019 customer service was great from the beginning. I had made a reservation online but forgot to put in my AAA number for the special rate. I made a phone call and had the rate changed by a pleasant customer-service agent in 10 minutes and had an electronic receipt within 20 minutes. When I arrived for check-in I was very impressed. The main lobby was ornately decorated and the guest service personnel were extremely friendly and helpful. I waited only 2-3 minutes in line before I was attended to for check-in. When I walked into the 3-bedroom suite, it was better looking than even the pictures had shown. The rooms were immaculate, the kitchens clean and the bathrooms sparkling. It was very spacious and the layout really adds to the spacious dynamic because the kitchen runs straight into the dining room and living room. The rooms are carpeted and the bathrooms and kitchen are tiled, which makes for a very modern look. The furniture wasn\u2019t as modern looking, but was in pretty clean condition. The master bedroom was very open and the bathroom was only accessible from inside the master room. The other 2 bedrooms were on the other side of the suite, so there was lots of privacy. The master bedroom King was firm but comfortable and the pillows were soft. The guest bedrooms had two large twin beds in each. The Jacuzzi bathtub in the master was a lot of fun and the jets were very relaxing after a day of traveling. The walls were not terribly thick, but we didn\u2019t have too much of a noise issue because there was no one staying in the neighboring suite and we were on the edge of the building. The guest rooms didn\u2019t hear much noise because the central A/C unit was in their hallway, and the unit made a soft hum that helped dampen sounds. The kitchen was great because it was fully loaded. It had cooking pans, utensils, glass cups, wine glasses a blender and more. It really felt like being at home. The balcony was a fun treat. We faced another hotel and a grass field, but the view didn\u2019t matter because we were looking for a more private scene which this location (building F) provided. It had two chairs and a table and could comfortably hold three people sitting out there. The supplies were sufficient for our 2-day stay. We were given the standard bath soaps and towels as well as dish detergent, dishwashing soap for the dishwasher, a paper towel roll, toilet paper, ice bucket, a new sink sponge, coffee kit, tea and Tide Laundry detergent for 1 load. (I hear you may want to bring some extra supplies if you stay for more than 3 days.) The washer and dryer worked great and we used it to clean our clothes which were wet from swimming. The Wi-Fi was decent. It would occasionally blip out, but no real connection problems. The only defect in the suite was that one of the kitchen lights was out, but the room has so many different lights that it didn\u2019t make a difference. The Housekeeping included: Replacing our towels. Replenishing our bathroom amenities. Housekeeping made our beds like. Housekeeping took out the trash \u2013 including extra bags we ended up filling. Full Maid service costs another $40 (sheet change, cleaning), but we really didn\u2019t need it for the weekend as cleaned up after ourselves. We brought some black trash bags, extra papers towels and extra toilet paper which ended up being handy. I figured spending a few dollars would be worth the time instead of having to request extra service. A Publix was 1/4 mile away as well as several restaurants. It was very convenient and we bought a pizza to cook in the oven \u2013 which came out great! Check-out was at 11 a.m. We were about 15 minutes late to it but they didn\u2019t seem to care which was very considerate. Overall, I cannot imagine why anyone would want to stay anywhere else. For the price, you get the comfort of home and more space than you know what to do with. It is great for families or for a relaxing birthday weekend (which mine was). The only consideration someone may have is noise and traffic. If you want to be by the main pool and don\u2019t mind kids everywhere and the traffic, take a building toward the front. If you want peace and quiet, take a building by the back. I would recommend this resort to anyone looking to have a full-featured hotel at a very inexpensive rate.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cLike flying a low cost airline\u201d", "Author": "maumac", "ReviewID": "UR116721094", "Content": "I consider myself an eclectic traveler, having stayed in hostels to six star hotels. I have stayed in Floridays based on my wife experience and reviews on Tripadvisor. In my opinion, staying there is like flying a low cost airline, you know you are going to the get the basics, everything else is extra. The problem is they don't tell you in advance how much they are going to cost. Although the infrastructure is comfortable, it lacks in services and cleanliness. For instance, given we don't live in the US, we did some shopping on the internet, just to find out that the hotel has a $10 fee for handling each package that was delivered to a guest. In the end, they cancelled part of the fees, but it was very annoying that they even tried to charge it. I was at the front desk one day and overheard the front desk lady speaking to the bell boy receiving one package: \"Is it heavy? Let me make sure I will double charge it.\" That made me believe that there is no criteria to charge it besides the frontdesk mood. I wouldn't have a problem with it if it was clearly described by the time I made our reservation. Not the case though. The daily maid service lacks in quality, and from what I witnessed not even wiping the bathroom floor was performed. Given that we stayed there for over a week, we decided to hire the full maid service one day for $40 (you have to reserve it one day ahead). Honestly, it felt that it was exactly like the \"basic\" service. One positive aspect of our stay: My pregnant wife needed to see a doctor while we were there. The concierge, Nilda, was very helpful and recommended a doctor that was very helpful. In conclusion, if you want to stay in a place where your room will be cleaned each day and there are packages you are going to have delivered, beware of the hidden fees.

The biggest disappointment at Floridays is that this resort doesn't offer anything besides the pool & game room to entertain the kids...there is no theater room, play room, mini golf, water sports, water slide, pirate ship or playground. Also, there is a lack of scheduled activities.

There is a Publix right next door and a pretty impressive outlet mall too if you are into that. All of the Disney parks are within 5-10 minute drive. There are also some great restaurants in the vicinity.

Everything was nearly as expected as I had read lots of reviews on Floridays. Don't go here if your expecting to stay in a hotel because Floridays isn't one, it is a large self catering complex with little or no service that you would expect from a hotel. Never stayed in a hotel where they don't clean your room unless you pay extra and where there is no bell service. So when you arrive at 11 pm after a 30 hour journey you have to struggle with 4 large suitcases, 2 sleeping children, in the middle of a thunder storm and no parking within 100 yards of the building.There was no offer of help. Units are a very good size, comfortable and well equipt. Furniture needs updating and there was quit a bit of dust, even though I rang before I arrived to let them know I had a child with astham. We stayed here for 11 nights and the only contact we had with the front desk was to pick up a package I had ordered to be delivered , which was there for 3 days before I had to ask for it. This is the first place I have ever stayed at where they didn't call us to ask if everything was alright with the room and if there was anything we needed or if they could help us with anything. Pool area looked ok, didn't use the facilities much as we had to get in the car to get to main pool area and bar. If your looking for a self catering resort then Floridays is not a bad choice and I must say it's very well located for all the attractions. But if your looking for a hotel and all the thing you expect from one then you may be disappointed. Value for money? Not really, you get what you pay for. I had to laugh on checking out, there was a extra daily charge for service added to the bill. Our unit was only cleaned once in 11 days and we never had any contact with anyone from Floridays.

We have stayed at many Disney area hotels, including the Boardwalk in the park and when you look at what you're getting for the money, the Floridays ranks number one for value. We stayed in a three bedroom condo - the girls had one bedroom (with a double bed for each girl), and the boys had the other. They had a HUGE bathroom and a linen closet, all on their own \"wing.\" The living quarters were a good size, with a full size, well stocked kitchen, dining area and living room with 37\" plasma TV. My husband and I had wonderful privacy in our king bedroom suite off of the living room...and far enough away from the kids' wing for privacy. Our bathroom was very large and icluded a jacuzzi tub that my kids took advantage of often. The hotel staff was extremely friendly accomodating. Ray, our bell captain not only delivered our luggage but gave us a tour of the condo when we arrived so we wouldn't question where anything was or miss one of the many features! The main pool (we were lucky enough to stay in building A, closest to the action) was all the kids' needed an then some after a long day at the parks. Our bartender at the pool bar was extremely kind and friendly, and mentioned that sometimes the pool bar remained opened until 1am if the crowd was still there, enjoying the live entertainment that is there on the weekends. The Palm Cafe was a great resource the occasional breakfast sandwich or snack. My husband would make nightly treks to the nearby grocery store, Publix to fill up our frig with drinks to bring to the park the next day. There is also a Walgreens in that same shopping center, as well as a Chinese food restaurant and Subway. We also ate dinner one night at the Benihana in the parking lot of the hotel - walking distance. The food, and the show that the Hibachi chef put on, were fantastic! The daily shuttle service to and from the parks was reliable, on time and transported you in a plush, air conditioned bus. One HUGE bonus of this shuttles over some we've used from other hotel properties is that it went directly to and from Epcot, no picking up or dropping off other hotel guests on the way. This is a big bonus and meant that we were never on the bus for more than 15 minutes coming or going. My family and I can't say enough about the Floridays.

I read some of the reviews and though that with so many good reviews it would be tough to be disappointed. Wrong! I have visited Orlando in several occasions and stayed at the vacation properties of the Marriot chain. Good experiences with my family. Some are newer and some outdated, but overall it has been ok. I thought I could improve my stay in the area and went through the different options on this site. First impression was as expected: multiple buildings, nothing fancy. The people at the front desk were ok, but the surprises started there. We would only have a tidy up service. If we wanted full housekeeping, we should add 40 dollars per day. I decided to pay for every other day, to make sure the room was clean. Second surprise: After a long day at the parks the kids wanted to refresh at the pool. We want to get the towels,( of course a self service). There is no way to call a drag of 2 feet by 2 feet and less thick than s kitchen\u2019s cloth a towel! I wouldn\u2019t use them to wipe my car\u2019s tires! The pool's floor was covered with sand and you couldn\u2019t see more than 10 feet underwater even with goggles. So much for the pool experience. The rooms are as described, but only in size. Even though I was told they are only 4 years old, I had to wrestle with the armoire\u2019s drawers to get them closed. My kids expected to rent a movie, but there is none and no movie rentals in the property. We went to the grocery store for the minimum supplies, and asked for \u201croom service\u201d. What you get is a hamburger in a plastic box. I knew I was not staying at the Ritz Carlton, but I buy my dog's food at PetsMart and it's nicer. As for the air conditioning, it smells like a swamp or maybe there is a dead cat in the ducts. Terrible moist smell! But the worst thing is the noise, every time it turns on and off it sounds like somebody is opening a door. My little girl did not want to sleep in her room. Maybe they can use this sounds for the Tower of Terror at Disney. And finally as the jewel of the crown, regardless I asked for full clean up,we came in today, only to find out that someone was here, they kind of move the things around, and maybe pretend to say it was housekeeping. I am a single father and I have help at home, but not even me would have done this really nasty work, They just pulled the sheets and left a towel. Everything else remained the same. My bed was undone. I can\u2019t figure this out, as the day before whomever came did an ok job. My little girl found a piece of an earring in the bathroom sink, so not even they didn't clean, but not even took away their own mess, Right now I really don\u2019t think someone tried to clean up, it looks like someone pretended to clean, and now I am considering they came in just to check our stuff. By tomorrow I shall speak with the manager and try to figure out what happened. I usually think that the lousy reports are given by the Grinch and his relatives, but not this time. Do yourself a favour and stay at something that has some name in it, Sheraton Vistana, the Marriot Vacation properties or any Disney Vacation property, and avoid this place at all cost. Otherwise, stay at your own risk. I booked 8 nights, but staying 2 was 1 too much. Hopefully a Manager will stand up to this terrible experience.

We arrived on June 14th, and as soon as we turned into Floridays Orlando Resort Drive, we knew we were home. The staff at check in were their usual, professional, courteous, selves, making us feel welcomed, almost missed since our last visit, which is always nice. We had kindly asked if we could possibly be allocated in a Suite on the ground floor, as this is the only floor that has a fully-screened patio, which we prefer, as our Son is Autistic, and it's reassuring to us that he can't get up to any mischief. We were duly allocated into Suite 105 in Building C, which was in a great location- not too far from the main Pool, but far enough away not to hear noise pollution. I had a package shipped from walmart.com, which was ready and waiting for me upon check in, so i was delighted that the process worked so smoothly. Obviously, being our 3rd stay, we were very familiar with the Suite layout, and availed ourselves of all of the creature comforts of home, like dishwasher, Fridge, Microwave, and Coffee Machine. The Washer and Dryer, which are situated in a recessed Cupboard adjacent to the dining room, is very useful for doing a quick wash, either during your stay or to wash all clothes before returning home. The level of housekeeping i think depends on whether you book direct with the Resort, or by a 3rd party. We booked direct with F.O.R, and received daily Housekeeping, with a full clean every 7th day. We found Housekeeping to be all very friendly, and were happy to give you extra Dishwasher tablets/Washing Powder, if required. We found the Beds to be very comfortable, but the Pillows lacked support, and tended to slide around on the Bed. I'm used to sleeping on memory foam, so perhaps i noticed it more, but it wasn't a major problem at all. We just bought a couple of memory foam Pillows from a Tuesday Morning Store nearby for about $15, and bought them back home with us. Everyone we encountered on our visit was so friendly, and i mean everyone, from Front Desk, Concierge, Bell Hops, Security, Bar/Cafe Staff.

But this does all take time. And if you were going to a water park you would need to transfer to 2 buses to get there. Totalling 3 buses which takes just over and hour. Also the first bus to come back to the hotel at night leaves at 6.15 which was too late to come back for swims etc and the last bus at 9.15 which was too early for the Disney fire works. And the only two transfers the hotel provided in the mornings were at 8.15 or 10.45 which made a very early or very late start.

The average stay was 5 nights for our group. Many of us (ages 5-90 years) wished we\u2019d spent more daylight hours at the resort in the main pool area. Our days were filled with Orlando activities which certainly made Floridays a \"hit\" in the evenings as the place to crash, relax, socialize and swim until pools closed. Affordability, space, location and hotel ratings were key factors to our reunion destination selection. Rooms are spacious, very clean and we certainly did not need to dine out 2-3 times daily. Anyone would feel comfortable cooking in these full-size kitchens or eating at the restaurant/pool bar. I think Floridays served the best lunch we had in 10 days. In suite laundry facilities are a perfect daily perk. My best tips: \u2022 If travelling with someone with mobility issues request a room near the main pool in buildings A, B or D. We loved that accommodation. \u2022 Book very early for the best rates, at least 6-9 months out and watch for better deals to come along. Cancellation policies are very accommodating if you find a better deal at the resort or elsewhere so read your booking details. \u2022 Book extra nights if you secure a great nightly rate, and then cancel the additional nights as time approaches if they are not needed. A quaint resort, Floridays lies in a quieter and less busy section of International Drive just south of Sea World and Aquatica Water Park. We were located within walking distance (for walkers) to Premium Outlet South, and a useful plaza with all required necessities: pharmacy, grocery, liquor, a few fast food/restaurants and other conveniences. If you don't mind public transportation Floridays Resort is doable without a car; however I would recommend renting a vehicle if you do not like transportation schedules and want to be free to explore the area and all it has to offer in a timely manner or if travelling with someone with mobility issues. Airport taxi roundtrip is roughly $85 and a 10 day car rental deal booked late was $250-300. Plenty of restaurants are nearby within a 5-10 minute drive in any direction inclusive of the Pointe Orlando/I-Drive restaurant strip. Note: Dining at Downtown Disney is closer than you think! Small drawbacks: Not many restaurant or shopping perks or discounts handed out at check-in. Resort ATM dings you in service fees; get money elsewhere! Pool closes at 11pm, midnight or 1am would be nice for night owls. This resort lies next to Blue Green Resort, which is next to Lake Eve Resort and across from Sheraton Vistana Villages. Hilton Grand Vacations Club and the Marriott Grand Vista are 1/4 -1/2 mile away in opposite directions. Floridays sits in a condominium stretch on International Drive. With a total of 5 suite bookings, overall everyone enjoyed their stay. Visitors staying elsewhere also complimented the accommodations.

Kitchen had a large microwave oven, coffee maker, dishwasher, blender, electric can opener, lots of luxuries, soap powder and dishwasher powder was replaced when used, there was also a hoover, iron and ironing board and 2 hairdryers. DVD player and 3 televisions. Wifi was great as we had 2 laptops with us. Jacuzzi bath was a wonderful luxury to have. Rooms consisted of very comfortable King size bed and 2 double beds in the 2nd room. We did not use the varanda as we had a ground floor room, never saw any bugs at all. This is a first for us on International Drive. GROUNDS; were beautiful with lots of palm trees, lakes and fountains, I did request a pool view through my travel company, but got a lake view instead, but everything else made up for that. POOLS; We only used the main pool which had smaller childrens pool and jacuzzi and we always got a sunbed, Saturday, Sunday there was a dj playing music and games with the children. No need to take towels as there is an unlimited supply for guest use. SNACKS; we ate once at the hotel, our order was wrong but it was still very good. Cocktails were lovely. LOCATION; was great we did not have a car and used the Disney and Universal buses, also the iride which both the green and red bus stops at every 10 minutes. We also walked to Walgreen's chemist which sold bread, milk, wine and gifts. Publix supermarket had everything and subway was within walking distance.

When we asked again we were told we would have to check out of our current room before 11am and check back in at 5pm, as a family of 7 I didnt think that was appropriate. eventually when they could see I wasnt happy they managed to find me a room in a better position. 2 days later I realised we may have a nicer view but the ant problem in the master bedroom didnt seem to get addressed. what may have addressed the problem would be a deep clean on all room between guests. we found baby bottles and cups. plastic bags, toys, empty drink containers and cups without even trying to find them. the carpets need a good clean from edge to edge not just where the eyes meet. The cafe didnt always have the food advertised. I got charged 3 different prices for the same drink.The computers are 1 dollar for 5 minutes but are slow and freeze at times but still charge you. On a nicer note the Porters/bellboys go above and beyond to make sure you have a comfortable relaxing stay. concierge always happy to help.

We had an awesome stay at the resort. I had requested a room in building B overlooking the pool and that's exactly what we got. We found all of the staff VERY friendly at the hotel. We got a great rate on our room, we got a 2 bedroom suite for $127.57 a night before taxes, so we were ok with paying the $11.00 a day resort fee. We loved the 2 bedroom suite, it was nice that our girls had their own room and it was also nice having the kitchen, we never cooked a meal for lunch or supper in the room but did make breakfast in there before we went off to go to the parks, etc. Our beds were made every day, our garbages taken out and the towels replaced. They even replenished all of the shampoos, etc in the bathrooms. I loved that there was a Starbucks on premises and we also liked the food that we ate at the palms cafe. We had one of their croissant breakfast sandwiches a few times and we also ate there for lunch one day - I had the chinese chicken salad which was really good. My girls (ages 13 and 10) loved the pool area, they went swimming there almost every day. The only thing they wished the pool area had was a waterslide. On the day before we left there was a lady at the pool area that played games with the kids for a few hours (hula hoop competition, water balloon toss) and they could win prizes. I thought that was really cool. It was also a short driving distance to all of the parks at Disneyworld and Seaworld. I think it took us around 15 minutes to drive to the disney parks and only about 5 minutes to Seaworld. We shopped at the Publix grocery store a few times around the corner from the resort and we loved the outdoor Premium Outlet Mall which was only a couple of minutes away from the resort. You could walk to the mall but we always just drove cause it was so hot when we were there. We also at at the Benihana restaurant at the entrance to the resort and we loved the food there! If you need a rental car I would recommend going through Thrifty. If you click on their link on the Floridays website you can get a great deal on a rental car. We paid $412.00 for a rental car for 10 days for a 4 door Ford Fusion. We could fit 4 large suitcases and 2 carry-ons in the trunk. I would recommend signing up to be a Blue Chip member. When we got to the airport we went to a different line up and we had our car within a few minutes and there was a huge line up of people at the booths who were not blue chip members. Overall, we had an awesome experience at the Floridays and would highly recommend it to anyone!!!

The customer service and attention to detail is fantastic, even before we arrived, with several e-mails being replied to promptly, and courteously. ( Thank you so much Alejandra Martinez! ). There aren't many places that make an arrival so exciting, and give you that \"Hey, we're Home\" feeling, but Floridays manages to do just that. Our most recent visit 14/06 thru 01/07/2011 was no exception. From the moment we arrived, after such a long day of travelling, everything just seems to fall into place. Check-in was an absolute breeze, with the ever-friendly, courteous staff, immediately making us feel welcome, and at home. A package that we'd had shipped from wal-mart.com was there ready and waiting for us. We had requested a ground-floor Suite, which we knew wasn't guaranteed, but we were allocated a Suite in Block C on the ground floor, overlooking the Lake, between Blocks B and C, which was in a lovely position. Having stayed here 3 times before, we were fully up to speed with the Suite layout, and amenities. The Suite was impeccably clean on entering. Having a full Kitchen with washing facilities is something that we've grown used to over the years, and we simply wouldn't revert back to standard Hotel Rooms again. House keeping was daily, with a full clean every wednesday. The Housekeeping staff were very friendly, and seemed only too happy to replenish cleaning products, trash bags, or anything else that you asked for. We even arrived back after days out, to find that our dishes had been placed into the Dishwasher, and cleaned- a nice touch. There are 2 pools at the resort, the main sits right between blocks A and B, but is only a short distance from Blocks C and D. The smaller pool is around the back of Block D. We only used the main Pool, which has a zero entry at one end, and an assortment of water features, which are sure to keep any children, and adults for that matter, suitably amused. The wifi extension from the main Pool to the whole resort is a nice touch, and worked very well with my smartphone. There is an ethernet port situated near to the Air conditioner control unit, for those bringing laptops. Be wary of the Pizza flyers that will be posted under your door. This is actually mentioned in the welcome guide, which will be on the Coffee Table in the Lounge. They are all of the same type, with red and green print. They are most certainly a scam, as not one of them carries an address ( probably a someone's Garage). This is not a fault of Floridays, although, a security gate by the entrance would certainly help to illiminate this. Well, a fourth stay, and this place is as awesome as ever.

We loved it! The front desk staff was very friendly, and graciously accomodated my request for building F as it is in the back of the resort and much quieter. The room was very spacious and clean. We all enjoyed both pools, both the main pool and the smaller one by our building. They were both clean and had plenty of chairs for everyone. We cooked all of our meals in our room, and the kitchen was very well equiped with everything we needed. We requested an extra packet of dish detergent from housekeeping since we already used the two we were given, and they brought it up immediately. We requested Building F as it is in the back of the resort. It is quiet and the view from our balcony was the lake and pool. However, it is a 2-3 minute walk to the main pool. If you want to be closer to the main pool, request Buildings A, B, or C. However, it is much busier and noiser there though. The resort is at an excellent location, we shopped for groceries at the Publix next store to the resort, and it is a very short drive to both Seaworld and Disney. My one issue is the lack of security at the resort. We had flyers under our door daily from pizza delivery places, which the hotel stated they would not recommend patronizing. Anyone could come in and walk around the hallways and use the pool, as evidenced by the pizza flyers. I wish there were a little better security, however, we were never concerned or anything, it just would be nice. To that same end, the room closest to the hallway was the one with the two smaller beds where my 4 year old son stayed. For safety reasons, I think the master bedroom should be closer to the door. I kept the deadbolt and security chain on at all time when we were in the room. I booked my trip through Expedia, and the resort fee was clearly documented on their website and was not a surprise. The cleaning service, which was changing towels, making the beds and emptying the trash, was also clearly disclosed on the hotel's website. As mentioned earlier, we cooked all of our meals in our room, so I can't comment on the resort's food quality or food service.

We originally asked for a room overlooking the main pool but on arrival we decided we'd prefer a room away from the noise which is always generated by people by the pool. We were moved without question to a room overlooking the wooded area with Disney in the distance, we only realized this when the fireworks started in the evening and we could watch them from our balcony. We found the room to be very comfortable with a large en-suite bathroom to the master bedroom, the second bedroom was of an ample size, as was the second bathroom. The beds were comfortable, the bedding and towels were clean and fresh. Housekeeping came in everyday to do a 'refresh', beds were made, towels replenished and trash taken out, it was enough for us, we kept everything else clean ourselves, they did a full clean on our 7th day. The kitchen is well fitted out with all the utensils you are likely to need if you are doing any cooking. They give you a starter pack of Coffee, Soap Powder and Dishwasher soap. We didn't need to put the dishwasher on everyday and really didn't want to buy a pack of dishwasher soap from the market so we asked housekeeping for another starter pack and they left it for us. Its very handy having the washing machine and dryer in your own suite rather than having to trail down long corridors looking for the laundry and then wondering if your things are going to get pinched. There is a safe in the suite for you to put your valuables, its large enough to get a laptop in, you might have to wiggle it a bit tho. We did go down to the main pool a couple of times but I must admit we preferred the smaller quieter pool, having no kids with us, we prefer not to have to listen to everyone elses. Bar service was a little slow but that was because there was only ever one person serving and he really was doing his best to cope. We had a pizza from the bar and it was very nice. We had a hire car so can't comment on the transport to the parks. The hotel is close to all the important parks and major shopping areas and there are plenty of restaurants within a few minutes drive. The staff were very helpful, from check-in to check-out. We did have a slight problem when we first arrived, the light in the shower wouldn't work so we rang the front desk and maintenance arrived with-in minutes and sorted it.

Locally there is the famous Premium Outlets for all your designer bargains less than a mile away, which could mean many trips for the ladies. These reasons aside the actual accommodation is where Floridays beats the rest, the 2 or 3 bedroom apartments are perfectly designed with all your needs catered for with the handy washing/drying facilities in every room you can pack lighter than normal. With a full kitchen and dishwasher you can save on eating out every breakfast, lunch and dinner, by stocking up with all your favourite groceries from the local supermarket. It saves a fortune with kids needing a non stop supply of drinks and snacks etc. The wifi is free of charge in the room, bar and at the pool so you can access the internet easily at all times when your in the hotel. (as a previous review says otherwise I can assure you it is free unless you are using the business centre) The pool is great with a small kiddie area with water fountains and a sand play area which certainly kept our little ones busy. we are always so sad to leave Floridays as it feels like home once you have moved in filled up the fridge, and hung up your clothes you'll never want to come back. We have tried many different hotels in florida but this one just ticks all the boxes so its the firm family favourite, be sure to ask for your universal discount card on check in it will get you 15% off restaurants in city walk food and beverages we used it often it also works in sea world and on merchandise.I know just about everything you need to know on the location, hotel and surrounding facilities so welcome any questions as am happy to help everyone get the best out of their holiday at Floridays.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery nice place to stay for a family\u201d", "Author": "travelingDany", "ReviewID": "UR114359928", "Content": "The resort is very well situated and close to all attractions.

I did read about the gripes about spotty service and worn furniture, and some of that is absolutely true. However, the benefits of the resort greatly outweigh the negatives. My wife, our two kids, 10 and 8, and I stayed in a 2 bedroom suite for 7 nights. We were in building C so there is a short walk to the main pool, and we were far enough from the commotion of the pool area and shuttle buses. After a long day at an amusement park, we relaxed at the main pool. The main pool does get crowded on some days, but it was large enough where everyone can get their space. We never had a problem finding a chair/lounger to dump our towels and clothes. After the pool, since there are 2 bathrooms, an adult and a kid can shower in their own bathrooms at the same time. For those nights we didn't go out to eat, we were able to cook our dinner in the equipped kitchen. Here's a tip, Publix is 2 minutes away (BY CAR), but if you have the time to drive about 3 miles away (12 minutes) to the super Walmart, you will save a lot of money on food and souveniers. The sofa (both sides of the cushions - I checked) and sofa chairs were slightly worn but they were fine. The maids cleaned on an inconsistent times. Our king size bed was a little lumpy and probably should get thrown out soon, but we slept fine. One day before we were ready to go out, they came at 9:30 but I told them to come back. Another day, we came back at 4PM, and they didn't come yet. They eventually came at 5PM and apologized. Each night we were able to wind down by watching our own shows, since there are 3 TV's in the suite. The ceiling fans in the master BR and LR were great if you want to cool down right away. They have free wireless internet now at least in our building, so bring your laptop which you can store in the free safe in the master closet. (I have a 14\" laptop, and it was kind of tricky making it fit in so a larger laptop like 17\" may not fit, but I'm not sure). The resort grounds were clean and nice, and there were plenty of parking when we were there. We did take the free shuttle once to Epcot to save $14 on parking since the shuttle times fit our schedule. Shuttle times for the non-Disney parks weren't so great, so we drove the other times. I recommend that you rent a car, since walking to and waiting for the trolleys in 90 plus degrees is not enjoyable on your vacation.

I-Drive trolley stop right outside takes you to numerous restaurants & bars without driving if, like me, you want a few bevvies at the end of the day! You don't need a car as there are courtesy buses to all parks, including Busch Gardens in Tampa ($10 each way). We did hire one for a few days from Dollar Rentals & picked it up/returned it in I-Drive (used the trolley to get there). My tip - take out extra insurance for tyres/wheels. We put a wheel down a storm drain & damaged the tyre but a quick call & someone came & put the spare on for us. Then Dollar rang to say they would change the car over if we wanted to pop back to their depot as we now had no spare. Great service and at good rates. By the way, if you drive to the theme parks you will pay around $15 parking charge each time. No charge if you use the coutesy bus. Best restaurants we found in I-Drive were Bahama Breeze (stop 21) & Tony Roma's (stop 20 or 21). Best night out was undoubtedly \"Howl at the Moon\" at stop 21. A bar with non-stop music played by a live band with 2 great piano players doing customers requests right through to 2am. Great night out but for adults only & it's a bar only - no food so eat first then go about 9pm . What would have made the holiday absolutely perfect for us would have been an onsite, full service restaurant at Floridays. Don't get me wrong, the food at the pool bar/cafe is excellent but is served up in plastic containers & if you want a dining experience you need to jump on the I-drive trolley & after a day at the parks in 93 degree heat we didn't always have the energy to go out again (mind you, we are in our 60s).

Also teenagers yelling & carrying on in the parking lots late at night, car alarms going off, sirens, airplane noise, and room soundproofing more suited to a Motel 6 than an expensive resort.

There is a really cool area for younger kids. Our room was really nice we booked a two bedroom suite but when we checked in we were given a three bedroom. The only complaint I had with the room was the night stand in the master bedroom was broke so the drawer would slowly roll open. This could be really dangerous for a family with a crawling baby or a small baby that likes to pull up on things. A lamp shade also in the master bedroom was broken and there was a cigarette burn on one of the dinning room chairs (the room did not smell like cigarettes or smoke). Also one mornings we left all of the towels on the bathroom floor to be picked up and replinished and when we returned all of the towels were replinished but a few of the dirty towels were still on the floor in the bathroom. It was not that big of a deal for us. The resort is close to the Disney parks but off the main strip away from the traffic. So in the evenings we were able to see cows grazing from our patio and in the mornings birds would meet on the patio. My daughter loved it. Also the outlets are around the corner.

The suites are nice and spacious, and the rooms are well situated- with plenty of storage. The decor was pleasant, but showing some wear, and a small bit of damage here and there (upon closer scrutiny)- we got a good deal so we didn't raise a big fuss. We loved that there was a good size kitchen with everything you could need to cook, and eat already there. We ate comfortably at the dining table, and sometimes on our balcony table. The bedrooms were very comfortable, and the bathrooms had plenty more than elbow room. It was very convenient to have our own washer and dryer in the room, and the iron and ironing board worked well. The Shuttle service wasn't as frequent as we would have liked, but it is good if you need it for the times they offer. I do also recommend that you bring your own hair dryer, as theirs was extremely weak, and it cut off frequently. While the concierge staff were always very helpful and pleasant, the front desk girls were not as friendly as we had expected- from other reviews. The maid service was also not top notch when they came in to clean, so we opted not to use them until we left and did our own sprucing up. We enjoyed the Benihanas restaurant within walking distance, and the grocery store is just down the street to stock up your kitchen, etc.. The kids enjoyed the game room near the lobby as a welcome way to relax, as well.Taking the good and the bad, and weighing it out, the positives do outweigh the negatives.

The first half of the trip we stayed in Tampa in an Embassy Suites, so we were really looking forward to a more luxurious experience. We were happy to find that our room was available at 11am even though check in wasnt until 3. This allowed us to get to Seaworld sooner! The room was clean but you could tell that it wasn't in \"new\" condition. The shuttered window between the master bathroom and bedroom was broken and we couldn't get it shut, good thing it was only my husband and I using it because there was no privacy! We called the front office to get them to fix it but no one ever came and since we were only there for 3 days we didn't bother to call again.The second room has two double beds in it for the three children (who are actually all over 19) and it was very nice to have the second bath after being in the Embassy. We thought we would love having a kitchen, but found that we actually enjoyed the complimentary breakfast at the Embassy (obviously a cheaper hotel) much more. We thought about ordering room service for breakfast but it was literally $30 for a box of cereal, milk, and some oranges! We were in the back building and were pretty far away from the big pool which was also very crowded. There was a smaller pool much closer which was nice but it really wasn't any nicer than the Embassy suites. House keeping came in and made the beds, changed towels, and emptied trash, however I had to leave a note to ask for more coffee, shampoo, and dish soap. It was annoying having to drive all of the way to the back of the complex which was very large with a lot of speed bumps and our room had a view of a field that was under construction. The \"free shuttle\" only went to Seaworld at 9:30 and only returned at 3:45, The 9:30 would have been fine because that it when the park opened, but we knew we wouldnt want to leave that early so we opted to drive which cost $14 a day to park. On the hotel website it does not say that the shuttle is so limited, and you have to make reservations to use it the day before, the day we actually did want to use it it was already booked!

Didn't like the decor. I felt it was too dark for Florida. Of course, rust is not my favorite color. Beware of complimentary shuttle service. Luckily we had no issues but they fail to tell you on their site that the shuttle bus services three hotels, and has a few seats and once full you have to stand on the bouncing bus. Also, the pickup schedule has three times and it is a first come first serve. This means if there isn't enough room and its the last pick up they will not come back for you. I preferred to drive after the first day to Universal. It's only $15 bucks and you can leave when you want. We had to take a taxi the one day it was lightening and raining for hours, but was too early for the shuttle. This cost us nearly $30 bucks. Overall this is a nice resort and my family and I felt safe here. It was clean and beds were comfortable. The employees were friendly and nice. Oh by the way, make sure to get a room that doesn't face the west sun, because the A/C is somewhat controlled by you.

It has nice amenities, not the least of which is a roomy suite layout that provides traveling families plenty room to spread out. It has two nice pools, a nice pool bar, and well kept grounds. The value factor is high, given the favorable May pricing we got and the exceptional square footage of the rooms. But there are issues. First, if you are looking for luxury and exceptional cleanliness, this shouldn't be your first choice. Our room carpets were stained, the front door was in need of a paint job, and the ceiling fans were caked in dust. We also had an air conditioner that made a crashing noise when cutting off and a tub that took most of the day to drain. Know that the daily housekeeping only includes changing towels, taking out the trash, and making beds. Cleaning is an extra $30/day. After our second night of six, we realized that the housekeeper was not replacing towels, but putting our used, wet towels right back on the rack. So in reality, we weren't even getting the towel refresh. Also, there are no ice machines on the property. However, your in-suite refrigerator has an ice machine that you must turn on at the beginning of your stay to get any appreciable amount of ice in a day or two. We didn't find the staff all that friendly. Most didn't make eye contact or greet you, and no one offered to help with our bags. Thankfully, our suite was on the first floor and you can park close to the one of 6 buildings your suite is in. We never tried the bus service to the theme parks. They have only a couple pickups each day, so we drove. The pool was always crowded, and the one bartender at the pool bar couldn't keep up with the line that formed for drinks. The wireless internet in the room was nice; the connection speed is limited to 2 Mbps. Overall, we were a little underwhelmed by the stay, given Floridays' #1 ranking in the Orlando area.

The pool bar had all the ingredients for any kind of drink you wanted. There is a Publix , a chinese restaurant, spanish restaurant, liquor store 2-3 minutes away. There is a an outlet mall 3 minutes away as well. The ITrolley stop is located outside the hotel. We used it once to go see the Titanic show at stop 13. The only drawback with this is that it makes ALL Stops. It was a bit quicker on the way back as it skipped some stops.

They give you a vaccuum if you want to clean yourself, but who wants to work on vacation!

I also read the \"not so excellent\" reviews to keep it real. Upon arriving, the resort looked lovely and had beautiful landscaping. We arrived very early (around 12:30pm) and they had a room available and ready for us, which was nice. My husband checked us in and told me the lobby was beautiful. Upon entering our building, the elevators and outside walkway to our room did not appear clean and remained that way for the almost the entire length of our stay.The day before we left, it appeared houskeeping finally cleaned the elevator walls but the floors still had trash that never was removed. Our room was inviting and smelled fresh. We loved having the 2 bedrooms (especially the kids) and master bath with jetted tub. It was decorated very nicely. It was not meticulously cleaned, just okay in my opinion. As a previous reviewers have stated, the furnishings are showing wear from all the previous guests that obviously are not careful when staying here. It clearly is a very busy and popular resort as you can see from the number of reviews. We were missing an ironing board from our room and one was brought up to us promptly. I feel the floors and carpets should be cleaned more often as our socks were very dirty from walking on the floors. Our view from the balcony was of the parking lot, so we did not use it but would have it had a different view. We slept very well and felt the beds in our suite were comfortable. The pool was great and we enjoyed it. All in all it was a great vacation and we were comfortable here. However, I am the type of person who values the cleanliness of a hotel or resort one of the most important things and I was dissappointed that some of those not so excellent reveiws were spot on. I did not address these issues while at the resort because I wanted to start my vacation and not have the hassle of changing rooms or waiting for housekeeping to clean the room to my liking. I am sure that if I did address these things, they would have accommidated me. There is a daily resort fee and I was aware of it before going and still received a great deal compared to other similar resorts. They do have wireless internet in the rooms now.

All 6 of us (myself, the wife and 4 teenagers) stayed at floridays resort in april in a 3 bedroom suite. these rooms are awesome. the fact that 1 room can handle 6 people with comfort is verrrry rare these days inseed !! The floridays resort is located at the south end of international drive so its just a ways out of the 'hub' or middle of the action... im not sure if thats a good or bad thing tho` coz being just out of the way makes floridays a little more peacefull I think.. Please note that their is a trolley/bus that runs up and down international drive all day up to 10pm ... and for a small charge you can get to just about anywhere you want to go along international drive. all the resorts and theme parks are on I.D except for disney which has their own shuttle anyway that comes into the hotel. The rooms here are great... u can tell that families have been staying here with the wear and tear that families generally give to a hotel...but thats fine.. its a family resort ! When we checked into the first room we were given it was not cleaned properly, so down i went to reception and i was quickly given another..this room was fine - good aircond in every room (and fans) big bathrooms, good size full kitchen and a lounge area.. (like a small home really!!) the central pool is huge and there were kids in the pool from open to close. The bar is just next to the pool and this is probably the only area on concern i had on our stay.. at night when its beer o`clock and people are looking for a cool beverage, the hotel only had 1 staff member on !!?? - this was insane and most people just walked away after getting frustrataed with the 15min wait time just to get a beer. !! this occurred evernight during our stay and was exasserbated by a wedding on the final night of our stay... it was a circus !! my wife ended up going to the general manager to complain.. THE CONCIERGE STAFF HERE ARE FANTASTIC they all know their stuff and go out of their way to help booking park tix, retal cars etc.. everything can be booked right at their desk..no need to be trying to deal with it from home just to save 20 bux !! ... they also had some great tips on the parks !! **One thing that i should note is the hype over the harry potter experience... I was prapared for anything after reading all the reviews and comments about HP here in T.A... Here we go.. we arrived early at universal as everyone had suggested... we stood at the gate and watched them slide open... then the rush began... almost everyone who was waiting at the gate made a dash for hogwarts !! some people were running !! i just took my time to get to the otherside of the park and when i arrived i had a 15 min wait for the HP experience... after doing the ride (trust me its not all that) we had a 10 min wait for the HP rollercoaster (which is just average as far as rollercoasters go, but im not a kid) My kids decided they wanted to do both rides again and they had that done in about 30 mins.. We then went into hogwarts village and tried to look in a couple of shops all selling the same thing... this area was fairly packed, but still ok to get around... The girl on the door of one of the shops did tell me that it was a little 'quiet' and that the general hype for HP was just starting to level off...!! We tried the obligitory butter beer (bout a 10 min wait) and my kids loved it. All in all i would recommend floridays because their intent is to make sure you have a good stay... the room rate is terriffic... and the location is good...

It literally is right in the middle of all the Parks and the shopping and cannot be faulted. I travelled with my wife and 2 sons (aged 11 and 14) and we stayed in a 3 bedroom suite. We had to switch rooms on arrival as the 2nd bathroom only had a shower, and my boys prefer to take a bath, and were moved to another (corner ) suite in building A. The suite did have a certain smell that my wife thought may have been from a smoker, but when I checked it was a non-smoking room. The kitchen itself was functional if not a little tired, and the two single bedrooms were very good. The master suite itself was small, with a very nice en-suite bathroom, complete with whirlpool bath. One of the main issues I had with the resort was that the curtains were poor quality so that the light came in at sunrise, and also, because I was overlooking the lake onto International Drive, the noise of the buses and cars (and sirens from Emergency vehicles) was particularly frustrating for me, being a very light sleeper. The swimming pool, which was in the adjacent building, was very nice looking, but there were nowhere near enough beds around to satisfy the number of guests. I believe there is another pool at one of the other buildings but I did not check it out. In conclusion, I really am tempted to change my review back to a 4 but I just can't bring myself to do this....it is very good, but in my humble opinion, is not quite good enough", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Conley, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful and sunny time!!!\u201d", "Author": "tmadison45", "ReviewID": "UR106912316", "Content": "The resort was the best place I've ever stayed on vacation.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Downingtown, PA", "Title": "\u201cWe had a wonderful vacation at Floridays\u201d", "Author": "GrandmomJudy", "ReviewID": "UR106864459", "Content": "Stayed at Floridays with our daughter and son-in-law and two grandchildren.

Wireless internet was including with daily resort fee and was a great addition. This was used every night and kids could connect with their iPod's PRO'S: Rooms are very spacious. We stayed in Building \"F\" which was at the very end of the resort and very peaceful. There is the main pool at front which we did not use as it always seemed full. The second pool closer to our building was great. Plenty of shelter, towels and also had a spa and not busy. Close to Publix supermarket and also near by take away if you do not want to cook. Literally around the corner at Vineland Rd (off memory) is a Premuim Outlet Centre which has great bargains and brand names shops. Housemaids cleaned apartments on a daily basis and were friendly on rare occasions we were there however we needed to leave notes to ask them to remove rubbish/trash and leave dishwashing powder as this was never replaced. CON'S Both toilets in ensuite and main bathroom hardly flushed. In the end we needed to contact reception to have issue rectified. The sliding door to the balcony had no lock so anyone if they were game enough to climb 5 stories could walk into room. Contacted reception and they had this rectified that day. The in house safe was locked and unable to open with code. 3 calls later a safe breaker came to fix it. Had to call reception to organise fresh towels as housekeeping replaced with only 2 and 4 people staying in apartment. The resort cafe is nothing to rave about. We had breakfast there and if you like food with around 4000 calories then this place is for you. The Starbucks coffee is very watery and for a country that prides themselves on coffee Aussie's definately are one up there!! I purchased an Italian Coffee maker from Publix for $12 and made my coffee in the apartment and it was much nicer. Coffee snob maybe... ;-) Overall, I would recommend family and friends to stay at Floridays and especially those with children as works well for young and teenagers. The cons were easily rectified and did not spoil our stay there. I would suggest however to hire a car. This was the way to go. If the hire car company want you to purchase an unlimited toll pass for $30 US do not bother unless you are travelling to Miami. If your intentions are to do the Theme Parks then you will not require this pass, this was an upsell at the airport. DISNEYWORLD You can do Disneyworld in 5 days with teenagers but if you have younger children I would suggest a 7 day pass. We had a 7 day pass and were rather bored by the end of it. Take plenty of money as there are some wonderful gifts to buy. Food was very reasonably priced at all lands. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS Was amazing and Island of Adventure with Harry Potter was the highlight of the trip. Any adult would have a blast and you can purchase a mug of \"Butter Beer\". Planet Hollywood in Downtown Disney was also very good. I would suggest to book before hand but well worth a look. The Secret Garden on International Drive was amazing.

We went there based on its rating and whilst it was ok and had some strong points (3 bed room layout is good and location is perfect) we've stayed at other better hotels on our previous trips to Orlando. Maybe too high an expectation but as its rated number one hotel in Orlando I expected something special. Some points the hotel should address: a) The condition of furniture, carpets etc. in our room was below our expectation. It needs refurbishing. Carpet had multiple marks, draws on units would not close and door handles loose and some hanging off. Small things like the TV control having black tape on it because someone had previously obviously lost the battery cover. Small stuff but in a top place they would just replace the handset rather than use black tape on the control. b) With the exception of the cleaning staff we never saw any managers or even had a courtesy call to check how our stay was. You expect a top hotel to be over flowing with staff. Even when we left and paid the bill the lady did not ask how was our stay etc. Very basic service stuff. c) Its noisy if you are anywhere near the pool even at 10pm as people are swimming late (we were in block B). Also the storm drains on the road are loose and make a big noise when cars drove over them. Drives you nuts after a while. d) You have to pay $30 to get a full clean of the room. Whilst you don't expect this every day - if you are staying 12 days you expect a full clean at least every 5-7 days like you get in all other places I've ever stayed. You can't do 12 days without having the floors cleaned etc. e) There is no security gate like you get in every other big hotel I've been to so anyone could drive into the complex and go to the pool for the day. No big deal but when you have young children I don't like the idea that people can just come into the complex. There is a sign saying temporary entrance but no-one explained why or if they intend to build a secure entrance. f) The areas outside the rooms - the floor and lifts etc. needed more cleaning and rubbish was often there for days without anyone picking them up. g) At our times sat around the pool there was no staff cleaning up and it needed it. Maybe I'm being harsh and obviously everyone else thinks its perfect - maybe its about expectation - I'm comparing to places like the Sheraton across the road where we've stayed before and Marriott's in Orlando.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bierbeek", "Title": "\u201cexcellent resort, great facilities, perfect location, heaven of peace\u201d", "Author": "frans26", "ReviewID": "UR105223967", "Content": "We thourougly enjoyed this resort.

I reported this to the front desk manager and she said she would investigate and call me back. The next day I call her back and she claimed to have checked in with the housekeeping department. They denied seeing the jacket and she said that it was only one jacket that was missing from the bunch and that I probably misplaced it myself. I told her in light of the Florida heat, none of our jackets left the suite considering we would not need to wear it in 90 degree weather, therefore it was left in the closet during our entire stay. The only other person aside from myself who has the key to our suite was the housekeeping and front desk. The manager that called me back said that anything missing was not their responsibility and that she could do nothing about it.

I had read nothing but positive reviews from different websites about Floriday's but was skeptical since we had one place booked that we were familiar with but thought that we would \"try\" Floriday's based on the reviews. Boy were the reviews wrong! After driving 19 hours to get to the resort and not sleeping, I was extremely happy that we were able check in right away and the grounds were very well maintained! It all stopped there! Upon walking through the corridor to get to the room, I noticed all of the cob webs and dirt that could have easily been removed with a broom in a short amount of time. I thought, \"Oh goodness, I hope this isn't a sign of what the room will look like\". Well I was right. As soon as I walked in the door, I saw food all over the front of the stove and dirt all over the refrigerator. Dried food dripped down the cabinets and dirty floors. Then I saw the ripped up chair and popcorn all under the coach and dust everywhere in the living area. I then walked into the spacious, beautiful master bathroom and looked into the jetted tub and saw long dark hair and dirt in it! How disgusting! I immediately sent my husband out to get some cleaning supplies and cleaned! Nothing that you want to do after being up for more than 24 hours! When going to bed at night, there was blood on the sheets and sunflower seeds around the pedestal! Thank goodness there were extra sheets in the linen closet! I didn't dare use the blanket or bedspread to cover up with either! I washed the blanket in the washer/dryer the next day. Also, I washed all of the other bedding for my kids. However, the beds were extremely comfortable. My husband fell asleep on the couch one night and woke up with red marks all over his body and became ill. Bedbugs? The next day we headed down to the overcrowded main pool where chair were sparse and there were leaves all in the pool which we noticed everyday. All it takes is a little skimming on a regular basis! My kids loved the pool however. Our room was located near the smaller pool and people were in it well after closing hours. Thank goodness I brought along some sound machines to drain out the noise! Of the six days that we were at the resort, we only received maid service twice!!!!! One of the service men also almost hit us while driving through the parking lot! He was speeding and not even paying attention to his surroundings. Thank goodness no one was walking in the area at the time! The only positive thing about Floriday's for us was the nice view from our window, the nice decor (even though dirty) in our room, the fact that we booked a two bedroom and received a three bedroom which my kids loved. The comfortable beds and free WiFi. The spaciousness and the nice location. Really loved the outlet mall nearby that we could have walked to! I also thought that the service bags for disposal available to those with pets what a nice touch too. I haven't recommended Floriday's to any friends or family and probably would try staying elsewhere in the future before I would try Floriday's again. We didn't try any of the food offered at the poolside cafe or the game or fitness room due to time constraints but the aroma coming from he cafe sure did smell good! Despite not having a good experience at Floriday's, we had a fabulous family trip that we will never forget!", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Savannah, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cOK - not great\u201d", "Author": "Traveler60814", "ReviewID": "UR105073884", "Content": "I travel regularly and this is the first time that I have been truly disappointed with a trip advisor recommendation - and the first time that I have ever written a review.

One of the things that kind of bothered me the most was that you could not set the temperature below 71 in the room. I like it cooler than that when I sleep. It seemed very warm in here and I wondered if maybe it really was more like 75 or 76. It is obvious that they try to conserve energy ( which I am all for ) but it is to the detriment of the consumer. It is also pretty dark in the rooms. One thing that bothers me a little by all three places is that they flat screen tv's ( only one in the living room here) , but none of them provide HD tv.

We never smelled a thing in our room, but we were on the top floor and the smell was very noticible in the open air hallway from our room to the elevator. One morning the fire dept was there and it was obvious there was not an immediate emergency. They were standing around talking and not seeming to be in a rush about anything. A housekeeper who happened to see me watching the situation from the window by the elevator said to me that it was something to do with the gas pump on roof but was fixed now. The rest of that day the smell was gone, but upon exiting our room the following morning, it was present again for sure. That was when we were checking out, so I don't know anything more. Might be worth checking out if you're wanting to stay in building B! I just feel pretty nervous if I smell natural gas!", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved this resort\u201d", "Author": "TinaI2011", "ReviewID": "UR101316630", "Content": "Great place to stay at with family.

Our time is so limited while here and to be able to save hours of waiting and getting frustrated ,hot and tired from waiting in lines was by far the best investment made while there!

Temperature controls and functionality was superb and ensured a comfortable stay either morning or night. Other great amenities include a very quaint cafe for those not in the mood to cook. The pool was large with a large spouting fountain that the kids just loved. A spacious jaccuzi was also a great thing for those long and tiresome days at the theme parks.

The scheduling was convenient and the drivers were very friendly and helpful. Just remember to tip them to show them how great they are.

When we arrived the had \"overbooked\" so we had to stay in a 2 bedroom the first night, we could not un pack and because we wanted to be at our first park early in the am had to leave all of our bags out so the hotel staff could \"move us\", for this they gave us free breakfast coupons (the free breakfast ending up being a choice of a muffin, or cereal and milk).. anyway that was the only bad experience.. I guess that can happen - but it is aggravating when you make your reservations 4 months in advance and your room is not there.... Well again the rooms (both 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom) where very clean, they had plenty of dishes, towels etc for our entire party... We did go to grocery store (about 1/2 mile away) and stock up on snacks, soda and food for the week so that was great. The pool area (did not go to quiet pool) was very nice... The one day we did not parks the kids had a great time swimming at the pool... Housekeeping was very good they did a nice pick up service each day and we found that to be done well... Overall this resort is an excellent value and close enough to everything ( it took us 5 minutes to get to seaworld and aquatica - 20 minutes to get to downtown disney and 15 minutes to get to Universal - We also went to busch gardens which was about 50 minutes away) that you can drive where ever you need to..

Amazing Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Br0wn33", "ReviewID": "UR97294897", "Content": "My husband and I were looking for an inexpensive place to stay while visiting Orlando, Florida. After looking through all the different Disney Resorts and how expensive they are, we were so happy to come across Floridays in our search. Floridays is located near all the different Disney Resorts, Disney Boardwalk and an amazing Outlet Mall. We never had to drive longer than 10-15 minutes to get anywhere we wanted to be. One of the main reasons we picked this hotel was because all the rooms had full size kitchens. Having the option to make your own meals rather than go out all the time, really saved us some money. We were shocked when we arrived because we had been upgraded from a two bedroom suite to a three bedroom. Since it was just my husband and I the third bedroom was unnecessary, however we really felt like we were living in a huge condo. All the rooms had their own TV's, the kitchen was very spacious and had all the dishes we required, the sitting area was cozy and the bathrooms were impressive. The decor wasn't to our taste and our balcony looked out onto the parking lot, but we really didn't care. It was clean, cozy and you couldn't beat the price or location. If you have children, this is an amazing hotel to stay at. I remember going to Florida as a child and having to stay in a regular size hotel room with my parents and brother. We were always fighting over the bathroom and what was playing on the TV. It also sucked having to share a bed with my brother and have my parents a couple feet away. It would have been amazing to have my own room/space and a lot less fighting between my brother and I. Also I am sure my parents would have enjoyed some privacy too. We only went to the pool one day, mainly because the weather wasn't that warm. However there were tons of kids playing in the water and there were plenty of chairs to lounge in. I would certainly recommended staying at Floridays if you are looking for a quality hotel for less money. We are even thinking about going back with another couple next year because the rooms offered so much space and privacy and with these prices you can't afford not to.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, New York", "Title": "\u201cAwesome, large suites perfect for families in desirable location!\u201d", "Author": "BuffaloSnowBird", "ReviewID": "UR97149555", "Content": "This resort was absolutely amazing!

Great location and convienent to all attractions. Sea World is literally a 5 minute drive and Magic Kingdom took about 10 minutes from parking lot to parking lot. This was our 1st trip with our 13 month old son and was alittle concerned about space for him to run around in the suite. As soon as we walked into our room all concerns disappeared. Our little boy had more then enough room and loved the space. It was also a huge plus that he had his own room so we had no issues with waking each other up.

The price was amazing for the amenities that were offered. We stayed in a 2 bedroom 2 bath condo. It was a fairly quick 15 min drive from Orlando airport. When we arrived, everything was set up as requested (room by the small pool and with a crib). When we arrived we thought the room was very new, well maintained and clean. The amenities were very impressive for the price we paid ($140 something per night). Parking is easily accessible right in front of each building. Our only disappointment was that the large, beautiful pool area shown in all the pictures was under total renovation during our stay. Our 3 year old was very bummed out that he couldn't play in the splash pad area and shallow area. When I asked what type of compensation they were offering to full paying guests that were not going to be able to use the pool area, they offered to waive the $11.75 per day resort fee and place us near their secondary, smaller pool. The smaller pool worked out really well as they cranked up the heat and it was like bath water. Lots of people could be seen swimming in it - even though the outside temp was in the low 60's! So, despite the big pool not being available, we really enjoyed our stay. My recommendations for people staying here are...stop at the Publix grocery store right down the street to pick up some food and bottled water before you check in. The tap water in our room had a sulphur smell to it, so we made coffee and cooked with bottled water. The smell was most noticeable when taking a shower. Nothing terrible, but just not something we are used to. We also really enjoyed the HUGE jacuzzi tub in our room. The water pressure and amount of available hot water in our room was incredible and we could fill the entire tub in about 5 minutes - no kidding! So, that was nice, since some hotels the hot water runs out quickly and there is little to no water pressure. We mostly cooked our own meals in the fully equipped kitchen and ate out a bit, so we didn't try any of the food they offered - it was really expensive. There is a nice cafe/bar area that offers Starbucks and beer/drinks which we would have enjoyed if we didn't have a 3 year old and 7 month old with us at all times :-) We also LOVED having in-room laundry and a dishwasher! They were even kind enough to keep us stocked with laundry detergent (Tide) and dishwasher detergent daily. Overall, we would HIGHLY recommend this hotel for families with children. It was conveniently located to everything (Disney, outlets, Universal, etc.) and the staff and housekeeping was excellent.

It was the best holiday we've ever had in our whole lives .. and a lot of that has to be contributed to the hotel we stayed in. Its located @ stop 40 on the I - Ride Trolley at a lovely quiet end of I - Drive and there is a Publix two minutes from the grounds. Floridays is a lovely, secure, Luxury complex with the best staff we've ever encountered working in a hotel, and were not just that ... there really are wonderful. We were greeted very nicely when we entered the building By Chris .. a Really Genuine nice guy who checked us in and got a very nice guy called Matthew to take us to the building were our room was. The complex itself is clean and well kept and the rooms .... THE ROOMS .... ARE AMAZING .... so clean, sleek, and flashy. Flat Screen, Jacuzzi Bath, Room service, Free Internet in the Room. The pools & Jacuzzi are clean and HEATED !!! WOO HOO and there is a bar, Comfy sun loungers and Complimentary pool towels for all the guests. When we got settled we went down to the Lobby to enquire about the parks and were directed to the Concierge desk ..where we meet the Wonderful Nildia .. who is so sweet and so kind ..she was like our mammy the whole time we were there .. she kept us on the Right Track .. Then There's Wildo ( The Wizard) .. he's the go to guy and has a Knack for helping with good places to eat & Such a Genuinely Nice Man to everyone he meets ... (Thanks For the Reservations Wizard!! LOL) . Nilda & Wildo and not to forget Brett are so helpful and lovely and have all the information you need and if they don't .. they will go to the ends to find it for you .. and not to Forget Tom on the Front Door (Thanks For The Dramamine LOL) He's a Real kind Straight Shooter. The guys at the Front Desk are Really Helpful and kind, Alejandra and Chris are guys we dealt with most and are full of info and laughter and make you feel right at home ..but to be honest the front desk people are all really nice and were all helpful and kind to us .. Overall Floridays for us was the perfect experience and especially for honeymoon .. were definitely going back ...

It is situated on the nice end of International Drive (no hurdy gurdy, neon lights outside). We took a 2 bed suite which worked well for us a kids young enough to share 2 double beds in twin room between them. We had a huge king sized bed and en suite with both jacuzzi bath and double walk in shower. The kitchen was well equipped with huge fridge dishwasher oven etc., we also had a laundry cupboard with a washer and dryer. There were 3 TVs with plenty of news channels and Nick and Disney Channel for kids. The only negative about the accommodation was how dark the kitchen and living area was. We had to have full lights on no matter what time of day as no natural light in that area. The pool was lovely and pleasantly heated. There was plenty of sun loungers and a graded beach type pool at one side with water jets for kids in addition to a deeper side for adults. The pool side restaurant (called the Market place) was excellent for burgers, wraps etc., either to eat pool side or delivered to your room. We arrived down there for breakfast on our first morning but ended up going out to the local Golden Corral as there wasn't much so ace to sit in the cafe. They serve Starbucks Coffee. There is free wifi around the pool, reception, restaurant areas. There is also internet access in your room if you have a laptop (not much good for iPads tho!!).

In fact, if I were traveling with friends or family to Orlando in the future, I think it would be foolish not to stay at the Floridays Resort! Our \"room\" was a full, 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment, which could easily and comfortably accommodate 2 couples or a family with one couple and 4 children. You couldn't ask for more room in the unit - with a full kitchen (with dish washer), washer and dryer, 2 double beds in one bedroom (with t.v.), king size bed in the master (with t.v.), a smaller, shared bathroom with a sink, toilet and shower/tub combo. The master bath was very nice, with a large whirlpool bath and separate shower. We were able to book 2 days in advance at a Florida residents' rate of only $125 per night. That was for 2 couples so we were paying only $62.50 per night per couple for a really nice hotel at a really nice location. You can't beat that price... especially for a clean, modern hotel. An important factor for us with booking at the Floridays was that there are free shuttles to/from the parks. Beware though - the times the shuttles come and go are EXACT. There is no room for error and the buses do not wait even one extra minute for stragglers so you may want to be where you are supposed to be for the shuttles a few minutes early because the driver will not be waiting for you, even if they are expecting you. That being said, the price of parking at Disney World is about $24 so we were very happy to save that money and have a free ride! Also, parking is free at the Floridays, which is unusual for an Orlando hotel. Note, however, there is an $11+ resort fee per unit per night, which really isn't bad when you consider the free parking and the free shuttle.

But, I soon learned there was only ONE SINGLE SODA vending machine on the entire resort site. The dollar slot was broken, but here was the real kicker: the front desk could NOT give me change! I found myself getting annoyed too quickly so I had to relax and give it another chance in the morning. After all, when you take a family to Orlando your hotel stay is the least of your endeavors. We spent the majority of our time at the Disney parks anyway. On our second night, the concierge was recommending pizza delivery places that didn't even deliver to our hotel, so that was laughable. On other nights the concierge was helpful and fine. The toilet in the master bathroom made weird gurgling noises all night long--that was kind of annoying. The hotel boasts a \"complimentary Disney shuttle\" but (unless I missed this somewhere on the website) beware that the \"free shuttle\" has limited availability and it only has two scheduled departure times. In other words, it's not like you can call on the shuttle to take you to Disney whenever you feel like it. You must either take the 8:10 AM shuttle or the 10:45 AM shuttle. Furthermore, you MUST sign up at least 24 hours in advance or you will not get on the shuttle. The concierge said there were only 28 spots but when we boarded the next morning there were far more than 28 spots on the bus. Still, the \"free Disney shuttle\" is indeed free but you MUST sign up early and you only have two departure times to choose from. On our final day the staff was very helpful with storing our luggage so we could hang out in the pool for a while.

I found this resort on a travel website and extensively researched and read reviews(which were all good) before we chose this one. I traveled with my husband, our daughter, 14 and 3 of her friends, all also 14. Check in was quick and easy with the staff being extrememly friendly and helpful. Concierge was also extremely helpful, altho some of the information they gave us was not completely accurate as we found out after the fact. We had a 3 bedroom apartment which was very comfortable for our group. It was quite clean and most furnishings looked to be in great shape altho several things did not work (shower light, microwave light, toaster, living room telephone, etc). Maintenance came to fix most of the things - the second day we requested to have the toaster fixed I had left a tip for housekeeping on the counter, when we returned about 5pm that day housekeeping had not been there yet but the tip money was missing. I spoke to our housekeeper when she came that evening and she said it's best to give the tips to the maids directly to avoid that. We made absolutely sure all of our valuables were locked in the safe after that. If you plan on doing any cooking be warned: the kitchen does not have much for pots/pans, etc! We had one small scratched up fry pan and a huge stock pot.. It is very basic!! Housekeeping, by the way, was sporadic. They didnt leave coffee, dish detergent, toiletries, etc every day - it was about every 2 or 3 days, so we would call the front desk to have anything we needed delivered. Clean towels are a must with 4 teen girls, so we were a bit disappointed not to have housekeeping come every day. The pool was cool, but we are from the upper midwest, so that didnt bother our girls much. My husband and I sat at the pool bar a few times while the girls were swimming - service is very slow. The staff seemed more interested in visiting amongst themselves about the parties they had attended then serving drinks. Several people around us were complaining about that, also. We ordered food from the Marketplace the first night and it was very good - especially the Cuban panini!! The location of the hotel is on the south side of International Drive - there is a Walgreens/Publix/Liquor Store (and more) within a short walk (to the south of the hotel) if you dont rent a car. There is a Benihana at the entrance of the hotel which is Fantastic! Also, there is an Outback (also Fantastic!) near the Walgreens you could walk to. We did not rent a car but relied on the hotel's bus system to get to the parks. We just taxi'd back to the hotel when we were done for the day. I would suggest taxi-ing to Sea World, tho because the bus doesnt leave till 9:20am (arriving about 9:45) and Sea World opens at 9am. (We booked a limo to get to/from the Sanford Airport and the hotel through Sanford Transportation Services for $200 - town cars and vans were even less expensive!) All in all we really enjoyed this resort, but some of the simple things that should have been less of a headache might deter us from coming back here agian.

Our main purpose was to visit the Disney, SeaWorld & Universal Parks, plus some relaxing by the pool. After booking with satisfaction & confidance, I bumped into this TripAdvisor site, read the negative comments (which were extremely minimal compared to the positive) but proceeded to panic. After assurance from AAA and travel agent friends, stuck to original plan. We are so happy to report our stay was next to perfect (which is scary!). The staff was friendly, the resort clean, suites felt like we were \"coming home\" instead of to a hotel room, food was good and reasonably priced. Although we'd have loved the pool/bar to be open later (than 11pm) it probably was a good thing they weren't!!! We were placed in the \"B\" building which was perfect in location to the pool/main lobby (further building might have been disappointing). The only downfall we can think of is that due to the resort being newer, there is not much real close for restaurants, convenience stations etc but would expect that it would grow when the economy gets better. Hotel shuttles to the major parks run at somewhat odd times and at times inconvenient, although the free service was truly appreciated! Highly recommend using the I-ride Trolley which runs up and down International Drive for service to SeaWorld, convenience stores, other resorts, restaurants, grocery, stores etc, unfortunately it does not service Disney or Universal - but very reasonably priced vs taxi.

Check-in was easy and we were given a room in building A (407) on the 4th Floor overlooking the lake (and i-drive). I haven\u2019t posted any pics as the rooms are exactly like all the ones already posted. I wouldn\u2019t want to stay in this room again as one of the housekeepers store rooms was directly opposite and they were really noisy when using it (although we were rarely around when they did, just an observation). Rooms were large and spacious, we had a 2 bed, 2 bath, the bed was actually quite comfy, either that or I was just so tired from the parks, I fell asleep straight away without caring. The DVD player didn\u2019t work and neither did the Jacuzzi (we figured this out though, the fuse had tripped \u2013 check the grey box on the wall in the living room out if you experience anything like this). We didn\u2019t get the problem with the DVD player sorted while we were there as it didn\u2019t bother us too much, but we did let them know there was an issue so hopefully they\u2019ve sorted it out since. The pool and grounds were lovely, but there was a horrible smell around near the entrance and the water also smelt and tasted of this. We didn\u2019t drink the water we got bottles from the Publix supermarket. The washer and dryer was a great addition to the room, for the first time we came home from a holiday with no dirty clothes! That was fab! Again we got some washing powder and fabric conditioner sheets, but then we made real use of them, others may not and will suffice with the tiny packs of washing powder they provide (no fabric conditioner though) for free. The palm caf\u00e9 was ok, not a huge choice of food but it was good when you were starving and couldn\u2019t be bothered to go out elsewhere. They provide \u2018room service\u2019 but at a major expense! For the sake of walking 2 mins to the caf\u00e9 I would not have paid for them to deliver to our room. The also provide you with menus of nearby restaurants that deliver. We didn\u2019t use any of these but I would use the ones they recommend rather than the pizza flyers you get under your door daily! Got a bit annoying but didn\u2019t ruin our stay. Great location, literally a 5 minute walk to a Walgreen\u2019s Pharmacy and Publix supermarket, the premium outlets were a 10 minute walk away and there was an outback steakhouse restaurant and a MacDonald\u2019s just before you got there (neither of which we got around to using). My only real complaint with our stay was the housekeeping, they made the bed daily and replaced the towels but as far as I could tell that was it. They didn\u2019t actually do any cleaning! Our bath tub wasn\u2019t cleaned once during our stay and I don\u2019t know about anyone else, but mine is cleaned all the time at home, I went and bought some cleaning products in the end. The shuttle service was great, we didn\u2019t hire a car and we really didn\u2019t need to. There was also an i-ride stop right outside the entrance (40 south) and we used this a few times to get to different restaurants along i-drive. You can get tickets from the concierge if you\u2019ll be using it a lot. We also used taxis occasionally and if booked through concierge they weren\u2019t too badly priced (they use sterling) mears really took the mick out of tourists! I wouldn\u2019t use these taxis if I ever return to Orlando! Overall I would return to Floridays even with the few issues listed above.

I am usually great with names...not this time, but he was great. Took my credit card information and DL. I was only responsible for the daily resort fee being I booked online @ Hotels.com. We were in Building F 3rd floor towards the back of the resort. Always decent parking. Balcony was facing the lake and fountain and smaller pool. Nice patio furniture. Not the parsons table and chairs you usually get at a hotel or resort. The room was immaculate and nicely furnished. The only thing was that the whirlpool did not work. I made a call to the front desk and the clerk nicely walked me thru to remedy the situation. She advised that the circuit breaker probably tripped. Totally forgot there was one in the livingroom. That did the trick. Housekeeping came the next day to see if we needed anything. Just new towels and coffee refills. They have Starbucks!! What a change from the normal boring coffees you get at resorts. There was only two of us. But enough cooking and eating utensils were provided. Like some previous reviews I saw (make sure you bring some Potholders or oven mitts) did not see any. There is a Publix in a shopping center nearby as well as a TGIFridays, CVS, Multiple Pizza Shops with some Great deals. This Resort is down the quiet end of International Dr. If you leave out of Resort , turn left and stay on there for about 15 minutes, you will be able to pick and choose among restaurants and entertainment. We wanted to relax, so opted for this resort. Was so peaceful and quiet. Did not have time to use all the amenities. Was short on time and took a 45 minute drive to Cocoa Beach for the day. But there is a nice gameroom, gym, pool patio bar and grille and a small grocery store onsite. The main pool looked fabulous and for a beautiful weekend, was never busy at all. Plenty of chairs. Only had two disappointments the whole weekend and because we only used the small pool, with a bad back was looking forward to using the hot tub to relax. When looking from our balcony , wondered why people were staying in for so long when you shouldnt. Well thats because the heater was broken and it was just luke warm. But still felt great on the back. Wish we would have been informed it did not work, so we could've gone right to the hot tub located in the main pool. The second was that unless we had a USB, we could not use the free wireless internet in our room that was included in the resort fee. They did have main hotspots to use by the main pool area and welcome center. but would have been nice to surf the net in the privacy of our room. Other than that. If I could afford to buy one as a timeshare, I surely would. Oh by the way...Was not approached once about it. Maybe I didnt meet the \"Time share buying\" person \"Look\". But will surely be back again with the kids and stay longer to enjoy it all. .", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLove our \"Staycations\" at Floridays!\u201d", "Author": "eevents", "ReviewID": "UR80300550", "Content": "This was our second year in a row where my girlfriend, her children, me and my children reunited for our annual weekend \"staycation.\" I live in Orlando and she lives in Sarasota which makes this a desirable \"in-between.\" This weekend in particular, the children and us thoroughly enjoyed our lazy Saturday by the pool.

But we didn't want to be confined to a soul less motel room on I Drive in case it rained a lot (September being the rainy season!). Floridays was the perfect solution - you get an air conditioned apartment with a fully fitted kitchen, washer/ dryer, cooker, microwave, fridge freezer, a separate dining area, a large lounge, plus a twin (two double beds) bedroom, bathroom, then a master bedroom (massive double bed) with an en suite bathroom ( with shower and giant whirlpool bath!). Theres also a balcony. There's also an iron, ironing board, hairdryer in each bathroom, vacuum cleaner. Also three televisions! (One in living room, one in each bedroom). Oh and a little balcony with a table and two chairs. Our teenagers loved it. It was really great to have some room to spread out and chill out in the evenings, much more a home from home than a hotel room. If you do stay there, ask for a room in Block A or Block B - it's a big resort but those two buildings are nearest to reception and also just 5 minutes walk to the i Trolley stop which is immediately outside the hotel. There's a lovely swimming pool, a gym (really well equipped ) and a little on site cafe/ shop (it's not really well stocked for groceries but has some useful 'emergency' bits and pieces like medicines and milk and water) - the cafe does very tasty snack meals like burger and fries but its quite expensive (about $10-$15 per head for a snack meal and a drink). There's also a bar on site but we didn't really use it. Floridays is located on International Drive but is at the quieter end of the International drive. It's not really within walking distance of many restaurants etc. as with some of the motels and hotels on I Drive - however we didn't find this a problem at all - there is an I Trolley stop (stop number 40) right outside Floridays and you can buy a weekly ticket for $10 per person unlimited use or it's $1.25 per trip. Trolleys are every 15 or 20 minutes and dead easy to use (there are maps for the route everywhere and also available from the concierge). If you are not familiar with the I Trolley, look it up on Google, it's an excellent service. We used it to get to loads of restaurants, two shopping malls and Seaworld. Also taxis from Floridays to either Disney or Universal are around $22 (one way) but if you can work to set times the hotel runs a daily and completely free bus service to both Disney and Universal (you just book seats the day before with the concierge) - these buses are clean, air conditioned and reliable so I recommend that you use them! They depart around 08.00 a.m. and 10.45 a.m. each morning and return around 6 p.m. or 8 p.m. each evening (these times probably vary depending on the season and the theme park hours so check when you get there). The concierges at Floridays are really really knowledgeable and helpful so ask them anything, we did and they were great. Floridays is about 10 minutes slow walk (or if you are less lazy than me maybe 5 minutes brisk walk!) to a massive 'Publix' (big big supermarket) which has a wonderful fresh food section as well as all the other stuff you would expect in a supermarket - a real pleasure to shop there - so if you want to eat in the apartment rather than dining out it's quite easy to do a grocery shop. There's also (in the same location) a Walgreens (chemist and other stuff), a Chinese takeaway ( we didn't use it but noticed that it did deliveries), a 'liquor store', and a 'Subway' sandwich shop. There isn't a room cleaning service at Floridays (you can pay extra for this but it wasn't included with our booking which was through Expedia). the maid will come in each day and make your beds and replace your towels but that's all. Personally I was fine with this - there's a dishwasher (you are provided with a couple of tiny packs of dishwasher powder so you may need to buy some more) and a vacuum cleaner and brush if you need to have a quick tidy up for yourself. A word of advice - we arrived after a very long journey from the UK, in a rainstorm (!!!) and there wasn't anything in the apartment in the way of tea, coffee, milk or drinking water. So if like us the first thing you do is put the kettle on (!) pack a small carton of dried milk, and some coffee and tea or you will have to make a visit to Publix immediately! It's not far but when you have just arrived it's not what you feel like doing! The apartment we stayed in had cups, plates and cutlery for 4 - 6 people, and there were also some cooking pans and frying pans. There weren't massive amounts of cooking utensils in the kitchen but enough to get by with, and truly everything you need unless you are wanting to do cordon bleu cookery !!! Also there's a tiny bottle of washing up liquid and a tiny box of washing powder provided but you will need to buy any other cleaning products yourself (Publix again). Pretty much what you would expect with any self catering arrangement. Overall we had a great time, the staff are lovely and very helpful, and the place was clean, comfortable and well located.

Our accomodation was a 2 bedroom apartment in block B which is close to the pool and all of the facilities. The apartment was very well equipped with everything we could have needed during our stay (except a clothes airer!! as my wife moaned when trying to dry clothes that would not go in the dryer) and was clean and spacious. The kids loved the fact that there was a TV in every room and frequently we had 3 different programs going on at once. Floridays is at the southern end of International drive which is close to Sea World, Aquatica and all of the Disney parks. We had a hire car and there is adequate on site parking that is free for guests. We found that the resort facilities were fine, a nice pool for us and the kids, shop, bar and food available. We only ate at the resort once but found the food to be fine. Close to Floridays is a Publix supermarket where you can stock up on supplies and the local Outback Steakhouse and Carabas Italian Grill were great value and an easy journey by car or taxi. I think Floridays is excellent value and we will definitely be staying there again on our next trip to Florida. There was wired internet access in the room and I simply plugged my network cable into the socket each day and was instantly online to check e mails and research our next theme park visit etc. From a security perspective we felt safe and secure the whole time in the resort and locked our valuables etc. in the in room safe that was easy to use and free of charge. The only negatives I can comment upon was that the pillows were not as comfortable as they could have been (very personal observation however) and as mentioned in another review we found the rooms a little cold as the A/C is so good. This was fine once you adjusted to the room temp however upon first entry to the room you really felt cold.

We read most of the reviews on many resort spots in Orlando and decided on Floridays despite a few negative reviews. We were absolutely amazed with the accommodations and the suite was very clean and tidy upon arrival. We planned the trip through Travelocity so everything was set up when we arrived. Our room was not ready when we arrived, however we did get there early at 11 am. The other family we arrived with had their room ready so we hung out in their room until ours was all set. We requested rooms close to one another...so I guess that was the delay...and the resort gave us a 3 bedroom room to accommodate us at no extra charge! Some pointers: request a room with a view of one of the 2 pools as it makes a huge difference when having your breakfast or drinks on the patio looking at the great pool views rather than the parking lot of the adjacent resorts. Book through an agency that books you into the resort itself: we met a gentleman who booked through an agency that had a private owner of the unit...any cleaning services, towels and other service is not included. Yes there was a resort fee for about $12/day however they DO tell you on check in and it is clearly listed on your key package. Includes maid service to change the towels, make beds and clear the trash/recyclables. When we needed extra soap, a sauce pot (we couldn't find one in the unit), glassware, plates they brought it up to our room without question. The facilities are amazing and we enjoyed the pools until 11 pm on most nights after busy days at Disney/Sea World. It is right in the heart of the action, very close to Disney, Universal, Sea World and plenty of shopping outlets and grocery stores to buy supplies for meals to cook on your own. We stayed a week and are already planning 2 weeks at Floridays next year...1 week was not enough to thoroughly enjoy the area!

Publix supermarket within walking distance and we stocked up for the week since the Kitchen was so large(snacks, drinks etc.). We rented a car so we didn't use the shuttle service. Only 10 minutes from Disney entrance, a mile or so from Seaworld. If i were to nitpick one thing, it would be the size of the fitness room(small) vs. the size of the resort, but that is it. Good Story: Had went online in my room to buy Seaworld Tickets and needed to print out prior to leaving. There was an issue with the printer in the business center but they immediately printed out the documents in their back office at no charge without hesitation.

The room was well appointed and had the typical timeshare-unit amenities - kitchen utensils, coffee maker, fridge, stove, etc.. - pretty much everything you need if you choose to cook while on vac to save some money. Several pizza/sandwich places available to deliver as well - you will have menus slipped under the door daily - we ordered one day and worked out fine.

Large master bath with jacuzzi tub and second bathroom as well, very convenient. Larger pool by lobby seemed very nice as well, many lounge chairs, though we were unable to use either pool due to sightseeing and storms in area when we DID plan to use them. Fitness center has 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals (sp?), 1 recumbent bike and several (6) weight machines - no free weights, mats or exercise balls, but was ok and not ever at capacity during the 5 days we were there/used it.

It was also great to have a tv in every room so everyone could watch their favorite programs. If you want to be waited on hand and foot, I'd choose a luxury hotel, but for a great family vacation choose Floridays.", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA great place to relax\u201d", "Author": "Abri10", "ReviewID": "UR75777393", "Content": "We had booked a different hotel in Orlando but after reading poor reviews changed at late notice to Floridays and are very glad we did.

The beds were particularly comfortable and there was always hot water for showers/baths. We didn't want to eat out every evening so appreciated the kitchen area.

There was, however, a smaller pool nearby (overlooked from the suite balcony) which was just a short walk away and saw nowhere near the traffic of the larger pool. The resort provides a transport around the property as needed. Just flag one down or contact the front desk to request one. Both pools had plenty of pool-side seating; we had no trouble finding available beach chairs. Both pools have fresh towels on-site. They were well stocked every time we went poolside.

There were plenty of cars in the lot and we saw other guests around the building, but seldom heard other people (no doors, yelling, running\u2026etc.) while in our suite. This is a huge plus.

I was debating between 4 other resorts and was trying to narrow my choice. Initially , I was estactic about selecting Floridays after checking the reviews and location. As my trip date got closer, I began comparing again and re-reading reviews and they got worse. I was questioning my choice of Floridays because I was starting to see a pattern of bad reviews. Having stayed there now myself, I will say some complaints are valid but can be overlooked. Here are some of the complaints I witnessed but dismissed. 1. Inconsistent Housekeeping- this did become annoying as we never received the same service daily. Some days we received clean towels and washcloths but no hand towels. I dont usually care about hand towels but they were CRUCIAL to have when touring the parks as we perspired profusely!!!! Other days they removed the dirty towels and washcloths but didnt provide new washcloths. Some days they did one bathroom but not the other. The housekeeper was nice and we didnt complain; we just asked her to leave extras. 2. Bed linen never changed- After being there a week, it would've been nice to have the sheets changed at least once. However, Floridays charges an additional housekeeping charge for this service which I think it should be part of the regular resort fee. 3. Bad water odor- I saw this complaint on a another review and thought the reviewer was being just petty. I soon discovered it wasnt. The water had a gassy-oil type smell and it became unbearable for me. It permeatted the shower and laundry. By the last day I was ready to leave just because of the smell. I had to re-wash all the laundry after returning home. 4. Mold in shower grout- I did notice the shower grout could use a good scrubbing as it was more noticeable in some areas than others. Quick trip to walmart fixed this. 5. Daily resort fee for debit card users- now this was a budget buster. If you used a debit card (with credit card logo), you were required to pay an upfront fee of $50.00 per day. Our stay was for 6 nights which totaled $300 in addition to resort fee and room rates. This debit card policy is not on there website nor is it stated on the confirmation email. If its on the website somewhere during the reservation process I must have missed it but doubt it. I think the only way I found out was via another booking site. I contacted the resort and told them my issue and they were able to work out a compromise. 6. Daily pizza flyers- you will get this daily under your door; just throw them away. No big deal. 7. No security- Another reviewer complained about the lack of security. The one thing no reviewer mentioned was that this resort has a motel set up. Meaning, the entrance door to your room is outside versus being inside like a hotel room and hallway. If I had known this upfront, I dont think I would have ever stayed here. I do not like the motel door feature where any passerby out side can gain access to your door. Thankfully, Floridays is located in a very quiet and slow area and this door issue didnt bother me much. Overall, Floridays was very nice and I would recommend it for value and location. It was very comfy and felt like home. Kitchen was extremely nice and had everything you needed from dishware to pots and pans. We saved money by eating in and cooking meals. Location was great. We could leave the parks and come back to eat and rest and go back out. Traffic was never an issue. Walmart , Publix, CVS, Walgreens and shopping outlets are all withing 5 miles. If you go another 5 miles or so, you will hit up al the restuarants and stores. I-ride trolley stops right in front of the resort; we didnt use it, we had a rental car.

First off the accommodation is huge with loads of room and very clean. Pools are fantastic but i would agree with the last reviewer about the Sun Beds been a bit uncomfortable they are also made of steel so the arms get very hot in the heat so be careful when you hop on them out of the pool as you could get burned. The kids loved the Games room but it could have done with a Pool Table & maybe a Ping Pong Table to use during the day to get out of the heat in the afternoon for the adults and Teenagers among our group. There is Kids entertainment on weekends our kids took part in some of the Pool Games but been in the middle of Orlando there is plenty of entertainment on your doorstep so it is not a big loss during the week. There is also some music on Fridays & Sat nights in the Bar area. The Staff on site are excellent from the reception staff, bar staff to the Security especially mike who looked after us on our late nights/early mornings, they even brought us some Hot Dogs on the 4th of July well after the Bar had closed. The marketplace is good for a snack during the day and great for a early morning starbucks, we also had dinner there a couple of times and had no complaints. The property is located on the Doorstep to Seaworld and the Disney Parks both within 10 mins drive, Universal Parks are about 20 mins away. As per previous post the maid service is not that great we had asked for a full service of the condo half way through our visit but we had to ask for ours to be done twice as it was not done at all the 1st time, also the resort fee is a rip off as there is no clear explanation for what it is for we were told it was for taking out trash and clean towels but this is hit & miss as well as it is not always done. I think if the Floridays want to be Number 1 in Orlando they need to get rid of this fee or give the visitor something for their money. Having said all of the above we will definitely be going back as the Pros far out way the cons, and hopefully some of the comments above will be acted upon for our next visit. :)", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat stays at Floridays\u201d", "Author": "Iain00", "ReviewID": "UR71385185", "Content": "My wife and I travelled to Floridays on 3rd June from the UK with our 5 year old son. While we are frequent visitors to the US and Florida this was my son's first trip to the theme parks and we could not have picked a better location. A 15minute drive in one direction was all the disney parks and 20 minutes the other way was Universal and with Seaworld/Aquatica/Discovery Cove less than 2 miles away. My son doesn't do heat so after a dy in the parks he loved spending a couple of hours cooling off at the child friendly pool. Whilst the hotel is mainly geared to families there is a smaller quieter pool where those without kids who want some peace without the usual screaming that accompanies small children will find ideal!! The main feature (and heaven with a fussy eating 5 year old in tow) are the rooms. Equipped with a fridge, freezer, cooker, microwave, dishwasher and washer/dryer it was a home from home. We found eating out a problem with a tired child so we often got take out and re-heated or cooked something which is not normally what we would do on holiday but with the facilities available it was an easy choice. There was a Publix just arounf the block. Across from Publix was Prime Outlet Mall, Outback Steakhouse and McDonalds. (a word on McD's - the service was awful - so much for fast food. Not!!!!) All the staff at Floridays were helpful and the room was serviced daily with towels changed daily (Bedding was only changed weekly although I believe this can be done more regularly at an additional cost). The daily 'resort fee' was a bit steep when you consider that the cost of staying here isnt that cheap but that was just a small quibble. But for a 2 bedroom apartment with facilities it was still good value. While there is no restaurant there is a small cafe where food can be served at the pool and they stock some essentials like milk etc as well as serving Starbucks coffee. The hotel is comprised of 6 blocks but a word of warning, there are plans to build 2 more blocks so check if the building work has started and what disruption this may cause (hopefully not too much because it will be away from the pool area so perhaps best to aim for blockas A or B if poss (on an upper floor) which should be furthest away from the planned work.

On arrival ,reception area looked the part, then I got to the room ! Very dissapointed with the old kitchen units.worn furniture in lounge and dining area,carpet looked like it could do with a good scrub. The bedrooms and bathrooms were a bit better,had the added bonus of some half eaten,food left in a cuprd,a sweaty t-shirt behind the sofa and a pair of socks in the bedroom drawer.made me think that the rooms MAY have been given the quick once over ! Another thing that concerned me as I had young children in my party,was the lack of security in the complex.you can drive or walk in completley unchallanged to any part of the complex. You will probably find that you have pizza flyers rammed under your door at all times of the evening by different companies who have full access to any block they wish. We also had someone trying to get the door open to our flat at 1.30 am which was concerning to my kids,as it woke us up. I had read a few good reviews about the rooms,on this site,but I can only presume that the good reviews have come from people who have had rooms in one of the newer blocks,either that or their previous accommodation was of a lower standard and Floridays seemed good compared to where they stayed before. I spoke to a few people at the pool area whom stayed in blocks A and B,we were in D,and they said that their rooms were the same,tired with worn furniture. Any way after the first week the maids gave the place a decent clean and changed all the bedding so it felt a bit cleaner at least. The pool and bar area was good ,cafe was fine,games room for the children was ok. I agree with previous comments that there are not enough beds for the busy periods an the broken ones should be replaced,good to see the berrys from the palm trees being removed as they just got trodden into the area around the pool an made it look tatty. VERY impressed with the pool entertainment,'DJ Chris', kept the kids busy for a couple of hours ,gave us parents some time to relax. I think that it may be an idea to let guests know whats on during the stay.We only found out about DJ Chris as we happened to be at the pool that day. Seemingly there were other things on like massages , scuba diving lessons,entertainment at the bar,happy hour but it seemed to be 'top secret' ! We found staff to be mostly friendly,we couldn't get a late check out, but they stored our luggage for us for a few hours. I would probably return to Floridays due to its location to the parks,plus the pools good for the kids and it is handy having a cafe an bar onsite. However I would be calling to make sure that I could get a newer or refurbished room before I booked.

Our 3 kids loved the fact that we can stay in the pool until 11pm to cool down at night. Access to grocery store is a short stroll away and will save you tons of $$ if you use the kitchen in your suite! Eat breakfast at home and then head out to the parks. Do reserve your shuttles the night before to guarantee a seat. But do make sure you are at least 10 mins early prior to the shuttle's departure. They usually arrive early and will NOT wait even if you are on the reservation list. If you rent a car for a couple of days (like we did) Cocoa Beach is only about 45 mins away...dont forget change for the toll booths! Do note that there is a ATM machine in the lobby but it only dispenses $200 at a time, plus ATM charges apply. If you need to withdraw $$ try going to a bank where you will get various dominations other that -- we found ourselves looking for bank where we wouldn't be charged an arm and a leg in bank fees + conversion on currency.

The only down side was room service was sooo pricey! So I do recommend just eating in and making your meals in your room. If you use the Lynx buses and IRide Trolly that is more beneficial if you like to just stay along International Drive. Do not recommend using this to go to SeaWorld or the Disney Parks...the buses take forever! Just use the shuttle at Floridays for the parks! We absolutely loved our stay at Floridays!

What we didn't know, until entering our Suite in Building C, was that we had been upgrade to a 3-bedroomed Suite, which was just fantastic! The Suites, were just as we'd remembered- spotlessly clean, spacious, and replete with every conceivable device for that \"Home from Home\" experience. The main Pool, which lies between Blocks A and B was wonderful- just the right water temperature, and our 5-year-old Son loved the water features by the zero entry. Everyone we dealt with was extremely courteous and helpful, making us feel like treasured Guests- really quite humbling.

Food at the pool was very nice and not too dear, my family's lunch price including drinks averaged $36. The hotel is at stop 40 on the i-ride trolley and so is pretty far South. It took us a good 20 to 25 minutes on the bus to get up to stops 24 - 20 where alot of restaurants are. Having said that I would definately book Floridays again. Most of our time was spent at the parks and it was nice to come away to a quieter hotel in the evenings. We found alot of the other guests were Americans and Canadians who choose to holiday there because the pool area was so nice and the parking was right outside the apartment blocks. The reception staff and the concierge couldn't do enough for us and were very helpful.

What Im getting at here is they have people patrolling the parking lot, and maintanence driving by in golf carts and everyone has a permit with a # that the resort asks you to put in your windshield.

Our appartment was fantastic,everything that you could want.My fav thing was the wash machine and tumble dryer(i will know for next year to travel lighter going over). It would be ideal for families wth young children or familes on a budget as you could go to the Publix supermarket(3min away) and buy in your meals for the week.We ate out in the eves.The master room was huge with a huge bed,bathroom,air conditioning,and tv.The other 2 bedrooms were big ,2 beds in each of those rooms,ideal for sharing with friends.Beds were comfy.Kitchen and living area big also.Huge t.vs in each room.Floridays felt like a very safe resort.The staff were extremely friendly,polite and very efficient.Each morn our appartment was given a general tidy,bins towels,and beds made-bed clothes changed daily at a fee.The pool was big and looked really nice but the weather was slightly dull for our stay!!Now location,Floridays is on stop 40 on international drive(quiet end),which is about 7min drive from main busy international strip.we used the i ride most days for method a transport,an in expensive form of travelling.We use taxis some nights also.10/12 dollars!! Floridays is a 3 min walk to one of the outlets so is great for a spot of retail therapy after a day at the parks,brilliant offers at this outlet.

It's a saltwater pool, so from the start it doesn't look as clean as a freshwater pool, plus the date palm trees surrounding the pool dropped little seeds into the pool constantly, and kids would track sand into the pool from the adjacent \"beach.\" The pool was the only part of the experience I would rate as even somewhat negative.

For a family, you can't fault the value and convenience. As others have commented, the approximation to Publix, outlets, walgreens and I-Ride buses is hard to beat. When we first stayed at Floridays it was brand new. Since then, things are showing wear as you would expect and although we obviously like to resort having been there three times, there are some improvements that could be made. Here are my pro's and con's. PRO - location, location - great out of the fray of Disney yet easy to get everywhere. A car is a must though unless you are going to rely on shuttles and buses. - pool(s) and facilities are very nice. Great for kids (our 4 year old LOVES their pool) a sandy area for play with buckets and shovels, hot tub, stocked towels, etc. - rooms allow for either 2 or 3 bedroom, perfect for families - allows everyone to have their own space - grounds are well kept and clean - marketplace on site for quick items like coffee, cereal or sunscreen - friendly and helpful guest services, everyone tries to be as accommodating as possible - full kitchen is awesome for those that want to save a little money or just eat more healthfully. We got foods for breakfast and lunch right around the corner at the Publix and then ate dinners out. Carry out dinners are also nice shared on the room balcony. - laundry is a very nice extra that is so helpful. You can pack less and come home without a lot of work to do. I did notice however, this trip that the machine in our room was not spinning well and the clothes were very wet after a full cycle. An equipment refresh is probably needed after so many years of hard use. CONS - housekeeping! It's not just a fluke, we've had poor housecleaning services every trip. You wouldn't think this would be that big of a deal, but when you come back from a day at the parks at 3:30 and the room has not been touched it is annoying. At these condo's you can expect towels to be refreshed, trash to be removed and beds to be made only.

Our party was 2 adults and 2 boys aged 8 and 10. We had a 2 bedroom ground floor unit in Block C. The location was fine and the unit was private and quiet. We found the interior to be quite dark even with the curtains fully opened at the back. (Opening the second bedroom curtains exposes you to the walk by traffic and this seems to be common to most units). The furnishings in our unit were a little tired as were the kitchen fixtures and utensils. A bed in the boys room was broken when we arrived and on closer inspection it was easy to tell that this was a well used piece of furniture. I reported the broken bed to reception and it was repaired before we returned that night. We found that our bed linens were generally old and poorly fitted so that even though the beds were made daily, they were always 'sloppy'. At day 10 we had to ask the housecleaning staff to change our bed linen. We used the resort shuttle which is shared with the nearby Fountains resort. The shuttle picks up first at Fountains. On several occasions we found that the shuttle was fully booked and we were required to make other arrangements. So be advised, book your shuttle very early on the preceding day, particularly on weekends. As many have reported here recently, the heated pool was cold. Enough said. We have travelled extensively and rarely find the need to use bottled water however we all reached for the bottled water as the water in the rooms smeeled and tasted very strongly of sulphur. If we were to go again I would think very seriously about Fountains Resort. BTW, here's a tip for those without a car. If at Disney and you wish to get back to the resort by taxi, take a Disney shuttle to a resort adjacent to Downtown Disney. Take a leisurely stroll over to Downtown Disney and get your taxi there.

There were 6 of us - my husband, myself, 2 boys, and my in laws. We had a 3 bedroom unit in building C and the space was perfect. The kitchen was very well stocked with dishes and cooking items. Only thing missing was salt and pepper. There is a grocery store within walking distance that closes at 10. The Walmart is about a 10 minute drive and is open 24 hours. We really liked our location in the hotel. Building C is close to the pool, but not directly overlooking it. At check in, we were given a choice of room locations and picked a room overlooking a pond with the pool in the distance. There are rooms with only parking lot views, which wouldn't be great if you plan to sit on the deck at all. We had such a great time in the mornings watching the pond. There was a family of ducks, a turtle, lots of fish, visiting loons etc. The front desk staff were great. The room was very clean upon check in. We knew ahead of time that full housekeeping was an additional charge. Everyday, they would replenish towels and make the beds. A couple of times we had to call the desk as not enough towels were left, but other than that, the service was reliable. Once, we did order a full cleaning which was only $35. They did a great job on the bathrooms and kitchen, but the vaccuming wasn't great. The only negative thing we experienced was the restaurant service at the pool. We only used it once, so maybe we just hit it on a bad night. We were told that our orders would be 20 minutes and they took over 40. Then, my husband ordered a pizza and sat there for almost an hour waiting. The place was closing and it turned out they hadn't put the order through. They offered to make it, but it would have been another 20 minutes so he passed. But, again, that was the only time we tried it so I don't know if that was a common thing. The bar service was great though, and the drinks were yummy. We had originally booked through expedia, but we ended up cancelling that reservation and booked directly through the hotel as they had a much better AAA rate come up.

For an unbelievably low price we had a three bedroom, two bath unit with a kitchen, dining room, living room, balcony, and washer dryer combo. There was a king sized bed in the master bedroom with a large Jacuzzi and walk-in shower in the master bath. There were two double beds and a TV in each of the other two rooms. The kitchen was very well equipped, and since it was just after the holidays, my wife was even able to make a complete turkey dinner for her children and grandchildren who we were visiting and had staying with us. It was very clean and everything looked new. Because the weather was very cold, it barely reached 50o, we stayed in our unit for most of the time. But we had plenty of room, and even hooked up a WII game system to the huge flat screen TV. They had a very nice pool area, that we hear was heated, but we opted not to try out. There was also a game room and exercise area. The property is located between Disney and Universal, and Sea World and Auquatica are right down the road. There is a grocery store right down the road and plenty of shopping and restaurants close by. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. When we called and asked about the internet access they said we could come down at any time and pick up a cable if we needed it. About five minutes later there was a knock on the door and someone was dropping off the cable for us. We had a problem with one of our keycards and a short time later someone was dropping off a new set. We asked for extra towels and again someone else dropped off a stack of extra towels. Something to keep in mind is that this is a timeshare type condo area. The only thing that housekeeping does daily is make the beds and change out the towels, etc. Although they are selling the unused units off like a hotel room, it is still a timeshare. It is a luxury condo that is normally rented out like a vacation home so you don\u2019t get daily maid service like in a hotel. There is also a daily condo fee that covers the shuttle, parking, internet, etc. (I think it was about $12.00 a day) That is how timeshares work. When I was checking this resort out, I\u2019m pretty sure almost all of the travel sites were pretty clear, and some even highlighted this information at the top of the descriptions. I would hate to think people were giving this resort lower marks because of information they should have been aware of before they even made their reservations. But even though this is a timeshare location, there was never any high pressure sales pitch forced on us. If we wanted to attend meeting they would take $100.00 off the bill, but we were never harassed about it. We have had to deal with that before and we really appreciated not having that happen here. We were very pleased with everything and would definitely stay at Floridays again the next time we are in Orlando.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cA great home away from home!\u201d", "Author": "Onmybreak", "ReviewID": "UR59083979", "Content": "My husband and I along with our 3 year old daughter stayed at Floridays in a two-bedroom condo. I have to say we were very happy with the accommodations. We stayed in one of the newer buildings \"E\". Note, this building is not too close to the main building that has the larger pool, but we enjoyed a short walk through the parking lot to get there. If you prefer a closer walk you should request it when your booking. The condo was very clean and supplied all the utensils needed except we needed a frying pan which we got in a matter of 10 minutes after calling the front desk. We cooked breakfast every day and we enjoyed eating out on the patio. One other problem we had was with the AC vent in the master bathroom. It would make a very loud noise every time it would turn on and it disturbed our sleep. The following morning we called guest services and the maintenance person came in, couldn't fix it at first, but was determined to resolve the problem. By the end of the day it was fixed AND the front desk called each time to verify that the person had arrived and made a follow-up call to make sure we were satisfied and the problem was resolved. Impeccable customer service, it was refreshing! We had all the luxuries of being in our own home. Washer/dryer, comfortable beds, very nice kitchen and dining room table and comfortable furniture in the living room area. Aside from some noisy late night guests, we were extremely happy and I'm sure if we had called the desk to complain, they would have resolved that issue immediately. There is also a smaller pool near the back buildings where we stayed and it was very nice and quiet. The concierge service is great and you can purchase all your park tickets, etc. through them. Again, can't say enough about this place and a great value for the money we spent. SeaWorld is less than 10 minutes away and Disney is 15 minutes away, perfect location. Simple hotel rooms were more expensive so we felt like we got a great deal. Can't wait to go back again next year! Don't hesitate, great find. Cheap eats and great food - Bahama Breeze.

We left laptops and cameras in the safe when we didn't need them, left golf clubs in the room with no problems. Housekeeping replaces towels and amenities (soaps etc) and makes the beds every day, anything more will involve a charge.

I was still skeptical but when we got to Floridays I was impressed. Checked-in on a Saturday afternoon, no wait at check-in or check-out - fast service. Only thing at check-in that could have improved was a little more of an introduction to the resort itself. We easily found our room and we were pleasantly surprised. Very clean! I did a bed bug check and none found - no problems. Very clean new mattresses. I had also read about how noisy it could be and was worried because it was spring break week. I found it to be very quiet with the exception of a small dog that went crazy barking at 8 am every morning for a few mornings. Other than that no problem. I would say it's nosier to sleep in the bedroom that faces the outside walkway. You may hear carts being pushed up and down or people talking. Housekeeping and all the service staff went above and beyond. The front desk professionals were highly responsive. Housekeeping replaces the towels daily, there was dish soap (both liquid and powder for the dishwasher) and starter laundry detergent (no fabric softener). They provide a new sponge for any hand washing of dishes. They provide hand and bath soaps, shower gel, body lotion, shampoo and conditioner - which they replaced daily if needed. There are beach towels at the pool. No mold in the baths - very clean. In fact, I found we were missing a spatula. I called the front desk and they sent a new one right over. I found the frying pan was really badly scratched up with the Teflon coating fraying and asked if it could be replaced, they quickly did so with a brand new one. We didn't think there was internet in our rooms, but there is free internet hook up - you need to bring an Ethernet cable or ask the front desk for a cable. They will provide one at no charge if you return it. I thought that was nice. The fitness center was small and new, all LifeFitness equipment. 2 Elliptical machines, 2 treadmills, 1 recumbent bike. Weight machines that cover all the major muscle groups. I liked that they provided sanitary wipes to clean the machines (although they did run out of these), hand sanitizer, water, and towels. On one particularly busy day they ran out of everything, but eventually did come to replace them. Busiest time in the workout room seemed to be 10 am - 11 am. Pool was fabulous!! The main pool was very nicely heated. We had unseasonably cold weather and were there really so my daughter could swim. We didn't come to Orlando to do theme parks, my 6 year old really just wanted a great pool and it was. The outside temp was a windy 67 degrees but if you stood near the edge of the pool you could feel the heat from it. The water was like bath water -- definitely, really enjoyed it. there are 4 lap lanes on one end of the main pool and a great kids area for little ones. No life guard on duty but we didn't encounter any rough housing problems. The pool is 5 ft deep in the center. There's another smaller pool and hot tub over near the back buildings. The onsite market has all the basics, no butter, but everything else. Floridays is in an excellent location - you could walk to Publix - the supermarket which is new and nice. There isn't a full side walk to it so I wouldn't recommend it necessarily but it's very close. The refrigerator has an ice maker in it. There's also a McDonald's, Outback, and Panera nearby. I would buy bottled water because the water in Florida has a sulfuric smell and chlorine or something that is strong enough to change the flavor of your coffee. LOVED the Starbucks starter pack of coffee provided! It made one 10 - 12 cup pot. Beds were very comfortable. Slept great there. I had read the temperature boxes were locked, but ours wasn't and we had no problem adjusting it if we wanted. There's an in room safe. Also loved the jacuzzi in the master bedroom. All in all a GREAT vacation that was relaxing!! We were impressed by the excellent service. I was very impressed that every single staff member went above and beyond!! You just don't see that that often. For example, the man who brought the frying pan and the spatula also asked if we needed anything else and then offered to bring additional garbage bags (he could see we might need them). I was prepared for them not to take the garbage because I had read here that was a problem, but they fixed it.

We were happy to find the unit very quiet, no noise traveled through the walls, that is something that drives me crazy in hotels. Unfortunately, and I'm not sure why, when neighbors allowed their doors to slam shut it shook our door and was quite loud. You could hear a lot of noise through the door as people talked in the halls. We were so happy to have the dishwasher and laundry, and were told at check-in what to expect from housekeeping- not much! Our unit was basically clean when we checked in. We did spend some time in the sandy area by the pool, and the kids found cigarette butts in the sand- gross! Can't really blame the hotel for that. Our impression was that we were staying at a family resort, but at the pool area at certain times it got a little rowdy. Not sure if they were guests or not? Which brings me to our biggest concern with Floridays- there is absolutely no security. No other resort we have been to or heard about let the public have free access to the grounds, pool, cars and guests!!!! We were careful about leaving anything in our car overnight, and didn't feel totally secure walking around at night. We had multiple fast food menus slipped under our door each day!

The floors could have used a better scrub and this was upon checking in. The beds are \"made\" daily along with garbage removal but bedding is not changed at all during your stay. My advice is to shell out the money for a mid week cleaning if staying a week or buy cleaning supplies along with your groceries. This would have been helpful especially since both tubs got a little scuzy after 8 days with a very busy family! Towels are also replenished daily but for some reason I had to call daily for facecloths!!! There is a dishwasher but we only got one pack of dishwashing powder so this may be another item to add to the grocery list. This resort is very close to the major theme parks, a short 10 min drive.

We could never hear the TV or conversations of our neighbors, just a small amount of plumbing noise. However, noise does come in through the windows. The buildings are set up with a courtyard area, so if there are guest scoming in late at night, their voices echo through the courtyard.

We were three adults who booked online and our stay was from 2/25/10-3/1/10, check in time was 4:00pm but we were told that we could check in earlier and if there was a condo availale. We arrived around 2:00pm and were able to check in effortlessly, our location was in building F # 211. The building itself was quite a distance from the main pool/bar area but since the weather during our stay was quite cool it really wasn't a big deal to us. The parking isn't assigned but we had no problem finding a spot by our building at the end of the day. The condo itself was very nice and well worth the money, it sure beat staying in a crowded hotel room. There was a Publix grocery store very close by and we stopped in to stock up on what we needed for the next four days. A previous review mentioned being pressured with regards to a time share offer but no one ever mentioned it to us during our stay. The condo was very clean and well appointed and had a nice balcony with a table and two chairs. The view from the balcony wasn't that great, it overlooked the Operations Building but it was very quiet. The resort provides a daily refresh service which included making the beds, replacing the towels and emptying the trash. For an additional fee you could upgrade but we found this service to be just fine for the three of us. We didn't use the pool or any of the services so I cannot comment on them however while using my laptop in the lobby I saw a lot of people purchasing park tickets and getting directions. My Father in Law sat at the pool bar one night and said the service was great and the bartender was very friendly. We did ask upon check out if in the future we could request a location closer to the main pool and were told that repeat guests can often get a better location than we had this time. All in all the resort was perfect for us and given the full kitchen it is a great value for those who like to dine in occasionally during their stay. We cannot wait to return to Floridays in the Fall. My Father in Law mentioned that they offered him a discount coupon for a return visit but I wasn't offered one at check out so may just call them to see if I could get one since we plan on returning.", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bermuda", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort, We loved it!!!\u201d", "Author": "pepe_Lapu", "ReviewID": "UR57535106", "Content": "We just came back from Floridays for a 7 nights vacation.

We also asked one day to borrow a screwdriver to fit some new batteries in one of the kid's toys, and they sent the maintenance guy round straight away with it, even though it was New Year's Day. You wouldn't get service like that in the UK! The apartment was very clean, and was roomy enough for all of us, though the second bedroom was a bit small for 2 double beds/3 kids. There was free Internet in the rooms, and reception offered us an ethernet cable when we checked in. Apparently there is free wifi in the public areas, although we didn't try this. They offer you a $100 voucher if you go to the timeshare presentaion, but don't push it, unlike some places. The cafe serves a good range of breakfasts/snacks. The pool area was nice, though sadly for us, too cold to use it very often while we there. Ignore all the pizza flyers that get pushed under your door - they are usually poor quality. If you want a pizza delivered, ask the concierge for a recommendation. The location is good, at the bottom (quiet) end of I-drive, near to Sea World, and about halfway betwen Disney and Universal. There is a Publix round the corner, which has a great deli counter, and an OK Chinese restaurant/take-away and a Venzuelan cafe. It's also walking distance to Premium Outlets, though you might want to take a taxi back if you do a lot of shopping. The I-ride stops outside the hotel (stop 40), though be aware, if you are planning to use the I-ride a lot, that it takes nearly an hour to get to the Prime Outlets mall at the other end on it. Negatives: The apartment showed some signs of wear and tear - chipped furniture, decor a bit dated. Plenty of kitchen gadgets (coffee maker, toaster, food mixer ...), but the utensils were a bit limited if you wanted to cook - only one saucepan! Cleaning was limited to bedmaking, towel changing and trash emptying unless you paid $25/day extra. Beds were only spot changed during the two weeks - a couple of the pillowcases, but not the sheets. No cleaning equipment was provided, not even a dustpan and brush, so it's hard to clean up any accidental messes the kids make. We asked the maid about this, and she said that that was the way it is.

One thing was that we looked at ratings, but when Floridays had over 600 reviews and still had a score of over 9.0. As I said, it was easy. Floridays has nice big rooms with everything we needed. Big fridge, washer, dryer etc. We stayed for several weeks and got the feel of the resort as well as the whole area. You don`t need a rental car, everything is whitin walking distance (PUBLIX, GAP etc) We used the fitness room almost every day. The kids used the DVD rental machine near the front desk a few times. Nice during the cold periode we experienced. We planed to visit Aquatica and Sea World (given the age-span), and got great deals as well as good information. We went with the 14 day pass (same price as 3 single days) We used the shuttle service (included in your room price) to the theme parks. When we didnt, we used the I-Ride trolley.

And they did. Even when the twins stroller had a flat tire and there was no way to get a new one, they pumped it up every day the last week of our stay.

Every time we needed support (i.e. changing a light bulb) the front desk always called you up to check if everything was taken care of. We had a great stay, we will be back. Friends of us has already been to Orlando, they stayed at Floridays. They will be back as well. Remember (all european travelers): - Tax is not incluted in anything you want to buy. - Tax and insurance is not includet in rental car offers (if you rent car in the US) - bring plug adapter, European ones does not fit - Use the coupons when you can. We were unsure beacause we are not used to this system. But it saves money and no one thinks twice about it. - If you go to publix to shop for food etc. Look for good deals. In 2 weeks time you can save a lot of money. - Remember; if you go to any of the theme parks with infants, they do not provide you with hot water in the bottle or heat up baby food in the micro for you. They give you a cup of hot water for you to warm up your food. No worries when you plan for it. Best regards to all of the staff at Floridays.

There were 6 of us, we were extremely comfortable, plenty of room for everyone. We had a 3 bdrm and it was HUGE. Cooked breakfast and dinner in the room on one day and the kitchen had everything we needed. There is a Publix right around the corner to pick up anything you need. A little past the Publix there is an Outlet Mall with great shopping. We were maybe 5-10 minutes from the Disney Parks. Not many restaurants immediately around the hotel but if you go down Vineland or take International down to World Center Drive there is every restaurant you can imagine within a 5-10 minute drive. The service at the hotel was great, check in was fast & easy and the push to go to the Time Share presentation was not bad at all, a polite no and we weren't asked to do it again or pressured into it. We only had one small issue (the smoke detector started beeping for the low battery), we called the front desk and they had someone there in minutes (this was at 7:30AM). They don't have full maid service, they will make the beds, take out the garbage & bring fresh towels each day. The room was very clean when we arrived. Sheets are wonderful and beds are very comfortable. There were TV's in each of the 3 bdrms and a nice LCD TV in the living room. The master bath had a stand up shower and a huge jaccuzi tub. The second bath had a stand up shower and a HUGE 2 sink vanity, plenty of room in each one to have 2 people getting ready at the same time without tripping over each other. The only complaint about the bathrooms was that there was no water closet. But not a big deal. Master bdrm had king bed, the other 2 rooms had 2 queen beds each. I believe the couch folded out to another bed but we didn't need to use it. They have computer access in the room but you do need a cord to connect your computer which I did not bring with me. I think they have wireless in the lobby but I didn't use that either. There were 2 pools (we did not use as the temps were in the low 30's all weekend) that looked very nice. We didn't visit the onsite restaurant or bar so can't comment on that. Overall we had a fabulous stay and if traveling with family or a group of friends again we would definitely stay here.

The carpet in the bedroom was worn and had the carpet tacs sticking out. Again not a real big deal, they just had to be carefull not to step on it with bare feet.

They also don't offer room cleaning during your stay unless you pay extra ($35 per day)for it.

Our party consisted of me, my two boys (14 and 11) and my mother (63). We booked a 3bed apartment through Hotelopia and the price was very good in comparison to other sites (\u00a31300). One of the main reasons we chose Floridays was that it had the three bedroom option which was what we needed. Last time we stayed at a Disney hotel and had to book two rooms and they would not give us any discount despite there only being 4 of us. Following on from what I read on here we requested block B or C overlooking the lake and we got exactly that. We were on the end of block B so could even see part of the pool. I have read some reviews complaining about noise from the pool and also about the pool closing too early but I didnt have an issue with either from our location. There was not too much noise, but the pool does need to close at a reasonable time so young children can get to sleep! My only complaint about noise would be that at about 7am I could hear them getting the pool ready for the day and the noise of them scraping the chairs along the floor woke me up. With the exception of the pool, which was excellent, the resort facilities were not up to much. The \"restaurant\" had very little on offer and we only got something on the night we arrived. The games room was very small. The business centre was ridiculously prices for using the PCs. I cant remember exacly but it may have been something like $1 for 10minutes. I noticed one review saying you pay $7 for the ethernet cable for internet access in your room, but that is not charged if you return the cable. Wifi is not available in the rooms, but was in recpetion and by the pool (I think). The facilities in the apartment were excellent. There was even an ice maker in the fridge. We had few problems (toilet blocked, several bulbs gone and one bedroom locked itself) but they were pretty quick to sort them all out. They only did a full housekeeping service once in the two weeks (as expected) and failed to replace the towels one day, but we just grabbed some from by the pool. On occasions we ended up driving in to other hotels either by accident or to make a U turn. In every one of them we did not get past the security, but in Floridays you could just drive in and out without a problem, which is something they may want to look at. We used the shuttle service on two occasions. Once to Disney and once to universal. The universal one was very good and went very smoothly. Straight there and straight back without a problem. The disney one was more of a trek though. The coach stopped at several hotels on the way which meant it took a long time. The return journey was even worse. Nobody seemed to know what was going on and there was not enough room so we enede up on a different hotel shuttle, which made a detour to ours. A minor issue really as it got us there and back without too much of a problem. I did miss the Disney bus service you get with the Disney hotels. The location of the hotel was good as the supermarket, other small shops and even an outlet mall were all within walking distance. We enjoyed sitting out on the balcony of an evening and watching some fantastic lightening in the distance.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGood... needs a bit of TLC ....something just seemed to be missing\u201d", "Author": "P_MOntario", "ReviewID": "UR52436969", "Content": "Stayed with my wife and three kids, ages 3-7.

Answer-Definitely Floridays Resort Review Negatives first -Staff was very polite and efficient. Although I got a bit irratated with the conceirge and the absolutely unacceptable charges for the business center. If you want to be a 4 star and attract a certain clientele, simple things such as printing a few tickets for your guest should be so challenging. -Games Room Games did not work sometimes, although front desk did replace tokens -Play room was closed for the entire 2 week stay. -Pool and hot tub was dirty most days with things floating in it, (straws, dirt, bark, etc) - no life guards,max depth is 5 ft , and the pool can get very crowded very quickly. - house cleaning , they were upfront with the level of housekeeping daily ,but probably would be wiser for them to start improving this as the quality of the rooms and furnishing is deteriorating quickly, this resort is only 3-4 year old. - Worst sales pitch from the timeshare folks we've ever heard. -no onsite restaurant full service restaurant. Although the cooks at the Palm cafe are very good, and take away meals were well done, - just missing some of the small details that make a difference. compared to other 4-5 stars. Positives -Great location to all theme parks and shopping - Great customer service at front desk, and conceirge most of the time. - simple check in and check out - Overall- floridays is trying to be great ,but needs more infrastructure (clean pools, working amenities, cleaner rooms etc).

Reception was lousy: I called them because I couldn\u2019t find the make-up mirror that is mentioned in their very own website, under furnishings. The girl from reception put me on hold several times as she was with other customers, until finally she said I had been misled and that none of their units had this mirror. They gave us a 2 bd/2bth suite at the far end of the resort. It was dark, with cheap and chipped furnishing, full of dusty and old artificial plants, uncomfortable beds, and terrible housekeeping. The only service they offered was: making the beds (terribly, by the way -see photo) and taking out the trash. We couldn't use the 6 place settings they proudly mention on their website, as they were dirty, scribbled on with a pen, and of very poor quality plastic. The water from the shower had a very strong smell of chlorine, as if we were showering with pool water. The air-conditioning was stuck, and temperature didn't go higher nor lower. There were spider webs around the bathroom and kitchen lights, and our door mat was filthy! But, wait......the worst thing of all, were the paper thin walls.

Extremely relaxing- friendly atmosphere, the resort has several six story buildings each building has a nice courtyard and the hallways are open so you can see the courtyard below. Inside the room was spacious and open, had a full kitchen dining room and living room. Master bedroom had a huge king size bed and bathroom with a juzucci tub! is idea for a family, the other two bedrooms had two beds each and televisions. The only downfall is no wifi in the room but they do provide ethernet cables so you can connect in the room. 3. Front desk staff is amazing- very accamodating anything i wanted i got ad they called to make sure i got it, they even have a bellman to help you carry your bags to the room. the best thing of it all is they remember who you are and greet you by name!

Overall it was a good experience. Here are the negatives: 1. The room had an odd smell when we got in. At first I thought it was some kind of heavy bleach in the cleaning products they used but then later realized that water does not smell great. I think it is an Orlando wide problem because I had some tap water at a restaurant in the Magic Kingdom and it was almost undrinkable. I used to live in Miami and I don't remember the water being a problem. It must be something with the south because on our way to Florida we stopped in Georgia to eat and the water also tasted like it had sulfur in it or something. 2. The suite does show some signs of wear and tear. One of the lamps had a whole in the side. But I am sure I could have called the front desk and they would have replaced it if I had really cared. 3. There is no wireless, but you can get plug in to your computer for $7 (one time fee). Positives: 1. The suite was huge. There were granite counter tops and there plenty of plates, cups, glasses and cookware. 2. If we ever needed anything the front desk took care of it immediately and then called to make sure we had gotten what we wanted. 3. The pool was nice although it was too cold to swim most of the time. There was a guy playing music on Friday night and they brought out heaters by our table which was great. 4. We took the shuttle to the Disney parks every day. We never had an issue with the shuttle. 5. We never had the cleaning people come so were never charged an extra cleaning charge. If you wanted towels or whatever they would just send them up. 6. Location - You are close to Publix, Outlet Mall and Disney. After staying in a condo I am not sure I could stay in a regular hotel room again. Each of us having our own space/tv was invaluable. Our main purpose of the trip was to go to Disney. Make sure to get a Fastpass first for Toy Story at Hollywood Studios. We assumed that Fastpasses would go first for the Rock 'n Roller Coaster but that was not the case. We ate at The Plaza Restaurant at the Magic Kingdom and had terrible service (we even got a free Fastpass from the manager because our waiter was so bad - although we were leaving the park so we had to give it away). Our meals at the San Angel Inn at Epcot and the Hollywood Brown Derby (be prepared to spend a lot even for lunch) were much better experiences.

Based on a questionnaire I got from my booking website, here are the comments I made: \"PROS: Professional staff attitude, clean surroundings, everything you'd want is on-site. Felt very well taken care of. Room very well equipped (furniture is really large and kind of take away from the otherwise spacious apartment). Awesome concierge service! CONS: In order of importance: housekeeping didn't clean toilets or floors during our 12-day stay (would have needed a run-through of the apartment at ~7 days). Also, when we left the apartment at about 1pm or later, we'd sometimes come back and housekeeping hadn't come back since in the morning (when we had the do-not-disturb-sign up) - even still, housekeeping operates until 5pm. Occasional absence of staff at the pool bar (had to call out to someone for service). Also had a baby crib and I've stayed at hotels where housekeeping makes the crib which I always appreciate (that wasn't done at Floridays, perhaps out of courtesy of us having our own linen).\" This being said, the hotel and overall experience was awesome. We've since moved to another hotel and it feels like a huge downgrade. One thing I forgot to add is that the children's pool area has no lifeguard, so you're on your own lookout all day long. Also, all that water is kind of loud, but just parking yourself on the other side of the pool you'd escape that. I'd definately recommend this hotel as one of the best I've stayed at.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay if you have a car\u201d", "Author": "retiredchemist", "ReviewID": "UR48832555", "Content": "We (3 adult men) stayed here on a golfing trip in early November of 2009.

There is a Publix supermarket and a Walgreens within a walkable distance but if you are staying in one of the back buildings it would be a hike. This is a very family friendly place very reasonably priced with the amenities you would need (especially low priced for Florida residents). The unit was clean and is no-smoking. Towels are changed daily and the bed is remade (using the same sheets). The only downside is that they charge a large fee for internet access ($0.20/minute) and printing ($0.75/page) if you don't have your own computer.

My friends and I have been looking forward to this trip for some time now.

The hotel is centrally located, well priced for the accomadations,very clean, the staff was excellent, it also has several ammenities.. like pools, coffee shop, market place, game room, gym, spa, and a restaurant (sad to say, I ddin't get to enjoy all of these). Minutes after checking into our 3 bedroom suite w/ fully equipped kitchen, living room, large bathrooms, jacuzzi, large balcony area, plasma tv's and good smelling toiletries, we received a \"welcome call\" from the front desk making sure everything was OK. Well needless to say, we had encountered our first \"problem\" prior to the call. The overhead kitchen lights were not turning on. We tried all the knobs we could find, turn them every which way we could but to no avail. The front desk advised us they will be sending someone over to fix the \"problem\". Minutes later (literally) a maintenance personnel showed up (boy were we impressed with the prompt service). Well turns out there was no problem at all.. we had to be TAUGHT how to use the lights. Instead of twisting and turning, we had to push and turn the knob in order to turn them on. LOL! The hotel has a \"Tommy Bahama\" home feel to it w/ it's beautfiul Caribbean decor. It felt like we were in Key West instead of Orlando. The following are the only problems we encountered: 1. Hot water ran out quickly. After 2 people finished taking their hot showers, the rest of us suffered w/ a cold one brrrrrr!! 2. With the beautiful decor, it's a shame they put the electrical panel box right smack in the living room area. You'd think they would opt to put it in the empty closet located between the kitchen and living room. 3. Need to invest in better shower heads! Felt like these were installed as an afterthought.

We stayed in a 3 bedroom suite (1300 sq ft) and found that it met all of our needs. It's extremely helpful having a full kitchen (including utensils) when you're traveling with young children, as we were able to make breakfast each morning before heading out to the theme parks (Publix supermarket and Walgreens is within walking distance). Upon our return each evening, the kids played in the pool (although be warned, it wasn't heated during the last week of October and the kids complained that it was a little cold). The bar is outdoors next to the pool, and the there is live entertainment on Friday and Saturday evening (although it finished around 8pm). The hotel is within 15 minutes of the Disney parks and 5 minutes of Sea World. Despite some other reviewer's suggestions, I would definitely recommend renting a car. The only restaurant within walking distance is Benihana's (which was excellent!), and perhaps Outback Steakhouse (also very good). If you have a car and looking for dining options, try driving north on International Drive for 10-15 minutes and you'll run into dozens of family restaurants within 1 or 2 blocks of each other (Bahama Breeze, BB King's Blues Club, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, TGIF, etc.). The resort is large and currently has 5 or 6 buildings, and if you get chance, ask for Building A or B, as the lobby, concierge, pool, bar, store are located in Bldg A. Some of the other buildings are a LONG walk. We were in Bldg E and belive me, when it's 92 degrees and 70% humidity, you's rather not walk 10 minutes there and 10 minutes back just to grab a morning coffee.

The pool was large with plenty of loungers and clean towels. The pool cafe was adequate. The grounds are lush and well kept. The staff are pleasant and helpful. Tha apartment overall was great, clean and well equipped. There were only 2 things that I wasn't happy with - We had asked for a pool view if possible and we were given a 2nd floor room overlooking a parking lot. All 2nd floor balconies are about 4 feet tall and made of solid concrete as opposed to higher ones that you can see through and are pleasant to sit out on. This really disappointed me and as a result we didn't use it at all. It also made the apartment feel dark. We arrived at night and didn't realise what a crappy view we had until the following morning when we had unpacked or I would have asked to change. The complex was no more than a third full ( Orlando in general v. quiet in Sept) so I was bugged that they couldn't have given us a room with a better view. The other thing was the shuttle to Disney. We decided to go to Typhoon Lagoon and use the shuttle. The concierge didn't tell us it would take 3 buses and over an hour using the shuttle and Disney buses! Don't do it! Take a cab, it will be about $18. The other Disney parks are easier to get to I believe and also the Seaworld/Aquatica/Universal buses are great and take you straight there. We didn't hire a car this time and we managed ok although we were only there for 6 nights and visited just 2 parks. The supermarket is a 10 minute walk round the corner but there aren't many restaurants in walking distance. We used the I ride bus to get up and down International drive. A car would have been more convenient but for the cost of the carhire it wasn't worth it.

We had a 3BR/2bath corner unit exchanged with II (timeshare) We requested a higher floor w/pool or lake view but were advised that due to exchange being from owner; they were unable to accomadate our request. The unit was very spacious. Very clean. Only set back was the balcony. It looked out to a \"dirt road\" and many trees \"hovering\" by the balcony bannister. The beds/pillows were very comfortable. Pots/Pans available. Had to \"fix\" a pan's handle which was unscrewed. Dryer full of lint; small things but items which should have been taken care of by housekeeping. Also, though I have not contacted the resort on this yet (I got a terrible infection which I ended up in Med-Center two nites in a row - not resort related though) thus the reason I haven't made contact. However, very important to mention. The bedsheets had blood stains which looked like someone cut their finger or hand and dripped blood on the sheets. These sheets were the same ones all week! Very depressing. Feel they should have been bleached or thrown out. Will contact Resort and advise. Otherwise, no complaints on the room and supplies EXCEPT that we were given one tiny box of tide and when I called the front desk requesting another box (this is the only extra supply we asked for) the person at the front desk kind of \"chastised\" me for asking for another box. Went on a long \"sermon\" that it is the norm to only give one box, etc. etc. but would make an exception and send one up, however, he continued to remind me (though we were checking out the next day) that this was the last one he would send up. ??? Anyhow, this was the only staff member that seemed to be \"unfriendly\" Upon check out we were treated great; boarding passes were printed out; etc. WARNING: You will be advised upon CHECK-IN that your card will be \"charged\" a \"pending\" $350.00 fee which will be reimbursed at check-out minus any charges you incur. So make sure you have the funds as \"surplus\" on your card. POOL: Small, they make it sound like there is a BIG pool and a SMALLER one - in reality there is a small pool and smaller pool near building C. This is where we were located. NOISE: Almost non-existent! :) Ground staff / housekeeping were very kind; helpful; and friendly. Only thing was that though we were close to Internation Drive - having been in Disney area numerous times; I missed US192 easy access to just about everything.

All the walls had massive scrapes and marks on them, (I don't know how someone could manage to scrape up an entire wall in one of the bedrooms). I immediately called the front desk to explain how dirty the room was, looked like it hadn't been vaccummed in months and they sent house keeping to the room right away. I showed them the dirt on the floor, the crumbs and other debris on the couch, and the sticky kitchen counter. They began to clean things up. But the spider webs on the lamps and lighting stayed along with the dust on the shades and around the windows. The balcony had to be the worst I've seen with hair and other debris I can't even imagine what it was, but I decided not to use the balcony after I saw it. The kitchen is very dark and it made for cooking kind of depressing. The condo itself is not very spacious the bedrooms are average size and the living/dining/kitchen are like one fat hallway. We ran out of toilet paper and soap in the first few days and they do not replenish these items automatically. So I ended up buying it at the local grocery store.

The front desk staff was extremely friendly (especially Brittany - she always had a smile and ready to answer any questions). The only issue ( minor) was that our confirmation documents (we did an exchange thru Interval) indicated a check-in time of 3 p.m., but we were told when we got there that check-in was actually 4 p.m. Not really a major bump to us - we just strolled to their cafe and had a late lunch poolside. Brittany brought our unit keys to us and we were good to go! The 2 BR unit that we stayed in was very clean, well decorated and laid out. We didn't feel cramped at all. The boys tried to claim our jacuzzi tub, but to no avail! The kitchen was well equipped for the week and although the Publix supermarket is literally just around the corner, we opted for Wal-mart which is only about a 10 minute drive. We were in Building B on the second floor - great for a short walk to the pool. Soundproofing was pretty good - didn't really notice any noise from the neighbors. The location of Floridays is a definite plus! It's at the opposite end of Intl Drive from all of the \"tourist\" things so we didn't encounter a lot of traffic. We did the Universal Studios/Island of Adventure thing during the week with a day at SeaWorld mixed in. SeaWorld is literally just down Intl Drive (5 minutes) and Universal was only about 10 minutes away. The biggest asset that Floridays can boast about is their guest services. As I said before, the front desk staff were outstanding and Dominic, the front desk manager was outstanding! The day before we were to leave, we tried to use the business center to print our airline boarding passes. You have to use a cash value card to use the computers, printers, etc. We couldn't get the value card machine to work but that turned out to not be a problem. Dominic called the company(a 3rd party vendor)to place a service call, then escorted my husband and I to the administrative office where we could use the office computer to complete our online check-in and print the boarding passes!

Went to the Magic kingdom and had to drive 2 cars to go there ---------- I had been really counting on taking the hotel shuttle to get to the park and one of the reasons I picked this resort was that it said it had shuttles to all the parks.. Shuttle did not have very convenient times and they said they dropped you off at Epcot (to get to Disney). The return shuttle at night for disney left from Epcot before the disney park had closed ----------we would have missed the parade and fireworks. So that was the only disappointment.

We were a little apprehensive about staying near/on International Drive but the location of this resort was perfect as it's on International Drive South (the quiet part!). All the parks, restaurants, bars and shopping malls were within a short distance if you wanted to drive but the hotel also had a good (free) shuttle service and there's a bus stop outside the hotel which was very cheap ($1.25 one way to the busier part of International Drive). The accommodation was first class and had everything you could ever need. The whirlpool bath was a nice 'touch' (and perfect to unwind in at the end of a busy day!), fresh towels were provided daily, all the garden areas were well maintained and everywhere was spotless. The staff were always helpful and friendly and were able to answer any queries we had. The only complaint we had, and we realise this is a bit of a strange one .... the frogs on the lake outside our room made the loudest noises we've ever heard & some nights it was difficult to get to sleep but to be honest we were so tired out each night that it wasn't too much of a problem (just sounded really odd!!). The weather was a bit of pain as it rained most days (only for an hour or so) but it was still really hot. It's worth keeping a check on the forecast and work your park visits around the weather - coz when it rains it absolutely pours!

As before the hotel complex and everything about it was excellent. I dont need to go into detail. Enough people on here tell you what Floridays is like. What they dont tell you though is how the Orlando area has really changed over the last few years. The main International drive area is like a ghost town, the shops are dead. People no longer go there due to the threat of Crime. If you are travelling with kids but like to go out late,forget Orlando completely. After 10 - 11 pm its not safe anywhere. Disney have closed Pleasure Island due to the trouble and nobody goes out around International Drive area after dark. We were told the only place to go out late was Universal studios City Walk. This is a fantastic area . The whole of Universal is fantastic , they have grown over the years and the parks and City walk now genuinely rival Disney theme parks. Problem is City walk although open until the early hours is no place for families aftter 10pm. We went there late one Eve and went inmto Bubba Gumps for dinner about 9pm. Bubbas was great, well worth a visit. By the time we cam out and started to walk round the security staff were very active with trouble making youths and we could not see any children left in the whole of city Walk. All the families flee around 10pm. By 11pm all families are safely tucked up in thier hotels Anywhere you stop after 10pm you will feel unsafe, Petrol stations, supermarkets, restaraunt car parks , its not safe.........just watch the local news while you are there, every day there are shootings, stabbings, robberies and murders. Orlando is quite large but not exactly a major city , violent crime however is probably 10 times what you would hear about in London. Obviously this is why the tourist areas are like a ghost town after 10 pm. International Drive is pretty deserted all day, the shops must really be struggling , they are always empty. If you are a family Orlando is a great place if you just want the Theme parks in the day , just keep your car doors locked when driving, if visiting a Restaraunt or shop in the evening, make sure you park in a well lit part of the car park . The car parks are very large and many areas badly lighted behind the restaraunts. My honest advice would be stick with Disney , all Disney areas are well lit, have great security and are far enough away from the main residential areas to prevent becoming hang out places for low lifes. While anywhere run by Disney , you feel entirely safe. If Florida is to remain the no1 holiday destination in the world, Orlando government must address the issue of crime. . One interesting fact to support my concerns is , on the local news while there I watched an article that claimed applications to carry a concealed weapon was at 160,000 for the area. A record high. Unlike the UK , Americans can carry concealed guns in public places . There are a lot of guns out there.

However, I just got Tripadvisor to delete my 2007 review so I could update it having stayed in Floridays for the third year in a row. Location Someone said they couldn't find their way home from Disney. I'll give you directions to Disney here; Turn right out of the hotel, turn right at the end of the road. Disney is straight ahead. For that matter, turn left out of hotel, turn right just before the convention center (down the 528 toll highway, $2.75), Cocoa beach is (55mi) straight ahead. Seaworld, Turn left out of hotel, Seaworld is straight ahead. It's location couldn't get any better. Even to the extent of the supermarket (Publix, think Sainsburys quality if you're British), and Walgreens (quite like Boots) within walking distance (5-10 mins) and much more. This really is the perfect Orlando location with or without a car. You're close enough to Disney that a taxi is a possible way of getting there and the hotel runs shuttles. It's also directly on stops for the iRide trolley which will bring you to Seaworld/Universal and the delight that is I-Drive. Rooms I don't think anyone disagrees - you'll NEVER be able to go back to a hotel room once you've stayed in one of these. Our family of four (two young kids) loved everything about it. Fully set up to do any cooking you want, we've come home with everything laundered, I thought the fixtures and fittings were of good quality, granite worktops for instance. Grounds and Pool The pool is great for younger kids as it's got a zero entry and loads of play-fountains. Around it is well stocked with both sunbeds and towels. Even at full occupancy we had no problem getting a place to sunbathe at any time of the day. The second pool is also a great place to go for a quieter sunbathing experience but having two kids I only went over to have a look at it. Cleaning and other. So long as you're not expecting your room to be deep cleaned every day (like a regular hotel room is), you'll be happy with this. You get free Internet in the room (wired), and free Internet in other locations around the site (wireless). Techie grudge though - I couldn't make a MS-VPN connection due to firewall restrictions, Cisco and Nortel connections were fine though. Staff One of the things that Floridays are doing really well with is the staff. In previous years they were OK to good but now they're of 'Disney' standard. Happy, helpful staff that go out of their way to make sure that everything is perfect. This year I seemed to see Tom at reception a lot and TJ and Shanon at the bar so special mention goes to them, but everyone really was great. Conclusions Not many hints and tips as it's all been said. Best blocks are A, B and C. Blocks D and E are fine, but mean a walk across the carpark to the main pool/bar area, but no big deal. Avoid the second floor if you can as the balcony isn't as good. Couldn't ask for more. Never mind 5* hotels with posh reception areas and doormen, bellhops and 50 other staff all wanting tips for meaningless tasks. This condo/hotel idea is FAR better.

We basically had the hotel pools to ourselves when we stayed at the hotel during the day and as we went after the school holidays had ended there weren't many children around- so very peaceful and relaxing. The hotel provide towels and there are plenty of sunbeds. There was a bus that took you up and down international drive for just a dollar- fantastic- everyone was so friendly! If you can afford it you should go to Discovery Cove- what a fantastic experience- you also get passes to SeaWorld/Busch Gardens and Wet and Wild for the rest of your holiday. Don't buy from the booths in Orlando as these are discounted as they take you for a morning trying to sell timeshares (unless you don't mind of course). We didn't do Disney as we wouldn't have had time in our 2 week to cover Discovery Cover/Busch Gardens/Seaworld/ Wet and Wild and Disney- we certainly didn't regret our choice- absolutely amazing- particularly going to see Shamu- we didn't think we would be bothered by this and just went as we were there- but it was such a wonderful experience- I would most definitely recommend it to anyone! We also went to Cocoa Beach and if you are thinking of going here stick around the pier as the facilities are better- we went too far down and it wasn't as 'pretty' We also went to Texas De Brazil (sorry about the spelling) as we had heard really good things about it- it was all you can eat but cost about $150 for 2 so was great for a special evening but there were plenty of more reasonable alternatives just as good in our view. The best place we ate was fudruckers- for less than $20 you could get a burger each (cooked to order in front of you) with all the salad and pop you can stomach- it had a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere- we both thought the staff were fantastic here. Anyway back to the hotel- you will not be disappointed- the hotel is really the most important thing for me in terms of my holiday experience and this was most definitely the best one- staff were great- so thanks for a wonderful holiday!!", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, spacious rooms.\u201d", "Author": "RachelManchester_UK", "ReviewID": "UR37697811", "Content": "We did lots of research, and had previously stayed in Orlando, before booking Floridays.

We decided to arrive in Orlando a few days prior to the reunion to take in some of the parks, shows, and relaxation. I booked a room at Floridays Resort for four nights, months before the trip. Keeping track of the rates, I managed to get a rate of $118/night, under the AARP rate, for a 2-bdrm suite. I've read many of the reviews prior to visiting Floridays and I must concur with the majority of them. Here's my take: Location - the resort is practically centrally located on International Dr. between Universal, Seaworld and Disneyworld. Quick access to all the parks. Universal was farthest, but still within 10 minutes drive. A Publix grocery is right around the corner along with several restaurants. More eateries are across the freeway. The Orlando Premium Outlet mall is also right around the corner for convenient shopping excursions. Price - the rate I got probably was one of the best you can get for a 2-bdrm condominium-style room. They didn't even ask for our AARP card as proof. Grounds - they are well-landscaped and designed. There are two lakes sprinkled among the buildings. The main pool area is very large and nice with both a shallow side and water play area for children. There is a separate pool area near the rear of the complex for those who reside there. We were in Building F (way in the back), but the walk to the main pool was not arduous at all. Even when the main pool area seemed crowded, there was plenty of room for everyone. The entranceways to the rooms (exterior entrances) seemed a bit weathered in our building and could use some overall cleaning. Rooms - spacious with all the amenities you'd need for a family of 4 or more. Ours was very clean. Lots of elbow room to stretch your arms and not bump into anything. The kids enjoyed their own separate bedroom with the two beds, bathroom and TV. The master bedroom was spacious enough. The bathroom with a jacuzzi tub (which we didn't use, but was nice) was also spacious, with a separate shower. We cooked our own breakfast every morning to save money on going out to eat. The kitchen had everything we needed (even an electric beater for eggs or pancake batter). It was no problem putting the dirty dishes in the dishwasher to be cleaned by the next morning. The washer/dryer combo came in very handy, as we were able to wash clothes prior to checking into the reunion hotel (Residence Inn Orlando Airport - see my review there too). Nice balcony, though they could also use a quick washdown. The thermostats can be very tricky to operate, but a quick call and the maintenance man was eager to offer assistance on how to operate it. Housekeeping - only basic housekeeping is provided; towels, linen changes, supplies, spot cleaning, etc. You are charged for any additional services (vacuuming, full bathroom/kitchen cleaning etc.) We had no problems with the basic service. When we returned from a day of sightseeing, our room looked as clean as the day we checked-in. They even provide a vacuum in the second bedroom closet (just in case you wish to do it yourself). The rooms also come with free \"wired\" high-speed internet, so you need a network cable. I didn't request one since we had our own, but I\"m sure they supply them from the front office. I particularly liked the ease of use; there was no \"hotel gateway\" access to bother with, just plug it in and your on your way. Overall - I would definitely recommend Floridays to family, friends and others. We spent one day just doing nothing, and it was nice to do it in a clean, comfortable and spacious room. We plan to return to Orlando again soon, and the Floridays will be on the top of our list of hotel choices.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort - very reasonably priced for level of quality/service!\u201d", "Author": "CDP27", "ReviewID": "UR36024249", "Content": "As always, we did our research on tripadvisor before booking this hotel.

They give you 1each of laundry detergent, dishwashing liquid & soap for the dishwasher...after you use that you have to buy your own..they didn't tell us that at check in. Other than the cleaning it was a great hotel. I was traveling with my two 17 year old boys and they loved it. It would have been nice if the pool stayed open later than 11. I recommend getting the I-Ride bus passes for the length of your stay. The bus stop is right there (stop 39) so all you have to do is hop on and let them do all the driving. It's a short walk from the hotel to shopping but there are no sidewalks...the I-Ride will also take you there...no walking involved :) The resort fee is a killer and the cleaning ppl need to be replaced but the front desk, Ray and the other staff were all wonderful. If booking this hotel check the hotel website first..you may get it cheaper. I went through Expedia and found out I could have got it cheaper if I went through Floridays website (but they might have had a sale going on).", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, MD", "Title": "\u201cFloridays Orlando Resort\u201d", "Author": "Fungaw55", "ReviewID": "UR34541353", "Content": "Two families shared a three bedroom condo for seven days.

Overall, we enjoyed the facilities very much. The staff members were wonderful---very eager to help and correct any minor problems we encountered. The positives: 1. A three bedroom suite for $179 per night. The accommodations were fabulous for this relatively low price! 2. The bell porters were so friendly and came to pick us up (buidling F...more about that later) in a super-size golf cart at our beck and call. We tried to tip Jeremy on the first day, but he politely refused the tip...\"No worries!\" 3. We encountered a few very small problems, and they were corrected almost immediately (missing a frying pan...room not made up one day...a missing reflecting bowl on the stove which made the largest burner unusable). 4. Very close to SeaWorld and Aquatica...easy to get there via trolley car. The Negatives: 1. Building F is FAR from the hub of the hotel (pool/main office/convenience store, etc.) Whoever designed the configuration of the buildings made a serious flaw in not providing a direct walkway....one has to walk around all of the other buildings and through the parking lots to get anywhere. However, as I mentioned before...the bellhops were happy to come and get us (but on occasion they were busy with other guests). 2. Do NOT come expecting to be able to get around efficiently without a rental car. We relied on the trolley, cabs (which we had not budgeted for, but used on several occasions) and shuttle buses which did create additional stress. Also, our walk from Building F to the trolley was about a mile (which is hard in the hot sun or after a long day at the parks). Getting groceries from the nearby Publix grocery store sounded easy...but was a workout in itself due to the long walk with bags of groceries! 3. Floridays is at the far south end of International Drive...takes a long time on the trolley to get to the north end (where more action is). 4. Housekeeping services were haphazard. Some days our beds were made and towels were prettily replaced in the bathrooms, but on others, only our trash was emptied and clean towels were left on the kitchen bar stools (beds left unmade). We called on Thursday to request that our room be made up, and housekeeping was on it immediately. 5. Resort fee of $11.50 per day---Yes, I knew about it in advance, but why?

The maids where in everyday with fresh towels, beds made and a general tidy and clean without fail. I would recommend hiring a car - don't be scared!!

Floridays is handy for all attractions esoecially Seaworld, Aquatica and Universal Studios. Disney is very easily found too.The kids enjoyed the pool and the little cafe had lovely food which we often ordered and brought up to our room after the the lids had enjoyed a jacuzzi bath.

I have been to Orlando 6 times over my lifetime and this hotel was the best yet. It exceeded all of my expectations. I will be honest and give pros and cons for this hotel: The Pros: The hotel staff was the friendliest and welcoming group of employees I have come across. From the moment we walked into the lobby, they assisted us with every need, and always with a smile, a very accommodating team. We stayed in a 2 bed room suite which for the price, was a steal. The room was spotless, furnished beautifully, and within easy walking distance from the pool, lobby, and weight room. My favorite part of the suite was the master bed room/master bath. It was huge! The bath tub can fit 2-3 and the shower 2 people comfortably. Every room was spacious. All of the appliances were in great working condition. The suites come equipped with a balcony that can be used as an eating area that over looks several areas of orlando, if not the pool/lobby. The pool area is amazing with great sunlight, palm trees, and plenty of seating. The price for 7 nights here was also unbeatable for what you get. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking to save money, have a great time with family/friends, and enjoy a home-like environment. The Cons: I am pleased to say that there was hardly anything that I didn't like at this hotel. However, if I did have to name a few things that could use improvement, I would say this. The stove top had burners that were tilted and made cooking on the stove a bit awkward. The heating/air conditioning in the rooms is preset and can only be changed for a given amount of time, but needless to say, the temperature in the rooms was always kept comfortable. I would have liked our trash to be changed daily but that was not the case, many times we had to take it out ourselves (not really a bad thing). I would have liked the shuttle service to be available all day instead of a set time each morning and night. Other than these minor details, it was a great hotel.

The room was huge, 3bed room 2 bath which is the main reason we keep going back. Great with 2 kids. The pool is also excellent and another reason we kept going back. I have 2 complaints that kept it from the excellent rating. First, you get whatever room they give you. We got a lovely room overlooking the power lines and what looked to be a swamp. Not a huge deal, but we told them we were there 8 months ago and could we have a little better room closer to the pool since we have young children this time. No deal.

However, I over looked it , because I thought the price was a little too much. But after calling several other hotels the pricre wasn't really any different. Considering Floridays was a complete luxury condo. With the other hoels it was just a small room, or a mini suite. I took a chance and booked Floridays Resort @$105.99 the first night and $118.99 the other 2 nights. It was worht it. If you rely on ALL the reviews for hotels you will NEVER travel anywhere. When we entered the lobby it was beautiful, it looked like something you would see on tv, one of those luxury getaways. Check -in was very friendly,courtsey, and informative. We stayed in buliding E on the 6th floor. Upon entering out suite, we couldn't believe it. It was everything away from home. Wash/dryer, dishwasher, stove & oven, an island in the kitchen. The kids had there own room and bathroom, the master room was very nice, a hot tub, stand in shower, a lot of counter space. Living room area very spacious, Overall it was PERFECT.

Because they didn't have anymore umbrellas on hand, he bought my entire family lunch at the Palms Cafe.

We were there for 8 days and we could not speak highly enough about it. The accommodation was very spacious and with two teenagers 14 and 16 and both over 6 ft we were indeed grateful for the space. We stayed in block C which was just around the corner from the pool and reception. We had a two bed roomed apt with both rooms en-suite. Master had a Jacuzzi bath and very spacious shower and vanity facilities. The accommodation also had its very own washer and dryer which proved invaluable after a day in the water parks. Cooking facilities had everything you could possibly need even though we only used them once during our stay. The bar down stairs although small had everything you could need and didn\u2019t close until about 11 pm. Being from Ireland my husband was delighted they had an excellent pint of smithwicks after a long day running around after two teenagers in the parks. We didn\u2019t get to use the pool but it looked clean and well serviced and didn\u2019t close until 11 pm also. There was music there each evening from about 5 to 7 which was very pleasant to get you in the holiday mood. Reception staff was most helpful and it was also possible to buy your park tickets at the counter. They offered a bellboy trolley service which was cool to take you from reception to accommodation if you didn\u2019t have a car. We didn\u2019t bother with a car as the iride was just outside the resort and took you all along international drive and to the parks in Seaworld, Discovery Cove, Wet n\u2019 Wild and more. It also took you between all the outlets in Premium (right beside the resort and in my opinion the best one) right down to Prime at the other end of International drive. The resort offer free complementary bus services at scheduled times to Universal and Island of Adventure during the day and City Walk at night. There is a taxi service from the hotel which is expensive but convenient when going out for dinner and you don\u2019t wish to drive. The bus to Busch Gardens leaves from the back of Premium Outlets (walking distance from the Floridays) or take a short iRide so it\u2019s easy if you are heading out there. Down side and believe me they were few \u2013 internet is available but at a premium, way too expensive in my opinion. Staff recommend the usual restaurants like Charley\u2019s Steak House, Johnny\u2019s Hide Away & red lobster, but they are over priced especially Charley\u2019s and the quality is crap if you are used of Irish beef, Portion size is huge but its not possible to eat it all and my steak was tough. As it was our wedding anniversary we ordered the best cuts together with lobster tails which was also tough and the bill came to \u20ac235 for two people, yes EURO. This included bottle of wine and 3 beers. Ya bloody expensive! Johnny\u2019s is better quality in my opinion and the prices are better too \u20ac245 for the 4 of us and our teenagers eat more than we do! The bill included desserts unlike Charley\u2019s. Nothing to do with the hotel though their food was cheap and satisfying. Taxis could be temperamental, twice they arrived 1 hour late and that was after reception staff remained them several time. There is a service charge for the facilities and it\u2019s about $14 a day, for this they take out rubbish and make the beds. A full room clean is about $20. Remember the place is really clean and someone\u2019s got to pay for it! We complained when we were leaving about the Taxi service and the hotel wavered the service charge entirely \u2013 couldn\u2019t believe it. They know their customer satisfaction! For those unsure I would GO FOR IT you will be happy you did. Do check with American Holidays if you are travelling from UK and Ireland, we got a cheaper rate from them than booking directly with the Florida\u2019s.

We had an excellent stay at the Floridays and would happily go back even with children. The only disgruntlement I had was that the housekeeping was very inconsistent; such as one day we had beds made, bins emptied, towels replaced (as agreed by the Hotel Beds agreement given to us by reception when we enquired how housekeeping works - apparently you get a different service to other people depending on who you book with), on other days we just had the kitchen bin emptied, a couple of days we had products etc replenished, one day we had no service and then the rest varied from some bins being emptied and bed made but no towels changed etc. I felt that the resort fee + tax (which initially I was informed was $5 a day when I asked in Dec, is now $10 a day) was a little steep considering the only thing we 'used' from it was the ability to park there and to use the pool. We never used the in-room internet facility, weren't entitled to replenishment of products etc based on who we'd booked through, didn't get a consistent housekeeping service etc however, the rest of the stay was enjoyable enough that I would give it a second chance. We couldn't complain considering the price we paid through Travel Repobulic was under half of what you would have to pay if you booked direct. Definitely give it a go though as we think it was worth it, especially room 603 which had a perfect view of Epcot and the fireworks every night. Infact building D was ideal. It overlooked the scrubland waiting on Phase 2 construction so was very very quiet, a minute from the small pool to the right and a 2 minute walk to the main pool to the left. This was an ideal location for Disney and the other parks, it was easily a 5-10 mins drive straight (literally) to Disney and 10mins drive straight up the I4 East to Universal, it couldn't have been better location wise. As the previous posters have mentioned Publix is next door as is the Premium Outlets, McDonalds, Outback Steakhouse and other food outlets in the Premium Outlets that serve decent takeaway. I would quite happily return and hope that our housekeeping service wasn't the norm.

The in-room washer and dryer was a great plus and, in hindsight, we could have packed just half the total clothes in total and still have been in great shape (while lugging lighter/fewer bags). Our approach was to hit the grocery store early for staples (milk, cereal, coffee & filters, bottled water, snacks, etc.) to stock up the kitchen. There is a Publix less than a mile south of the hotel so this was easy to knock out, even while relying on the trolley for transportation. I recommend packing some laundry detergent and dryer sheets or plan to pick some up at the grocery as well.

The \"condo\" was very roomy, and was nicely furnished and had full appliances. Great patio (ours screened on first floor) to enjoy the morning and evenings. The staff was very friendly, and helpful in directions to area attractions. The location was prime, with a 5 minute drive to SeaWorld, and 15 minutes to Universal. There are also grocery stores and an outlet mall within a minute's drive. The resort overall is very nice, but it has a few problems. (1) There is no dining. At a resort of this caliber, I would have thought there would be some type of dining facility. The Floridays does offer a small menu at the bar or in the small cafe. Anyway, be sure to use the condo's full kitchen to cook your own meals if able, as a meal for four will cost you $50-$60 dining out. (2) The pool area fills up quickly and becomes crowded. There are two pools at the Floridays. One large pool with bar at the main buliding, and one quite small pool at the rear of the complex. The small pool is not heated, not regularly cleaned, and does not have a bar. If you need refreshments or a snack you have to either walk back to your room, or walk up to the main pool/bar area. Not a horribly long walk, but it is inconvenient. Also the main pool area becomes very crowded by mid-morning. With the amount of rooms the Floridays has, their pool area should be larger, or they should have multiple large pool areas to accommodate the amount of guests(actually a second complex w/pool is being constructed). (3) Limited room service.There is no actual cleaning service at the Floridays. Guests are expected to clean and pick up their suites themselves. Cleaning staff will come to your room and make the beds (not change sheets), bring fresh towels and take out the trash. With this in mind, make sure you are aware that the mess you make is the mess you clean up. Overall this is a fantastic place to stay. I wouldn't come here if you plan to stay your whole trip in the resort, but if your days are spent at area attractions then this place is good to come home to. P.S.

As has been stated many times over in these reviews, the rooms are large and having the kitchen and other amenities is a great money saver. After shopping at the local Publix on our check-in day, we ate breakfasts in the room, made lunches to bring to the parks, and ate half our dinners in the room. We did laundry half way through our stay which kept our packing light. The staff was always very friendly and helpful. I had a number of encounters with them and they were always very professional dealing with the situation. Some examples: - Had requested a crib and high chair as part of my reservation, and called 3 weeks in advance to make sure it was in their records. Was promised it would be in our room. Upon check-in to room, they were missing. I called the front desk; they apologized and someone was at our door within 10 minutes with them. - The jacuzzi tub jets would not turn on. They sent a service man within minutes to the room and he fixed the problem which was a tripped circuit breaker - The A/C would not run when we checked in and we couldn't figure out the thermostat. A service guy came again wtihin minutes to get the thermostat running for us and show us how to use it. - After a couple days we realized the A/C was stuck on 71 degrees and our adjustments of the temp weren't taking affect. Again an engineer was sent and he had to reprogram the thermostat from scratch. After this it worked correctly - There was some kind of gross spill/mess from a hotel guest in one of the elevators that I encountered. I called the front desk and they apologized and had it cleaned within minutes. - I was having trouble using the wireless network in the lobby and 2 front-desk workers went out of their way to watch what I was doing to connect and point out what I was doing wrong With all of these encounters service was professional and courteous. Here's a summary of the pros/cons based on our experience: PROS: - Convenient location to parks (no need to interstate / toll-road drive to get there) - Supermarket and pharmacy around the corner - Close to outlet shopping, although we did not check them out - Dining nearby - Kitchen, full fridge, 2 bathrooms in unit, dish washer, washer/dryer -- lots of space - Family pool with graded kiddie area was perfect place to introduce our 10 month old to pools / water play - good staff / service - towels replaced daily and beds made daily, trash taken out daily CONS - Massive furniture (especially dining room table and chairs) and fake plants make navigating room very tight, especially once you have your bags/stuff everywhere - Maid service doesn't clean anything; although we knew this going into it - Parking lot long and slow to drive through, especially for us who were in the farthest building from the resort entrance - Parking lots dangerous to drive in due to drivers that do not obey the multitude of stop signs. I came very close on two occasions to getting in an accident with cars that were driving fast and shortcutting the lot and blew through stop signs. - There were no luggage stands in the room to put your suitcases on. You typically see these in hotel rooms. Kind of annoying to work out of suitcases that were on the floor since the bedrooms are already tight and don't have much floor space. - Lighting in the kitchen area was dark, especially over the sink and countertops. - Master bath is much bigger than it needs to be, with a lot of wasted space. I'd rather not have the jacuzzi tub and have more space in the bedroom. One last thing, our Garmin GPS unit which I bought in early 2008 did not have Floridays Resort Drive in its maps. This put me in a jam when leaving the airport in my rental car and I had no working address to punch in and I hadn't printed off directions in advance. Fortunately because I knew it was near Sea World on International Drive I eventually found it among the dozens of resort/hotel properties in the area. Try the address in your GPS before you leave and if it doesn't work, use 12540 International Drive instead to get you to the resort entrance.

The good: Lots of space, laundry in suite, two bathrooms, full kitchen. (We got a grocery delivery from gardengrocer.com and it was waiting for us in our suite--highly recommended and much, much less expensive than the little market/cafe on site, even including the modest delivery charge.) The not-so-good: Incredibly poor insulation that allowed us to hear EVERYTHING that happened in the parking lot and on balconies of surrounding buildings, all night. Every conversation (loud or not), every car horn locking beep, every door shutting. We don't have ultra-sensitive ears and live in a city, so we aren't strangers to noise, but this was intolerable. After three nights of being awakened repeatedly every night, my husband and I moved from the master bedroom to a small interior bedroom that was somewhat quieter. The times we called security they responded promptly, but as soon as they drove away in their little golf cart, the patio partiers were back at it and we were still awake. Maid service was ... interesting. They devoted themselves to folding towels into exotic shapes, but didn't clean sinks, glass dining room tabletop, or floors, or vacuum the carpet. But they did come every day, unlike some reviews I've seen. Overall, unless you are bringing a large family and most of them have hearing impairments, I would definitely look elsewhere.

The free shuttle has major short-comings. The biggest being that there is only 1 bus regardless of the number of passengers...you may have to stand. We went at a relatively quiet time of the year and had to stand on two legs in 6 days. The bus to Universal was significantly less crowded, newer and cleaner. The thing that really ticked me off about the shuttle was the fact that I inquired about it before booking and it was implied that it was on-demand, NOT. There is a per-day resort fee which I knew about before booking so I did not have a problem with that. The on-site cafe is small and limited but does provide the basics. It is expensive and the value is not great. We had no problem with the maid service in our unit. We were short some kitchen inventory items and they brought them up to us within an hour. Without them, we would have been unable to cook dinner. We had full control of our thermostat and the temperature setting in our unit. The internet connection (wired but they will provide a cord) was slow one night but that could have been due to the number of concurrent users. We arrived at 10:30AM and received an early check-in and got the 11:15 shuttle to Epocot. We were also granted a late check-out at 1:00PM to accommodate our 3:30 fight.

We had a *fantastic* time and our stay at the Floridays resort was a big part of that. The pool was fantastic. The kids had a wonderful time playing in this very family friendly and well designed pool. The kids could play and the adults could lounge around and enjoy watching them play. Very nice and highly recommended. The condos - we stayed in a three bedroom condo - were very nice. Well laid out and very comfortable. Again, the kids had a place to go to bed and rest and the adults had a living area to relax in and enjoy. WAY better than being crammed into a couple of adjoining hotel rooms without question! By the way, for the parents our there - our condo had a washer and dryer so I only had to pack clothes for three days instead of a whole week and I came home with suitcases full of clean laundry. It was wonderful!! The staff were very friendly and helpful - until we checked out. The guy at the front desk was less than genial once he realized we had already checked out and were just there to pick up our luggage. One pinhead should not ruin it for everyone though and I would give the hotel an A for staff and service. It was very enjoyable. I have just two small grips - so small that I didn't bother with them, but others may find it a problem. 1.) The housekeeping is ala carte - so be aware of that. There are no published fees that I could find anywhere. We just put the Do Not Disturb sign on our door and cleaned up after ourselves and 2.) the shuttle service that this hotel uses left early from one of their scheduled stops one evening leaving us scrambling. The next night, the shuttle did not show up at SeaWorld, leaving us to rely on a cab to get us back to the resort. This should not reflect badly on the hotel itself, but it is something to be aware of - especially if you have small children in your party.

Even though prices seem to have shot up this year I would certainly recommend Floridays mainly down to thew location. On previous visits to Orlando we have often stayed further out in Kissimmee and last time at Bahama Bay - which was also a great resort but seemed miles out from all the action. Being situated in the quieter south side of international drive, Floridays is only a few minutes from Sea World/Aquatica & Discovery Cove. A shuttle bus runs outside the complex taking you up the length on international drive so a night out without the car is an easy option. Also within a fairly short trip are the Disney resorts in the Lake Beuna Vista Area. Nearby is a Pubix supermarket for groceries. The 2 room condo we stayed in was clean had a decent kitchen, We prefer this self catered option as 2 weeks of restaurant food can get to seem too much. We opted for a pool view which can lead to a little noise but nothing excessive. The pool was great for cooling off after a day out or even just for having a lazy day and the bar was well run with friendly staff. On certain days the pool bar even had some entertainment.

Perfect location for both; transportation to parks was well organised and available, even at that busy time. We were a mixed party of young children, needy teenagers (shop-v-park??) and parents; this place met everyone's needs. We didnt have a car but Lynx and I-Ride stops literally outside the door. Some would say you need a car to stay here-I'd disagree (it's be nice but it's doable without). Also teenagers were free to come and go on public transportation so no taxi-driver mom. Ideal for Premium Outlets which had improved greatly since our trip the previous year. Travelling with small children access to the full kitchen/washer/dryer was such a bonus compared to previous trips spent in hotel rooms with a kettle and a microwave. It's not the most convenient for evening dining but we did most our eating in theme park restaurants or got delivery to our hotel room. We're park-people so often forget to eat!! Weather was just amazing! The pool was heated well, and temp during the day was up on high twenties/early thirties so for us this was glorious, having left -1 to -5 at home. The roomy spa was 'roasting'!! We also found it better than June/July trips where we tend to find the heat too much. Our 3-bed condo had everything we needed, though on our first night, arriving after 24 hours travelling, they didn't have a 3 bed for us, and asked us to accept a 2-bed for the night. It wasn't ideal, but we were exhausted and didn't bother arguing.

(Best parks for a 9 year old) After much research on trip advisor we chose the Floridays. Great decision. We had a two bedroom in building B over looking the main pool. The rooms were spotless, roomy and as comfortable as home. Fully equipped kitchen with a dining area big enough for 6 people. There were two double beds in our son's room and a seperate bathroom. Our large master room had an adjoining bathroom with a shower and a jacuzzi tub big enough for two!! There was a small balcony and we were on the 5th floor with a nice view. The complex is not over-whelming like some of the other resorts in the area. You can walk to the pool, bar, game room and front office easily. There are golf carts at the complex with employees giving rides if you are located at one of the back buildings but the young and healthy really can walk. The front desk was very attentive and friendly. We didn't have an iron in our room and it was sent up within 5 minutes. If you want internet in your room you do need an ethernet cable but they have them at the front desk. The bar area is nice with two great bartenders, Katy and TJ. They were very sweet , giving service with a smile. Another plus was the ability to purchase a bottle of wine or beer at the local liquor store and sit by the pool at night while our son swam. ( plastic cups of course) We LOVED this place and will definately return. It is a bit further down International Drive and I highly recommend a rental car. We grocery shopped at the Publix Market 1/2 mile away and loaded up on breakfast items, juices, coffee etc. It lasted all week and we even packed lunches for the parks. ( Saves lots of time and money) The ONLY thing I will warn about is that there is somewhat of a noise issue. The ceilings are thin and yes you can hear plumbing from above. We had the 5th floor so request the 6th (top) if that is going to bother you. Also, my son's room was closest to the outside corrider and he heard noisy people at night returning to their rooms.

Check in went real smooth and we were even given a short tour of where everything was. All questions we had were answered quickly and we were off to our room. The rooms were nice just like everyone describes them. We had a two bedroom suite and were in Building \u201cD\u201d which was close enough to walk to the pool and market. There is a shortcut through the parking lot of \u201cD\u201d that leads right to the pool area. I think building \u201cB\u201d is the best location. Anyway, we had a few incidents in the room with TV remotes needing batteries and some light bulbs out as well as a missing a coffee maker. We made a call to the front desk and all was resolved in no time. We found out later that our TV in the living room also did not work I assume it was batteries in the remote again but never called as we did not use it anyway. Our friends had the blow dryer missing from their room and they brought one right away. We found it funny that blow dryers and coffee makers were missing and we came to the conclusion that they take it from rooms that are not rented to replace them in the rooms that are and that is why this happens. The rooms were very clean and the maid would come and take your trash, make the beds and refresh the towels which there were plenty of and our rooms were always done when we arrived back. I also loved that we had two bathrooms with showers so it made it real easy getting ready in the morning for everyone. The food at the mini market was very good and my husband and I would split an egg, cheese and sausage croissant in the morning which also came with fruit. It was only 6.00 for the sandwich and was big enough to feed both of us. The mini market is the only place to get food and is not a full service resturant. They do have good sandwiches and breakfast and there are enough nearby resturants to eat if you arn't in a park. We ate at a Bahama Breeze and Olive Garden so all was well. The pool was nice but we never actually had the time to really spend by it but they had plenty of towels and chairs. The resort is in a great location to both Disney and Universal. We did Blizzard beach one day and Universal 2 days and had not problem with traffic getting in and it was painless. One thing I did not like is that they have the resort fee but then charge you in the internet room. We had to print off our Southwest tickets and had to purchase a card to get on the internet which I think was 20 cents per minute and 75 cents a page to print. This kind of put me off since we paid a resort fee that said internet was included but I guess that meant in your room if you brought a laptop. We did send the kids over on the shuttle to Universal early one morning (our kids were 17) and that was a great help as the adults could relax and arrive at their leisure. I would definitely recommend this resort and feel it is clean and nice for anyone who does not want to stay in the park. It is a great option for families who want a kitchen and plenty of room for everyone to stay together in comfort.

We were in Block A towards the front of the resort with our balcony looking over a small lake and fountain. The apartment was so well laid out and supplied that it was like living in a small house.

Coffee and percolator. Air conditioning/heat. Towels changed without any requests. Bed linen changed twice during ten days. Staff lovely throughout resort. Pool area great. Pool bar and shop (pricey but handy). Concierge was, to our surprise, working for Expedia rather than the hotel. Had one bad experience due to this. Booked for Kennedy Space Center and we were told that bus would collect us at 7am, but would ring us the night before to confirm time. No call. Got up for 7am and no bus arrived. Eventually a concierge arrived, checked and found that Dolphin Tours had us booked for March (not February) - so she said. She changed the company and the day worked out well. I think I would do my own booking and buy my own tickets online in advance in future. Or buy tickets at the attractions. Be warned, especially if you are bringing a group ... attractions are expensive. Sea World cost almost $90 for one ticket. Much the same for Disney and Kennedy. We were not driving so we used the I RIDE TROLLEY. $10 for a 7 day ticket with 41 stops running between two outlet parks, one at each end. Two lines Red and Green, but you get used to their slightly different routes. 1, 3, and 7 day tickets are not available on the trolley; buy them at your resort. Validate the ticket 1st use and then swipe it each time you enter trolley. Individual trips cost only $1.25 but obviously the day tickets are much better value still. Pick up a map of the stops (and what is at each stop) in your hotel or on the trolley. No set times for trolleys so it can be frustrating if you just miss one because it can take 20 minutes for the next one to arrive. Stop 39 is beside Floridays.. it would be handy to know this for the taxi from the airport because there are lots of hotels and resorts on International Drive. PUBLIX is only about 200 yards of a walk away and you can buy supplies of just about anything here, including pre-cooked meals, meat, fresh fish, cooked meats etc. etc. You are sure to enjoy Floridays and I do not really understand some of the niggles reviewers scare prospective clients with. The resort is very easy to walk around no matter what block you are in. Finally, if you are looking for a Catholic Church during your stay, there is a beautiful one just past the outlets park and near Floridays. The info in your apartment will give you numbers for places of worship and your local calls are included in the extra payment you make per day to cover this and other amenities like free shuttle to some parks. Make sure you book the shuttle a day in advance. Enjoy your trip and enjoy Floridays.

It charges twice the amount of a taxi. If you want a taxi, you have to do that on their own. Great concierge service, huh? Since we were not on the outbound, we couldn't take the return shuttle, that we paid for in the daily hotel service fee. We had to take that round-trip. 3. You pay a service fee everyday in addtion to your room rate. It only includes towel replacements and trash removal if you are lucky. This was very inconsistant. They do not replenish the toiletries if you use them up nor do they replenish the coffee if you use their coffee machines in the units. You have to call to get replenishment and you may need to wait over an hour for somebody to bring it and made to feel like you're being greedy. 4. They do not have a restaurant on site like they say. You can order food in their overpriced convenience store and sit at these cheesy tables if you want. It's like you would be eating your dinner at 7-11. No waitstaff like you would expect at a restaurant. The cost of the beverages nd food at the convenience store are the same price as in he Disney parks. Need I say more? 5. We did end up taking the shuttles. They are disgustingly filthy. They stink like stale smoke and they show up late and leave without you early. If you stay there, do not expect the amentities you would expect at a hotel. The front desk staff do their best, but the company that owns this joint is a disaster. Do NOT be fooled by the low nightly rates, because you will be surcharged for a bunch of nothing. You'll incur the cost of a rental car or their overly expensive car service if you need to get anywhere the day you arrive, since you cannot check in until 11:00 am. I will not stay there again and I vehemently discourage anybody to pay to stay there", "Date": "February 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cicero, NY", "Title": "\u201cDecent Place with a few disappointments\u201d", "Author": "Tripswithbaby", "ReviewID": "UR24216276", "Content": "Over all this is a nice property, but there were several disappointments. First, their reservation system is seriously flawed. I had to call several times, at different times of the day when trying to book to finally get ahold of in-house reservations. I had requested a first or second floor room because my one year old hates elevators, I also requested a crib to be in the room. As it was late when we arrived, I didn't notice during check-in that our room was on the forth floor. Since we had already driven to the back of the resort to our building(it is kind of far) plus the baby was sleeping and the crib should have been waiting in the room, we decided we would stay there. We got in the room, no crib. We called the front and we were moved to another room on the first floor in a different building, but we had to drive all the way back to front of the resort to take care of it, then back to the second to last building. We also received a message on our phone two days before we planned to check out to confirm that we were checking out the next day, they had our reservation one night short. And I know I repeated the reservation days and number of nights more than once on the phone when making the reservation. Again, it was quickly fixed but could have been a problem had it been the busy season. The play room that is advertised and you see pictures of on their website no longer exists, which was a huge disappointment since it contributed to our choosing this hotel. Several lamps in our room did not turn on, not really a big deal since there were so many. I think the broken lamps were so because they have tassels hanging from the turn switch, not the best choice for a hotel which is geared for families! I had to take off all the tassels because my toddler saw them and wanted to pull on them! I am sure other little kids have done the same which is how they broke. The furnature was really uncomfortable, super uncomfortable! I can't stress how poor the chairs are, the back of the chairs are so far back that you cannot sit back and relax. I have seen other reviews about noisey neighbors and thought it was being picky, but after staying in here, I understand. The exterior corridors are concrete and the buildings are U shaped, any noise made in the exterior U shape echoes through the corridors. You can here every last whisper through the thin walls and windows. It was loud, we were there at a slow time, and I don't think there were more than a dozen rooms occupied in our building. I can't imagine how loud it must be when the place is busy. On our last day, the internet (wired) did not work throughout the entire facility. I understand these things happen, but I have read other reviews where this has happened and think it is a common problem. The connection is also on the slow side. It is also true, as other reviews have said, that it is a hike to the main building and the road from the far buildings. About a 5 minute walk, and about the same to the road in a car because there are so many turns and speed bumps! We had planned on using the I-Ride during our stay, but didn't for several reasons, it was a long walk to the road, the bus came very infrequently, and most importantly there is no crosswalk! In fact you have to cross three lanes of traffic, up over a curb, across a grassy median, down another curb, then across two more lanes of 45 mph traffic! Not safe if you are trying to travel with children and/or a stroller~! Plus it is $1.25 per ride, not the $1.00 the hotel website states. There is a Publix close by, but if you walk there, you have to walk along the busy road in the grass in front of a construction site. Another issue worth noting is the heavy use of scented candles and/or air fresheners in the main building! While the smell was not unpleasant, it was STRONG! A member of our family who is allergic to perfumes could not even go in there to use any of the facilities. If you have perfume allergies, do NOT stay here. The rooms were large and clean. Kitchen was spotless, I didn't think twice about cooking there. The water has a strong Sulfur taste and smell, so if you are not used to sulfur water, plan to buy bottled water! Master bath is clean, large and nice, but could use a few towel racks. Staff were all friendly. Cribs and high chairs are available upon request at no charge! We didn't have any issues with the limited house keeping, other than the day we asked for hand towels and washclothes but were informed they didn't have any. They didn't even make an attempt to bring us some later. The pool area was nice and large. We also liked the 'sand beach', well my one year old liked the sand beach. There were no toys there like the pictures show. The land scaping and fountains in the ponds were also very nice. They also have DVDs for rent in the lobby, I think they were $6.49 per night. I found a RedBox($1 per day) at a Walmart a couple miles away. This 'Resort' ( I wouldn't call it that) is also for sale, as in the units are privately owned then the hotel rents them out for the individual owner to make profit. So when you reserve a unit, someone owns it similar to a time share, but they make a profit on your stay. They don't push a sale on the guests, only a few signs and brochures about buying a unit in the rooms. But I think the unit owners contribute to the number of wonderful and excellent reviews for this place.

Next morning, there was no hot water, but informing the front desk got it resolved after a while (the building's boiler needed to be re-set) and the second morning, there was a minor re-occurence. Next day, someone was doing some sort of early-morning work in what may have been the unit above us and it sounded as though the person was in the bedroom with my wife and I. Lowest-bidder construction quality strikes again. The last two days of our stay, the in-room Internet connection (wired) went from its normal slow speed, to unusably slow and then completely out. The on-site maintenance guy couldn't repair it. Service was finally restored the last evening of our stay. The maid service alternated between insisting one morning that she be allowed to replace the towels although my wife and I were still dressing; to another morning forgeting us entirely.

We really did'nt know what to expect regarding the Complex and we were delighted to find such a great place. Some of the reviews had complained about its location. We found the location to be very satisfactory. It was quiet and well away from the Honky Tonk overly commercialized opposite end of International Drive. Right around corner from Premium Outlets and a Publix supermarket. Its also few min from Sea World. (Discovery Cove is a great day out and the Swim with Dolphins is amazing). Universal and Disney very near also. Some reviews also said a car is not necessary and although this is somewhat true we found a lot more flexibility with a rented car. Cars are not too expensive to rent in US. Busch Gardens is also worth a visit. Particularly if you like animals and very scary roller Coasters. The apartments are a great size and there was plenty of space for 5 of us. The two bathrooms and shower is a great idea. The pool area was great and the fact it was heated meant my children could use it over xmas when we got back from a day out. Starbucks on site also. We found the rental price to be very competitive and the staff very helpful. On returning one evening half the electricity would not work and on phoning reception they had an employee(who knew what he was doing) to us within ten minutes.

We visited Disney and Seaworld and chose Floridays primarily because we could use our AE \"points\" to book this property (our last visit to Disney 1/08, we stayed at the Polynesian) we wanted to get more bang for the buck and also visit Seaworld, so we moved off site from Disney. I would have been very disappointed if we paid out of pocket to stay here. Our Amex travel agent really pushed this property and we were happy to be in a suite with a separate bedroom for our boys. While the inside of the suite was fine, the appearance of the resort was so-so. We were there over a cold snap and could not use the pool, so other than general appearance (which was clean) we cannot speak to that. Here are some observations/pluses & minuses about the property: Positive Large two bedroom suite. Suite was generally clean Kitchen was clean and contained and basic equipment to make dinner (full size fridge, electric range, plates, silverware, glasses, coffeemaker, blender, icemaker, pots, pans, etc.). TVs in each room two full baths large master bathroom with whirlpool tub Pool with water play area for kids Good location for seaworld (10 min to drive) and right next door to a Publix, Walgreens and near premium outlets (although we didn't shop). Many Luggage caddies were made available near the elevator which made bringing up stuff helpful. While they offer shuttle service to Seaworld -- a Car is a must. Negative General International Drive is loaded with \"resort\" properties. While Floridays is a \"good enough resort\" -- especially for a long term stay -- it did not appear to us a one that was worth \"275-400\" a night which it appears listed as on the Amex website; rather $125-150 would have been a fairer price. First of all, it looks like there were two halted construction projects on either side of the property (they appeared to have raised/cleared acres of property on either side of Floridays and just let the weeds grow) -- which does not look appealing when you approach the resort. Second of all, the outside hallways look a little weather-beaten, dark and shabby, with worn floor paint. Third, the landscaping/greenery on site looked a little sparse. While the inside of the suite was spacious, the furniture was too big for the room and made it hard to walk around --the table for six was always in the way (and we are skinny ; )). Second, bathroom tub surround was not tile, but some plastic type material (fine if your on a cruise ship, but not on land). Bedding was motel-like (like the second bath). Third, while there were perks, free coffee (on the first day only) and crabtree & evelyn soaps, towel animals that they used to gussy up the place, the overall appearance was mid-range. Noisy. Our room was over the parking lot (not like we needed a view), car doors and beeps from people locking and unlocking cars was a little annoying. Maintenance When we arrived at 6 pm from the themepark, there was no hot water to bathe our children. This inconvenience lasted only a short while (about 1 hour) but the front desk was less than helpful. There were a couple of blown light bulbs in the suite and it was difficult to turn off the automated air conditioner. Later that evening, I went to the market and returned up in a pitch black elevator (which was kind of creepy). The shower had VERY low pressure and I had to wash my shoulder length hair in the tub (yuk). I did find a stray hair in my kids tub (I cleaned it with clorox wipes), but this may have been from the maids. This is a long term facility and they do not change your sheets or make the beds -- they take out the garbage and replace towels only. We tried to get coffee for our second day, but despite requests, it never came. The gym was lacking. Three out of the four treadmill were out of order for days while we were there. Conclusion The two bedroom space was good, kitchen helpful but there were some minor glitches with the maintenance. We certainly would not mind this place if we were staying longer and got a slightly better price than was advertised (who doesn't like a bargain?); but we were disappointed b/c it did not appear as it was described to us by Amex Travel.

There is no denying these are smart looking apartments and are well kept. On the whole everything is positive however there are some negative points. I\u2019ll get the negative out the way first. There is a resort fee that is payable upon check out in addition to the room rate. For 2 bedroom apartments the charge is $5.33 per night. I believe the charge is higher for 3 bed apartments. I booked these apartments through Broadway Travel in the UK. The policy is they empty trash everyday which they did do but they were also supposed to replace towels and make the beds. Towels were only changed on request and beds were made about 3 times in 14 days. The sheets were supposed to be changed every 3 days, this didn\u2019t happen. Also they are supposed to do a full clean every seven days this was not done either. The maids turn up at all different times. We did not have a car but the I-Ride Trolley stops outside the resort and we made good use of this. Supermarket is one stop away, it is only a ten minute walk away I did it quite often. Wouldn\u2019t recommend it in the dark simply as the street lighting isn\u2019t great. Floridays operate a mini bus service which you book the day before to all the main parks. There are 2 to 3 pick up times depending on the park. With Disney they drop you at Epcot. You can make your way free of charge to the other Disney parks free of charge from there. Used the mini bus for Universal/IOA seems reliable enough. The I -rideTrolley goes into Seaworld, Aquatica and wet and wild. Seaworld is a five minute drive away. Pool area is very nice it looks bigger in photos but none the less it is very nice. The caf\u00e9 is over priced. A small bottle of water is $2.00! You can get a whole pack for that up the road at the Publix supermarket! The Market Place Caf\u00e9 in Floridays do things like burgers, pizza and breakfast muffins again these are over priced. They also serve Strarbucks drinks here. Reception are very polite as are the concierge. The gym is nice as is the games room. Internet is available at $0.20 a minute. One recommendation is the local Chinese round the corner Citrus Garden. They deliver which is ideal if you have had a long day shopping or at the parks. [-] we used them loads and they really were good and the portions were huge. You will find you get lots of flyers for pizza places etc it\u2019s best to ignore most of these as per reception. Stick to well known names like Pizza Hut and Pappa Johns who both deliver to this resort. If you are a not driving it is a good location as you can get around to main attractions and shopping quite easily. If you find you need a cab I would not use the company used by Floridays as they are very overpriced. There is a reliable cab driver we always use (Jim) when we are in Orlando he is fairly priced and trustworthy. If you need the number send me a message and I will give you the number. Few minor problems as mentioned but I would happily return to Floridays as positives far outweigh the negatives. If you are driving I would also recommend looking into staying at Hapimag Lake Berkley Resort we stayed there last year (It\u2019s only approx 5 miles away from Floridays) it is also a great place to stay but only if you have a car.", "Date": "December 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dalaro, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cThe suites are gorgeous..\u201d", "Author": "Swede81Sweden", "ReviewID": "UR22850719", "Content": "We have just arrived back from staying 16 nights at Floridays.

Everything you need to make meals are provided, except for spices and food itself. They even have an electronical tin opener. They have two pool areas, one that is mainly for adults and then the big pool area. I bet that is good at the peak seasons, but now hardly anyone was around when we went to the pool in the evening after Disney and shopping. Swimming in the pool at 8-9 pm in december surrounding by palm trees is what I call perfect. There are two elevators per building. Staff are superb and are there to help you with alot. You can even walk to one of the outlet malls from the hotel, although a short bit is walking on grass/gravel. But you can also take any of the buses that go by, I-ride, Lynx bus 8 and 42. There ought to be a crossing across International Drive to get to the bus stops on the other side, nr 42 goes to the Florida Mall. But the traffic was not heavy so we made it across.

I travelled with my husband, who was attending a conference at Disney's Yacht Club, my children ages 4 and 5, my brother-in-law and my elderly mother-in-law. it was our fourth trip in four years to the Orlando area. In the past, we have stayed at Sheraton Vistana VIllage, Residence Inn by Marriott and Disney's Grand Floridian. Floridays was a excellent choice for our extended family. With small children and an elderly relative, it is not always convenient to go out for every meal, especially breakfast. Floridays worked out very well for us. We stayed in a three bedroom condominium in building F. Our kitchen was well stocked with dishes and kitchen utensils and appliances. There are several pools at the resort. The ones closest to building F are more oriented toward adults even though children are allowed. The zero entry children's pool is a bit of a walk, which was not a problem for myself, my children and my brother-in-law, but was a problem for my mother-in-law. If mobility is an issue, you may want to request building A, B or C. The pool is heated and has waterworks which my kids thoroughly enjoyed. The resort is conveniently located to the Disney theme parks, Sea World and Universal Studios. We visited the Magic Kingdom, Universal Studios, Sea World and even drove to Busch Gardens in Tampa. The International Drive restaurants are only minutes away by car. I choose this resort based on reviews that I read on Tripadvisor and was not disappointed. Should you stay on Disney property or at a resort such as Floridays. I guess the answer depends on what your needs are. Having stayed at the flagship of Disney properties, the Grand Floridian, I can say that the Floridian is beautiful, it has character meals, and is very close to the Magic Kingdom and the other Disney parks. However, a standard room at the Grand Floridian fails in comparison to a three bedroom unit at Floridays.

This is only a big deal if you have a baby/toddler that NEEDS TO NAP. Our schedule was basically to get up when the people upstairs did so, due to the noise. I was never asked if I was interested in purchasing, which is good because I would not. I paid an extra maid service fee to clean my room thoroughly, and they left an olive on the carpet, and some food in the sink.

We didn't have a car for the duration of our stay. Although you don't need a car to get to any of the parks and the I-ride stop is right by the entrance I think it's much better to have a car. There are a couple of restaurants and amenities close by but if you like flexibility you really do need a car and taxis are not cheap at all as we found out! Also, if you don't book a car, definitely try and stay in one of the blocks nearer the road. We stayed in block 'H' and it's a ten minute walk just to get down to the main road to get the bus so it's a bit of a trek in the heat!

Thanks to Tripadvisor the reviews on here are justified, the two of us stayed in a two bedroom condo, this included a dining table which could seat six people, a kitchen with large microwave and large fridge, dishwasher, Jacuzzi, 37\" plasma televisions in the bedrooms and living room. We never stay in hotel rooms for long, but we enjoyed waking up and coming home to this great living space. The front desk were always very helpful, you have to pay a five dollar fee each day to Floridays, this gives you things such as free internet access, free shuttle service to seaworld/disney/universal and general up keeping of your time there. LOCATION: The location we thought was perfect; it's near the end of International Drive in the South only two bus stops away from the Premium shopping outlets (I-Ride stop 41). The I-Ride mentioned is basically a bus going up and down International Drive from morning till 10.30pm (stop 39 outside floridays), the cash price per ride is just one dollar but for even more value buy a ticket from the Floridays concierge to save even more money (1,3,5,7,14 day passes). The Calvin Klein shop has to be the best shop there, amazing value for money on lots of quality clothing. As the hotel was on the southern end of International Drive, it was easy to get on and off even seated without the I-ride being overcrowded as it approaches the middle of International Drive. One word of warning, you will find a different pizza menu each day slid under your room door when you get in the evening. We stayed in one night and ordered one from 'Orlando's Pizza' - do not buy from Orlando\u2019s Pizza, terrible quality and didn't feel too well the following morning. Also if you want to walk along International Drive, you can't! Not at least in the Southern end where Floridays is, we had to walk along the grass with other people as their were no pavements/sidewalks. And the I-ride stops urgently need to have lights fitted for the night, bus drivers cannot see you standing at the stop in the darkness unless you start waving or nearly stepping out into the road for them to see you, one I-ride driver agreed he cannot see people and ends up driving past people. WEATHER: After all the worry of the weather reports online showing the recent hurricanes it forecasted thunderstorms every day of our stay! Turns out you should never trust the forecasts, it only rained for an hour for only one of the days we were there. All other days the weather was roasting hot 31-34 degrees. PARKS: Highly recommended is the Orlando Flexticket, superb value for money. We bought the one which covers five parks (Seaworld, Universal, Islands of Adventure, Aquatica and Wet n Wild) - \u00a3125 for one of these tickets and we made great use of the parks. We also went to Magic Kingdom and Blizzard Beach which are Disney parks just to see what they were like, unless you have kids or enjoy kids entertainment it's not for you - the rides at Magic Kingdom I thought were very poor in comparison to the other parks on the flexticket, Blizzard Beach was good but AQUATICA is by far the best waterpark without a doubt. Also the Disney parks were very overcrowded, this was simply due to the parks being popular of course with younger children and the many Disney resort hotels in the area. Favourite ride has to have been the new Simpson\u2019s ride at Universal, closely followed by Spiderman at Islands of Adventures. Terminator 2 was stunning for a special effects show. And for an absolute soaking on a hot day, just go on Bluto's Barges at Islands of Adventure, you will be drenched! I think the Jaws ride at Universal is very dated now 15+ years on and should be replaced with something more up-to-date. FOOD: International Drive has loads of various types of restaurants; our favourites were Tony Roma's (ribs,seafood,steaks) and Maggiano's Little Italy. Charley\u2019s Steakhouse is the best steakhouse in town, a little costly there but well worth it. Worst happened to be Pizza Hut, one couple even stormed out of the restaurant as they were so appalled by the service and food - very bad. To sum up, Floridays was the perfect hotel in what we think was the best location on International Drive.", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hebbburn, Tyne and Wear", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Floridays\u201d", "Author": "Disneyfamily08", "ReviewID": "UR19736371", "Content": "Just returned from Floridays having stayed Aug. 18th - 1st Sept 08 cannot fault this place easy check-in and out given written info on houeskeeping to avoid any confusion {none on our part as we knew what to expect} the facilities of staying in this type of resort far outweigh staying in a hotel especially when your children are different ages like ours - 18 and 11.

We were in the area so my husband could run an international race, do business, and squeeze in a family vacation! We decided to book Floridays vs. staying in Disney because we had so much business to do outside the park and figured it would be easier getting around. We really had a great stay. The hotel/condo is spacious and clean. If you are looking for pampering and spa treatment then this is not the place for you but if you are looking for a home away from home with privacy and convience then you've come to the right place. We stayed at the 2 bedroom and it was great. It made it so much easier traveling with children to have a full kitchen. On the day we arrived we headed to the grocery store right down the street and stocked up. It was very helpful and economical to feed the kids breakfast at the hotel before heading out for the day. There is a cafe on site where you can get sandwiches and drinks. A little pricey but delicious. It was great having two bathrooms with 6 people in the room. and the balcony was great for relaxing. The property is very large so if you are placed in the back like we were (building F) then it can be a long walk with kids to get to the pools and cafe but if you call the front desk they will pick you up in a cart and take you where you need to go. We only had a few minor porblems like one of the hair dryers didn't work, the remote didn't work (they fixed it) and we had to call several times to get needed items. If you are traveling with small kids and need a crib they are available but PLEASE double check the crib before you put your little one in it. They didn't secure ours and it's a good thing I checked before putting our 18 month old in it or it would have folded up on him. Also, if you are going to use their cribs I strongly advise that you bring your own crib sheets. They don't use crib sheets they use regular sheets that they fold around the mattress and if your child is very small then it could be dangerous. We had requested a crib and high chair before we arrived but still had to call once in the room to request it again. They brought the crib right away but it took us 4 phone calls to get the high chair. Another thing I would strongly suggest if you have small children is to bring some outlet covers. Some of the outlets were at eye level for my son and I had to use chairs to block them so if you have small ones take some of those plug in covers; you'll feel better knowing they can't get hurt. So overall it was a good experience and nice to have the comforts of home. One more suggestion i'm going to make re: traveling with small children. I found that it was much easier to get through the theme parks by carrying my son in a snuggli with him facing out. Standing in lines for rides and attractions can be long and my arms were straining carrying him but this way I was able to walk through the attractions and then he was able to ride on my lap and be secure of not falling. If your are traveling to the theme parks they are very close by and easy to get to. I will issue out a warning to be careful of the time-share scavengers! They are everywhere and will offer you fantastic deals on park tickets. If you don't mind listening to a time share lecture then you can get park tickets much cheaper than at the gate but if you don't have time for that (or the patience) avoid them like the plague!", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cGREAT place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "Skip74", "ReviewID": "UR19611219", "Content": "I spent somewhere between 20-30 hours online looking for a place to stay for our family of 3. I finally decided on Floridays and we were all pleasantly surprised when we arrived. We rented a 3 bedroom suite which was basically a condo. There were 2 large bathrooms w/ one in the master bedroom. The kitchen came stocked w/ just about everything you could need except for food. The place was perfectly clean and the beds were comfortable too. There was a small desk area for those of us who cannot be w/o our computers. I do recommend bringing an ethernet cable as the wireless router had poor signal strength at times. I purchased an ethernet cable at Wal-Mart and did not have anymore connectivity issues. I never made it to the large pool, but I did use the smaller pool and it was perfect. Another thing I recommend is renting a car for the duration of your stay. It will give you freedom to do what you want when you want. Relying on shuttles to get around will make you miserable as Disney is filled w/ people who do not use their manners. If you do rent a car DO NOT buy the toll pass. The people at the counter will show you a map of all the local toll roads, and you'll think it is a good idea to pay extra for the toll pass. However, the only times I ever went through a toll was leaving the airport and coming back to the airport. For what we spent on the trip I am extremely glad that we did not stay in a Disney Resort. We got more room and saved money (yes, even w/ the rental car) that we were able to spend at the parks. If you are planning on going w/ kid(s) under 6 or 7 I recommend planning a relaxing day in between the Disney Parks. We actually drove to Clearwater beach and it was just what we needed after 2 full days in the Parks w/ a 4 1/2 year old.

Stayed in a 3-bed condo in Building E (room 609). Prior to arrival, emailed Floridays requesting a high floor, preferably with lake or pool view rather than overlooking any construction. On check-in, the staff advised they had 3 rooms meeting requirements but recommended Building C as closer to the larger pool/reception area. Made our way to room 312 but soon discovered this was overlooking a dirt track & the construction site that is to become Floridays Phase II. Called reception to enquire about another room & was relocated to Building E (room 609). This room was top floor, overlooking both a lake and the smaller pool. Not sure why this wasn\u2019t the first choice? The neighbouring resort to that side of Floridays is now built & isn\u2019t the construction site as appears on some map websites as at time of writing. We were also handed a letter on check-in \u2018to clear up any confusion\u2019 regarding the cleaning service. We chose to remain with the basic service \u2013 trash emptied daily, beds made/towels replaced every 3 days & a full clean after 7 days. Didn\u2019t have any issues with the service. We were also aware of the resort fee ($5 per day) prior to arrival (advised on Travel City Direct website). The room was clean & very large, especially the bathrooms. The kitchen had every utensil/appliance you could need. The layout of the room was great \u2013 never felt that you were under each other\u2019s feet. The safe deposit box is located in the en-suite bathroom cupboard. Minor issues \u2013 there was quite a bit of wear & tear, considering the resort is only a couple of years old, and the carpet was in need of a proper clean \u2013 they should perhaps go for fully tiled floors, especially with the Mediterranean theme of the resort. The resort was spotless though & the welcome centre, condo buildings & gardens impressive. The smaller pool is much quieter & there is plenty of parking around each building. The location is great \u2013 very close to SeaWorld, Aquatica & Disney. Could see Epcot ball & the Magic Kingdom fireworks from the 6th floor corridor. Universal was about 25 mins away & Busch Gardens 1 hour. About 1 minute drive to Publix, 2 minutes to Premium Outlets & a number of gas stations nearby (closest at I-Drive/Vineland). Sanford Airport was just under 1 hour (via 417/528). The resort doesn\u2019t have a two-way intersection onto International Drive so you will have to make u-turns either side of the Floridays entrance, i.e. when driving to SeaWorld or when returning from Disney. Gaps in the central reservation are very close to the entrance though & there are left turn lanes (in both directions) so isn\u2019t an issue if waiting for any traffic to clear.

The units were exactly as pictured with nice amenties and very clean. During our one week stay, housekeeping service was prompt, efficient and courteous. We had ample towels and toiletries. Beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows. Three TVs (one large screen plasma) with lots of cable channels and a DVD player let everyone watch whatever they wanted whenever they wanted. We also had free wired high-speed internet service. However, there wasn't an Ethernet cable in the room and we did not have one with us. When we called the resort office they pleasantly provided us a cable (they charged an $8 deposit that was refunded upon check-out without any problems when the cable was returned.) If there was anything to rate lower than 5-stars in the room, it was the sofa and coffee table that were already beginning to show some wear -- however it was nothing major. I would have also liked wireless internet access. In addition to the accomodations, the resort had 2 beautiful pools with towels available (at the larger pool.) You could also purchase a cocktail at the bar, snacks at the deli and essentials at the convenience shop. However, we chose not to do so because of the plentiful number of stores nearby from which to choose that had better values -- including Publix and Walgreens.

Everyone we dealt with were nice and helpful and professional.

You don't even need to rent a car if you plan on staying on/within the I-Drive area.

We had 3 adults and 2 toddlers and the 2 bedroom suite was perfect for us - plenty of room for everyone to run around.

This resort is one of many new condo rentals that have become available in the Orlando area, located on south International Drive about 2 mile south of Sea World, it is just far enough out of the way that you don't get traffic and close enough that you can get anywhere you want to go with a 15 minute drive. The resort has two pools (one with a pool bar/restaurant) and a small convenience store. This complex is a cluster of of building each with 2 and 3 bedroom units and buildings A,B, and maybe C are the closest to the pool with the bar.

The suites are spacious, the pool area is gorgeous and the grounds are kept clean. In fact, this was actually my second time staying there. Although they certainly earn their 4-5 star rating when considering only the facility, they fall very short when you consider the details. What I\u2019m going to list are small things. However, there are many of them and they tend to add up. Although my 2 BR suite had a beautiful view of a lake with a waterfall, each day when I approached my suite from the outside I was greeted with housekeeping carts complete with dirty brooms, cleaning chemicals and rags. Although this is certainly acceptable during the housekeeping cycle, they left that stuff out even after they were done. I saw carts out at midnight. Additionally, there was a room across from the entrance to my suite labeled \u201ctrash room\u201d. That would not have been a problem except that they left the door open everyday. So each time that I opened my door, I saw an unsightly trash room, which was clearly not designed for customers to see. I personally closed it several times only to see it open again shortly after. I would imagine that their policy is to hide that kind of stuff. But, the mgmt team certainly isn\u2019t checking behind the cleaning crew. The suite kitchen provided all the needed appliances including a very efficient washer/dryer setup. However, the kitchen was equipped without non-stick cookware. Now, I know this sounds very petty, but we found it impossible to cook with their cookware. We wanted to do breakfast each day in the suite. However, everything stuck and burned on that cheap cookware. In fact, it was so bad that I had to go to a nearby Publix store and buy a non-stick frying pan just to survive. You have to go out of your way to find cookware that doesn\u2019t have the nonstick coating, but they found it. It\u2019s clear to me that the people who purchased the cookware for the suites have never actually cooked on it. I would have preferred to pay an extra couple of bucks per night for access to cookware that I can actually use. The site sports a so called \u201cbusiness center\u201d. Since I didn\u2019t bring a printer for my laptop, I went into the business center to print out several important, time sensitive documents. After going through an elaborate system of purchasing time via a special, overpriced, key card system, I attempted to print my documents but the printer was out of ink. I immediately called over a manager and he indicated that \u201cthe business center is not ours\u201d (it\u2019s outsourced) \u201ctherefore, we don\u2019t have printer ink\u201d. He said it as though it was okay that I was not getting what I needed because it wasn\u2019t \u201ctheirs\u201d. Their strategy around who runs the business center should be transparent to me. The fact is that I\u2019m a guest, you are marketing a service, I paid for it, it\u2019s not working, and you can\u2019t fix it. I had to leave the hotel and find a Kinko\u2019s store to get my work done. I was beyond angry and still await the 4+ bucks that I paid for the bad printouts (.75 per page)! Finally, as I checked out the hotel, I approached the desk to hand over my key. Instead of the clerk greeting me with a smile as asking me about my stay, she instead sarcastically looked at me and said, \u201ccheck out time was an hour ago\u201d. Taken aback I said, \u201cso what are you ultimately saying to me?\u201d She says, \u201cI could charge you, but I won\u2019t\u201d. I immediately asked for a survey form and recorded her name. She snapped back with, \u201cthis isn\u2019t my real name tag. So, you may want to make sure you get the name right\u201d and provided me with a different name. I was horrified to see that I hotel like that would allow some young kid, who clearly doesn\u2019t understand customer satisfaction, leave their guests with that kind of image. Young clerks are often too immature to know to think before they open their fat mouths. The result is this fairly bad review on the Internet for the world to see. Much of what I\u2019ve outlined is what I think is just bad management. Many of the people aren\u2019t properly trained at the \u201c4-5 start hotel level\u201d. However, I must say that the bar staff was great. However, the bar manager (TJ) was often there personally to ensure that things were always topnotch. I\u2019m not really sure if I\u2019d go back a 3rd time. The facility is beautiful and a water park is on the way.

The suite was very spacious, nicely decorated and clean. We stayed in one of the Disney on-site hotels last year, and it was such a wonderful difference to have the extra space, kitchen, dishwasher, washer/dryer, etc. There is a Publix grocery store and a 7-eleven a couple minutes drive away. Pretty much everything is provided in the kitchen, even things you don't always find like tupperware, bakeware, cheese grater, etc. They also provide dishsoap, laundry soap, toiletries, coffee, etc. Housekeeping made the beds, changed towels, and emptied garbage daily. Since we stayed 10 days, we did end up with one full clean during our stay as well. Pool is a bit on the cool side, although the weather wasn't really hot when we were there, but there is also a hot tub and small sandy area for kids to play in. The grounds are lovely. The on-site Starbucks is also handy. The food counter didn't interest us a great deal, but there are lots of restaurants and some fast food places nearby if you don't want to cook. Also, there is a DVD player in the living room, so bring some DVDs, or I think they also may have rented them in the lobby. We stayed on the 5th floor in building C and our balcony did face a construction lot, but we only noticed some beeping from the construction vehicles a couple mornings, not a big deal at all in my opinion. As others have mentioned the temporary entrance is not lit and very difficult to see at night, we missed it twice. During the day it is not too bad. Disney is only about 15 minutes away and we found driving/parking and taking the tram (and monorail or boat for the Magic Kingdom) didn't really take anymore time than staying onsite and taking Disney transporation. It's also only a couple blocks away from the premium outlets. We booked online through the hotel's website and got 1/2 price with our entertainment book card. You can see the different rates online. For our dates only $115 per night plus tax which I thought was an amazing deal. When you book, I suggest asking for a suite that is not at ground level and requesting a building close to the pool if you plan to use it. The staff were all friendly and very accommodating. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the security is a little lacking. The windows were installed upside down so did not lock tightly. The maintenance manager checked a couple different suites with us and this seemed to be a problem in all of them, so check your windows when you check in! He put screws through the frame to keep it shut in the bedroom that was on the exterior walkway. This is not a gated property and there are exterior corridors to all rooms, so you will find pizza flyers stuffed under your doors (we ordered from one of them, I can't remember which and it was horrible, don't waste your $$).

So for a family of five who doesn't want to spend a ton of money for a deluxe room inside the park, Floridays is a very attractive alternative. Seven of us - my wife and me, our three children, and my in-laws, stayed in a three-bedroom suite for four nights, and it was perfect, with plenty of room for everything. It also had four TVs, which eliminated ANY argument between the kids over who was going to watch what when we got back to our room in the evening. The two large bathrooms were excellent...one with a Jacuzzi style tub that my kids loved. Showers were fine as well. The full kitchen made it easy to prepare food to bring with us into Disney, and the washer and dryer allowed us to pack less clothing than we would have needed to. Floridays is a 15-minute, very easy drive to DisneyWorld, a few minutes from SeaWorld, and around 20 minutes from Orlando Int'l Airport. All perfect. A supermarket and drug store was a stone's throw away as well, which was nice. Check-in was easy, as was parking. The pool was large and the bar was open until 11pm, so that worked for us as well.

There were many minor annoyances... the last day we did take a list to the fornt desk of all the things that were broken, but I asked that they not be fixed until we left since we were spending so much time in the room. They made no offer to do anything extra, but also I was not really very upset. None of it really hindered us, but if I was with my kids it may have been more difficult (and I would have demanded they be fixed, which I think they would have done). *The burners on the stove were not \"plugged in\"... took us 15 min. to figure out why the stove wasn't working. We did call and they were sending someone from engineering, but then we figured it out. *The iron was broken, but replaced with a phone call (well, 2 calls really). *Garbage disposal broken. *Back sliding door did not lock, but we were on the 6th floor (balcony) so I didn't really care. *Toaster had to be \"jiggled\" to work. *One lamp in bedroom did not work. *We did not have a do not disturb sign, although housekeeping gave us one when they saw our handwritten note on the door. *Alarm clock did not go off, but was ok since I set my phone too. *One outlet in the kitchen did not work.

Can't really give any advice if you're looking to visit the theme parks since we didn't do it... with the kids we always stay on Disney property because I like the full immersion.

The resort grounds are very well maintained, with an elaborate family pool area and a much quieter adult pool located near the back of the resort. Both had very warm water in January! Near the main pool is a neat kids games room, a Starbucks, and an outside bar with a basic menu. The service was extremely professional throughout the stay. The maintenance and cleaning staff, without fail, always said \"Good Morning\". There were also none of the dreaded Florida timeshare sales pitches or offers of free stuff to endure a sales pitch!

The bathroom off of the master bedroom included a big Jacuzzi tub and a separate shower. The second bedroom had two beds and a TV. The hotel brought us a crib at no charge. In the living room area, there was a nice flat panel TV with lots of channels (but no HD) and a big dining room table. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils. Local phone calls are free, something we found convenient. The balcony had a nice view of a small lake with a fountain. There was also a small nook in the room with a spot for connecting to the Internet. The free high-speed requires a cable, so avoid our mistake and bring one with you. In terms of complaints, the biggest one we had was the horrible pillows on the beds. All 7 pillows in the room were identical and equally bad. A few of the ceiling fans were a bit noisy too, but not extreme. The elevator cabs were a bit industrial looking, but still very clean. The nearby construction didn't seem to create any noise problems, although our room faced another direction completely. Overall, the resort provided excellent value.

Me, my wife and 5 & 9 year old daughters had a great 5 days. The suite was very spacious and clean. The master bath was huge with a nice jacuzzi tub. It had a large shower stall also. The kids enjoyed the main pool with the sprinkler park. Since we were there during Christmas week, the pool deck was packed, so the second (secluded) pool came in very handy. There was much more room and quieter there. We did not have a problem with the construction noise at the adjacent property. Yes, you could hear it, but it was a non-issue. The resort is located near everything. We went to Sea World (4-5 minute drive) and Universal (10-15) minute drive. We skipped Disney this time, but it was within 10 minutes away. The outlet mall is just about around the corner - avoid this place the day or 2 after Christmas. What a zoo there! Publix is right around the corner and saved many calories and dollars by eating in. Since you only get one days supply of coffee in your suite, we found it a must to get to Publix for coffee and filters. We will definately stay there again next time we're in the Orlando area. A few pointers - I would definately recommend having a vehicle for your stay there. I believe there are shuttles, but I never saw them. Also, the hard wired internet connection in the suites is not Vista ready, so my laptop would not work. The wireless connections are only in the main lobby and occasionally found on the main pool deck. The wireless connection is Vista ready. Not all the front desk staff were aware of that. I learned that on the last day, after asking on previous days. Another pointer, we were not impressed with Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. Too many soaking wet and/or high intensity rides there. Most of these rides were not appropriate for our 5 & 9 year olds.

Floridays is PERFECT; I will never stay anywhere else every again. The property is beautiful although still in the midst of development. We were in building E. I don't know whether it was the time of year or maybe this property hasn't been discovered yet, but our building was practically vacant. Our unit was serene and beautifully decorated. Housekeeping was attentive and detail-oriented. We got a 2-bedroom unit that we shared with the grandparents so that each couple paid only ~ $85 per night. Our only \"complaints\" -- such as they are -- was that the temporary entrance was difficult to see, especially at night. And the bathrooms need more towel racks (or, as my father said of the master bath, \" 'A' towel rack would be a good place to start!\") Taking back roads into WDW property, we were about 5 minutes away, and didn't have to mess with the traffic or congestion of I-4 or International Drive.

We wanted an inexpensive but nice place to stay for the night and waited too long to book one of the value Disney resorts and they were full. Our search of hotels in the area led us to this one. Since we were going with friends, we liked that we could book a suite for a reasonable price. The price we paid per couple was less than what we would have paid at one of the value resorts on Disney property and we had comfortable beds and nice bathrooms as well as a full kitchen, living room and balcony. We had a two bedroom suite, so there were two bedrooms (one with a king bed and one with two full size beds) and two full bathrooms. The property appeared very nice-unfortunately I can't comment too much on the extras around the property because we only stayed the one night and didn't spend too much time at the property. I was happy with the accomodations though and won't hesitate booking here in the future when we visit Disney again. I think this resort would be a great place for a family visiting the Orlando area for a long weekend or week stay as there is a full kitchen so meals can be made there, and there are also laundry facilities. The living room has a full pull out couch also, allowing space for a few more guests. The staff was very pleasant and helpful-offering recommndations when asked. We arrived earlier than check-in time but since our room was ready they allowed us to check in early with no trouble. If you live in Florida as we do, ask for a Florida resident rate when booking. We called the hotel directly to book and they quoted us the price we found online, however when my husband asked if that was the best they could do they inquired if we were Florida residents and then gave us a better price. Also, a tip we learned...we took a cab to get to Disney and called a cab company the hotel gave us. The cab driver explained to us that Disney has a contract with a specific cab company (not his) and he is charged parking to drop visitors off at the parks. Coming back from Disney we used one of the cab companies that Disney contracts with and it was about $7 cheaper. Unfortunately as I'm writing this I can't think of the name of the company! The hotel offers a shuttle service too, we just happened to miss the shuttle.", "Date": "October 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Preston", "Title": "\u201cA gem\u201d", "Author": "alwaysissy", "ReviewID": "UR10041829", "Content": "If you want value for money and close to Disney and Sea World I very much doubt that you will find better. Firstly let me say that our holiday was in September when the schools had gone back so we never saw this place anywhere near full - in fact at one stage only 72 rooms were being occupied - so I cannot say what it will be like during the holidays. Fantastic location but walking is not an option due to the humidity but the trolley bus up and down I Drive is frequent - this place is very near the Premium Outlets and the Hilton GVC with a mall including Publix around the corner. Stayed in block C room 606 which was top floor overlooking one of the lakes and the pool - great spot! At first however we were allocated in block B overlooking the carpark but the front desk were very accomodating in moving us. I note that many travellers try to reserve or request specific rooms etc as I did but this did not work - their computer simply randomly selects a room upon your check in.Therefore if you are desperate for a view as we normally are it really is a lottery with limited possibility for changing rooms during busy periods - I did notice that there is a good chance of overlooking the carparks with the layout of the property. Block C overlooking the lake is highly recommended - just far enough from the noise of the pool but close enough to everything in the resort. I was informed on site that by Sept 2008 the resort will be completed which will mean that it will double in size - not a problem because extra pools and restaurant/bar included in new build. Room spacious and clean - maid service excellent everyday. Pool/bar/grill bar spotless and well set out- the food served is very good indeed,infact we had an evening meal there one night just to avoid the maddness of I Drive following a long day at the park. Good size pool with lane swimming area for the serious swimmers! Pool towels provided which they let you take to the water parks as well! 15 minutes to Disney and 10 to Sea World. Great concierge team who will point you in the right direction for everything if you need advice. Never once approached about making property purchase on the resort.

It is perfectly located for the freeways and getting to/from Disney and Seaworld. The apartment we booked was two bedroomed, and the kids loved it. TVs in the bedrooms and the lounge meant that we were not living on top of each other, we we were there. We could come home from a long day out and about and relax as if we were at home. The kitchen allowed us to make breakfast most mornings before heading out. The pool are was open late every night and we mostly used it then, from 10pm onwards. The bar staff were friendly and it was really nice to sit having a beer at 11pm while the kids are enjoying the pool within 10 feet. All very safe. During our stay we were never bothered by anyone trying to sell us anything, as usually is the case in some Orlando resorts. The phone did ring twice but we just didn't answer it. The location is handy to the Outlet shopping centre, the local Pubix, and the Dolly Parton Show. We thought about walking but, as another poster has said, it is not a walk you would want to do in hot weather. Couple of things that I found annoying though. One is the entrance to the resort - the roadsign is not visible at night and as we arrived to check-in at 10pm we missed the turn a couple of times. There are roadworks ongoing and it has meant that the entrance is coned and not in good condition. The other thing is the building work beside Floridays. They start work at 7am and all you hear is beep-beep-beep from then on, if you are overlooking the site. It is not Floridays fault but it just got on the nerves, especially when you want to get much needed sleep before the long day ahead!! All in all, a great spot to stay at and we will definitely be back! Other things worth a comment : Outlet Shopping : God, things are soooo cheap compared to back home. Didn't mind her spending, but don't tell her that!! Wonderworks : Keeps kids occupied for hours. Go to the magic show in the evening as it was very enjoyable. Ripley's : Good fun Titanic Exhibit : Pleasantly surprised. Very well done and presented. Even the kids felt moved by what they learnt. Kennedy Space centre : More for the adult (me) but kids enjoyed the simulation take off and the rockets. Great idea mid-visit, to get away from the park crowds and break up the week. Priates show : Encourage the kids to get involved if asked, and have the camera ready! Dolly Parton Show : Good night out. Universal : Loved it. Seaworld : Shamu Rocks!!!!! Disney : Nothing really more you can say! All lands visited was what we expected, and more! Not every day, because too much of a good thing............. Near the end of our visit, we discovered DisneyQuest in Downtown disney - free car and bike games etc. Kids wanted back there every night after that. Raglan Road Irish pub in Downtown : I know.....Irish man goes to Florida and ends up in an Irish bar!! But I tell you, the crowds queuing don't lie. Great food, great service, and great beer.

My husband and I enjoyed the shower and whirlpool bath in the master bedroom. Also, the privacy was unmatched. The master bedroom was far enough from our teenage sons' room that it was like a second honeymoon for my husband and me. The beds were large and extremely comfortable.

Still, the call of the parks and the college our elder son plans to attend next year forced me to leave the plush luxury of the room. Let me not forget to mention the hospitality of the staff, which was greatly appreciated. Finally, the pool areas were tops. Although the larger pool near the bar was always crowded, the atmosphere was fun. We simply preferred the smaller pool because it was less crowded and the jacuzzi is located there.

My husband is a hotel manager (totally unrelated to Floridays), we were there for a conference he was attending, and we were suppposed to stay at the Gaylord Palms, but after reading reviews, and since we had our soon to be 2 yr. old daughter with us, I thought a condo type room would be much more comfortable. Don't come to this resort and expect pampering, the staff was pleasant, but nothing special, but I didn't expect special, because we weren't paying through the nose. Housekeeping just gave us new towels most of the time and didn't make the beds, which again I really didn't care about. They give you coffee for you coffee pot free for the first day, but if you want any more you need to buy your own, same for laundry soap, shampoo, soap, etc....again this is not like a regular hotel......it's a condo. I loved having the washer and dryer in the room, did a load before we left and it worked out great. The rooms are lovely, and the decor is very tasteful. One of the reasons I booked this hotel, was for the indoor playroom, which was tiny, and pointless. The pool was very nice with a little one. We had \"Super Sitters\" baby sitting service come and it was really wonderful....I couldn't have felt more comfortable leaving our little girl with her. It was nice they come to your room and watch them, again much more comfortable than being in a regular hotel room. Nice to have tv's in every room. Also had a dvd player. I really wrestled between this hotel and the Sheraton across the street, but the nice thing about the Floridays is, it is all pretty new, you don't have to worry about getting stuck in the old section, like over at the Sheraton. I don't know why people say that the Outback, and Publix, and the Outlets are in walking distance, I guess you can walk, especially if you have been walking miles around the parks, but it would be a little bit of a hike, and I wouldn't recommend it with small children. If the weather is really hot, you would probably be pretty disgusting by the time you got to Outback to eat, which is probably not how you would want to feel to go enjoy dinner. I thought it was nice to have a rental car, and we got a super rate using the Entertainment guide and used Enterprise at the airport, and when we got there we were just supposed to get something like a pontiac G6, and there weren't any readily available so they gave us a Pacifica for the same price, much more comfortable to ride around in.

My husband and I would spend many late evenings on our balcony watching the tenants from that hotel sneak over to use the Floridays pool. The room service was our biggest complaint. Again, we were not used to this as our first time there we felt so pampered. We went 4 days with no new toiletries. I ended up having to go down to ask the woman at the desk for some. Our beds were never made, we had to ask for fresh towels after 3 days, the closet door knob in the spare room fell off when I opened It.

We were at the resort from the 13th thru 27th July 2007. We had booked through our timeshare exchange company (Interval International) but as they could only offer sunday - sunday weeks at the time we booked and we wanted to do Friday - Friday, we booked a couple of extra nights directly with the resort to add to the start of our exchange and left a couple of days before our exchange was up. The resort sorted it all so that we had the same 2 bedroomed condo for the full 2 weeks of our stay which, as anyone who exchanges regularly, may know is not always possible. We were really grateful for that. We loved the pool area and never had a problem getting a sunbed or chair. The hotel provide towels for use at the pool and once, when we went for a quick swim at about 5pm they were out of towels, but it was no big deal. We always made sure that when we were leaving we put our used towels in the bins provided. Maybe that's why people think the sunbeds are in use but maybe folks just haven't bothered to dispose of their used towels. The poolside bar and small store were great and the take-out food there is very tasty and good value. It would have been useful to have provided a menu in each condo. Saves you trying to remember what was on offer if you want to have one of your party do a take -out run! We were in building E which is right next to the small pool but our family prefered the 5 minute walk to the main pool as we liked the atmosphere there but if total peace and quiet is what you're after, the small pool seemed to hardly ever get used. What maid service you get seems to depend on whether you're there as a timeshare exchange or you've made reservations directly with the resort. Either way, you should get your beds made, clean towels and removal of trash daily with clean sheets every third day. (It tells you on the card that comes with your room keys so if there are any issues, it's all there in print what to expect.) You have to pay extra if you want your bathrooms cleaned, vacuming etc. There's a vacume cleaner provided but no cleaning materials. Provision of dishwasher soap, laundry soap etc. was a bit eratic. There was a supply when we arrived and we bought a supply of laundry soap at the grocery store but I kept forgetting to pick up dishwasher soap. Some days the maid left some more and some days she didn't. I'd say better to take/buy your own. There is a hairdryer in the master bath (I assume there's one in the other bath too but I never looked as our boys didn't need one!) and it's perfectly fine so if your not too fussy, don't bother packing your own. There's no full length mirror anywhere (sorry! it's a girl thing!) but the hairdryer is right in front of the mirror so at long last, hotels are starting to get the details right! I've seen lots of posts about some buildings being better than others but I wouldn't get too worried about where you're allocated. Even building F, which is farthest from the reception, is only a 5 minute walk from the main pool and parking is throughout the resort so you should be able to park at each individual building. Hope I didn't get too bogged down in the details but was trying to cover some of the stuff that hadn't been mentioned in other recent posts that others might find useful.

The resort itself is ideally placed for everywhere by car - Disney, universal, seaworld, Premium outlets, good restaurants etc but still manages to be in a private, quiet location. The only slight nag i had was after one long day at a park we came back to find that there had been no maid service at all - normally would't mind a little blip like that but it was on a 3rd day ( when bed linen gets changed) and i was looking forward to a leisurely bath in the jacussi and then jumping into nice clean sheets! I rang reception to inform them and they could not have been more apologetic sending someone round straight away with clean towels and to empty the bins and arranged a full service clean the next day for the inconvenience caused - excellent customer service.

A family could easily spend a week here without tripping over each other. Each bedroom had its own bathroom, which is very convenient. There was a full kitchen, with everything you need to cook, as well as a washer/dryer. The location is fairly central to all the Orlando parks and attractions. You will need a car, however.

There is also a second pool, which is more for adults and located in a different part of the resort. The price was very reasonable, and we were very pleased with our choice. Floridays is located a ways out on International Drive, so it is easier to have a car, although they do have shuttle service. Also, there is no restaurant, but there is a bar and cafe, and both Publix and Walgreens are located within walking distance.

The floor was the only thing I noticed was rather dirty, but that is pretty typical with most hotels. With a baby crawling around on the floor, I frequently had to clean his black feet from the dirty floor. On a positive note, the master bath is huge and has a large hot tub.

The fire alarms were being tested one day and the alarms were ringing all day long which was pretty annoying, but wasn't Floridays fault at all.

Housekeeping is 'light-touch', which was adequate - beds made and towels changed. What I didn't like much was from our building B the short walk to the main pool was through the car park. The main pool, which again looks very nice especially for children, zero entry with fountains etc was only heated at the weekend! This pool is alongside the carpark (no big trees to shield it) which is adjacent to the building works next door - we were there during a windy week and dust constantly blew over the pool area and our car was covered in dust everyday. There is a pool bar for lunch and drinks and a small store, which sells a few cereals, crisps and coffee - it shuts early. The business centre is good and the staff were all very nice. I did not notice any security and in theory anyone could come in and use the pool or wander around the apartments. These units are at the far end of International drive south, near the premium outlets and Hilton Grand vacation club. There is a walgreens, Publix supermarket and Outback steakhouse 5 mins away. My feeling is that in a year or so when more in the area is completed it will be a very nice place to stay but at present no-where is finished and it feels a little bit soul-less. Having stayed in both hotels and condos, I think that I am not really a 'condo-girl' although I love the space, I don't really like having to stock up on groceries on holiday to cook meals etc. I prefer the atmosphere of a hotel with the onsite facilities and daily housekeeping. Although if space is a priority then this place is good for the dollars.", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

It is already fairly large, situated just south of SeaWorld on International Drive. I drove to Magic Kingdom parking lot in exactly 10 minutes. It is a very nice location (outlets, drugstore, grocery store very close). We were in Building 'A' and that worked well. We rented a two-bedroom unit and found it to be plenty big enough even for five grown ups. Bedrooms: The master bath had a king-sized bed and a fine walk-in bathroom that included a decent jacuzzi type bath tub. The second bedroom featured two queens and there was a second bathroom right around the corner. Both bedrooms had nice, large TVs with plenty of channels to choose from. Living/Dining: The living area had a comfortable couch and sitting chair and a fine flat-screen TV with a DVD player. The dining area included a nice, large dining table, full refrigerator/freezer, stove, microwave, plenty of shelves and all the utensils you could wish for. There was also a very small deck on the back. Misc.: The suite included a washer/dryer, a full dishwasher and a sweeper along of course with all needed towels and linens. We found the fitness room to be quite a bit better than the typical hotel. The equipment was new and worked well and there were two TVs. WHAT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER The resort doesn't feature a whole lot to do other than a fair-sized pool and hot tub. I also like a warm pool and this one wasn't heated during the week. Only on the weekend. Unlike some other places we have stayed in Orlando, there was no complimentary food or drinks of any type and there wasn't much food on site. A very nice Publix is very close.

Our experience is this...my wife and I were traveling with our daughter, my mother, and our aupair. We rented a 2 bedroom villa. The room we were initially assigned wasn't cleaned from the previous guests. It took about an hour to discover that though...everything looked okay until we unpacked and decided to have a bite to eat and use the facilities. Not good. Although one call and we were moved to another room. It was a bit of a pain, but worth it. Oddly the new room was wider - it was the same unit per say - but noticibly wider. The original unit was bldg D and the new unit was bldg C. Weird. BTW, the \"D\" bldg has a view of construction equipment and the balconies have concrete walls, not railings. The new room was a ground floor unit in bldg C. The lock on the sliding door did not work. A simple call to the desk and in two minutes it was fixed. That was nice. The people are nice. The pool is also nice. The playroom for children is basic, although much of it is broken. p.s. A few noteworthy mentions regarding quality. Keep in mind that these units are very new! Some examples are: cabinent doors falling off, lights flickering, lights sporitically working, sliding doors not locking, broken coffee maker, etc. Many of these things can be repaired with a phillips screwdriver.

Always had clean towels and made up beds. They even loaded and ran the dishwasher for me the first day! The negatives... I have to agree with another reviewer... I, too, arrived around the same time as the prom kids and they were obnoxious and rowdy. I was quite shocked that the resort would even offer them rooms, considering the \"family\" atmosphere. It was very noisy and security was inadequate. After spending Sat. & Sun. in Bldg. A, I asked to be moved come Monday because the construction noise was disturbing. They moved us to the other side of Bldg. A facing a vacant lot. It was much quieter. The biggest peeve was that I booked a crib over a month in advance but was told when I arrived that there were none available and 6 people ahead of me waiting for one. The next day they brought me a pack & play. While I was moving to the other room two days later, I saw a crib in a utility closet not being used. I called the front desk and they had it delivered to me but they were surprised it was there. Communication could be better. I also have to agree with other reviewers that lounge chairs by the pool were in short supply. All of the chairs were always reserved with towels but I found it interesting that there were never as many people by the pool as there were towels on chairs.

That was fine they did a great job. They provided dish detergent and even a little laundry detergent. They did not provide windex and they have a glassed top dining table. So, if you tried to wipe it down it never really looked clean.

The furnishings in the rooms are kinda cheap hotel type stuff and the main living area was a bit cramped because the dining room table and chairs were a bit large for the room.

Although this property had a great pool and spaciuos rooms, there was one incident that causes me to caution others about staying here. Our stay started out great. The pool was great. The food at the cafe was great. Our suite, in building B, was great. There were a couple of issues with noise levels. We could not lock our balcony door. The door just would not close enough so the clasp would lock. The windows are thin. We were up a few levels and could hear a conversation taking place in the vehicle below our room. We were unfortunate enough to stay here Saturday, April 14th. It seems one of the high schools had their prom that evening and kids were staying at the resort overnight. After a long day at the parks we were hoping for a peaceful evening. Well that did not happen. Starting at 10pm, numerous cars started arriving. At midnight, the party really started. Both inside the rooms and in the parking lots between the buildings. Again, the windows are thin and the noise levels were high. The kids were trucking speakers into various rooms. There were kids openly urinating in the parking lot. The next day, one guest had to clean his car because the kids were throwing cigarette butts onto his windshield from balconies. There were coolers being trucked into the rooms and it was openly visable that there were alcoholic beverages in those coolers. The legal age for drinking in FL is 21. These kids were definitely not 21. Management was aware of the problems because they sent \"security\" around - but this was only cursory. The parties, with load music and noise continued until 3am. The kids were revving their cars in the parking lots. That Saturday night was unbelievable. What would have been a fantastic stay was ruined. Was this a family oriented place? Not on that night. Filling the rooms was more important, not the comfort of the other guests. When discussed with the front desk the following morning, the only response was \"sorry.\" With all of the other choices in the area, I will find it hard to stay here again.", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, OH", "Title": "\u201cVery nice stay\u201d", "Author": "penelope_13", "ReviewID": "UR7429522", "Content": "We arrived here a few hours before check-in and were told there were no rooms but that we could sit by the pool or in the lobby area if we did not wish to leave the property.

Finally, we requested a late check-out which they granted for an extra $75.00 to stay until 3:30 p.m., however, be advised that your hotel keys won't work after 1 p.m. Last but not least, they didn't replace the toilet paper and both bathrooms ran out.

You don't hear any of the usual hotel traffic because they are condos. Pros- -beds are wonderful, slept great. Separate rooms for my husband and I and our children. And separate living area in case someone wanted to stay up late and watch tv... -Housekeeping responded promptly to call for clean up after my daughter got sick, they came right away and cleaned the floor. -Pool area is fun- my five and one year old loved it. Our most relaxing day in Florida was spent lounging by the pool. Hot tip for families, don't buy the five day Disney passes and try to hit every park. Go once or twice and lounge around the rest of the time. Rushing from one place to the next is just stressful! - I loved having a full kitchen so we could cook breakfast in the morning and store leftovers from restaurants. After having stayed in a condo, I wouldn't go back to a hotel- it's just really convenient and nice and felt very safe. -There is no extra charge for extra guests. My family of four went to Orlando and our friends drove up from South Florida to meet us. They were a family of three and the accomodations worked perfectly. Plenty of room for everyone and everyone was comfortable. Would not be the same in a hotel... - Pretty close to all the theme parks, just make sure to get a good map so you don't get lost at 12:30 am. -Free parking Cons- -Housekeeping. Lack of attention to detail and superficial cleaning. I got into bed one night and basically the bed had been superficially made. The sheets were still down around the bottom of the bed and all I could feel was the blanket. Essentially, housekeeping pulled the bedspread up over the messed up bed and called it good. - Room was beautiful, but dusty. Just seems like this property needs to brush up on its maintenance as far as thorough cleaning goes. My friend who used the spare bathroom found a plastic razor cover in her tub, if it had been cleaned thoroughly before we got there then it wouldn't have been in the tub. - Regarding cleaning, there was a ring around the jacuzzi tub the entire time we were there. No one cleaned the tubs. Housekeeping seems to be limited to changing the towels, emptying the trash and quickly, very quickly, making the beds. No surfaces were dusted or touched. In the hotel's defense, maybe this is what is expected of them. But, it's a hotel with a potential timeshare capability and as a potential owner that is staying on the property, I would want to be impressed by the level of service- and I wasn't. (In particular, the cleaning, everything else was good). -Balcony on second floor was cement- about 4 ft high, so you couldn' t see outside if you were sitting in the living room. Higher rooms had wrought iron that you could see through. With little kids, the cement balcony was actually safer than wrought iron but didn't like that it obstructed the view. -You pay for internet in your room, coffee is free in office if you buy one- and it's Starbucks drip coffee, nothing fancy. The hotel does offer wireless internet but you have to bring your own laptop and sit by the pool or in the main office to access it. -Business center internet costs 1 dollar/5 minutes and 75 cents to print one page. Little pricey. If internet access is important to you, bring your own laptop and sit out by the pool. Overall, I would recommend this hotel. I did like the accomodations, I just wish cleaning would have been a bit more thorough. Cleaning staff was extremely friendly, just did a rush job. But.. I would return to this hotel.

First week we booked a two bedroom Condo and were upgraded to 3 Bedroom. 2nd week stayed in 2 bedroom. Both accomodations very similar with positive and pleasurable experiences. The Check in by Luis 1st week was very friendly and efficient. The first impression when you open the front door is that the rooms are stunning. Very well appointed with quality furniture. The Master bedroom is spacious and the Bed itself is huge and very comfortable. The ensuite bathroom has a Jacuzzi with a rather strange stable-type door above it that opens into the bedroom. The shower is powerful, although it is diffcult to adjust the shower-head and you cant avoid getting a cold blast when you turn it on. (Just being fussy here) We were in block E, 4th Floor which overlooks a pond and the nearby Fountains resort. The Fountains construction complained about in many of the other posts is now nearly complete, at least as far as it will affect Floridays guests. There was only a very light murmur in the mornings which should disturb only the very, very lightest of sleepers. The pool area is attractive and appears popular with kids. The Bar staff is very friendly and helpful. Particularly TJ who remembered every drink that our party liked, even after we left for a week and returned. Bar Food is good. Starbucks coffee. The convenience shop could do with more stock. If you need groceries there is Walgreens nearby as well as a 7-11 about a half mile away. We stayed in Vistana Villages last year which is excellent. This compares very well indeed. The only real difference is slightly less attractive landscaping, which may improve when a further part of the resort is developed. Slightly better shop at Vistana. This is one of newest resorts in International Drive area so you can be confident that everthing is still fresh, bright and unworn. Would definitely recommend. One tip. Book on the Floridays website for the very cheapest midweek prices you can find for this resort. Very close to Seaworld, Discovery Cove, Dolly Partons Dixie Landing and a large Designer Outlet Mall. Nike, Adidas, Guess, etc etc Highly Recommended.", "Date": "March 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat!\u201d", "Author": "canswede", "ReviewID": "UR7227038", "Content": "Great!

I was a little reluctant just because of its name, but finally decided on that because it was cheaper than The Fountains, The Hilton Grand Vacations and Sheraton Vistatana. All of these resorts are within a 1/2 mile of each other. When we arrived at the resort it looked just like the pictures. I had a quick and easy check in. My room was in building C on the first floor. LIke the previous review I also faced the fountain and could see the pool from my room. Only drawback is that I had to look through a bush of some sort, not a big deal to me at all. The room itself was VERY CLEAN as was the entire resort. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable. Plenty of dishes and cooking utensils. The room also has a washer and dryer which was a big plus as well. The master bedroom has very nice big bathroom with a whirlpool tub and separate shower. However, this bathroom was poorly lit as well. The other bedroom has 2 nice double beds and a big tv as well. The only drawbacks to the 2nd bedroom is that it is poorly lit and the light from the outside hallway shines into the room even with the blinds closed. The pool area was really nice as well. My son loved it. The deepest area is only 5 feet. The hot tub was nice as well. There is also a separate pool area of about 4 feet that shoots out a fountain, that pool seemed to be rarely used though. I could hear people at 8 or 9 in the morning in the pool until it closed around 11 at night. The pool gets crowded rather quickly and stays that way, but I think there is plenty of chairs and tables to sit at. There is a nice bar area facing the pool as well. The game room is pretty small with only a few games as is the kids play room. Though I never used it the marketplace served some hot food and cold food and the prices didn't seem too bad when I walked in. If you can't get into building B then C is your next best choice. The higher letter in the alphabet the furher away you are from the pool. Other postings have commented on the annoying construction taking place next door at the Fountains. That is not a problem in Building C. From my room I could only hear and see the construction if I came outside to leave. The resort itself is only 7 miles from Universal, 3 miles from Seaworld and real short drive to downtown Disney. RIght around the corner is a very nice designer outlet Going past the outlet will lead you right to International Drive were there are several restaurants to eat and downtown Disney. Also there is another strip mall with a Walgreens and Publix grocery store. For the drinkers there is a liqour store in this strip mall as well, but it is way overpriced. The only damper I had on my trip was that on my second night we didn't receive any housekeeping service, no new towels nor beds made. At check out I mentioned this to the front desk rep who then made a call (after a few minutes of discussing) to the manager of housekeeping and I received a $20 credit for that day. I got a 2 bedroom suite for a little over $600 for 3 nights. Well worth the money, I am sure they next time I visit the price will have jumped. We talked to several other guests at the resort and they all loved it just as much as we did!

In our group there was two young couples. We had an absolutely fabulous time. Reception was just wonderful, and very accommodating to our questions and requests throughout the week. Before heading to the resort I read reviews on this website and decided to call ahead to request a room away from construction with a nice view. We were placed in building C (rm 405) a 2 bdrm/2bth suite,and it was fabulous! The full kitchen was well equipped with granite countertops, dishwasher, garbage disposal etc. Other reviews mentioned no laundry/dishwasher soap but they do indeed give you these supplies in your room when you arrive along with Starbucks coffee and Crabtree & Evelyn products. They are also more than willing to refill these as needed. There was a balcony with a small table where we ate most of our meals. It even included an outdoor ceiling fan and light. The view was great, as requested. We could see the pool, but weren't directly over it for noise reasons, and we had direct view of a pond/fountain area. It was quite lovely. The rooms were very nice. There were two double beds in one room with a TV and the bathroom was next door. The master bedroom had a king size bed, TV and an ensuite bath. The bathroom was huge with a whirlpool tub and separate shower. It was quite lovely. The only complaint about the rooms was the lack of lighting in the smaller bedroom, it was a bit dim unless you opened the blinds - but then you were looking into the corridor of the hotel (not very private). The pool areas were gorgeous with hot tubs, palm trees, even a sandy area. Be forewarned, people go down early and use towels to book the lounge chairs around the main pool. If you want one during the day you will most likely have to do the same, especially for a group of 4, or go to the smaller pool. We were informed that the third pool/waterpark area won't be built until later this year and into 2008. Be careful if using the Disney/SeaWorld shuttle. Make sure you know where and when you are getting picked up. At the end of the day the shuttle never came and we waited over 30 minutes for it. We finally took another shuttle back to the resort, although reception was very accomodating and paid the expense of $20 before calling their own shuttle company to inquire about the problem. Overall, we had a wonderful time. At the resort, it often felt like the Caribbean more than Orlando with the palm trees, landscaping and poolside bar and grill. We ended up having a fabulous time at this beautiful resort. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to take a great vacation to Orlando. It is close to everything (2 min from Publix, Walgreens, and premier outlets) and it provides a beautiful, relaxing, vacation.", "Date": "March 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious and convenient for families\u201d", "Author": "TheWongClan", "ReviewID": "UR7200015", "Content": "I booked this hotel based on the reviews and happy to say they were all accurate.

The suite was spacious enough for us even with the long and narrow room set up. We requested and received a highchair and crib (playpen) very promptly. There were no linens for the crib however. Appreciated all the luxury amenities (ie. TV, Crabtree toiletries and Starbucks coffee). The pool area was great and they even had a playroom for the young ones. The location of the resort is great (loved that it was so close to the Premium Outlets). We were also able to get to Disney and Sea World with ease. Housekeeping was indeed a bit spotty and yes the resort lacked landscaping with \"green\" areas. That being said, the positive points far outweigh the negatives. It was a great stay and would hope to be back again soon. Tip: If you book early enough (Floridays website), the rate is only US$150/nite for 2 bdrm Sun-Thur stay.

We were in building 5 which was a bit of a hike to the pool, ask for a closer building if being close to the pool is important to you.
