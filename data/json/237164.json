Staff was annoyingly grim and unfriendly, room in desperate need of refurbishment, lacked fridge, hairdryer, toiletry (but a tiny soap), A/C was only switched on after request and was switched off sometime during the night and remained switched off during most off the day, even though Madrid was going through a heat wave. After having previously stayed at two hotels/hostels of equivalent class and price in central Madrid, which were both excellent but unfortunately had no vacancies, Hotel Mexico was a huge disappointment.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spain", "Title": "\u201cLocation perfect for the Prada, but bit shabby\u201d", "Author": "TonyDW", "ReviewID": "UR113112867", "Content": "Paid 70 euros plus 15 for the very convenient parking under the hotel. The location sold it to us and it was perfect, a short walk to the 3 art museams. It is also convenient for walking into the historical centre and tapas bars. The staff at the front desk spoke English and were helpful. There was wireless internet in the room but it was small, and shabby. Very small bathroom (1 metre bath), and seperate loo. The bed was small and not very comfortable. But I assume this is what you get for the price we paid.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Plaines, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and good value\u201d", "Author": "Gorgonzillah", "ReviewID": "UR109007191", "Content": "Mexico is very convenient to El Prado Museum, the Reina Sofia, and Thyssen art museums, the Botanical Garden, and the Atocha train station. The yellow airport bus also makes an easy connection at the train station. Mexico was featured in the MTV travel guide a few years ago. We stayed two nights in early April to visit the museums after a week on Costa del Sol. The decorative theme is interesting, but not too overbearing. The staff was helpful and patient, and complied with reasonable requests (extra pillow). Our room was clean, if a little worn, and had some funky touches. (example: there was only one rubber plug in the bathroom, which did not fit the bathtub, sink, or bidet.) We did not use the attached parking garage, but were very relieved that the idiot who was honking at 5:00AM on a weekend morning was NOT an American tourist.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBasic but well located\u201d", "Author": "derwent10", "ReviewID": "UR65893591", "Content": "The hotel has a good location close to the Prado, train station, botanical gardens and park.
