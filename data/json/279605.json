Chris went out of his way to help us with this. 10 out of 10 for Chris and the Scala staff - may they all find good jobs and be treated well. 0 out of 10 to the new management who must have known long before that they would not be taking short term stays.

Our stay wasn't perfect but Scala House was sold by the long-time owners several months ago and will be closing to short-term stays as of this coming May. Therefore, I have to think that perhaps our stay isn't completely representative of how the property would have been, say, a year or two ago. I'd bet a fiver the new owners haven't put a dime into the property since the sale back in Oct/Nov 2006. The main value for your money is the amount of space: Two bedrooms, a large living/dining combination, great kitchen fully kitted out, a full bath and a powder room, and a tiny little ledge (balcony isn't really correct) to lean out on as you have your monring coffee. Right there it was worth it for us, every penny. My husband is a late-night, up watching TV person and I'm in bed by 10-11pm. If we'd had to stay in a standard sized hotel room we'd have driven each other crazy. The hotel is very centrally located, a block from the Goodge St Station for the Northern Line and a 5-minute walk from Tottenham Court Rd for the Central. A friend of ours who lives in London seemed to feel this wasn't a great area, but we never felt anything but safe. Great restaurants, grocery stores, shopping, and right across the road is a great greasy spoon, Gig's. (Get the chicken doner or falafel. A 'large' for \u00a33.80 will feed two. And the fish and chips were so heavy in the bag I thought my husband had bought a six-pack of beer. And the guys behind the counter are super nice. We loved Gigs. It was the first thing we said we missed when we were home.) As for the negatives: The property is very dated and shabby, but the prior reviews and even the website pictures make this clear. (The people who seem shocked in their reviews at what the place looks like must not do ANY research at all. ) The construction next door caused a water shutoff to the hotel for a few hours our first day, which was profusely apologized for by the management. The beds are firm and the blankets a little thin. The housekeeping seems a little overwhelmed (the shower curtain was still in the washing machine and our dishwasher was still running at arrival.) But all in all, we loved it. It was clean and had plenty of towels (and wash cloths!) The caulking at the sink and around the windows might not have stood close inspection, but I can't say it would in my own home, either. We didn't notice any unusual odors other than people's smelly cigarette smoke seeping into our hallway from other rooms. The driver who collected us from Heathrow said he'd been taking passengers for Scala House for over 15 years and that to keep the prices low, the Palos' just hadn't put any money into the property to keep it modern. But really, people need to understand that's where the value comes from. Yes, it's a 70's shabby look, but the space was more than my first apartment ever had. We paid \u00a3770 for the week; by comparison, we could have stayed at the Travel Inn County Hall for \u00a3693 in one small room with a bathroom you have to stand sideways to get into. Chris and Boba in management were truly a pleasure; helpful, sincere, really concerned with making sure everything was going well, despite the fact that they're all losing their jobs in less than two months. The desk is staffed 24/7 and we were always met with a smile and a quick answer to any questions. The people really make the property. As we left, Boba advised they were looking at buildings and would be hopefully opening their own property for short-term rentals, \"much nicer looking\" but with all the same people in charge. I really hope so; when they open, I'll be lining up for my reservation.", "Date": "March 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cTraveler Beware!\u201d", "Author": "wenrosie", "ReviewID": "UR7156141", "Content": "Having read all the previous reviews, we bravely made reservations about 8 months ago for our visit to the Scala House. We stayed from 2/24 thru 3/10/07. There were 3 adults. The flat was as expected: old and rundown but a good home base for all of our adventures. The kitchen was the best of the lot with a fine dishwasher and washer/dryer combo. A terrific convection oven that worked like a dream! Great refridgerator and freezer...large for UK standards. Here's the problem: The rest of the flat. It smells like your grandmother's house from 1962 and it is furnished the same way. The bathrooms are run down with peeling paint and non working fixtures. We were without any water for 24 hours one day and without cold water for 24 hours another. One day, we had no phone service. The beds were hard as rocks and the bedside lamps were broken. Responses to fix things were overlooked for days by overwhelmed staff. The staff seemed really disheartened by a recent takeover and reported that the Scala house would be closing it's doors once the last of the registered guests vacated. I strongly suggest staying elsewhere. London is not for the meek of wallet. Any other accomodation is going to cost you more than the Scala House. It is unfortunate that no one has cared for this aging building which is so centrally located. It is close to many wonderful eateries and grocery stores and buses and the tube.

In this flat both the dishwasher and de washing machine was brand new. The living room is sizable with a dining table sofa and some chairs. Small TV and ADSL connection (since I didn\u2019t bring a laptop I can\u2019t comment on the ADSL connection). The smallest bedroom is small! There are no room for a suitcase. The largest bedroom is well sized. There are a safe in the closet of the larger bedroom (opened with a key). You\u2019ll find blueprints of the flats on Scala House\u2019s homepage.

There's nothing fancy about the furnishings but the apt. is clean and comfy. If you travel to or from Heathrow, do consider using their limo service. It's reliable and a relative bargain.

For that reason I hesitate to write too positivie a review of the place. I have stayed there three times. Once on business and twice with family. Scala House is great. Iit's excellent in fact, if you do not wish to pay upwards of $1000 for similarly spacious accomodations elsewhere . Scala is not a hotel - repeat: it is NOT a hotel! Seatings for High Tea are not scheduled for three times daily. Scala consists only of two-bedroom apartments with full kitchens and laundry faciities. There is only maid service once a week, if you stay for a week. It is unbelieveably convenient a place from which to explore all of London. It is in a nice, safe neighborhood, where Londoners actually work and live. It is not surrounded by overly touristy shops. It is however within one or two short blocks of excellent restaurantes and supermarkets. Scala's apartments have always been immaculate. They are not air conditioned, true. But, most of northern Europe is not. To blame one's bad experience with Scala House on weather conditions during a London summer, as was done a short time ago on this forum through two seemingly related posts, is quite unfair. One more thing, the staff, particularly Chirs, Omar & J, are top shelf professionals when it comes to meeting the needs of your stay or solving problems that might arise. I doubt the Dorchester has a staff so helpful and polite! I also recommend using the taxi-airport connection that Scala House will arrange for you. I have always been pleasantly suprised by the drivers.

My last stay was in July of this year. I think that it is very unfair to hold Scala House accountable for the unpleasant weather conditions experienced this past July in London. Yes, it was hot. Yes, Scala House was hot. But pretty much every place you went in London including Buckingham Palace was extremely hot. One certainly can not expect Scala House or any reasonably priced accommodations to exceed the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s residence in comfort during these record braking temperatures. I think that would fall into the category of having unreasonable expectations. One of the main reasons that I enjoy Scala House is that it is so quiet in the evenings. My experience in July was that with the windows open there was a bit more noise than usual. But nothing that was way out of line or that lasted all night. Friday nights were the nosiest. This noise seemed to come from the pub on the corner. However, the pub closed at 11pm and the noise ceased shortly after that. Yes, if the windows are open you will hear some traffic from Tottenham Court road. But this is after all a large city of over 8 million. It would be impossible not to hear some traffic noise. Some people have mentioned \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outdated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd furniture as a negative. The furniture at Scala House is maybe not what you would furnish your own home with, but it is solid and certainly comfortable after a long day of sightseeing. Scala House is not the Savoy, but then again they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t claim to be. What it is, is homey and comfortable. I have never found the beds to be uncomfortable. In fact I have never had a poor nights rest due to any discomfort from the beds. If you expect and need the amenities of the Savoy, then my all means make yourself happy and stay there. But if you want something that is homey, comforting, clean, and personable, then Scala House is a wonderful haven amidst all the craziness that is London.", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cScala House less than expectation\u201d", "Author": "Hornet42", "ReviewID": "UR5612986", "Content": "Friends recommended The Scala House very highly as being above the average for London.
