We wanted to take the shuttle but found that it is limited in where it goes. It wouldn't go to Granville Island, which is just across the river. However, it is within walking distance of transit. The rooms are a little small, but I suppose space in downtown Vancouver is pretty pricey. There is a coin laundry, which is handy for those longer trips.

Nice touch! Hotel staff were all very pleasant and friendly. We did find the 2 elevators a bit slow, especially at max busy times. They do have a larger gap under the bedroom entrance door so noise and light travels from the hallway.

The first time was in May 2010 for one night. We had originally picked this hotel based on reviews on trip advisor and we were not disappointed. We stayed 4 nights this time and just returned home. It's Feb and they had a great price for downtown Vancouver ($72/night CAD + tax). When you book online, I like that when you Select a Rate Plan and keep the default \"Show Rates\", that you get results under several rate plans (such as AAA, Senior, Internet Only Rate, etc). My only tip is that since they don't list the prices under every single rate plan they have, is to go through all the options at the beginning of the reservation process. We booked under the 30 Day Advance Purchase plan this time and saved a good chunk of change compared to the Best Available Rate. We were once again upgraded to a room with a king room - very nice. We had booked a room with one queen bed. We used their complimentary bike service this time. They provided a lock and a helmet for each bike. The shuttle service is nice, though you need to book ahead. We had used it last time. There is parking for a fee, either $13 or $14 per day. If you have lunch or dinner at White Spot, let them know you are staying at the hotel and you'll get 15% off your bill. Yaletown Roundhouse Sky train station is the nearest station to the hotel. It's around a 10 min walk between the two and is slightly uphill from the station to the hotel. There is construction next door, currently a big hole. Our room looked over it. They seemed to start work around 8am in the morning on weekdays, but so far the noise isn't too bad. We have family in the city and we'll be back to Vancouver for visits in the future.

Our taxi driver had us there in around 10 minutes - he also mentioned that he'd heard good things about it from other guests too so that bode well for our stay. The building is fairly modern and well presented and that theme continues once inside. The reception team could not have been friendlier or more helpful - quickly welcoming us labelling and then storing our cases and providing both a map and detailed advice about what was where and how much it cost. That enabled us to have an enjoyable day wandering around - we probably covered around 8 miles on foot and took in most of both the downtown and harbour areas. However it must also be said that some of Vancouver is actually best left unseen. There are some very seedy parts indeed - including those around Chinatown - and it is clear that drugs play a major role in this. Returning to the hotel by a different route took us through what was obviously a predominantly gay area - but this was very colourful and certainly not threatening in the way some other parts of the city had been. Having been reunited with our cases we were quickly in the bedroom which was quite large well equipped and functional - although perhaps the lighting could have been a little better. Although the hotel is surrounded by bars and restaurants of all sorts we chose to stay and eat in the restaurant accessed by the side of reception. The service and food was very good indeed - and also offered great value for money considering it was to all intents and purposes part of the hotel. After a very comfortable night - there is some adjacent building work going on but it certainly didn't disturb us - we checked out quite early and therefore didn't have time for breakfast.

(he is allergic to them.. he had two other occurrences, at a hotel a year ago and another time with friends of his that had got a couch off Craigslist that was infested. After seeing the doctor did research on what they look like, etc) so.. he takes all the pillowcases off, etc.. and while we are packing up.. (our bags were never placed on the beds) we find a bug crawling across the white blanket and I took a picture of it. Then he squished it. We drove home at 3:45am even though I was so exhausted. They are telling me that they had the room checked out, and don't have bedbugs.. but perhaps I was the one that brought them in with me. (LOL!!!!) I said, with my son's instant reaction to the bites, we would have known if we had them beforehand. He was only in that bed for 3 hours. According to the head office, the manager would like the chance to talk to me again and 'help me to decipher where the bites came from because they did not happen at their hotel'. So... the bites, and the picture of the bug in the hotel are a figment of my imagination apparently.

Our first trip was to spend a week in Vancouver. We chose this hotel for several reasons. 1, the location is awesome...we went all over the city and were literally 15 minutes or less from everything. Very easy to hop on any form of transit, or even walk. 2, the cost was great. we paid $179 a night, and for being right down town that's pretty amazing. 3, we were told it was a fully wheelchair accessible hotel, including having shower stalls rather than tubs in some rooms where the wheelchair can roll right in and out with no transfers needed. This was a huge thing for us as we had two individuals that required this. 4, adjoining rooms were available, with two queens in each room, which was also very important to us. 5, there was a restaurant attached to the hotel which made getting the group up and meeting for breakfast was very easy and convenient. My travel agent and I spoke directly with one of the managers of the hotel, arranged extremely specific room requirements and assignments, paid in full and were very happy with the process. When we arrived to the hotel it ended up being not quite what we expected. 1. There are no wheelchair accessible showers. Yes, the bathrooms are bigger so that a wheelchair could be in it, if it fit through the door, but you would need to do a full transfer in to the tub. 2. The only adjoining room possibilities are one king, and two doubles. 3, most of the room assignements were incorrect. It took about 3 hours to get it all sorted out and everyone where they were comfortable. There were 14 of us in total, so it was a large group milling around trying to get organized. The people that were working upon our arrival were absolutely amazing at doing everything they could to make us comfortable. they moved rooms around and rearranged and made the adjoining rooms work for us. Then in the room that absolutely needed the wheelchair accessible shower, they were able to provide a bath chair that was fully adjustable. We had to make a few changes, and it took two assistants to do the bath rather than one, but they did what they could. Upon finding out that the beds were too high for the person in the wheelchair to get on,they quickly removed the boxspring to lower it, and stayed almost 2 hours with that family making sure they were completely comfortable with everything. They checked on us at least twice a day, and also gave us vouchers which allowed all of us to have a free breakfast at the adjoining restaurant. Though we were mislead by the person we spoke to, and it wasn't overly pleasant checking in, all of the staff were awesome - very friendly, helpful and warm. The hotel was clean and welcoming and comfortable and we had a great time! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone - they will make sure you are comfortable and happy any way that they can!

Here's an example: The night before we left we arranged with front desk to get a late checkout at 1 pm. When we woke up, we thought we'd better confirm - called the front desk, who didn't know, but said it was okay. Around 11, housekeeping called to inquire when we would be leaving (we told them about our 1 pm late checkout), and at 12.40, the front desk called again, asking when we were leaving as they had heard from housekeeping we'd be gone by noon. We mentioned this to yet another front-desk attendant when we checked out, saying we'd felt like they were hinting for us to get going. She very politely apologized, checked her computer and confirmed the late check-out had been noted there all the time. Bottom line: Go ahead and book, it's still good value for money.

The hotel is located within easy walking distance from both the downtown main attractions and Granville Island. We didn't have a car but friends of ours dropped us off at the hotel one night and we entered the parking lot and couldn't understand the bad reviews about it in previous posts. it was very easy to find and very convenient to park in. the area around the hotel can be seen as a bit dodgy but frankly this is Vancouver dodgy, not new-york dodgy - even the dodgy parts seem clean and harmless... our only two complaints are that (a) the toilets clogged a lot (we had to call the hotel plumper twice in one week) and (b) the elevators are way too slow. We waited 10 minutes on Sunday morning when we were trying to check out and finally after 2 elevators arrived packed with passengers (again in 10 minutes!) we dragged our luggage down the stairs to the lobby.

Now for the no sleep part. We were on thee 7th floor. At first I thought maybe there was a window open. I could hear conversations from the street below, and the traffic noise was deafening at times. I told my wife to be sure to remember to wait for the WALK sign before she got up from bed to go to the washroom at night, or she might get run over by one of the buses I was sure ran right beside the bed.

The concierge/desk-staff and bellman sat there watching us struggle, there was no one else in the lobby, and they eventually yelled at us \"Oh, just kick the wheel and it should straighten out!!\". They couldn't even get off their butts to help us out. I had dinner reservations and understood from the web-site that there was shuttle service available. The concierge explained that there was no shuttle that evening but promised to have cabs waiting for myself and friends to make our dinner reservations on-time. When I arrived in the lobby with my friends there was no cab waiting and when I checked with the front-desk they just shrugged their shoulders and said, 'we called them'. My friends and I ended up in the rain in our party-dresses and high-heels trying to flag one down. Later in the evening I was in the lobby waiting on some friends. I was there not even 10 minutes and I saw at least 5 different men come in separately with hookers (unmistakable) and the front-desk clerk and posted security guard didn't bat not an eye-lash. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for anyone, but especially not families. These 'ladies of the evening' were wearing see-through dresses and no underwear--not something you want your child to see. Also, I forgot my toothbrush, so I called the front-desk requesting one. They said, 'no problem, we'll be right up with it'. Over an hour went by and still no toothbrush so I rang the desk again. They incredibly terse reply was, 'Sorry, we're too busy, you'll have to go without!' And lastly, the girl at the desk who checked me out was a witch!

This hotel tends to get very busy in the morning through around noon time due to the cruise ship passengers. Therefore, if you need to take the free shuttle around this time, you need to make sure to reserve a space. This hotel is located on the South side of downtown Vancouver. There are plenty of night life around the hotel, but we didn't hear any noise. On Saturday night, a few blocks up, the streets were blocked off for pedestrian entertainment. The location is quite convenient, since Vancouver is not that big anyway. From the cruise ship terminal, it took about 5-10 mins taxi ride, that cost about $10.

They did allow us to keep the car in the garage all day at no extra charge whilst we went sightseeing till tea time which was nice of them. They also have a rooftop garden which was good for a few pictures and imagine is nice in summer when it's a bit warmer! The gym was up there too and it looked fine enough to me for a small hotel.

The fitness room and hot tub are up on the Pent House level and offer a great view. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family. The only drawback that it has is there are no balconies...which is a shame when its a beautiful night and you have to go upstairs to sit on the common patio.

After checking us in, with the bar minimum effort we parked the car and headed up to our room, walked in the room, and was blasted with the smell of smoke. It was quite strong and i wanted to change rooms, but felt reluctant to call reception and bother them after a not-so-nice check in. Eventually did, and was asked to come back down to reception to get our new room key. After heading down and picked up or new key, it almost felt like the gentleman (same one that checked us in) didnt believe us, and pointed out that it couldnt smell like smoke as it was a non-smoking hotel, well someone obviously broke that rule! After going into a new room, everything was perfect. Headed out that evening, and when returned was greeted by a different gentleman at reception that was extremely kind and full of smiles.

There were other hotels in the area in the same price range but I was glad we picked this hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. They gave you 2 free bottles of water every day so we didn't have to buy any. There were several eating establishments nearby to choose from - restaurants, diners to a Tim Horton. Only drawback was that it didn't have a pool. The front desk clerks were very helpful. They have a free shuttle that will take you anywhere downtown w/in a 5-10 mile radius one-way. So we used this service to take us to Canada Place. I thought we would have to get a taxi but they said that this is what the shuttle is for. The hotel was 2 blocks away from one of those \"Hop on Hop off\" trolley tour stops. It's also not far from Granville Island where there is a water taxi service to take you there from the mainland.

The primary reason we chose the hotel was because we could use airmiles gift certificates to pay for it. The positives: 1. Location. We were meeting people at a pub on Davie Street for a pre-cruise get-together. We could walk there and back easily. Plus there was lots of shopping (Shoppers, covenience and liquor store) a stone's throw from the hotel. 2. Staff. This hotel has awesome staff. I never caught anyone's names but I probably dealt with about 4 different front desk staff and they were all extremely pleasant and helpful. 3. Downtown Shuttle. Even though it's not on any kind of schedule, the staff goes out of their way to try to get you on this shuttle and get you to where you need to go. Free of charge. A small minus about the shuttle is that it does service a few local hotels so it does get busy. Just book it as soon as you can in the morning and you should be alright. 4. Cleanliness. The room and lobby were immaculate. As it should be. 5. Comfy beds and pillows. Not too hard, not too soft. Negatives: 1. The air con/heating. It was noisy! I'm a light sleeper and was consumed by pre-cruise excitement so it bothered me. My partner on the other hand can sleep through anything so barely noticed it. 2. The light from the hallway shone like a laser through the peephole in the door. See my notes above about sleeping habits. I should have moved the lamp so it blocked it but this, of course, did not occur to me until the morning.

If you like to walk, downtown Vancouver is perfect because I walked all the way from the waterfront back to the hotel and it took about a half hour. Everything in the downtown area is pretty close to the hotel. I even walked back from Stanley Park and that was doable! I wouldn't recommend walking that distance with children though. Also if you go up to the roof of the hotel, you can get a pretty nice view of the downtown. There's a rooftop patio. Service The hotel is kept very clean and although my room was small, it had everything I needed. If you want quiet, ask for a room on the back of the building. I think this type of request is called a \"quiet room\" request. Every day you can request one free 30 minute internet card per room to use the internet in the lobby which was nice. Just ask at the front desk, and in case you're wondering, ther's no printer.

We were told there was a free airport shuttle to bring us back to the airport and that was false, we were told a few other things that actually weren't true once we spoke to the front desk. Another thing to warn you about: SOME CAB DRIVERS ARE DISHONEST. We had to take a van to cab from the airport to the hotel and once we got there the driver told us it was an extra $10 because we took a van. If you find yourself in this situation, do not pay that extra fee, it's a scam and completely untrue.

There is however a complimentary drop-off only car service from the hotel that runs from 7am-7pm each day that will take you closer to downtown if you like. Coming from the airport, the Airporter shuttle bus dropped me off right at the hotel ($21/ return), so for a little more than 10 bucks each way I saved a big part of the $30 or more that a single cab ride would likely have cost. It will pick you up from nearby as well for your return home. Great hotel and I'd definitely stay there again. By the way, there is another Best Western a few blocks further north on Granville if you'd rather not walk as far to get downtown. Just another tip: If you're wanting to go to Whistler for skiing like I did, take the Greyhound bus from the main bus station.

My colleague and I were assigned rooms in the same location on different floors. We both had trouble accessing the (free) wireless internet, so the next day the hotel cheerfully moved each of us to another room on the same floor. The first room I was in was set up for business travellers, with one queen-sized bed; a cordless phone by the bed; and a desk set up for working travellers, with a phone and a conveniently located electrical outlet built into the desk. Unfortunately, that was the room that was in a wireless dead spot. The second room was bigger, with two beds and a kitchenette, but no business amenities. The bathroom in each room was clean and quite adequate. The quality of the towels reflects the budget rates (about $100 a night). There is no business centre at the hotel, but the front desk staff were very helpful and gracious about printing documents for me and doing some photocopying. There is underground parking, and also a free shuttle that guests can use to get away from the somewhat seedy immediate surroundings. And now, for my one major complaint: the only breakfast available in the immediate vicinity of the hotel is at the White Spot that adjoins the hotel. White Spot is a popular western-Canadian chain that serves an awful breakfast -- everything on the menu is bland, greasy and heavy, and there are absolutely no palatable light options. We put up with it on four of the seven days we were there, and each time the food sat in my stomach like a rock. We didn't find any other breakfast spots for blocks around... until our last day. Just on the other side of the bridge, at 2211 Grenville, is a great place called Paul's Place Omelettery.

Vancouver really does deserve its reputation as one of the best places on earth to live. And even if I'm not a typical tourist going to all the typical tourist spots - I still love to come back, relax and wander around town. It's a perfect place just to chill out, and laze about - basically heaven for a slacker mall-rat like myself looking for some quiet down-time away from work. My wife and I previously stayed at many hotels of all price ranges in all parts of Vancouver - but our previous favorite was the Meridien at 910 Beach. In many ways, that was an ideal place for us. Modern, clean rooms with every imaginable amenity for a couple or small family: fully equipped kitchen, laundry, spacious living rooms etc. It is perfectly appropriate to call it a home away from home if you're thinking about a week-long break (like we usually do). We particularly like their townhouse suites - which are outside the hotel 'proper' and even more like staying in your own home. It suits me more in that I feel more like a local Vancouverite and less like a tourist. The reason that we didn't stay there this time was because the Meridien does NOT have air conditioning. Yes, I know Vancouver is not known to be a warm city, but did anybody notice the temperatures here in early July this year rising to over 35 Celsius?! That's Global Warming for you all, folks. Sorry I'm not greener myself - but I do appreciate some air-con in this kind of weather. That's why we looked elsewhere. Our key requirements were: air-con, secure parking, convenient location, cleanliness, and preferably Internet access. I use the Internet when travelling with a small laptop to access all the wonderful online travel guides - so I never need to bring travel books and maps. And I use the hard-drive to store my digital photos. Oh yes, this time we were also travelling with our baby son -- so we definitely needed a kitchen or kitchenette. We needed this so we could clean our son's milk bottles out daily, and prepare pureed food for him. In this regard, the Meridien would have been ideal - but alas, no air-con ... After some internet browsing, we shortlisted a few choices - but the good rate on Expedia clinched it for the Best Western Downtown in our case. We were attracted by the free parking and WiFi access - and the apparently very modern-looking building. We stayed for exactly one week in a King-size bedroom with kitchenette, and made use of the free secured basement carpark. So how was our stay? Let's break it down into categories: 1. ROOMS Great room. Large, comfortable and very clean. This hotel looks and feels modern and new - and I prefer that to quaint, old hotels. The room was large enough that we could open both our large suitcases and park our baby stroller - and still have lots and lots of room to walk around. The carpets, sheets, curatins etc all looked spotless. The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked, and we appreciated the generous supply of towels - even though there was no bathrobe. The bed was huge and generally comfortable - though personally, I would have preferred it to be slightly firmer. The aircon control was a bit confusing (not helped by the really hopeless printed instructions), but once we got the hang of it, it worked flawlessly -- it was quiet and could raise or lower the room temperature quite quickly. Sound-proofing was good. No only did we not hear our neighbors at all, but we felt comfortable that our baby's occasional cry did not disturb anyone either (and that's important, as all parents know). One big tip: do NOT accept a room on the 2nd floor: a sort of wall blocks off all views out of the windows on this floor. We ended up with a 7th floor room facing north. Okay, the views aren't great (tall buildings, traffic), but at least we got some light coming in and making the room fell more airy. 2. AMENITIES There was a top-floor gym & jacuzzi apparently, but we didn't use it this time. We didn't try the restaurant, but as it was just a White Spot (a famous local chain of nice family restuaurants) - as Vancouver 'regulars', we knew exactly what we would have gotten anyway: a reasonably priced, decent family food in a casual friendly setting. Because there is no other actual hotel restaurant, there is no complimentary breakfast here - but hotel breakfasts are not something my wife and I really care for anyway. However, we did make full use of the underground parking. There was ample parking space, and it was great that the elevators could go straight from your room's floor to your car's floor. It was reassuring that the elevators required your room key to access any floor except the lobby - good security. Like many hotel carparks in Vancouver, this one was clean and well-lit. Because we had our own car, we didn't use the shuttle bus that apparently would take you to any part of downtown (which was within walking diatnce anyway). But we did see other hotel guests using it and they seemed pleased with the service. As I mentioned above, I use the WiFi Internet access on my travels. The one at this hotel worked OK - except for a couple of days in the middle of my stay when connection was impossible for some reason. Then a couple of days later, it was back to normal again - strange. We appreciated that a full-sized umbrella was provided in each room (necesary if you know what Pacific Northwest weather is like). There are vending machines on a couple of the floors - which seems ubiquitous in North American hotels these days. And if that's not enough, there's a 7-Eleven across the street. 3. SERVICE The service was OK. One or two of the front desk staff (the male ones) seemed a little aloof, but everyone else was warm and friendly. Check-in was quick and efficient. Liam - one of the young porters - was especially cheerful and helpful, even when it was apparent we would not be tipping hm twice ! When we asked for a baby bed, the staff were again helpful. They had a crib/playpen which they brought up very quickly on our asking. It wasn't quite what we were looking for, and Liam was quick to take it away and bring back a fold-away bed for us to try. This was meant for big kids, not babies - so again it was unsuitable, and again Liam was prompt and cheerful when whisking that away. In the end, we slept with our baby on our bed (it was certainly more than big enough) - and the staff seemed genuinely apologetic that they didn't have exactly what we wanted. 4. LOCATION I noticed quite a few other reviewers commented on the location being a bit dodgy. Let's make it absolutely clear: this is NOT a good neighborhood. The 3-4 blocks on Granville St just north of Granville Bridge is basically the red-light district. You have cheap bars, a few XXX shops, some dubious pawn shops, and a shady-looking liqour store right next door to the hotel. At night, you see a few pan-handlers or one or two prostitutes at the street corner. Of the 7 nights we stayed there, on 2 of those nights, we drove back to find a police car responding to call outs at the next door liqour store. When we told our Vancouver friends where we were staying, their eyes bulged out on hearing \"Granville on Drake\" - they knew how rough that part of town is. However, having said all this, this is still NOT the worst part of town. I would say the Hastings St area just north of Chinatown is at least many times worse than this - and I would seriously, seriously warn any tourists (not only single females) to avoid that area at all times. This is the area where mobs of drug addicts and distinctly mean-looking ruffians lurk. Compared to that part of Hastings, the area around the Best Western Downtown is really quite tame. In fact, we were not troubled at all during our stay. Much of that has to do with our driving everywhere. Because we went straight in and out of the underground parking every day, we basically never had to face anything at street level. And in our room, the sounds from the street simply didn't reach us. With that in mind, the location of the Best Western Downtown is really not bad at all. It is on the south side of the Downtown/West End peninsula, and this provides the best center (in my opinion) for accessing the whole of Greater Vancouver. Driving to Richmond, Burnaby, Coquitlam and so on was simple. Downtown and Chinatown are only minutes away by car. Getting to Stanley Park and North/West Van is also a doddle: from the hotel travel up Seymour, turn left onto Georgia - and that's it. Very convenient. I've stayed at some of the hotels nearer Stanley Park, and the locations of those are not as good. From that end of town, if you want to reach any other part of Vancouver, basically you have to face the notorious traffic jams on Georgia every single time. On the south side of the peninsula (like the Best Western or even the Meridien), you only have to struggle with the Georgia jams when you go to cross the Lion Gate Bridge. 5. WOULD I STAY HERE AGAIN? The Best Western Downtown gave me more or less everything I required. Free secure parking, good air-con system, fully stocked kitchen, free Internet access, clean modern rooms, very convenient location (if driving). Given a good deal , I would not hesitate to recommend this place to a friend or even stay here again myself. But if I were inclined to walk more and drive less, or if the Meridien decided to install some air-con - maybe I would have to think again.", "Date": "July 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pontypridd", "Title": "\u201cGood location and base for sight seeing.\u201d", "Author": "PontypriddMick64", "ReviewID": "UR8207388", "Content": "Stayed at the hotel at the end of June.
