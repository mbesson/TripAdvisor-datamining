We booked 2 rooms, same price, same category. Our room was horrible, in every way, while the other room that was given to our Cousins, was great. We checked in first, and were given the horrible room, while our Cousins checked in a couple of hours later, and were given the suite. I asked upon check in, if we had the same type room and was told we did. Now, I wouldn't wish our room on anybody, and am pleased that our Cousins got the fabulous, large, modern room with a view, but why would the hotel give us, the worst room in the place. Both reservations were booked by me, reserved by me, and paid for by me! I would never stay here again, because there is no guarantee on where or what kind of room you would get, plus they will tell you they are all booked and don't have another room to give you. Of course, if I had been given the upgraded suite, with modern touches, and a comfortable bed, I would be giving this hotel an entirely different review.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plovdiv", "Title": "\u201cPleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "VanesaPlovdiv", "ReviewID": "UR127202418", "Content": "Compared to 4star hotels I stayed at in different European capitals,Konak hotel was a pleasant surprise.Good sleep quality, very clean,nice decoration, perfect location,very satisfactory breakfast", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "dubai", "Title": "\u201cgreat little hotel\u201d", "Author": "alfi-in-dxb", "ReviewID": "UR125010815", "Content": "Great hotel, location was ideal & not a far walk from Taksim Square.

We chose the Konak Hotel because of its proximity to the Istanbul Conference Center, and because of the good reviews here on tripadvisor. I'm very happy to write that we were not disappointed. We arrived at Ataturk airport near midnight, so it was very helpful that the hotel sent a driver for our pickup. We found the superior double room we reserved to be very clean, which is very important to us, and also surprisingly large. We asked in advance for a quiet room on a high floor, and got one on the top seventh floor. It wasn't facing the street, so it was indeed very quiet (though not much of a view from our window... but we prefer no-view and no-noise!). The staff was nice and helpful throughout our stay. The breakfast was nice and tasty with fresh pastries, though we must write that its general variety wasn't large. The location was perfect for us - if you come to Istanbul for a conference, this is the closest hotel to the Istanbul main conference center apart from the Hilton. It is also very close to Taksim Square, which is the main public transportation hub for Istanbul (and also the terminal for the airport shuttle buses, which we used for our trip back to the airport). Apart from business, a trip should of course include at least a little pleasure, and as the hotel is a short walk away from Istiklal street, the main shopping and nightlife street of the city, we had plenty of that as well. We found the Konak Hotel to be be very nice, welcoming, clean, quiet and well situated for our needs. We recommend it whether you intend to visit Istanbul for a conference, for business or for pleasure. Should we come to Istanbul again, we'll be sure to stay there.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California/Norway", "Title": "\u201cCost effective boutique hotel well worth a stay\u201d", "Author": "eggestad", "ReviewID": "UR120698946", "Content": "This boutique hotel is well worth it, and conveniently located in the Taksim area of Istanbul.
