We stayed in the adjoining building. Our room was very clean, warm and cozy. The service at the front desk, TART restaurant staff and cleaning staff was very nice and friendly. The place is right across the street from the Grove and the Farmers Market, two great places to take a leisurely stroll, eat and people watch. However, even with those places close by, it's a pretty quiet hotel despite the traffic noise.The place is a renovated motel that is very clean and bright. As with older hotels and any places near busy streets, there is going to be some noise. If you are used to living in an apartment building in a busy city, you probably can adapt to it. Sometimes the traffic noise sounded more like calming ocean waves so it wasn't that much of a problem. My tip is to bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Other than that, there is nothing to complain about this place. If you are looking for luxury go to another hotel, but if you want a place that provides the basic essentials and is clean and has NO BEDBUGS (which is my #1 concern), you will have no problems staying here!

We were attending the 2011 Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival at the near by, New Beverly Cinema and wanted to stay in the area at a boutique hotel. We were not disappointed. The Farmer's Daughter Hotel appears to have been designed as a quintessential \"motor court\" in the 50's or 60's. It has been redesigned and they have done an amazing job of working with in the constraints of the original structure. We stayed in room 101, located in a quiet corner of the property. I don't know what the other rooms look like so this is unique to 101. The room is decorated with copper counter tops and accents throughout the room and includes a subtle continuation of the farm theme in the bedding and wall mural. The bedding was very comfortable. The faucet was style like an old fashioned sink pump. The shower was simple but included an adjustable rain style head and there was plenty of hot water. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. They made every attempt to accommodate us as we dealt with the logistics of visitors. They helped us find a great place to eat - \"Animal\" - just up the street. It didn't matter if it was midnight or 8 am, there was always a smile and helpful attitude.

It is, like many similar boutique hotels in other cities (Ace, Clarendon, Rumor, etc), a property that was previously less reputable and not constructed as a modern hotel, but which has been retrofitted and renovated in order to serve a class of customers who don't mind trading off some big hotel amenities in order to get a more interesting and distinctive hotel experience. Like these similar boutique hotels, Farmer's Daughter can't entirely hide its flaws beneath good design, but overall the experience usually outweighs the drawbacks. There are two very appealing aspects of the Farmer's Daughter. One is its concept and branding. The entire place is decorated using a farmhouse theme. Think lots of yellow and blue, including plaid/gingham curtains, denim bedspreads, imitation whitewashed plank flooring, large beds, and lots of whimsical paintings of animals and farm life decorating the rooms. There are, of course, many of the usual expected amenities, from flat screen TVs with cable to in-room safes and refrigerators, to an in-house restaurant (TART) that also provides room service. All of these are coordinated with the Farmer's Daughter iconic imagery. You can even buy the official t-shirt (\"Do It At The Daughter\") at the front desk. But you can also get free cookies and lemonade at the front desk, so it's not just a gift shop. The second appealing aspect of the Farmer's Daughter is its location right in the middle of everything interesting in West Hollywood. If you're trying to get on a CBS game show, the studio is across the street. LACMA and the Petersen Automotive Museum are very close. So is the farmer's market, and a variety of local eateries, some of which are famous (Canter's 24-hour deli). You can see the Hollywood sign from the sidewalk, and you can reach most places from Beverly Hills to Pasadena in a reasonable amount of time by car. Of course, parking stinks. So if you're driving into the Farmer's Daughter, either take advantage of the valet parking (currently about $18/day), or get familiar with the neighborhood and try to find street parking (but beware of street-sweeping exclusions!). Given these two appealing aspects of the Farmer's Daughter, there are probably good reasons to overlook some of its less appealing elements. But not everyone will be able to do this, so I should point out two things that might eliminate the Farmer's Daughter as an option for your next trip. One is that, like every other retrofitted boutique hotel I've ever stayed in, the Farmer's Daughter is loud. Part of this is that LA is loud, especially with traffic noise and external construction. But a big part of it is basically that Farmer's Daughter has thin walls and a lot of activity that causes noise, whether it is A/C units kicking on and off, cleaning machines powering up, or construction noise (e.g. jackhammers in the pool at 9am). It is sometimes difficult to sleep through the night, and light sleepers will not enjoy their Farmer's Daughter experience. The main building is quieter, but this is relative. It is never actually quiet. The other thing that might put off travelers is that the overall condition of the property feels less well-maintained and polished than a large hotel. You're not always sure that the toilet will work (though it does), and large parts of the bathroom seem to be held together with paint. I did not have any problems with maintenance issues, and everything worked completely fine. However, if you are expecting the same level of fit and finish as the W or Four Seasons, you may find the Farmer's Daughter a bit shabby. Ultimately the good far outweighs the bad at Farmer's Daughter, and if you are looking for a charming and unique boutique hotel in a great location, this is about as good as it gets. Light sleepers should look elsewhere, and you shouldn't expect that the physical property will be as perfect as the branding and identity materials. But if you want to remember your stay in Los Angeles, check it out. You'll probably be glad that you did.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBest location in LA.

The exterior is tasteful, warm and inviting. The valet was friendly and prompt. We pulled our bags and were off to the front desk. Check-in was courteous and pleasant, all was well. Our room was a short walk from the lobby upstairs. The room was close to the street, in the same building as the lobby, and there was noise but no big deal. The room was clean but something just didn\u2019t feel right. The room wasn\u2019t bad but it was not good either. Of note, our mattress was worn and VERY unsupportive. As we changed to walk across the street to the Grove, a housekeeping person opened the door and walked in. No knock, no announcement, just WALKED right in. She quickly apologized and literally sprinted off, but seriously? Farmers Daughter is across the street from the Grove, which is a plus. We had breakfast Sunday morning at the restaurant onsite. The food is good, ambience warm and friendly, and overall the restaurant area is well done with plenty of umbrella\u2019s and shaded tables to enjoy your meal under the Southern California sun. Overall it is nice, though the service was average. On Sunday morning, housekeeping called us at 10:40AM supposedly for no reason. At 11:30am housekeeping knocked on our door asking if we were checking out. I said yes, and confirmed checkout was noon. The housekeeping person seemed to be pressing us to be out more quickly, like, RIGHT NOW. Three interruptions from housekeeping in less than 24 hours is three too many in my book. Our room was on the outside. The rooms facing into the center of the property are probably a better experience as the inner ambience is warm and inviting while the GNC sign in our window was not. As I looked around during breakfast, the inner part of the hotel was quite nice and I could imagine probably a good experience. Ultimately, the housekeeping interruptions, and at checkout a general lack of concern with guest satisfaction, combined for a will not return. The Valet provided the best service experience at this property and is excluded from the poor service rating.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria", "Title": "\u201cPro's and Con's\u201d", "Author": "BCMck", "ReviewID": "UR119274481", "Content": "We stayed here for our first 3 nights in LA in September 2011.

The rooms themsleves are quite large and in a funky (interesting) decor and were very clean. The thing we liked most about this hotel is its location - directly across from the Farmers market and The Grove shopping strip which in my opinion is one of the best shopping areas in LA. It also meant we could walk over there for lunch, late night dinner and cheesecake and take in a late night movie without having to get a cab home.

It was great being near Target and Kmart so we could buy extra suitcases and stock up on all the basic items that are $$ in Australia.

Our room (a Suite, #300) was nice size and included a fridge, stove top, and plenty of nice glassware. It was everything we needed in a room.

Location: It was a short fare of about $15.00 to go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The reason on why you would stay here is to attend a taping of The Price is Right. It is located right across the street. It is right across from the Farmers Market. (I had a good breakfast at Du-Pars) The Price is Right Seminar: The hotel provides a seminar hosted by Ted in the lobby. It starts around 10:30. It is quite informative on what to expect. He has a lot of knowledge. Even if you are a friend and true of The Price is Right, you will enjoy this. Other: The Staff went out of there way to make your stay more enjoyable. They printed my boarding pass when the lobby computer had trouble. Also they store your luggage when your across the street at The Price is Right. No problem calling a cab for you as well. Overall: The hotel is in a great location for The Price is Right. I did find it on the expensive side of $189 for the night. It was worth it just for the location alone. The room was clean overall, and friendly staff. I wouldn't hesitate to stay hear again.

The hundred blocks jump around, but look for the TART sign glowing pink, that is the hotels restaurant. We valet parked and headed to check in. We were going to a concert a few hours later and let the valet know so he parked it up front for easy access when we left! (very nice!) The lady at the counter was great. She was knowledgable of the area and pretended to care about our vacation! We made it up to our room on the top floor (3rd floor) of the main bldg. which was suppose to be a bit noisier then the \"barn\" rooms because it was attached to the lobby however we had no noise complaints at all and for a friday night that is saying alot! Before our concert we ate at the hotel restaurant TART. We were greeted and seated right away. It is a tight squeeze inside but nice and there is outside seating in a private area between the hotel lobby and the restaurant doors. The staff was very pleasant with great customer service skills. Many people were working in order to keep everyone happy on a busy friday night! OK, this is where the mostly good service comes in... We were out until about 2am, after the concert we ate at a great little 24 hr restaurant/deli not too far from the hotel. On the way back to the hotel I called to make sure valet was still aval and of course it was 24hrs but was told to come to the lobby because the valet was also security at this time. We tried to use our room key to open the doors that connect the parking area to the lobby and they had bolt locked it. So we had to walk around front (which even though it is an ok neighborhood I would rather not do at 2am anywhere) it was a bit frustrating. Then when we got to the lobby the staff was very unpleasant (the lady working the desk and the security/valet) They were rude and some what bothered by us disturbing their naps (?) We then gave him our key and started to our room. We heard him rev the engine a few times in the process and squeal. We were able to view him parking the vehicle however and satisfied that he didn't hit anything along the way we decided to go to bed. There were plenty of comfy pillows and the bed was very comfortable too. The room was very cute and a good size.

I had one of the most unpleasant experiences that I have ever had in staying hotels anywhere around the world. On the whole the service was good. But in one day the manager - who seems to respond to posts on here - was able to destroy all of that good will. Having taken one payment off my card successfully, the manager wanted to immediately authorise a future transaction in advance but the card declined it - presumably as I was abroad (I had informed the bank) and the fact that the same place was running a second amount through within seconds. I reiterate, the first payment for several days stay WENT THROUGH NO PROBS. The manager didn't try to be helpful or understanding. Instead he was aggressive and deeply rude from the moment he first spoke to me. If I didn't have a thicker skin it would have been very embarrassing, as there were other people in the foyer. He said he would lock the room and wouldn't let me back in until I had a valid card (said cards were in my room and I couldn't call the bank as it was 1am in the UK). I wanted to get back into the room to use another card or my internet banking - he said he would only allow that if he came with me and sat with me whilst I accessed my account. As a professional person traveling with work I was made to feel like a child. I should add that I was staying for another week at this point. Once we managed to sort it, he asked if he could buy us a drink. Really quite a strange way to run a hotel - I didn't want a drink, just some common courtesy and politeness that should be run of the mill to a hotel guest. As this was going on we saw the same manager interact with another guest who had merely come to ask for a street map. And he was equally unpleasant and unhelpful in his dealing with this man, who in the end said 'You know what, forget it, I'll sort it out myself'. The final thing that really upset me with this hotel was the tiny bird cage in the foyer that housed two budgies. I really am no EcoWarrior type, but if there's something that upsets me it's seeing birds in a cage. Now that's my beef and it might not bother you. But what did concern me though was that one of the poor birds had a very long beak that had overgrown, it was clearly in distress - its partner was having to feed it. For God's sake, ignore my comments about the management but please take your sick bird to the vet! Regarding the rest of the place, it's a great location. The rest of the staff, bar one other, were really friendly. The manager should take lessons from the two girls on the desk. Tart serves some good fodder. BUT it is definitely overpriced. As other people say, the decor is tired. I can see what they're trying to achieve, but rather than being a pastiche design finished to a high standard, it's a redecorate done on the cheap with a marketing spin on the skimped finish. On a point of principal I wouldn't stay here. But also from an objective perspective I still wouldn't stay here - there are better boutique hotels in this price range.

The room has a small kitchen (no microwave) but they do have a small stove for heating (Farmers style), it also has a fridge. The bath was spacious and the water and bath products were excellent. The only thing to note will be that the Air conditioner was located on the main room and it took a while to cool the bedroom, but once it was cooled it was fine. Also with kids in the next room, you really have no privacy because the master room does not have a door lock and if you close the door you loose the AC. And the only two recommendation I can make to the hotel is to get better pillows, for me it makes a huge difference on a good night sleep, and the pillows were the only thing I can nip pick out of a great stay experience and the second one is to heat the pool.

The bathroom was nice and clean with a cool rain shower head. The bedroom was pretty small with a very comfortable king bed (that I think had one of the memory foam mattress topper on it). We had a great night's sleep. Both rooms had large flat screen TVs and the one in the common room also had a DVD player that we used and looked great. Just outside of our room (#200) there was a cool open air patio area with some nice outdoor furniture and a coffee table. It's a nice place to relax at the end of the day.

When I needed to meet with some clients in the hotel, the hotel would not let us meet in their courtyard or lobby.

If the primary focus of your trip is any of these neighborhoods, you couldn't design a better location.

The decor leans heavily on the \"farm\" theme, which I like, but some people might find less than luxurious. For example, the floors are hardwood rather than carpeted. I prefer it, since the hardwood tends to be cleaner and more hygeinic, but for anyone who is looking for a more luxurious experience, he/she will be disappointed. For the price, this hotel is a great bargain. I also took advantage of the all-in-one deal (parking, breakfast and room rate). The breakfast is from Tart, the adjacent restaurant, which is excellent.

We were going to the taping of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson across the street at CBS, so if nothing else, this hotel is convenient for that. It was just the one night stay and we had been at the Disneyland Hotel for the 3 nights prior, so I knew we would be arriving there early and requested that since I needed to be at CBS before 3:30 pm, would they please block a room for me if one becomes available by noon and the front desk graciously gave me a room ready to check into at 1:30 pm.

The parking valet was very helpful when we arrived, even helped us with luggage and the front desk clerk was smiling and welcoming and of course, accommodating with that early check in.

Last time I was there, I was on the phone with tech help for 1/2 hour before I was finally connected, but when I got home, from all their reconfigurations, I couldn't connect to my home network.

Our free breakfast at TART was better than I expected, my husband had strawberry pancakes that looked fantastic and I had French Toast, which was delicious. Service was great.

I asked at the front desk, they said they don't do that (they knew it was our honeymoon), they told me to go to the bottle store across the street (kinda defeats the point).

Firstly, the Farmer's Suite is located right next to the elevator, so that people waiting to go up or down are waiting/talking/laughing/shouting right outside the front door of your room. Second, I echo the concern about no hand soap. Yes, there is a shower bar of soap, but nothing for the hands. The sink area was a little small. Third, there are no blackout shades in the room. I am not a heavy sleeper, and so I was awakened at 7:00 each morning by the sunshine. A nice touch if you want it, but I had fully intended to get some serious rest on this trip and the brightness of the room made that impossible. Fourth, the comfy couch that is advertised is anything but. It is small, with one large pillow, not at head level, and no armrests or throw pillows. It was very uncomfortable to watch TV on (at 7 AM after being awakened). Fifth, the TV and movie selection was quite subpar, and with great plasma TV's, one might expect a little better programming.

This is a converted Motel on a very busy street in Los Angeles but the location makes it a desirable location for contestants on \"The Price is Right\" as well as visitors who like the proximity to the Grove and Farmer's Market across Fairfax Avenue. There is a good deal of street noise and a busy alley behind the main building faces an auto repair shop that gets banging pretty early. Trash removal by a dumpster service also makes a racket at dawn a few days a week. We always pack ear plugs. Because there are communal areas on the ground floor pool patio and an open air second floor furnished lounge, it is best to request a room away from the action as people meet to chat and smoke and drink into the wee hours. Contestant meetings for the game shows are also held in the lobby in the evenings which makes it rather awkward to use the computer or congregate if you're not on a show. When we visited last year, the room rate was a little more than $100 a night and parking charges had been upped to $10 a night (mandatory valet parking is the only option). Use of wired internet was free in the room and the hotel offered no food service save a coffee pot en suite and a small fridge for anything you might bring to your room. This year, much to our dismay, the rates on the hotel website were closer to $200 a night. After shopping around awhile on the web, we found a $139 weeknight/$149 weekend rate and booked using expedia.com - a service requiring full payment for the entire stay in advance (yikes!). Upon arriving at the motel, we were impressed to see their new restaurant TART had opened and seemed busy with trendy Angelinos. Perhaps because there is increased traffic at the cafe, parking rates were hiked to $12 plus tax/tip and the small valet stand is very busy. Cars were backed up in front and into the driveway which made check in a little difficult. The desk had trouble locating our reservation and we feared there was a miscommunication with the prepaid discount rate or the booking site. The desk staff are always very pleasant and helpful and they worked it out. Once we got to our room, it was pretty much \"Same Time Next Year.\" Nothing changes year in and out in the rooms, but towels, rugs and furniture are definitely showing signs of wear and tear. The bathrooms are original to the motel and have gotten a little dingier with time. Our shower head was damaged and sprayed the entire bathroom each time we used it... These inconveniences are all minor when one is paying around $100 a night, but to be fair - this is not the quality of a $200 hotel room in Los Angeles. Times change and prices rise, but there is stiff competition for moderate hotels in the area and the Farmer's Daughter needs to update their facilities if they expect return guests. Free internet is gone as well. We logged on the first morning and found the service is $10 additional a day. There is a terminal available in the lobby for the same day rate or $4 an hour. We used a small safe in the room to stash valuables. We have never had a problem with articles left in our room. Our stay was just under a week's time in mid-July 2006. Housekeeping came in daily to change the well worn towels and make the bed, but did not change the linens. 2 small blue area rugs on the linoleum floor were never cleaned nor replaced. They were a little dusty all along. Chair cushions and slip covers were spotted and worn and the walls could have used a fresh coat of paint. To be fair, the Farmer's Daughter is quaint and funky and located in the midst of lots of shops, cafes, and the superTrendy Grove Mall. It is easy to walk around to pick up a quick meal at the Farmer's Market, to run to the drug store, or to check out the nearby shops and museums. Be aware that there is an active homeless population on Fairfax and walking alone late at night can be a little daunting. We have always enjoyed the Farmer's Daughter over the years but feel like the facilities could be spruced up as the rates are quickly increasing.

We were told no problem. A month after our reservation, we received a call from the hotel Manager saying an error had occurred and our rooms were not as we requested but that instead we would be upgraded at no additional charge.

We loved the decor, the copper lampshades, the amazing copper table and bar, the no carpet floors, the comfortable bed and shower. Our room was a good size and for being on such a busy street it was very quiet! We had the a/c running all night, so if there was any noise, that may have blocked it out. We walked to the farmer's market across the street, where you can find any kind of food for a very reasonable price. We took the advice of one of the reviewers and had brunch at the crepe place. My huge crepe of ham, mushrooms and cheese sauce was delicious and served with a green salad. They also serve sweet crepes with fresh fruit and toppings. One night we had dinner at the outdoor French restaurant, near the gourmet market, at the rear of the farmer's market. They serve 40 wines by the glass. Excellent food and wine! You can sample food from all over the world here, and the prices are amazing. Next door to the farmer's market is the Grove shopping mall, where which has upscale shops, restaurants, movie theatres, and dancing fountains similar to the Bellagio in Vegas. One day we went to the La Brea Tar Pits. Don't miss it! The LA County Museum of Art and the Peterson Auto Museum are also a couple of blocks away. Our reservations for the Farmer's Daughter were made online via the hotel web site. If you stay 3 nights the 3rd night is discounted. We found this to be a better price than the web daily price. The hotel has a restaurant that looks nice, but with the farmer's market across the street, we didn't try it. If you drive, you must use the valet parking for $12 per day plus tax, which makes it over $13 per day, plus tip to the valet. Add that into your price per room. If you want to use your laptop, the price for that is around $10 per 24 hours plus tax. This service isn't provided by the hotel, but by the cable company. With the extra add on of parking and internet fees, we still found this to be a reasonable hotel, with charm, and a friendly, helpful staff.

For the price, it is a great find. It's a cute, boutique-y hotel. The rooms are clean and very cute (the pictures online don't really do it justice). We booked our room via the hotel's web site directly. From the reviews online and the owners blog, it looks like that is probably the best way to book this hotel. We didn't have any problems and got the lowest price I could find by going direct. Many people seemed to have issues with the parking, but honestly ... EVERYWHERE in LA is valet parking. It's part of the culture there, and probably much more practical for the hotel. It was the cheapest valet parking anywhere around. Not much to really complain about there. And, the valet guys were great. The only downside is that check in was a 4 pm and we arrived very early. Luckily, we had somewhere to go, but some of the other guests were put out. Most places have an earlier check in or will let you check in sooner. We even let them know when we booked that we were arriving early and would appreciate getting checked in early and they still wouldn't let us in earlier than 3 pm. Another minor annoyance was that although it was a non-smoking room, the room smelled terribly of stale smoke.

Check in was easy, the location is fantastic (we had meetings all over LA and it was central to everything), parking was reasonable ($10 a day with in&out), and the staff was nice. The kitschy theme of the hotel is fun and one they're really committed to -- I felt like we were in the next to-be-discovered hot spot in LA. One fascinating quirk of the hotel is Ted, front desk clerk and in-house \"The Price is Right!\" specialist. If you're around some night at 10:25 p.m., DO NOT MISS his treatise on how to get on TPIR as a contestant. It is a hoot. And it works! The show films at the CBS studios right across the street, so it's a convenient tourist activity for folks at the FD. I suspect they will soon have pilgrimages of people desperate to be contestants who will stay here... There are dozens of pictures in this lobby shrine of all the contestants who have won stuff on it, with his tutelage of course. I might have not believed it, except when we were checking in, a girl was on the phone in the open air lobby (very cool!) telling her mom that she'd just won $7000! Funny, and sweet. The open air lobby was really cool and aesthetically appealing & the pool looked clean and inviting, but it was cool during our visit and not really swimming or hanging outside kind of weather. The only drawbacks to our visit -- and these were minor inconveniences -- were that the free Wifi signal was very weak and spotty in the room, we had better luck in the outdoor seating areas (but as I mentioned, it was kind of chilly). They had a total shut down one day, so perhaps they were working on the system. Also, there was construction happening for a (needed) bar/restaurant on the premises. The banging was kind of a drag, but never before 9 a.m. and we weren't in the room much anyway. Having a restaurant right there would be a perfect addition to this funky cool spot. And the Farmer's Market across the street (and The Grove shopping complex) was just fantastic. We walked over for a number of meals and had great inexpensive food every time. (Oh -- except one morning we went to Cantor's, a 24 hour legendary deli a few blocks north -- an experience, to be sure, but not one I'd ever repeat. Try the Kokomo? Cafe on the South end of the Farmer's Market. KILLER Pancakes and great southern inspired dishes.) Another terrific place is the \"Authentic Cafe\" on Curson & Fairfax, 1/2 block north and a few blocks west of the hotel...this was a FANTASTIC dinner of south american cuisine -- herbed chicken with rice & beans and plantains, etc -- gorgeous food for a good price, about $60 with wine and tip.

I'm not one to be picky about beds, but the mattress was incredibly HARD, like it was the cheapest one they could find. The yellow wooden lattice that serves as a \"headboard\" of sorts behind the bed had a homemade look to it, was in need of sanding and had a couple nails sticking out of it. The floor has no carpet, just some kind of synthetic \"wood\" vinyl flooring, which made the room lack warmth. The TV, stereo are cheap brands, not fancy like the shiny brochure and webpage would lead you to believe. And the refrigerator looked like they got it from a garage sale. Bottom line, the hotel, though it looks posh from the street and from the lobby, is posh by no means.

That was especially true once the three of us moved from a room with two (small) double beds to a room with a king and a rollaway. The hotel refused to put a rollaway in the room with the two double beds, arguing--probably correctly--that there wasn't enough room. I liked the decor, I don't think it did much for my wife or daughter, though my wife noted the cleanliness value of hardwood floors. The bathrooms were very minimal, a tight flourescent lit space with a toilet and bathtub, though the sinks with their \"waterfall\" faucets were outside the bathroom. There were two main clerks on duty during our 3 days there--one was fine, the other seemed to come from Slacker Central Casting. Darkness at night--good. The soundproofing was so so, especially when we moved to the larger room closer to Fairfax Ave., but we ran the fan on the heating system and that drowned out traffic. The bed comfort was good, though the rollaway was a bit too springy. My wife was unhappy that the first room had only one chair--the second room had a chair and a rather steeply canted rocking chair. The location is good. The Farmers Market is right across the street and has a bunch of places to both buy fresh food and some very good stands selling prepared food--restaurant level places. You can walk to some other places in the Fairfax, such as the enormous LA County Museum.
