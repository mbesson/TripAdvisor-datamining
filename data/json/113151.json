If you are looking for ultra modern and over-sized rooms, try someplace else. We stayed in an Ocean Front over looking the boardwalk. Good location, good view, nice room. The room has 2 smallish double beds and a double couch that opens. We were only 2 people so the room was of adequate size (although we slept in different beds as it was more comfortable that way). The room sleeps 6 but I would not try that with 6 adults and lots of luggage. The full sized refrigerator was nice to have as was the Microwave and counter top, good for bringing in take-out and breakfast but not for cooking. The hotel was not full and the service was good. We had an issue with a noisy AC unit and they sent someone to fix it quickly. All of the staff always was friendly and said hello when we encountered them. The Outdoor pool was nice and clean. We did not use the restaurant (Breakfast) or the pool bar/grill. We passed by the small indoor pool, again it looked clean but it is small. Parking was onsite but, they also have off site when the hotel is busy. We did not have any issues parking. It is a little pricy but it was in high season and we wanted a ocean front room.

I booked the Commander hotel for four nights. After reading the reviews and speaking with a friend who had recently stayed there who told me that her experience at the Commander was awful, I decided to cancel and stay somewhere else. I called to cancel and was told I would get a refund all but one night stay. Okay I understand this is policy and I was canceling six days before my scheduled date, so we decided to spend one night at the commander so we didn't lose any money. One extra night in Ocean City sounded great!!! I also wanted to see for myself if this hotel was as bad as its reputation. We had to check out of our hotel at 10:00 am. We could not check into the Commander until 3:00 pm. Understood we have some time to kill and we were hoping that maybe we could check in a little early because we have two small children.(I guess it was wrong of me to expect them to be a little hospitable) Alright we spend all day killing time, I called the commander around 1:30 to see if maybe our room might be ready. No Luck, but the kind lady at the front desk said we can park (three blocks away across a busy highway) and use the pool. Alright we will make the best of it, we parked got the kids dressed and hung out at the pool. 3:00 came and by this time we just want to go to our room, lay the kids down for a nap and relax. No our room is not ready yet. We were told by the kind lady at the desk that the most rooms are clean they were just waiting for them to be inspected but that have no clue how long it will be..... I was in the same boat as the other 25-30 people waiting in the lobby. I was a little disappointed but hey what can you do. Okay a half hour goes by and the nice lady at the front desk is replaced by a mean, unsympathetic older lady. I was told by other guest she was the manager, if that was true I can't imagine who would hire her as a manager she was rude and just downright unpleasant. So now forty-five minutes go by and rooms are starting to become available. A older gentleman just walks in cuts everyone off who have been waiting goes right up to the counter and says he booked five rooms and would like to be checked in. I bet your thinking she told him as soon as she gets to all the others who have been waiting, Nope she checks him in while everyone else is still waiting. In the meanwhile a guest came own and said they have been waiting quite a while for service, another employee at the desk tells him they know he needs service but 73 guest checked out today and they will get to him when they can. HELLO your a hotel, you know in advance how may people are checking in and out you should be prepared!!! Twenty five minutes later still waiting, the man with the five rooms is still at desk and his family keeps rolling in and going off to their rooms. The man is still checking in when his family members are now coming back down heading strait up to the counter, their keys were not working...... I had enough, I walked up to the desk kindly asked to cancel my room and for a refund. I didn't know if my room was ready yet or not, at this point I didn't care. The so called manager didn't say one word to me. Just grabbed my card out of my hand, I told her my name and she processed the refund and handed it back to me. No apology, No is there anything we can do to make this better, Nothing, not a word. I wish I cold give a review about the accommodation of this hotel, I wish I got to see more of this hotel but all I got to see was the lobby and the pool which looked nice.

I love this place. We've stayed here for 12 years and have never had problems except for little things. And as soon as we call the front desk, it has been taken care of. We almost always have a Captains Suite, but also have stayed in one of the oceanfront rooms and it was just as nice. I also have a sensitivity to chemicals, so the housekeeping staff is well informed not to use the cleaning solutions in my room during my stay. The reservation people, (probably Pat!) makes sure they know. The only problem I have are when people who smoke don't follow the No Smoking rules (even on the balconies). Why is it that Smokers come to a non-smoking hotel? There are plenty of hotels that allow smoking, so why do they insist on smoking so that I can't open my windows, or sit on the balcony and enjoy the view/Ocean sound that I am paying for? That is taken care of too, when I call the front, they are quick with a gentle reminder of the non-smoking, or they will have a $500 fine. We visited the SkipJack bar this visit and Bunky is a great, personable bartender. He makes real drinks, not something from a mix. And can answer any question you may have. Don't be put off by some of the bad reviews here. If you come and have a room that's not up to what you expected, then ask for another one.

The hotel staff were able to refund our nights we did not use, and the check-in and general service experience was great. The hotel needs to have a facelift soon \u2013 just wear and tear over the years.

We also had breakfasts and lunches on that balcony, relaxed after getting our toddler to sleep, and the view is excellent. We always try to stay in the Captain\u2019s Suite for the reason of more space. The sofa opens to a nice size bed, which was used by our toddler. BUT the main bed NEEDS to be King size. It is just small for the suit and expectations. It would fit in the bedroom area, even if we have to \u201cfront-load\u201d into it. But really, it should be king, not queen.

All personal items have to spread out into the rest of the room, and you look for them daily. And the lack of hand/bath soaps is a \u201cdown\u201d. There is a dispencer for shampoo/bodywash in the tub, but that is kind of odd, and we found one little soap on the counter. Remembering this from before, we brought our own soap. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal. The hotel should provide some soaps and other things (stationary for example) for a room, especially their top-level room. The kitchen area is great \u2013 big fridge, microwave oven, toaster, some forks&plates and such, corkscrew. No dishwasher, I washed some, and left some \u2013 the maid (VERY GOOD at taking care of us) did get them. But the kitchenette is very useful, especially for long stays like ours. The view \u2013 fantastic! The restaurant downstairs is okay for one breakfast, but we are not very thrilled with it. Service is excellent though. Also, it\u2019s only open for breakfast, and then \u2013 drinks in the evening, which is kind of weird. Location of the hotel is perfect. Feet away from the beach, and in the middle of the great OC 2.25 mile long boardwalk. Which is just perfect \u2013 not too close to the carnival area, which gets quite loud and messy at busy weekend nights, and not too far for a stroll to down there. There is a pool, but we never used it. Parking is available around the hotel. We were lucky to always find a spot right next to the entrance, but in busier season I am guessing it is tougher. So altogether \u2013 I recommend staying here, and it is a better value (I think) than some of the nearby places. However, there are some quirks we keep noticing every time, and the hotel definitely will need some updating very soon.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cCaptain's Suite was amazing!\u201d", "Author": "Mark Y", "ReviewID": "UR117630735", "Content": "I had a great time staying with my Fiance at the Commander.

We did not eat at the SkipJack Grille. We asked for towels each day from the housekeeper and she was very nice about exchanging them. The Commander is right between 2 great restaurants--to the left is DaVinci's--very good Italian food--and great sandwiches at lunchtime--and to the right is Phillips by the Sea--it was great sitting right by the window--broiled seafood combination was tasty. We also ate at the Harrison Harbor Watch at end of boardwalk overlooking the inlet--it was very deliciious--about a 45 minute walk to the restaurant from the Commander. We also enjoyed Kohr's softserve (tastier than Dumser's for sure)--rented a surrey bike and biked up the boards to a java cafe near 24th I believe and our son enjoyed a Krispy creme donut for breakfast. We also played a lot of carnival games, visited the Kite loft, went into Marty's Playland and the Funcade Casino where you can play skeeball and other games which give you tickets to exchange for different stuff (what child doesn't enjoy this...?!). The hotel outdoor pool was very nice with a zero entry and it was clean. The indoor pool was a little green looking and it was too humid inside. The only complaint was the oceanfront suite view--we were on the second floor right over the roof for the skipjack grille and that did obstruct our view so I would strongly recommend that you ask for a higher floor away from the skipjack grille roof! We now know that you need to ask for this when you make your reservation. It was too late when we checked in--as they were sold out. We walked everywhere and only took the tram once when it was lightening and thundering just to take us to a dry place. On the boardwalk at night, there were several street performers (people who looked like statues, performed magic and comedy and music) We brought breakfast food and used the fridge, toaster and coffee pot which was very convenient.

The balcony was large with hanging racks for towels. The bed was extremely comfortable and I slept great! We had queen sized beds which is a big plus. We stayed on the 2nd floor which was convenient for laundry and ice. Its a $1.50 the wash and same to dry. The ironing board is located in laundry room and not the room you stay in. Our ice machine was broken. The door to our room didn't shut all the way which we were gone all day and found it wasn't even locked when we returned. Nothing was missing. Having a full size fridge was very nice. There was a mini stove top, but there wasn't a large size pot to cook something like pasta. There weren't very any cooking utencils. They have dishes but the bowls are very small. I suggest you buy styrofoam bowls for cereal. We saved alot of money by packing lunch on beach everyday. We went to the local Food Lion and bought very good lunchmeat (we are very picky with quality of food). I like to pack beer for the beach, but they do have a very strict no alcohol policy. It is a $500 fine and arrest. You have to drink your alcohol on the premises (bar) where it was purchased. You cannot carry it up the boardwalk or to the beach. We popped popcorn on the stove top with Jiffy popcorn and 15 minutes later the entire hotel fire alarm went off. We didn't even burn the popcorn, so we were a little stunned that they thought we set it off. Even though they thought we set off the alarm, they were very nice about it. The staff (maintenance, front desk, housekeeping) was very pleasant and helpful. Parking is a major issue. We had to park on the street most of the time. The beach bar was nice and served drinks and food, however was open very long. I'm not sure, but I think they opened around 11 or 12 and closed by 5. We were very disappointed that the pool closed at 8pm. We felt that was way too early and should be open til at least 10 or 11. The pool area was very clean but could use some more umbrellas. The beach was clean with a lifeguard on duty. The water was VERY cold, and it had been 103 degrees out when we were there. Once you got in, it was ok, but it was hard to get used to at first. The lifeguard shut down around 600 or 700 and would call everyone out of the water. They strongly suggests you don't swim without lifeguard on duty, the waves are pretty intense. We spent our days at the beach and nights on the boardwalk. There is a tram that you can pay $3 to use all day. We walked and got alot of exercise. Everything on the boardwalk was open til around 12am, some places such as pizza places and other food places stayed open. Bathrooms are a bit of an issue on the boardwalk. They are pretty far apart and none of the stores we went into had restrooms. My suggestion is, if you really have to go, is to go into a restaurant and order a drink and use their restroom. One night I sat on boardwalk by the bathroom house (which was closed at 12 am) and watched people begging the people inside to open the door so they could go, but the lights went out and no one opened the door. At that time there was a ton of people on boardwalk and alot of food places open that didnt have restrooms. I really think bathrooms should stay open until the entire boardwalk is shut down. Food on the boardwalk was a little pricey, especially sit down meals. Cigarettes were $8.35 a pack. You could get pizza fairly priced for $3 a large slice. Be sure if you order a pizza sub to ask if it has meat on it. We ordered a pizza sub and it was just sauce and cheese on a bun. The ocean view grill which is just a couple blocks up had DELICOUS baby back ribs.

The hotel staff were so kind from the time we arrived until we left. The only drawback I had was the parking situation. There really aren't many spaces to park right at the hotel, but 2 blocks down the street is another lot to park in for the hotel, which is where I had to park.

My husband and I spent four days at Ocean City (Oct. 1 \u2013 4, 2007). We hadn\u2019t been there for many years and didn\u2019t know where to stay anymore so we did research on tripadvisor. We were looking for a place on the beach, with a balcony and ocean view, about halfway down the boardwalk, reasonable rates, quiet, and clean. We found everything and more at the Commander Hotel. We did not make any reservations ahead of time. Because this was the off-season, we didn\u2019t think we would have any trouble finding a room. And besides, we like to look at our room before we check in. (My husband is known for going from hotel to hotel before he finds a room that satisfies him. If it is not clean and smells good, we keep on going.) Based on our criteria, the Commander was our first choice. My husband went in to scout it out and the first thing he liked was the friendly and helpful people at the front desk. The next thing he noticed was how clean everything was. PJ took him up to look at a room. (Oceanfront Suite, 7th floor, $99.00) Thanks to tripadvisor, we knew to ask for a room on a higher floor away from the restrant. The room was perfect. The layout was exactly as they advertised and was beautifully decorated. Exactly what we expected. And clean! We did not have to check out another hotel, which means high praise from my husband! We especially liked having two televisions and the nice kitchenette. The vinyl sofa was very practical for the beach (especially if you had kids with wet bathing suits). It didn\u2019t bother us \u2013 we just threw a blanket over it. We could have used an alarm clock, but we knew to bring our own, so no problem. The beds were the farthest distance away from the balcony, but at night we could leave the balcony door open and listen to the waves easily. If you do not have any children, we would highly recommend visiting Ocean City during the week in the off season. We wanted peace and quiet, and we got it. There was hardly anyone there! Room rates are way down and there is no traffic or lines. We had front row parking at the Commander every time we returned from driving around. You can ride your bike on the boardwalk all day instead of just in the morning. When we were younger, we used to love walking the boardwalk. I knew I physically couldn\u2019t go the distance anymore, and I felt bad that I would miss this activity. But to my joy, we found that they rent tandem surreys which can be pedaled by two people (or one strong husband and a wife with a bad knee). They also rent electric wheelchairs (hover-rounds). What a convenience for the elderly! We were looking forward to eating seafood on this trip and really enjoyed the buffet at Phillip\u2019s Crabhouse on 17th St. ($28) The different restaurants have different buffets and different prices, but we found this one was well worth it. Everything was delicious and it satisfied my craving for seafood. Our vacation was made so much nicer because of tripadvisor. Some of the entries can be really helpful. But others have to be taken with a grain of salt. Individual problems can turn up everywhere and people don\u2019t always give both sides to the story.

Also, the rm looked right out onto the lo-n-g and wide roof of the restaurant, w/the beach in the distance- not exactly the oceanfront view I paid for. I talked to the manager who said there were no other rms and that he could not move me until the next day, and even then he did not know if another oceanfront rm. would be available. He tried to tell me that my rm. was an oceanfront rm., even though I had specified that I did NOT want a corner room and that I had to have the other separated layout and was told I would get it when I reserved. I checked out and went down the street 2 blocks to the wonderful Holiday Inn Oceanfront. More expensive, but guess what- I got a real oceanfront rm. there and they didn't try to pretend I had something different. Beware- Commander may try to pass off these much smaller corner efficiency-type rooms on you (w/one TV and absolutely no separation btwn the beds and living areas, and lokking out over the roof of the bar/restaurant- totally different than the oceanfront pics on the website) when you are paying for a real oceanfront room like the ones pictured on the website. Even if you specify that you do not want a coner room beforehand. It was a big hassle to have to unload the car in the heat, move in the hot room, deal w/this, and then move out to another hotel after this hassle and being told I HAD been given the right type of room when I had not.", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norristown, PA", "Title": "\u201cA Very Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "PATraverler", "ReviewID": "UR8681545", "Content": "We stayed at the Commander Hotel the last week of August and had a wonderful time.

We stayed in one of the ocean view Navigators Suites on the 7th (top) floor. There was plenty of room for all of us, including the pak-n-play we brought for our 2 yr old. The layout was spacious with a separate room with a living room/dining area. Also provided was a full-size refrigerator which really came in handy. Off our room was a huge double-sized balcony with a beautiful view of the ocean and bay. The rooms were very clean, the front desk staff was pleasant and very helpful. Housekeeping was excellent. The outdoor pool was great, and so was the indoor one - small, but nice. The location on the boardwalk was very convenient. Far enough up the boardwalk to not have huge crowds, but close enough to be able to walk pretty much anywhere. I can't say much about the on-site restaurant. We had the breakfast buffet there one morning, and it was average at best. The price was reasonable, though. However, there were a few things that the Commander could definitely improve upon. The headboards on our beds seemed not to be attached properly. Every time you accidentally touched the headboard, they made a loud, horrible sqeak. Also, for anyone anticipating using the pull-out sofa bed in the living room as an extra sleeping area - DON'T! Our twins wanted to try it out just for fun. I would not allow them to sleep on it. The mattress was very thin, and you could feel every spring. I can't imagine anyone being able to get 5 minutes of sleep on that sofa bed. It also would have been nice if they had even a curtain to allow some privacy between the bedroom and the living/dining room. That seems like such a simple, inexpensive thing to do and it would add so much to the room. Also, the only ceiling light fixture hangs right between the bedroom and living area. If the kids are sleeping, you may have to sit in the dark so you don't wake them up with the bright light shining on their faces. We ended up moving a lamp from the bedroom into the living room just to be able to see at night. By far, the most inconvenient thing about the Commander was the parking. It's horrendous! They have very limited parking at the hotel. For three of the four nights we were there, we had to park in their satellite lot, which is about 2 blocks away. (About a 5-10 minute walk.) Not a big deal, but with 3 kids it was a pain. That is the only thing that would make us possibly look for a different hotel the next time we visit Ocean City.

The Hilton welcomed us back, but the kids said it's the perfect time to try something different...the Commander. After the reviews, I thought it looked interesting myself. The front desk was less than sympathetic to our situation, and would not even upgrade us at 6pm even though they had many, many rooms available. We chose an oceanview suite (the layout was nicer than oceanfront, and the view was good). We were there about two hours when we couldn't take it anymore. The TV didn't work, the sofa was such a yucky plastic thing, the dishes were dirty, the heat barely worked, the beds and headboards were rickety, and the halls were very dark and kinda creepy. I was traveling with the kids alone while my hubby had to work. We are not hotel snobs, but when an 8 and 10 year old boy actually notices these things, it's pretty bad.

I will say that they were generous to let us check out without penalty when we weren't happy. Guess what...we went right back to the Hilton! They were so concerned about what we went through that day, they gave us an upgraded suite and charged us less than our initial 3 days because they knew we had a tough day.

The location is perfect--right smack in the middle of the boardwalk! The Ocean front suites are spacious with seperate living and sleeping areas--great to put the kids into bed and us to drink wine and play Scrabble in the living area. The rooms were also clean without the traditional OC musty beach smell. The funky couch that others have mentioned in reviews was ok--we put a sheet over it to make it more comfortable to sit on. (the only bad thing we have to say about the room is the kind of strange liquid soap dispenser in the bathroom--bring your own bar soaps!) The kitchenette was perfect for breakfast and lunches in the room which helps the budget because OC hotels are not cheap in the summer. A full size fridge, micowave and toaster as well as the all important coffee pot are provided. We had a very bad experience when my niece became very ill after eating a local seafood buffet.

Unfortunately, it was right after spending two nights at the new Hilton Suites on 32nd street. That did not bode too well for the Commander in comparison, especially as it was more expensive than the Hilton. However, the woman at check in, P.J., was simply outstanding and put the check in staff at both the opulent Hilton and rather cold Crystal Beach Hotel to a distant 2nd place. P. J. is a very pleasant, cordial and welcoming person. She is, what my parents used to always say about meeting good people in life, a real ( non phony ) person. I hope the Commander knows how incredibly fortunate they are to have her as she truly epitomizes what the word \"service' really means in the hotel industry. Thank you, P. J. for your kind welcome to the Commander. I thought of her as almost a new friend immediately. How often does THAT happen when you check in to a hotel? I think the Hilton should steal her from the Commander and make her the concierge up there. It would be the best decision the Hilton could make. The guests would adore her. About the Commander. It has an excellent location on14th street. I had an oceanfront room and private balcony overlooking the boardwalk which was nice. The room was clean and the infamous vinyl couch did not bother me at all. ( Maybe I am low class. ) In general however, I found the accommodations to be just adequate, roomy enough for 2 to 4 people but also rather outdated and even a little funny after the magnificent ( cheaper ) Hilton. The beds were acceptable and limited kitchenette supplies okay. There is a full size refrigerator which is of course a plus. No stove, just a microwave. Parking is on site and no problem at all. The restaurant served acceptable to good food at a reasonable price and provided staff who gave good service. P.J. suggested I take a look at the Cabana rooms located right behind the main building. I thought they were definately nicer with a better room layout and obviously more roomy than the oceanfront room I had. Of course my view was better. While some of the Cabanas have a limited side view of the ocean that is not bad, you can't compare it to being direct oceanfront. The outside pool is directly in front of the Cabana accommodations while the quite small indoor pool is in the main building. Would I stay here again? Probably not in any rooms located in the main building unless the cost was less , especially during high season. I do not personally feel they are worth it otherwise. I would consider a cabana room as all you have to do is walk a few steps and you are on the boardwalk oceanfront. I got the sense that this hotel has a loyal, annually returning clientle, and that certainly says something for it. However, the Commander faces stiff competition, and not just from the Hilton. In most ways Crystal Beach Hotel is nicer and I am willing to bet Park Place, Paradise Plaza and the new Breakers are as well. After walking along the Boardwalk and seeing other hotels and reading reviews on tripadvisor, i would not ever stay at either the Monte Carlo or the Tidelands Caribbean over the Commander. P.
