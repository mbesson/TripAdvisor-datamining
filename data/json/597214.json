{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good, not great, fine restaurant The Feng Ze Yuan is nicely located near Qianmen, Tiananmen Square, and the Temple of Heaven (I was able to walk to all of those places, although the walks were not short).The restaurant is terrific, serving Shandong cuisine. The food is so good that many locals eat there. Their sea cucumber is famous and the Beijing duck is decent.Many of the staff struggle with English but they try to be helpful. My broken Chinese brought the best results. I booked through elong and had no problems with my reservation, my Visa card, or the special price offered on the Web. Perhaps because it is more traditionally Chinese and less Westernized, many of the guests were Chinese folks and I felt less like a tourist.The single rooms are on the corners and although they are nice, they are also small.Like I said, this hotel is more traditional than other, higher-priced options. This includes the old Chinese belief that men traveling alone need to be comforted. A woman called my room every evening (and once at 5:15 AM, on the day that I was to check out, no kidding) to see if I wanted an in-room massage. Be forewarned.All in all it was a fine place to stay.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR544246824", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Thugje"}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs bon h\u4e48tel   showReview(15269078, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR586313427", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gl0betr0tteuse"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d597214-r5923914-Feng_Ze_Yuan_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "597214", "Price": "$54"}}
