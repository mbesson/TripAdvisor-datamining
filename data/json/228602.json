{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not cheap, but the AC Aitana is good Have stayed here a few times and I always choose it when I'm in Madrid but it's the second AC hotel I've reviewed on this site - and the 2nd in which the aircon didn't work and the room uncomfortably hot. I see a pattern emerging... If you stay here, try for a room away from the road, otherwise I think it's a great hotel in an excellent location near to the Bernab\u8305u stadium.

Close to the Metro for visiting other parts of Madrid too.Nice, clean hotel - maybe trying a little too hard to be trendy! Very comfortable beds and excellent pillows. Good, well-stocked bathroom. I had a 6th floor room overlooking the busy Paseo de la Castellana but road noise was not a problem at all.Excellent breakfast. Don't be seduced by the 'free minibar' - its very limited (couple of beers, water and soft drinks) - better than nothing though.Good choice.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR939906688", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "traveller131"}, {"Content": "An outstanding hotel - a must for your trip to Madrid !!       sink area.

Good business hotel, a little bit further out from Madrid centre than others.Stylish and relaxed, the hotel just manages to get the balance right between looking like modern, designer hotel rather than a cheap Ikea showroom. Dark cherry wood interiors, glass doors, modern sinks and I had an enormous bed.However, the rooms can be noisy, both from the road outside, and also from neighbours. It's never great to hear you neighbours morning ablutions!The basement restaurant is characterless, and filled with office chairs on wheels which is slightly bizarre. Food was fine, but there are too many good restaurants in Madrid to go to instead.Staff are helpful.All in all, a more interesting choice than some more traditional, tired hotels, but nothing to make a special trip for.", "Date": "Jan 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR577771105", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Seat1A"}, {"Content": "Stylish hotel, noisy room The AC Aitana is very stylish - wooden floor in the room, marble bathroom and glass shelf for the sink. The free minibar is a nice touch. The WiFi network worked perfectly for me (though a colleague had some difficulty with this). We got a great business rate of \u9227?00 per night (plus breakfast  taxes) which compares favourably to other hotels in that area. The only negative was the traffic noise, as I probably had the worst room in the house (2nd floor, facing main road).

This hotel is around 200 metres from Real Madrid's stadium and there aren't many other places to visit in this area.

The beds were a bit on the small size though.We were pleasantly suprised to find out that the minibar was free, as were the hot and cold drinks in the reception area downstairs.Be aware though that the hotel is very close to a major road (3 lanes each way), and road noise can be a bit of a problem.Overall though, this is well worth a visit!", "Date": "Sep 26, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR292894567", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Excellent rapport qualit\u8305 prix   showReview(19650487, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR685352855", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Pocas sorpresas al pisar un AC   showReview(16210817, 'full');", "Date": "May 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR812265554", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Adoquin"}, {"Content": "Esta vez me toca quejarme   showReview(12184001, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR217922094", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Vaguete"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d228602-r20535335-AC_Aitana_Hotel-Madrid.html", "HotelID": "228602", "Price": "$223"}}
