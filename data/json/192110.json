As I was a late check-in, I had to ring the doorbell to get in, but this was no trouble. I was greeted by a very friendly man who swiftly and comprehensively explained everything to me and checked me in. He explained that, although I booked a double room, he didn't have any, so he gave me a triple instead. This was fine with me. Got into the room which was of a good size and very warm and cosy. The decor could do with some work but, hey, I paid \u00a339 for a room in a Kensington/Earl's Court hotel for one night! The bathroom was of very good size and, whilst there were a few cracked tiles, this was very nice with plenty of hot water. Nice clean towels and even shampoo and soap as freebies, not normally seen ina very budget hotels like this one. The hotel is situated close to Earl's Court tube station (about a ten minute walk) so is in a good location for commuters. The night's sleep was very comfortable and the bed was soft and cosy. There was a kettle and tea/coffee in my room, and a hairdryer which worked. TV had freeview with good reception. Good amount of plug sockets too so I was able to charge both my phones. :) Checking out was fine as just gave the key back in. The reason I haven't given this hotel five stars is mixed. There was a fridge in my room - and whilst this was an excellent feature - it is not integrated so makes a humming noise constantly. This doesn't disturb sleep at all, and whilst quite a luxury feature, is a bit annoying. I would definitely stay here again for the money I paid.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve arrived at 11.00 am of the 1st July after having booked a single room with private bathroom for a fare of \u00c2\u00a360. The prices reported by the West Cromwell Hotel on the advertisement were: up to \u00c2\u00a3 35 for a Single room with private bathroom, \u00c2\u00a3 50 for a Double room with private bathroom, from \u00c2\u00a3 65 to \u00c2\u00a3 70 for a Family room with private bathroom; on the base of this information I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve chosen the hotel (it was a trick?) and I thought to be in a very large room. When they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve permitted me to access to the room B1, I find something unacceptable: it was an underground room, extremely tiny, with a window in front of a wall, with a single tiny bed, without a wardrobe or something similar where to put may clothes (maybe in their idea I had to put my clothes on the floor, under the bed because it was the only floor available). Indeed a not decent room!! As first thing I asked to the reception if it was possible to change the room because it was not acceptable for me (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in London often and I never found something like this in the same hotel category). They said me that it was not possible and so I was forced to look for another hotel and so I did it for all the afternoon wasting my time (warning the receptionist that for this reason I had to leave the hotel the day after). So I wasted all the afternoon finding another hotel and all the day on this issue. When I came back at the hotel in the evening I found a man extremely rude that has threatened me to charge \u00c2\u00a3 120, if I decided to leave the hotel. My compliments for the hotel policy! In his mind the notice of a cancellation was due 48h (on the website is clearly reported that is 24h) before arrival and I had to stay in the indecent room! But it was not a cancellation, I was forced to leave for the bad service! And the receptionist and that Hotel manager are not able to understand the little difference. After the threats I warned the rude man that he was doing something illegal (and that I had to report this to the authorities) and I had the chance to speak at phone with the Hotel Manager, so I paid only \u00c2\u00a356.
