We were visiting the Canton Fair in nearby Guangzhou and decided to travel to Hong Kong over the weekend inbetween phases. We stayed there on two occasions. The Minden has about 20 floors and about 4 rooms per floor. The 1st time we went, we were on the 6th floor. The second time on the 18th (we could even see a bit of the harbour from here). I preffered to be higher up as the night clubs in the street can be a bit noisy. The hotel is very centrally situated and easily accessible. It is a 5 min walk away from the Star Ferry terminal which you can use to visit Hong Kong Island. It is also close to many markets (a 3 min taxi ride). There is a 24 hour store next door to the hotel which is very convenient. Buy your drinks/water from here as the water in the hotel is very very expensive. The rooms are nice, clean and quite modern. Each room has a flat screen TV and a bar fridge. The ensuite bathrooms are small but exactly what you need. I heard that hotel rooms in Hong Kong is generally quite small; even this was also small it was bigger than I expected. There is also a work desk in each room. Every room also has FREE broadband internet which is a rarity in HK. The comlimentary fruit basket was such a delight after some weird meals in mainland China. The hotel includes a complimentary breakfast which consists of fruit, coffee/juice, boiled eggs, toast, yoghurt, and pastries. Breakfast is served in the restaurant which has a lovely little outside terrace. You can also order room service but not all the items are available so check with the kitchen. The hotel also offers a luggage storage facility if you need to book out but still want to sightsee.

Anything else is welcomed but not essential for me. This hotel meets my criteria and exceeds it in some aspects but also falls behind in a little of things. Let's start with the location; From the MTR station TST it is as close as it gets for the low price range, if you take the K11 mall exit you only have to cross the street and hotel is just around the corner. This is a plus in my book, and also the street where the hotel is is almost full of bars/restaurants which comes very handy if you are in fact looking to have a drink or two and then stumble back to your room. Now this is a double edge sword, because with all these bars comes noise at night and if you are a light sleeper, then ask for a higher floor room or a quiet facing the back of the hotel (a little research goes A LONG WAY) My complaint with noise was in the early morning when the bars get rid of hundreds of beer bottles you can hear the noise for several minutes in what I assume is a recycling truck, very disturbing if you plan to sleep in for the morning. Now a positive point is the free in room internet, very rare in Hong Kong and came in very handy, totally makes up for the morning noise (I had to wake up for work anyways) and if you bring a travel Wifi router you will have yourself a personal office in the middle of Tsim Sha Tsui! another minor annoyance is the lack of complementary water, they have 2 bottles inside your room but they charge 60HKD for each, most hotels will gladly provide you with a small bottle or two of generic water. Again, no big deal as there is a 7 Eleven just down the street. They will provide power adapters free of charge at check in which is also very nice of them as well as an Ethernet cable for your laptop connection (hardwired) and another quick tip if you need to iron your clothes ask for an ironing board in advance as they will provide it to you free of charge, but upon request. Some people may find the beds to be in the stiff side, I did not have a problem with it but please do yourself a favor and not dive into the bed you will thank me for this tip. Other in room amenities, are in room safe (big enough to fit a laptop and a SLR camera) TV (non flat screen) with cable and in room AC/HEATER system. There is a mini fridge with room to spare for your own drinks but I did not use it. Personnel are very attentive and nice, I have no complaints at all, my check in was really fast as well as checking out which is at noon, also very helpful.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely recommended!\u201d", "Author": "elaineeyyy", "ReviewID": "UR123819568", "Content": "Checking in was a breeze. We got there way before the 2pm check in time, but no problems whatsoever with leaving our luggage in their storage until we got back from our 1st round of shopping at around 5pm. Front desk staff were easy to talk to and very helpful (without even asking, they offered an adapter for our chargers, assisted us with locating places easily, etc.). The hotel is just a very short walk from the trains, ferry terminal and of course, all the shops and restaurants in Tsim Sha Tsui (it's just behind The Peninsula and Sheraton). Very safe street on which The Minden is located, Minden Ave. It reminded me of the West Village in New York, with the bars and restaurants that line it. This impression is just for this particular street, though. The Minden Hotel's Room 702 was simple but very comfortable; the bed fit two perfectly. The mattress may be a little bit too firm for some but totally okay with us. Sheets and pillows were clean (and smelled that way). I was surprised too, at how comfortable the pillows were, considering this is just a 3-star hotel. Prior to the trip, I read about the poorly soundproofed walls. This didn't bother me until our last morning. It was still to my advantage because I was really supposed to wake up early... and I did, thanks to the noisy family waiting for the elevator. My friend didn't hear anything, though. We had a clean, well lit and spacious bathroom with only one downside: it got quite cold because of outside air that seeped through the window (even when closed) on one side of the shower stall... survivable, though. Not sure if it would still be if it were a colder time (we were there 2nd week of January). Breakfast, served at Courtney's on the 5th floor, made my day! I loved their blueberry danish and coffee! Sausage roll is quite good, too! I enjoyed eating in this small but nicely decorated area. While the spread is limited to hard boiled egg, toast, plain croissant, danish (plain, blueberry and another fruit), sausage roll, cereal, fruits and yoghurt, orange juice, coffee and tea, heavy eaters will appreciate that they may eat to their heart's content. I rated Average for \"Value\" because their rates were steeper than other 3-star hotels in the TST area (especially during the super peak season we were in), but I'm still happy we settled for The Minden.

The hotel is pretty decent with all basic ameneties. Few things I noted though. No bell boy service to carry your luggage when you check-in. B'fast is just about decent not good. There's a few pubs around the hotel so gets a bit noisy on the weekends. I had read about this already so I got myself a higher floor. The only caveat is Wi-fi works on the lower floors only. They have the usual LAN cable though so if you have a laptop, you're covered. Rooms are decent sized but no Ironing board provided in the room. I had to call the reception to get an Ironing board which they gave very promptly. The pillows were too flat, so I asked for extras but since it was weekend rush, so they didnot have any. Tough luck. Service is fast. About the location, very very near to TST(E) MTR and some of the good attractions like the Star ferry, Avenue of stars, Salisbury etc. Another good thing is transport to airport, this place has tons of taxis/minivans right below the hotel. So you can bargain quick and skip the hassle of booking a taxi in advance. One thing I really didn't like about the location of this hotel was the walk from hotel to TST E Mtr. You have to pass through some of the backyards of hotels/restaurants etc and you'd see either hotel staff or random people sitting around the corners, smoking and stuff. I would've just avoided that route if I could but that was the shortest route to the MTR. Bottom line, I would opt. for YMCA Salisbury any day provided they have vaccancies.

General location was very good (that's why I chose The Minden in the first place). Near MTR and K11 Shopping Mall and hundreds of small shops, eateries etc all around. But then the noise from the night-clubs , that had been mentioned by other reviewers, started. It was unbelievably loud and really unacceptable. They should have triple-glazing !! Besides, the window in the bathroom is not double-glazed and although we kept the bathroom door closed, there was no escape from the racket. The following nights were better - thank goodness. (Or perhaps I had got used to it?) The bathroom was very well functioning with a nice shower and enough room to move. Although I am used to hard beds all over China, these are ridiculously hard! The oldfashioned bulky TV set surprised us in the otherwise high-tech minded HK. The included breakfast was for us the best aspect of the hotel. There is a nice outdoor area as well which you can escape to if the 6 airconditioning units in the b'fast room freeze you to death. :) I loved the artwork throughout the hotel but can not possibly recommend the Minden Hotel to my friends and only because it's small, it's not a \"Boutique Hotel\" in my book.

There may have just been something loose in the handle, but I asked to have it looked at and it was working the next night. The rooms have a switch for the hot water heater so you do have to leave time for it to heat up when you get to your room.

We wanted somewhere affordable, value for money as we knew that hotels in Hong Kong can be over-priced with tiny rooms. We went for the standard double at an online price of HK$800 per night with breakfast included. They always whack a 10% service charge on top. The Positives: -the room was a good size, fairly big for Hong Kong, by all accounts. -free broadband internet via ethernet cable provided by hotel (no wireless). -great location in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui without the noise of Nathan Road. Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby -easy to get to from the airport: take bus A21 to TST and walk about 5 minutes. $33 for a single journey, a lot cheaper than the express airport bus. Why we won't be returning: -the room stank. We thought something had died. Really really unpleasant. I've read another review where someone also mentions the smell, so obviously not a one-off. -breakfast was pretty dire, certainly not my definition of continental. Better than a lot of places in China, yes, but at a very, very, very basic level. At least it was free, I guess. -we were given a voucher for a free drink from the hotel bar on arrival. We went to the bar to claim it only to find that it meant literally ONE drink. We were two people staying in a double room - pardon me for presuming that we'd get a drink each. We got two teeny tiny beers and had to pay $55 for one of them (didn't find out till we tried to leave). The wording on the voucher does not make it clear. -we asked to change rooms because of the smell. The completely personality free receptionist told us they were full, but I knew there were rooms available in the next price bracket (deluxe double for about $100 HK dollars more) and would have expected her to either upgrade us at no extra cost or to give us a discount on our room. In conclusion - an awful room, but there has to be something good about this place because some other people liked it and the Lonely Planet picked it out from all the others.
