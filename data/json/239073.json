The room they gave us was facing the Gran Via. The views are good but the noise of traffic is all night. They had inner rooms but smaller. As our room was not great I am in doubt if the inner rooms will be good option. The air conditioning in our room did not work. As if by chance we do not need it, do not question the reception, but then checked the hotel website they charge as optional air conditioning (5 \u20ac per night and room). For me is something that I will not choose this hotel again.The bathroom was small, with half bath, and no offering (gel, shampoo, etc. ..). Cleaning is on the threshold of acceptability. Could be better. The room was one floor above the reception which we had to access by stairs. The elevator only goes up to the level of reception. Although a metro station is a 50 meters, the station \"Calhau\" is not a main station and therefore implies that almost always have to make the transfer station of the \"Poerta del Sol\" or in the \"Gran Via\". The \"Poerta del Sol\" Station is 250 meters on foot. The area is a expensive area to take breakfast, for example. In the area \"Poerta del Sol\" there are several cafes offer breakfast at prices much more cheap. In this same building there are other hostais so if I\u00b4ll choose this type of accommodation again I\u00b4ll probably try one of the others.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cjust an excellent location\u201d", "Author": "abg112070", "ReviewID": "UR64104360", "Content": "the best asset of the hotel is it's location ... very near a metro station and is walking distance to practicallly everything ... the room we got was of good size BUT the toilet smelt disgusting (drainage?) ... when we mentioned this at the reception, they came ready with an air freshener and some alcohol based liquid which they used - it made us think that this is an ongoing problem that has not been dealt with ...

Located on Gran Via, across from Plaza de Callao, the Continental is right in the middle of the city. The room is very basic, and looked much like old college dorm rooms: slightly worn linoleum floor, two single beds, a chair, table, and closet. Still, 39 euros per night was a good price for the location. Guests must request the air conditioniing remote control to use the in-room unit, which adds 5 euros to the cost of the room. Traffic noise was a bit of a problem over night, as the windows have not been soundproofed. The room was fairly clean, but the shower curtain hadn't been changed in a while and had some mildew spots on it. They accept credit cards, but the receptionist asked that I pay in cash when checking out. It wasn't worth insisting on charging such a low price. The place was all right for one night.", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hostal Continental", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d239073-Reviews-Hostal_Continental-Madrid.html", "Price": "$42 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Gran Via</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">44 3&ordm;</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28013</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "239073", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/84/59/hostal-continental-thumbnail.jpg"}}
