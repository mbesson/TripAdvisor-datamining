The walls need to be sound proof better, our neighbors reported us for loud noise when we hear our neighbors just the same. On August 30, 2012 my family headed to the club house, I suggested to the front desk lady that this is our 2nd stay at a west gate resort and our first stay in a different West Gate in Orlando had free wifi.

I am sure he will reply with a lame excuse instead of being accountable for his lack of leadership. The topper was when someone had gone thru our luggage in all 3 of our rooms. That's when we checked out and went to the Hilton at the Landing. Filed a chargeback with our credit card company and they loved we supplied them with photo's to back up our nightmare experience.

We could hear them well into the night. 2) We arrived 2 hours early and the lady at the front desk would not let us check in. This would have been understandable except that she was rude about it. We spent the next 2 hours wondering if we made a poor choice. We are all about customer service.

There was a washer and dryer, and the bathroom had a nice jacuzzi tub, (which we didn't use). The only complaint I have, is that the corner shower, (which was in the same room as the toilet, tub, and sinks) had clear glass doors. For us, staying with our 2 sons, the bathroom lacked the privacy needed to accomodate 4 people. My sons enjoyed swimming in the indoor pool, and playing ping pong in the clubhouse. By the outside pool there is also a mini golf course, a small basketball court, and a horseshoe setup. There is also a large pavilion outdoors, full of picnic tables. It has 2 nice BBQ grills and a stage as well. We needed something repaired in our unit, and they had 2 men up to check it out within minutes, and had the problem fixed before the end of the day - very impressive! We would definitely stay there again. Also, here's a tip on finding the resort - it's quite a drive from the time you drive through the security gates until you find the registration building. Do not stop at the large house with white pillars just up the hill from the gate, you have to proceed down the hill directly toward the lake. Eventually at the bottom of the hill, the road takes a sharp left turn and you should soon see the clubhouse/registration center straight ahead.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Joplin, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a Winter Get-A-Way\u201d", "Author": "grandma80401", "ReviewID": "UR121682618", "Content": "We stayed here while attending a wedding in the area and completely enjoyed this hotel.

I found the absence of hooks or racks to hang our swimsuits, towels, etc to be lacking. There is a towel rack over the toilet, and that is it. Much storage in the bathroom with a closet as well as drawers under the sink. We had a one bedroom, with a king sized bed and a walk out of the bedroom to the large screened in deck. The bedroom had a tv in it, but we never turned it on. The bed was comfortable. Kitchen was a work in only kitchen with a dishwasher, and the washer and dryer (stacked) were also in a closet, and very handy to have. I found the tableware to be adequate, but barely. I think there might have been a setting for 4 people. We did not like the coffee cups at all, and went out to purchase mugs. Kitchen was very clean, as well as refridgerator and microwave. Cleaning supplies were nicely stocked. Dining room was pretty and small, nice glass top table with 4 heavy chairs. Living room consisted of a leather couch and chair, and the couch could be made into a bed. They were comfortable. The carpet was like an indoor outdoor, and could have been vacuumed again, it was gritty. From the living room we could also walk out on the deck, which had a patio table with 4 chairs. It was a great view of the Lake, and we also could watch the birds flying and fishing. There is NO internet at all. I was able to check messages with my blackberry, but if you plan on using wireless or internet, forget it. That was an annoyance and almost enough to have us leave and find somewhere else. The pool was nice, and there were two propane bbq grills close to it for use. There is also a charcoal bbq betweeen buildings for tenant use. Boats and other watersport items can be rented from the marina, which is maybe a 10 minute walk. Check-in was easy. This was a bid for vacation trip, and I paid about $60.00 per night. There were activites but we did not get involved in any. We mainly vegged out and sat on the patio and watched watercraft, people, and nature. The only restaurant that delivers is a Dominos, and it cost me $30.00 for one pizza and one sandwich, which is more than I pay in Cincinnati. But, it was the only game in town on Saturday even when we arrived. We were tired and did not want to go back out and find a restaurant or a grocery store. Food was fine. Be aware, though, and either stop at a grocery store before you come to the villa, or eat pizza. (smile) We did find the walls between condos/villas to be very thin. We could hear our above neighbors whenever they walked across the floor. Either they all were very heavy walkers or not much insulation. We also could hear our next door neighbors television, their conversations, etc. Thank goodness they were not having a party, just regular voices really carried. They probably could hear us, too.

The location is in a gated community on Table Rock Lake. As we drove into the resort around 7pm it looked wonderful. We had very high hopes- soon to be shattered. PROS: 1. Nice indoor pool w/ warm water. 2. Beautiful views of Table Rock Lake. CONS: 1. Check-in took 20 mins4 as the only front desk employee couldn't figure out how to enter our reservation into the computer. 2. Requested a baby crib and were told \"no\" because there was only 1 employee working. Returned 3 times to press the issue & the front desk employee finally retrieved one herself. 3. Room smelled very smokey. When neighbors lit a cigarette the smoke literally came through the vents or walls into our condo. Our clothes stunk and our family with small children had to breathe 2nd hand smoke all night...it felt like we were sleeping in a bar. 4. Very thin walls. Could hear the neighbors every time they talked. 5. No wireless internet anywhere at Westgate Emerald Pointe.

The property is well lit. The room furniture can use an update and I was told that its going to very soon. However, it was very well kept. Fully equipped kitchen. I fell in love with their stove! Everything you can think of to have with the kitchenware. Plenty of space for food and snacks if you are looking to stock up. The shower was sooooo realxing. Beds were amazingly comfortable, but the sofabed wasn't as comfortable. Very roomy, plenty of space. Nice closet with good shelving, just kind of small. Loved the convience of the washer, dryer, and dishwasher in the room. The resort staff was ok. Some were good, some were bad. What can you do? A little distance from the strip, but it worked.

Had front and back adjoining condos. The view of Table Rock Lake is fabulous and I woke up early every morning just to sit and gaze. Loved the screened in porch. We were on the top floor so really had amazing views. I noticed no bugs/spiders at all as a previous poster stated. The rooms were very clean. There's no maid service daily if that's important to you but it was ok with us. There were plenty of extra towels and the washer and dryer in each condo is a real plus. Kitchen was fully stocked with kitchen utensils. I wasn't sure I'd like being this far out of Branson but really, it wasn't a bad drive at all...no more than 10 minutes. The area is very quiet and peaceful. We used this room through a friend who had previously rented and couldn't make the trip so there was no time-share hassle for us to worry about. We were not interested in the organized activities here but there were several things to choose from. We did take advantage of the ticket concierge for show tickets. They tell you their tickets are cheaper than box office prices but we did not find this to be true. Most were equal or even more. The convenience factor wasn't there either since they only give you vouchers and you still have to wait in sometimes long lines at the theaters to get your actual tickets. If we had to do it again, we would not use the on site ticket counter. The people working there were extremely nice and helpful so that was a plus.", "Date": "June 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, IA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Scenery\u201d", "Author": "deegeegirl", "ReviewID": "UR8260270", "Content": "We were very pleased with this resort.
