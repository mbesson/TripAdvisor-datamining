The breakfast is plated and not so much options to choose. They even offer huge umbrella if its raining which is very seldom to see in a hotel. Location is good coz its near Clark Quay Central Mall and you could just walk all the way up to the famous China Town and tons of stuffs you can buy from there. Have to pay the internet but its not expensive and they are super fast.

A budget hotel. On the plus side, it's new and clean. Most people here have commented on the room sizes and they are not wrong. TINY. I have never seen anything like it before. The bed is smaller as well to accommodate for the fact that a normal bed couldn't physically fit into these rooms. The beds have rubber mattresses as well, which is hideous. Why?? The location is very good. Right next to Clarke Quay and near bars / restaurants and transport. It's not too bad if you don't plan spending much time in the room. Make sure you get a good rate though. Singapore is an obscenely expensive place and rooms like this fetch a much higher price than they would almost anywhere else I've ever been!

First the Pros: Location. This hotel is very closet to Clark Quay, only a block from an MRT station, and just a short walk from Chinatown. Really it's about the best location I could imagine. BUT. The hotel itself had a lot of problems. Primarily: If you read that the rooms are tiny, you will still not be prepared for HOW tiny. Our room, admittedly a standard room, consisted of a room probably about 8 feet by 8 feet, containing a double size bed. There were two tiny nightstands on either side. And that's it. No desk, dresser, not a single usable space to put stuff except on the bed. No window (room was interior), so it felt like a prison cell! Bathroom was combined toilet shower in one room. So as soon as you use the shower, the entire bathroom is wet. Not a single place in the bathroom to put stuff either. Not a single shelf usable. Towers were paper thin, threadbare, had holes in them and stains. No bathmat, washcloth, hand towel. Bed was rock hard. Worse, under the super thin top sheet, some kind of plastic barrier. I felt like they expected me to wet the bed, and like I was sleeping on a crib. Pillows on the other hand, were like 12\" high. And rock hard as well. Way too thick, made it very hard to get comfortable. Aircon was fine, but arranged so that it blew directly on the bed. Which isn't ideal, even on low you have a blast of cold air aimed directly at you. No way to adjust. Have to manually turn on the water heater. This is fine, just takes a bit to remember for your shower you need to wait a few minutes after turning in. Internet is not that fast (fast enough I guess) and not free, $5 for 2 hours, $10 for 10 hours and $18 for 24 hours. Way too high in my opinion. And once you start your time, it runs out in 2 hours whether you use it or not. Some confusion at the front desk about the free breakfast next door. I had a special rate, and it wasn't included, that's fine. But when I inquired, they said it was no problem and would give it to me, to just ask for the coupons each morning. But of course the next day, different people, and even after I explained that they told me to ask for them, wouldn't give them to me. Again, my room didn't come with them, so I didn't expect them. But if you then offer them, mark something in the computer so they know to give them to me! :) Noisy, the cleaning staff in the hallways starting before 7am every morning were very loud, chatting and yelling (sometimes singing). We couldn't hear any city noise as our room was interior, but were woken up every morning by the workers and their loud voices. With a room as tiny as they are, if that had had at least a lobby you could use to have some space, but the lobby is nearly as small as the rooms. One single couch, a countertop with two computers (but only one stool, go figure), and endless bags being stored (apparently their luggage room can hold about two bags). So you're constantly crawling over people and luggage nearly every time you enter the hotel. No toiletries except a toothbrush.n Only one trashcan in room (none in the bathroom since it's a single room), only one outlet in entire room (again, none in bathroom) Staff was courteous though, check-in and out was painless. We paid about $80 a night for a room the size of a prison cell. That is cheap by Singapore standards, so I'm not too upset. Had I paid the normal online price of near $160, or their ridiculously 'normal' rate of $250 I would have been pissed! Again, the location is great, and if you're only going to sleep there, maybe it's OK. We did hear a lot of guests complaining that their rooms were noisy (probably facing outside) Just a head's up. Rooms in Singapore are typically small as I understand it. But this room was very very difficult to navigate.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antalya - Turkiye", "Title": "\u201cClean and tidy\u201d", "Author": "BoogyKsK", "ReviewID": "UR123615603", "Content": "Friendly front desk staff.

It's a simple hotel, so as long as you realise that you're not paying much (in terms of the cost of accommodation in Singapore) and you're more interested in having somewhere clean, safe and centrally located than all the bells and whistles, then this is the place for you. The hotel is within about 3 minutes walking distance to Clarke Quay MRT station, which is very central. Clarke Quay itself is a beautiful river side entertainment district, with restaurants, bars and a shopping centre. Orchard Road is a short MRT ride away, as is Marina Bay, while China Town is right on your doorstep. The room was small, and I was lucky to be upgraded on my arrival, but it had a double bed (not queen) a flatscreen TV, kettle with complimentary coffee, and bottled water (although some days this was replaced and other days it was forgotten!) The bathroom is the sort with the shower head simply attached to the wall, so everything in the bathroom gets wet, but this is no the first place I've stayed with a shower like this. There was free internet access at two desktop terminals in the lobby, although wifi was on a paid basis and was quite expensive. The only real down side I saw with this place was that the walls were thin, so if your neighbours were noisy it was hard to get any sleep. Also, the lack of included breakfast was a downside. I would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Singapore.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cRoom is small and noisy\u201d", "Author": "icarolyap", "ReviewID": "UR122348894", "Content": "I paid SGD138nett and get a room which is very small and noisy with no view at all.The only thing I satisfied is walking distance to Clark Quay MRT Station and famous pub along the riverside.If you can pay a little bit more, try to stay at other hotel which is more spacious.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fragrance Hotel - Riverside", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2439500-Reviews-Fragrance_Hotel_Riverside-Singapore.html", "Price": "$94 - $168*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">20 Hong Kong Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">059663</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2439500", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b6/71/b671ca6967f1bb8f859634cbd48593c83large.jpg"}}
