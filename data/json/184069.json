The valet (no option to park yourself) at the Hilton is $30 a night and we often had to wait for the valet attendant.

LoL First of all as soon as I arrived there was no concierge to bring in my luggage. When i asked for one they told me they did not have one an di was to do this myself. From there the lady at the front desk was rude and let me know that all of a sudden the room deposit was all of a sudden double what it was supposed to be \"due to the caribana season\" were her exact words. Which meant i had to withdrawl more money than i had intended which led me to have to call my husband and make arrangement immediatly to find a western union stand in line cab there and back just to pay the extras. That cost me money and timeout of my day meaning i could not enjoy most of the plans i had made for that day because this took me an hour and a half to figure out! I was not aloud in my room until i gave her the extra money. When i arrived back with it then she changed her mind again and said she made a mistake and it was actually once again more than i had so i had to make a second trip due to her neglect to give me the proper info prior! I was super tired and annoyed. The hotel did not have room service which led me to wander toronto in search of clean substinance and as soon as i left the hotel there were junkies everywhere and i was deathly afraid to get robbed. In the lobby there was an officer who was taking information from the staff due to the fact that one of the maids children had been STABBED down the block at school!!! how horrible and this gives a small description of the location! A strip club which was inhabited by the lowest lifeforms outside was right beside the hotel!!! Everytime i left the hotel i was asked for money, drugs and cigarettes by bums right in the front and there was absolutly no security at the front door for my whole stay! I could have been hurt. There was a spider in my room and i did not open the windows once, which made me wonder to the cleanliness. When i climbed up to kill it i fell and fractured my back in my room which was a pain undescribable! The hotel knew of this and sent me a chocolate bar? lol and a card saying sorry which i still have. The workout room equipment was broken and led me to have another injury smashing my kneecap on the bike because the seat was loose and wobbly and when i told the hotel they sent a mechanical guy who thought to blame me which was utterly ridiculous being i am 115 lbs and was only on the bike for 2-3 min! The hot tub had grime inbetween the tiling which was unacceptable! when i left the hotel due to my injuries to recieve proper care elsewhere i was surprised to see the cart for my luggage at my door once again with no help or sight of a concierge! In my opinion this hotel should be stripped of the hilton name all together! I am now still in recovery of my injuries from this so called vacation. If you want the truth about this hotel stay there for a night and tell me if your happy in the morning. Totally unacceptable I paid 600.00 extra to aircanada to re-book my flight and get out of there fast. I was going to stay another 2 weeks but if i did im sure soemthing worse would have happened to me on the premisis. My injuried were os bad i had to be carted to my flight and wheelchaired on my plane which was embarrasing and painful for me.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201c'Can't wait to go back\"\u201d", "Author": "cruiselady77", "ReviewID": "UR116675859", "Content": "This was a very nice hotel.

Thanks Irma! The room on 6 was quiet, the bed was very comfy and we both slept well. The breakfast was great with newspapers, juices, fruit, yoghurt, cereals, breads, pastries, cook yourself waffles and cooked to order breakfast.so we were well set-up for the day. The staff in here were really efficient and friendly. In the evenings we didn't eat but did have a nice cold beer in the Caseys on the ground floor.

One person in our party was allergic to feathers, and she called the front desk inquiring about a hypoallergenic pillow. She had to call three times before getting a pillow. I also called multiple times about getting washcloths. Most of the time, the staff never delivered them to our room. A person in our party brought her own towel/spa wrap.

Our party was booked through a corporate rate, and the staff kept on insisting that we were not allowed to use the shuttle unless we were Hilton Honors members. Lucky for us, the driver was very nice and drove us to our conference anyway. According to the driver, the shuttle service was available to all guests. A member of our party left two nights early. The hotel manager refused to take off the charge for the extra person on our hotel bill because \"we were getting such a good rate anyway\". If we wanted that charge off of our bill, we would have needed to book the more expensive rate. Another colleague in the conference had a problem with keeping her conference rate when trying to shorten her stay. She accidentally reserved an extra night.

Everything in the Hotel is new, therefore the rooms were exceptionally clean and comfortable: Adjustable beds for firmness/softness, comfortable desk chair, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, free Wii-Fii, whirlpool tub in bath (with colored lights!). No complaints at all about the room with the exception of a lack of soundproofing - we could hear loud conversations from the adjoining room - it didn't bother us, but might bother light sleepers. Facilities: Exercise room had weights, elliptical, 2 treadmills. Decent sized indoor pool and hot tub on 2nd floor. Restaurant (we were there one night, didn't use it). Continental Buffet was $13; Full Breakfast Buffet $16. We spoke to some in our group who tried it and they were very satisfied. There is a restaurant (Casey's) on the side of the building; Room Service is also available. The Area: this review is written by a 56 yr old guy with a yellow streak down his back. Other reviews talk about the area; I can only assume people writing must live in the country - this area was certainly no worse (and probably better) than you'd find in any large city's downtown area. There was one panhandler in front of the hotel when I went out in the morning; saw one homeless individual sleeping on the sidewalk 2 blocks down. There's a nice Grocery store 2 blocks down on Jarvis; Eaton Centre isn't a far walk (we had a nice dinner at Baton Rouge), and I felt perfectly safe walking the area (others in the group shared the same opinion and said the obvious: just protect your belongings like you would in any city). Negative note: I'd rate this hotel a step up from Fairfield Inns and Hampton Inns (my usual choices). I can't comment on price as it was part of a bus tour group, booked for us. Again, the room amenities were well above average; room service is available. We were lacking an ice bucket - it took 1 1/4 hours to have one brought to our room, so that aspect might need some work. Also, there's a brochure in the rooms about an exercise pad/equipment you can ask to use: I asked at the Front Desk and the clerk had no idea what I was talking about. In closing, I wouldn't let the location of this hotel bother me - Toronto is certainly a major city and its Metro, buses and taxis make it easy to navigate. I would definitely use this facility again if I was in Toronto.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague, Czech Republic", "Title": "\u201cGood location, service needs to improve\u201d", "Author": "Zelenec", "ReviewID": "UR39529031", "Content": "Booked still with Choice Hotels, I received an e-mail from Choice hotels to check, that my reservation is still accepted while changed to Hilton, which I did about two weeks in advance.

Room was OK, spacious for single traveller, nice bathroom. Housekeeping fine, just found tones of dust in the AC inside the bathroom - seems they clean the floor but never look to the ceiling. Breakfast service fine, good qualiy food, good service - I went always around 7:00 am and probably was one of first customers. Liked the freshly cooked breakfast, good variety of products and very tasteful. If I will be coming back to Toronto and get a good deal, no hesitation to stay in this hotel as the location is perfect.

The room was good, had everything we wanted, spacious, LCD TV, iron, fridge etc. However this is the only good thing I can say about this hotel. Breakfast was included but it was chaos both mornings. It as self service except for hot breakfast. Both mornings we had breakfast we discovered that the nothing is restocked as it runs out i.e plates, glasses, juices, hot water, coffee, butter, yogurts etc. There is only 1 hot breakfast cook who keeps his back to the awaiting guests that want to place their order for hot food. The area is dreadful. We arrived the first night at 1am, on approaching the hotel we saw homeless people and prostitutes. While I as checking in & asking how safe was the area there was a drunk woman banging on the window of the car asking my husband to drive her somewhere. There was some hotel guests smoking outside the hotel entrance and they too were being hassled by homeless people. The second night we arrived again by car about 9.30pm and were again hassled by homeless people. We could hardly get out of the car when they were over to us.

The restaurant manager was useless in attempting to get him to work. It costs 30 dollars a day for valet parking. You can't walk in the area of the hotel because of the bums trying to get money from you. Not a safe area day or night.

When my family arrived, there was no valet in sight and no obvious self park options. We checked in, left the keys with the front desk, and went to our room. While unpacking, my daughter noticed that the carpet was soaking wet. I called down for another room, which they happily accomodated. Attempt #2 was near someone who was smoking, which is not allowed but I figured it's not a hassle I want to deal with when they get the urge again at 2am. Attempt #3 was a decent room, albeit a bit small and with a tiny window that makes the room feel a bit claustrophobic. After putting the kids to bed, my wife and I thought we might rent a movie but alas the hotel has no in-room movies. In the morning, we went to breakfast which was just a disaster. I noticed that the front desk had forgotten to give me our breakfast vouchers, and they quickly gave them to me. The bigger issue was finding somewhere to sit - while there were plenty of open tables the staff hadn't kept up with clearing the tables so they were all littered with dirty dishes. Once we did sit down, the poor service continued. At the breakfast buffet they had run out of plates and when my wife asked the kitchen staff for some plates they were scolded by the dining room staff for giving out the wrong size of plate. Several of the breakfast items were depleted and not being restocked. When people did hunt down the breakfast manager he was on his cel phone with someone and the customer I'm sure felt like they were interrupting him. In general it was chaos, and we think it's because the team of 3 people didn't have clear roles - one should be bussing tables, one should be keeping the buffet stocked, and one dealing with bills. On the hot food, my wife ordered pancakes from the kitchen and stood around for about 20 minutes waiting for them. We had all finished (including custom omelettes) by the time the pancakes arrived. When we were done, I couldn't find a waitress so just left my coupon on the table (without tip) and went back to our room. The hotel is not in the greatest area of Toronto, but it's a quick walk or streetcar ride to Yonge street. Overall, it's a very nicely renovated hotel in a decent area, with some major issues to figure out related to customer service.", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hilton Garden Inn Toronto/City Centre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d184069-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_Toronto_City_Centre-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$137 - $349*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">200 Dundas Street East</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M5A 4R6</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "184069", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/29/5e/295eec8fc15a738452f07d62455688eb1large.jpg"}}
