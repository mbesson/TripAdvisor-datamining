Am pleased to give it a big thumbs up. No queues on checking in, hotel was beautifully clean and location is superb. For an inexpensive hotel, this hotel met all the criteria we wanted/needed. We opted for a Premier Room with marina views and am glad we did pay the extra money as the view was awesome. Easy access to the shopping mall from the lobby area, and a 5 minute walk (if that) and you are at the marina area. Some people complained about the chirping birds, well we thought it was quite nice and did not find it annoying. The pool area is quite large and certainly refreshing for a cool down.

The lounge is a fantastic space stretching the full height of the hotel and tastefully decorated with well thought out seating. Our room when we arrived was modern, spotless and spacious with a good view over the marina. The position of the hotel is spot on we walked to everything we wanted to see. Due to our late checkout we could also enjoy a dip in the pool in the afternoon before checking out and storing our bags prior to our evening flight.

On one night after coming back late, I urgently had to use the writing papers and envelopes to send a letter, but to our horrors, found that these stationaries had not been replenished(we used some on our second day and there were none around on this 6th night that I am writing this review!). I think this kind of cheap-skate attitude is common in a locally-owned and locally-run hotel like this Mandarin Group of hotels. They stinge on small things! I can also confirm other reviewers' comments on the illegal car racing that takes place on the road (Raffles Bouvelard) in front of the hotel. On the early Sunday morning that we were staying there, my wife and I were rudely awakened by tremendously loud revving of car engines. I keeping hearing the revs every few minutes and finally, when I could not stand it any longer, I went over to our balcony to have a look. Sure enough there were at least half a dozen racing cars weaving in and out of a surprising not-so-empty-road racing against each other. From our 11th floor, we could see that they even beat the red traffic lights at the end of the road where they turned right and then probably continued with their circuit whereby they re-appeared from the left(facing the road) over and over again. This all happened at 3am on Sunday morning. And I am a heavy sleeper, mind you! I called the Police but they were ineffective as these \"hoons\" were still at their games at 5pm, although by then they were racing around some roads nearby(deducing from their engine revs) and were no longer using the same circuit. I called the duty manager at 4am and told him the problem and asked if they are assisting the police in this matter. \"Oh we are not the only hotel affected\", he replied. I said surely this would not be the first time that this is happening and the hotel would have known quite a bit to help the police? \"Oh things were much worse before and this is a lot better than in the past\", he replied again! I swear that I did not make this up and I will leave readers to form their own conclusions as to what the hotel management(as represented by that duty manager) expect their guests to put up with in relation to the racing problems in front of their hotel! When I mentioned this on-going racing to a local friend, he said that these racing wanabes may be the kids of the connected and \"important\" people in Singapore and that is why there have been no effective actions taken against these illegal street racing that has been taking place on a portion of their F1 circuit.

Things were rather OK here, nothing mind blowingly good, but nothing terrible either. Check-in was efficient. I had arranged with the hotel ahead of time to have a cake (complimentary) sent up to our room for her birthday. I liked the fact they did it complimentary, I really appreciated it and I thought it was a nice gesture. Confirmed the timing of the cake to be sent up when I was checking-in. Was put on a no smoking floor. As the hotel is in a sort of \"triangle\" like shape with the \"base\" facing the road and the two sides that arc up to a pinnacle. We were given a GREAT room all the way out at the point overlooking part of Marina Bay towards the ocean. The room had a GREAT view and was quietly located far far away from anyone else. perfect. Room was good, clean for the most part, nothing that blew us away. The desk chair's seat cover we noticed was torn at the side and the seat cover was filthy, dared not sit on it! I did later complain about this and they did say they would send someone up but i don't think they ever came (even when we were out, still not 100% sure but there certainly wasn't a new chair when we got back). The lamp-stand for the standing lamp was also broken a bit. The hotel has been here for quite some time (15-20 years perhaps? maybe longer?) so they have \"updated\" it so the rooms are nice and modern, with a good cheery vibe to them. Bathroom was a bit dated though. And the cups in the bathroom were filthy. I don't tend to use the glasses put in bathrooms anymore just because they are usually pretty filthy and lord knows how hotels actually clean them. Shower was also a bit tiny. But other than the cups, the bathroom was quite clean. Toilet and bidet included as well! Although, the bidet had scalding hot water regardless of which temperature the handle was pointed towards. They have a \"pillow menu\" which we noticed on a printed placard next to the bed, I thought that was a good idea. Bed was comfortable to sit on and rest, but I didn't sleep so well; even with my pillow I bought from home. We waited around for the cake (I guess I should say I waited since my girlfriend had no clue it was coming up!), but the cake never arrived. I finally went downstairs to the front desk roughly an hour or so later and let them know. This was also when I told them about the desk chair. The cake eventually arrived, but quite later than we expected and the surprise was a bit ruined as my girlfriend was quite suspicious why I was walking out of the room at one point and pacing around the room. The cake was EXCELLENT though; that is worth mentioning. We got some room service too before the cake arrived and the food was OK. Nothing fantastic, but the cake was heavenly; rich amounts of chocolate - just perfect, with perfect flavor. Job well done! I don't usually get excited about chocolate cake much these days, I find most places in Singapore that have any sort of chocolate cake on their menu just seem to make it super bland and almost tasteless. But this place, this cake was AMAZING! So thumbs up there. We were able to score a late check-out the next day which was quick and easy. All-in-all it was an OK stay. The service still needs some attention I think given the tardiness of the birthday cake and also the general attitude of the staff. They could definitely raise the bar there, maybe even renovate the bathroom for the room we had while they're at it. But like my title suggests, it was an unremarkable visit; nothing bad, nothing great with a few misses along the way.

Would I stay again? For business: probably. For leisure: definitely not. The main thing that is letting this hotel down is the rudeness and ignorance of staff at reception and at breakfast. Arrival: We arrived with taxi early in the morning (the taxi ride from airport costs approx. $20), and were advised by porters to take lift to level 4 to reception. One of the first things we noticed was that reception had about 8 counters, but only 3 staff manning them. After having stood in a queue for 15 minutes, we were finally served, yet check in took another 15 minutes- no smiles and at times rude behaviour, made me recount (and agree with) the Tripadvisor reviews suggesting check in was a drama. And right they were! Breakfast: you need to agree to sign up for each day and then they will charge you $30 only> Otherwise it is $47. We only agreed for convenience, but the breakfast is uneventful (especially for vegetarians), and it is very hard to get a cup of coffee. Staff just don't seem to be bothered to help guests, and they look like they don't want to be there. Don't expect any smiles and friendly service here (even though it is the norm everywhere else in Singapore). The selection of fruits is very limited (unlike the Mandarin Oriental next door). Staff tell you where to sit- and actually argue with you if you suggest a different seat (perhaps for more privacy, out of the sun or whatever) - very annoying. Room 905: clean, spacious, safe that worked, beautiful bathroom (excellent water pressure). View over city. Very happy with the room. Wifi: Very expensive if not included in your package, and a hassle to have to call 'o' each day to get a new code. Twice code did not work. I reported it once and they promised to call back, but they did not. Disappointing. Internet pretty slow. Business Centre: To print of a document (black/white) the Marina charges $2 per page - very vey expensive Housekeeping: Perfect. No complaints. Housekeeping staff were friendly and very thorough. Room always very tidy - bottles of complementary water replenished each day. Bar (on fourth floor): at night there is live music (piano music with singer) - yes I could hear it in my room, but not really loudly. Indeed I thought it was quite pleasant. The bar area itself is very nice and at two occasions did we have drinks here. It's expensive, but a lovely place to unwind after a busy day (if you like cocktails I recommend the skinny Hendriks). Bar staff are friendly. Swimming pool (fifth floor): not big, but big enough to do laps. Not very busy early mornings or late afternoons. Plenty of lounge chairs to lie down out of the sun. Towels provided. Location: my colleagues and I were attending a conference at the Suntec. The Marina Mandarin was an excellent location. Take the lift to level four, then steps down to level 3 to a door which takes you to the Marina Square shopping centre. From here you follow the signs to Pan Pacific Hotel and the Suntec. Very easy walk in air-conditioned mall for about 5-10 minutes. Due to its location would I consider staying here again, for business only. I will be visiting Singapore with my partner in a few a months, for leisure this time, and shall not be staying at this hotel. When on holiday I do not want to have to put up with unwelcoming and unhelpful staff, especially considering the price you pay at the Marina, and the excellent service you get elsewhere in Singapore. I am surprised the Marina's Manager has not addressed the issues at reception and in the breakfast area, considering the many reviews highlighting these particular shortcomings. Thus my recommendation: the hotel is ok if you are attending a conference in the Suntec, but if you are going to Singapore for leisure, you're better off elsewhere.

Superficially, the hotel is what one should expect of a five star property. It is underneath the surface that flaws are discovered; and these flaws can be corrected if the hotel management chooses to do so. I stayed at the Merits Club level, which I thought was a benefit. It was expensive (S$500/day), but given the prices for meals and drinks, this was worth it. We had cooked breakfast daily, and cocktails with appetizers in the early evening daily. The charges for breakfast alone would have been well over S$45, and the glasses of wine would be over S$20 each. So the costs rapidly add up in Singapore. Additionally, the Meritas Club entitles one to free Internet access, which also saved. The Club Level staff were spectacular. The most friendly I have experienced at any concierge level at any hotel. The rooms were very clean and elegant. All the emenities that one would expect at this price, including bathroom toiletries, etc. I found that the room was always too cool even if the AC was on the warmest setting. The only thing one could do would be to turn the entire power down in the room, which led to the room warming too much. So one must adjust to this. The in room coffe was the best I have ever experienced anywhere. I went to one restaurant at the hotel, which turned out to be a mistake. The restaurant was Peach Blossums. The service was horrible and the food bad. The wait staff offered the upscale full dining menu without also offereing the lunch menu (we were there for lunch). Not knowing better we ordered from the more expensive menu. When we asked for explanations concerning the entres, the wait staff could not explain the dishes. It was a real mess. I noted also that this restaurant serves shark fin dishes. I was astonished that in Singapore, and at a world class hotel, that shark fin was still available given the world outcry over the decimation of the worlds shark population and the UN stance against shark finning. I spoke with the management of the restaurant about this, and all they could say was they \"were discussing it\". I was really surprised the Mandarin would allow this practice at their facility, and I take it that the Mandarin Chain supports shark finning as a result of allowing the menu to include shark fin items. The fitness gym was adequate for the hotel, but nothing to brag about. Most of the equipment, including free weights and resistance machines with cardio machines, was dated. I suspect most of the equipment was acquired used. Many of the free weights, such as dumbbells, were mismatched. There were no medicine balls or exercise balls available. This is a cosmopolitan hotel catering to an international clientele. The sister hotel Mandarin Oriental is within easy walking distance.

The food is excellent and the average price for a main course is about \u00a33 or less. Outside the Mall, towards the marina, is a small hawker market, where the food is almost as plentiful, just as good, and almost as cheap. Many locals eat in the food court and the hawker market, a sure sign of both quality and value. We could not fault the Marina Mandarin for comfort, quality and service. It is well-placed, just 3 minutes from the marina and about 5 minutes from Raffles Hotel and the Padang.

Firstly, the location of the hotel is excellent and central to restaurants and attractions in Singapore. The taxi ride from the airport was about 15 minutes and costing about $15-20 Singapore dollars. We had stayed at this hotel before and had booked an upper floor suite. This time, we booked a standard room on one of the medium floors. The good: - The MRT train station is a short 10 minute walk through an underground walkway with many shops. - The hotel is connected to a large shopping mall with good restaurants and shops - The room we got was clean and spacious with a comfy bed. The bathroom was big with both a standing shower and a bathtub. - The lobby is quite grand. With a comfortable lounge area - Breakfast is a typical buffet with a decent variety of Eastern and Western foods The bad: - When you enter the hotel, to get to the reception you must first take an elevator to the proper floor where reception is located. - Our check in took 25 minutes. The receptionist was cordial but took a long time to find us a room. At one point she left us and returned 10 minutes later with no explanation. (For travelers who have come off a long flight, this was annoying) ** This was also a stark contrast to our previous visit checking into a suite, where there is a private check in area, which is quick and efficient. - The hotel is what I would describe as open air in the sense that if you look down from the hallway, you can see all the way down to reception no matter what floor you are on. This may sound cool; however it becomes an annoyance in the evening when the noise from the lounge area permeates the walls and into your room. It was difficult to fall asleep during the first night, - For a tip on the rooms, try to get a room on the upper floors as our mid floor, city view room really had no view except the building that was across the street Overall: - I think you can tell a lot about a hotel by the different experiences that they provide to you depending on what room you book. The difference in booking a suite and a standard room is vast. While obviously the experience would be different, the level of satisfaction that you have with your experience should be the same no matter what room you book. - This hotel is a 4 star hotel masquerading as a 5 star hotel. It is a business hotel with impersonal yet professional service. - This hotel would be suitable for business travelers, however expect to pay a premium no matter what room you book - On our next trip, we would opt for other hotels in the area that provide better value and experiences for the premium that the hotel charges.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cExcellent City Location & Great value for Money\u201d", "Author": "masgendut", "ReviewID": "UR124511144", "Content": "Pretty much every thing about this hotel is great.

The atrium of the hotel was enormous and had birds chirping all day. I used the gym and pool every day, the water in the pool was the softest i have ever swam in and i swim a lot. The service was first class, nothing was a trouble to do and the staff were so polite and helpful. This was my third visit to singapore and i loved it, the accomodation was first class. The position of the hotel is fantastic, just a short walk from everywhere including train station and the underground shopping centres.

The good reasons for staying at this hotel were still there but unfortunately wasnt impressed with there service or rooms this time. It's very easy to get tothehotel, you can take a shuttle that Drops Youat the hotel (ask customer service) it will cost you about S$ 9, or you can take their SMRT. Singapore metro train, there is a stop right beside the hotel ESPLANADE, it will only cost you S$3.20, dont forget to get a refund for your metro cards afters, youget a dollar back. The bedroom part was neatand clean. The bathroom was another story, when you filled up the tub, there were little black things floating in the water.... And the shower had black molds in the corner, the door of the shower would not shut properly so we always had this big puddle after we used the showers. When we told the reception, they made a note of it and had their cleaning staff clean it thoroughly, they address the tub! But not the mold part. The duvet which is common in hotels, can get too warm at night, so just ask for a sheet which they will provide immediately. The breakfast we found was ok, if your paying for it its not worth the S$35. No love for bacon lovers! The hotel is attached to suntec and marina square mall, so you will enjoy shopping if your not up for orchard road. Theres a Starbucks across the street, carls jr. Burger place beside it. All opens at 10. An irish pub is just around the corner and a row of local restaurant. 7/11 in the walkway to the trains If you want to try the local singapore cuisine, theres one just stone throw away, apparently alot of tourist come here and the prices are cheap. If your going to universal theres a shuttle that picks you up at the hotel and drops you off too.. Free for tourist. Internet is fast, but if its not included in your package its $31 for 24 hours i think and its $10 for 1 hour. Good points of the hotel its great place to be if your always on the move, if you dont like to eat at the hotel there hundred to choose from just outside the hotel. MBS is across the marina. Its very accessible by train, and most tourist spot. Staff is willing to do everything they can to make your stay enjoyable.

Our view of the Singapore skyline was superb and the room was able to easily accommodate a rollaway bed for our 11 year old, at no additional charge. Check-in was swift and painless with our bags arriving 10 seconds after us. By the time we had unpacked and scrubbed up it was almost 10.30 and there was nowhere open in the hotel where we could have a proper meal except a very impersonal seating area on the reception floor that was more of a bar area. Normally I would deduct a star for such a failing , it was only 10.30 after all, but the Concierge came to our rescue with a half a dozen outside alternatives including free transport in a hotel limo! We opted for the Thai joint across the street and had some of the best tasting and authentic Thai food I have ever sampled outside Bangkok. Breakfast was always a great experience and I came away hooked on omelettes a la Marina Mandarin - they are seriously good and perfectly cooked. The coffee was also the best I had tasted on our 15 day trip. Chinese New Year was in full swing during our stay and the hotel was in the forefront of local revelry as they introduced us to the Year of the Dragon with very entertaining displays. It was good to see the GM of the hotel in attendance resplendent in Mandarin coat! Although we didn't have occasion to usetoo many of the hotels services we were impressed by what we saw and the attention to detail made by the staff. Our room was in excellent condition and the only gripe was when we wanted to use more than one laptop or IPad, extra charges would be incurred and new passwords were required. This waqs all quite irksome as on most occasions the password never worked so we had to call the operator very frequent for yet another new password.

As it was the NY eve, the price was jacked up but looking at the food choices, was disappointing - seafood was only served during dinner. If there were specialities served in the buffet, definitely couldn't tell. Breakfast was at the same place too but has more variety to choose from. Apart from the food, another minus is the link from hotel to the Marina Square mall. Since there wasn't a direct lift landing, we had to walk down the staircase carrying down the stroller to the 3rd floor - short cut.

The trip is a celebration of our wedding anniversary as well as an annual holiday. \u00a0From before check-in to date, the experience has consistently been lacking. A combination of major and minor issues add up to an extremely annoying experience: 1.\u00a0Prior to leaving India, I called to ask for the rates for upgrade. I was informed that for an additional SG 50 per night, we would have a breakfast inclusive upgrade to the next category. When I called back to confirm, a different person answered and informed me that this offer would only be presented to us at check in if there was availability. When we arrived, the lady informed us that due to New Year's they would not be able to upgrade although there was availability as mentioned by previous reps (who were aware of our booking dates) and we would have to pay an additional SG 900. 3 people- 3 different answers.\u00a0 2.\u00a0At check in, we reached early so were told room wasn't ready. Fair enough, except the lady checking us in refused to confirm the check in time. Although hotel check in time was 2pm, she kept saying the room would not be ready by then as there were too many guests. Apparently, it didn't matter that we were guests and had a baby with us. I had to speak sternly before she finally agreed to have the room ready at the time that the hotel policy specified.\u00a0 3.\u00a0Housekeeping's idea of cleaning the room is making the bed and maybe cleaning the bathroom. Floor had not been vacuumed...I could tell because I'd accidentally spilled some baby formula, which was still there when we came back at night 4. Housekeeping also made the bed, but left the pillows and cover on the floor for us to pick up. Dirty plate was not picked up, but nicely rearranged 5. Some channels in the TV have bad reception 6. They also had a hot water problem- the water became tepid while I was bathing my baby 7. Drilling noise (related to New Year Eve celebrations) woke baby from nap. Issue was fixed, but damage was done 8. Shower makes keening noise. Housekeeping came to fix it and \u00a0succeeded...in making it less loud 9. We ordered jam for some croissants we'd gotten from outside, and they charged SG $2. This after we were paying SG $1800 for 4 nights 10. When they made our bed, they did not bother to make or change the sheets in the baby's cot 11. When asked to change the baby cot sheets, they forgot. After we came back and it was time for baby to sleep...sheets weren't changed so called again 12. When they finally showed up to change the sheets, the housekeeping personnel rang the bell. Before I could get up..in 2 secs..rang the bell again and before I could reach the door, in less than 10 secs, opened the door himself 13. On New Year's Eve, we were dining in-room due to the baby and requested 2 candles. Apparently these present a fire hazard, so the hotel does not keep 2 candles. However, they keep birthday candles. I guess these do not present a fire hazard??! 14. We had called from India to check if the hotel could provide a bottle sterilizer, so we would not have to lug it all the way and carry a large suitcase. Staff insisted this was unavailable, but of course when we got here, we found the hotel can provide these 15. The guest services manager, Mr. Senthil, was nice enough to sympathize and sent across a bottle of wine. Housekeeping forgot to bring the wine opener. Small detail, but with luxury hotels, details count Rooms are nice and location is good, but poor attention to detail means you are better off elsewhere.

We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the finish line at Padang. It was actually less than 10 minutes walk which is a great recovery walk after a 42K run. Fortunately, the room had a bathtub which is great for soaking tired legs in cold water. During our stay, we discovered Marina Square (beside the hotel), a mall where you can find just about any retail store or restaurant. There is an outlet of the famous Wee Nam Kee chicken rice there but I've tasted better in other chicken rice places. I have been to Singapore many times and Marina Square is a good new find. The hotel is also walking distance to Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade, Suntec City and Funan Mall. It's also beside the Esplanade MTR Station and near the City Hall MTR Station connected via an underground link that has shops and restaurants. An MTR station is a great take-off point for exploring other parts of Singapore. Aside from the great location and the view of the harbor from our room (we paid additional SGD30 a night), I can't say much about the value. The hotel itself looks like it was built in the 70s and has probably reached its peak renovation potential. In a country where technology is advanced, there is no free wi-fi in the rooms. They did not give us newspaper everyday even if I saw newspaper in other rooms. The Ala Carte breakfast we ordered at the outlet took ages to arrive as if forcing us to just take their buffet breakfast. And the price wasn't worth it at all. There are many places around where you can get a substantial breakfast if you are not really a breakfast person. Overall, I still give Marina Mandarin a very good rating. The hotel in general and our room is clean. The bed and pillows are comfortable. The airconditioning is superb. Everything in the bathroom works perfectly. They bring you bottled water twice a day. And lastly, the doorman was very helpful. He pointed our taxi driver to which airport terminal to drop us off.

The best of the hotel is the first class service and the friendly and courteous staff - everybody tries to do the best and to satisfy the guests' needs and requests. Nothing seems to be impossible. The hotel is situated in the very center of the Marina and therefore ideal as a starting point for visiting the city; it is directly connected to the Marina Square Shopping Mall, to Suntec City and to public transportation.

Notwithstanding that Singapore hardly has a festive feel about it in a 32degC heat. But worst of all were the piped bird sounds. Now these seem to be on all day and can be heard everywhere including inside your room. So when I was laying in bed at 8AM then it was unnerving at best and downright annoying at worst - preventing me from dozing off again. I was contemplating ringing the concierge for a shotgun but I guess he wouldn't have got the sarcasm. Apart from this major downer there was one high point but it is possibly a personal thing - corned beef hash at the breakfast buffet! This took me back to camping expeditions as a child/young adult and I couldn't get enough of it. Superbly done. Imagine my disappointment when it wasn't on the counter for the second day of my stay. Other points are that the air con is too noisy. The control is either 'on' or 'off' and the 'on' position is too loud to go to sleep. Fortunately the room temperature was OK with the A/C off. Also why would I have to pay for wifi in the room but it is free if I went downstairs to sit in the lounge? Surely this is inconsistant?

When I stepped in, I saw several tiny fruit flies perched on the terry bathrobe and the underside of the towels on the rack. Also, there were occasional plumbing-like/or aircon? noises from the toilet throughout the night. - depending on which side you face (my room on the 17th flr was facing gardens by the bay as well as the highway, it can be pretty noisy at night.

I interacted with many of them over the course of my stay, and all of them seem to be unhappy and agitated. The service is not 5 star service. Some other negative points: if you want to get breakfast for the reduced rate of SGD 30 you need to commit to it for every morning of your stay when you arrive, the details of order and cleanliness are missing (chipped tiles in the bathroom, mold in the shower, WiFi not working in all the room, hairs in the bathroom, toothpaste from other guests left behind), the vent to the kitchen blasts out by the pool area thus you smell food exhaust while swimming, grimy cabanas for changing your clothes, not having rooms ready for guests having requested afternoon check in (happened to several colleagues), breakfast buffet is cheap food although with many options, non-smoking rooms smell like smoke. Positives: they will open the gym at any time for you, WiFi for free in rooms when you request a code everyday from the front desk, location, and cost of the hotel (although you can get good rates at better hotels elsewhere).

This was to take 20 mins but after returning to our room 5 hours later their machine was still running.. Making it now smell like the swimming pool.

One more suggestion, they should also employ some outstanding door men to give it some glitz.

It did lack a few amenities, like a sewing kit, which was of course needed when one was not there. There was very little local information in the room also. I like when hotels provide magazines in the room. We had an amazing time, and the food was excellent also. Over priced I thought at the pool but then I guess most hotels do over charge at the pool. The pool is great, very clean and pool towels are supplied. Our checkout experience was not as great however, We got charged for internet use, apparently it was free for only 12 hours per day. Also the Valet parking of the car was not free either, it is free if we parked in the car park ourselves. No one told us that. They also checked us out of our room at 2 pm and not 3 pm as advised. They did allow us to stay until 3 however again another mis communication. Now the charges for the internet and parking were not high and this is not my issue, my issue is the mis communication of information and than the lack of understanding when we question it.

Good food and healthy drinks, a little bit pricey but reasonable.

The room that we stayed is directly facing the Marina Sands Hotel and Convention Center, thus, i have all the time and the view to click my new Nikon D5000 all throughout the day. The night view is very spectacular! SO I ADVISE YOU to get rooms with the view of The Sands. Although we did not avail of the food or eat at the hotel restaurants during our stay, there are so many restaurants at the Marina Square Mall just adjacent to the hotel, and one can enter the mall without going outside the hotel first coz they have a 'secret' door to the mall. Infront of the mall is the Suntec Convention Center where restos and shops abound. The biggest fountain in the world (?) is also in this area.

Just one thing which I feel needs to be improved - the pay TV. They have some in-house \"Adult movies\" for viewing at $19++ per show. I actually chose one of it and to my horror after selecting, I realised that it was a very outdated, 1970s, possibly 1960s production. Moreover, the contents in it can hardly be classified as \"Adult\" in today's context. I switched off the TV after 15 minutes. It was a big turnoff.

From the first moment where the porters relieved us of our luggage, to the ease of check in with the friendly, polite and flexible staff (and we did test the poor lady, requesting upgrades,daily breakfast, earlier check in and late check out!) we knew we were in excellent and capable hands. We were in a Premier room on the 19th floor and the view of the Marina Bay Sands and the bay we were given was breathtaking. Our bathroom was pristine white and modern with separate shower AND combined shower/bath. The room itself was spotless, comfortable and had charming decor, the bed was large and comfortable. The room service staff were practically on first name basis with us through our time stayed as we ordered food and dessert once or twice, chose contour pillows off the pillow menu and requested ice and internet codes almost daily. Not once did we find a cause to complain and it was never too much trouble for any of the staff. The highlight of our stay in the hotel was definitely the 3rd night in. It was my Partner Tims birthday and i'd taken him out for a dinner on the Singapore Flyer. Concierge (Arjay i believe the name was?) had eagerly helped me arrange a limo taxi to chauffeur us there and back. When we returned around 9pm at night we'd found that the room had been freshened again AND a beautiful birthday cake had been left for Tim with a candle. I was taken aback with how thoughtful and kind that small gesture was and it really hit home just how high the quality of the hotel we were staying in was. Other highlights of our stay include: -The daily buffet breakfast (i was dubious at first considering it was $30SGD a day p/p, but even now a fortnight later my mouth waters over the plentiful offerings and I can say it was worth every penny) -Ease of getting taxis (our longest wait was around 3 minutes) -Excellent location -Amazing Day Spa -Sound of live birds singing throughout the atrium-couldn't ask for a better wake up call! Im struggling to find a negative thing to say about the Marina Mandarin Singapore. Maybe the wait of the elevators to your room? Or that one day that we didnt have our soap replaced?

On our first visit we were greeted at the reception by very friendly and curtious staff. I asked if the room was non smoking (as we had had problems previously at another hotel). As the room was not classiefied as non smoking I was assured that there was no problem but if I was concerned I was welcome to see the room first and if I was not happy they would try and move us even though they were heavily booked. The receptionist was very curtious and arranged for us to be taken to the room. We were also accompanied by the Duty Manager. The room was excellent with a great view over the bay and to the new Casino. There was no smell of smoke and very clean. We took the room and our bags were delivered promptly. We were very surprised when an Ioniser was delivered and plugged in the room, just in case we were still concerned about the room. We spent a pleasant night there and left for London the next day. We completed a questionaire that is left and thanked the hotel for the service and that we were very pleased. On arriving in the UK I was surprised to find on my e-mails a reply from the General Manager thanking us for our comments and saying if we ever wanted anything again to let him know. As we had not booked our return hotel we contacted Singapore Stopover and booked this hotel for our return. I took the Manager up on his offer and e-mailed him to say we were returning in a few weeks. As we were arriving from London early in the morning I asked if would be able to book in early, and how much we liked the room we had previously. I had a very quick reply saying he had arranged that for us and also we would be given the same room, I also noticed that he had sent copies to other staff members. On our return in October we arrived at the Hotel at 9am and hoping to be able to get in the room early (which I thought might be an hour or so before normal booking in) we were very grateful to find it had all been arranged and we could go straight to our room. The receptionist said she was sorry but we could not have that same room as we had before as it was booked, but they had moved us up to the executive floor in an identical room and position in the hotel. How lovely it was to be able to collapse straight into bed and have 4hrs sleep to recover from a tiring flight. We spent another very enjoable stay in this hotel and found all the staff attentive and very helpful. This Hotel is situated in a lovely area overlooking Marina Bay with the Merlion and the new Casino and plenty of places to eat. On the lower leval below the Hotel is a very nice shopping centre with a wide selection of shopping available if you want it. The Hotel itself has a good range of restaurants and a lovely swimming pool, all you need for a very relaxing stay. As we were with Singapore Stopover we are taken to the Hotel and returned to the airport. Another bonus we found is that even though we were leaving late in the evening way after booking out you can leave your baggage there securely in the Hotel and collect it just before you are picked up. Really great if as with us you want to explore Singapore without having to trail cases behnd you.

Upon finding out that our flight was only at 10pm the next evening, they extended our check-out till 6pm and even allowed us access to the club lounge (evening canapes + cocktails, etc.) right up to the time we had to get to the airport.

I've had much better breakfasts at both the Pan Pacific and Hilton Singapore.

The hotel is well located being about a 10 minute taxi ride from the main Orchard Road shopping area and the business CBD. Unless you spend all of your time in the connected Mall you will need to use taxis or the subway to get out and about, but taxis are plentiful (when its not raining) and cheap in Singapore, so its very easy to get around. The hotel is connected directly to the large Marina Square shopping mall which incorporates all of the shops found in most of the malls in Singapore.The mall also has plenty of eating options ranging from western style casual dining restaurants through to a large food hall that sells the full range of local dishes (in fact there is an up market and basic food hall). There is no supermarket in the mall however there is a 7 Eleven and a very large supermarket can be reached in the adjacent Suntec City mall which is about a 20 minute walk through connected malls. The Marina Square mall also has direct access to the subway (a part of the Suntec City mall) which is about a 10 minute walk, although you never need to go outside into the heat to get there. Alternatively you could also take a 20 minute walk to the City Hall subway located in the Raffles City mall via the CityWalk underground shopping arcade. The hotel itself is large and typcally Singaporian offerring good service and reasonable food. But as with most Singapore hotels they do a far better job at cooking up local dishes than western. I found the quality of room service food adequate at best. The rooms are pretty much as they look on the hotel web site but I didnt think they were as new and fresh as the pictures indicated. But they were of a good size and quality and unlike many comparible hotels, the air conditioning in the room actually worked well. A little warmer out in the hotel atrium but still quite comfortable. My only complaint was that I couldnt get internet access to work and had to head down to Starbucks everyday to get connected.

Hundreds of rooms located all around you in a fabulous atrium design. 4 panoramic elevators located in the center of the atrium takes you to your floor and an an additional 2 or 3 minutes walk is required to reach the room. the view from the inner atrium floor balconies is really nice when you look downward. You automatically notice the colored design of the magnificent reception area.You won;t notice that as you would be standing on it, you have to go up. One very negative thing about all this is the heat. Temperature is very high throughout the hotel common spaces and you literally sweat while going from your room to the lobby. At the end of the journey you just run to the indoor space where breakfast is served because you can't take the heat or even the humidity. 2- Location The hotel is definitely located at a great location at the Marina in Singapore. It is just a short walk away from the Marina Bay Sands one of the best locations around Singapore. At the Marina Bay Sands, you can find the huge brands mall from Prada to Louis Vuitton. even if you are not a buyer, you can definitely enjoy that luxurious place from window shopping to a stop at one of the great restaurants on menu. All of you gambling lovers, make sure you hit the casino just a short walk away fro some really nice fun. Entrance is free for all foreigners upon showing your passport. Just 30 sec away on foot to the East of the hotel you will find the Marina Square mall. a great place to shop all brands you can expect.. The west side is filled with cafes and pubs where one can enjoy the great tastes of south Asian fast food or the soothing drinks of the Irish Pub. 3- Rooms The rooms in the hotel are spacious but old. You can automatically see this through the design of the walls and the colors used: mainly brown, beige and white. Rooms are definitely clean and get cleaned in a great way while on service. I have not noticed any dirt even in the corners or in tight places on or around beds. My view was magnificent on the marina bay sands and the surrounding area. A great way to wake up in the morning looking at that view. But the balconies are tiny and you can barely fit yourself outside. the doors to the balconies have a hook which keeps them locked. Going back into the room, I was surprised to see that my TV remote was completely torn apart and it was held together by pieces of adhesive glues. Rooms and appliances needs update or renewal. 4- Staff Can't comment much on staff as the friendliness which I experienced is a cultural fundamental in the country. Everybody is very friendly and civilized. Everybody smiles to you and greet you even strangers on the street. Our chauffeur from the airport was great in greeting us and showing us around.the staff at the reception were by far better than the best hotels in Europe and the US. Compliments to a great spirit and wonderful faces and smiles you get surrounded with. 5- Price From a price perspective, I was paying SDG 340 for a deluxe room/nigh inclusive of free internet and daily breakfast exclusive of taxes. Not a very reasonable price, but payable taken into consideration that it is a 5 star hotel with great service.

We had coffees which cost S$15-very nice coffees but still pretty pricey, cocktails were expensive and, again as per a previous reviewer, the breakfasts very expensive for what they were. There was a good choice of coffeeshops locally though as an alternative. We would book to go there again-don't miss the very relaxing pool area which I think was on the 5th floor- and we would definitely recommend it to others. One other thing - if you are thinking of booking the night safari take into account whether you have been on a safari before or visited really good zoos as it is very tame with one or two of a limited variety of very unthrilling animals. Great if you or your children haven't had much contact with wildlife but otherwise I would give it a miss. If you do go book the optional dinner as it is a very, very good buffet and well worth it!", "Date": "March 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kolkata (Calcutta), India", "Title": "\u201cRooms are excellent and location brilliant\u201d", "Author": "Blue10122", "ReviewID": "UR98322461", "Content": "I stayed at the suite room.

A very good start began with our taxi driver who was keen to know about our own country and way of life and who gave a very good running commentary on the sites from the airport to the hotel. On arrival, met by very helpful porters and the most charming receptionist who advised that we had been given an executive upgrade. What a start. Got to our room and on entry....wow...what a view of the harbour. Suitcases soon followed. After shower, checked out the hotel facilities which included a huge foyer area with several restaurants and bar. Also checked out pool area, which looked most inviting (but with only approx 1.5 days, never got the chance to use it). Following my spilling red wine all over clothes on the flight from Dubai ( I nodded off with the glass in my hand....what an idiot!) I called housekeeping and gave them jacket and trousers.....it was returned that evening and was absolutely immaculate! We only ate at breakfast in hotel which had quite a variety to choose from to satisfy all tastes and cultures (including curries) and eggs cooked to order. Drinks at the hotel were quite expensive, so apart from first evening, we drank elsewhere (Durty Nellys around the corner is worth a try). There is quite a large shopping mall at the base of the hotel which has a food court and I would certainly recommend the \"Hotpot\". We arrived fairly late and the owner himself sat us down and explained what and how to eat. Basically we were given a stockpot on a burner with a selection of raw meats, fish and vegetables. The owner helped us and placed the food in the pot to cook at different intervals. It was absolute heaven and reasonably priced. The hotel is a very short walk to the harbour and for the Hop On/Hop On bus tour stop at the Singapore Flyer. Overall, we were well pleased with our choice of hotel , the standard of service and the charming hotel staff and would certainly stay here again. The only (slight) criticism is that our room furnishing and bathroom fittings was a little dated (but absolutely spotless).

Upon arriving at the hotel by taxi, it was still necessary to go up by elevator to level 4 to get to the reception area for check-in. The reception area seemed quite large and grand and the attendant was friendly with the right approach and generally the experience was professionally handled. I was upgraded to the next class of room, which was the executive deluxe room. I found the room to be quite modern and not dated at all, as suggested in previous reviews. Firstly, the furniture was new and in good condition. The wardrobe was also new-style and the carpet was also clean. Perhaps the executive deluxe rooms look quite different from the deluxe rooms. The room had a balcony which in my case was reasonably large but there weren\u2019t any places to sit. My room had a nice view over the Suntec area and the other hotels within the area. The room was around medium-size, not the largest room I have stayed in within Singapore but still quite generously proportioned. The room was clean and the bed was also comfortable. The TV was an LCD-type and modern. The bathroom was large with a separate shower and bathtub. It was the only area of the room which could be described as being slightly dated. The granite or stone on the bench was also chipped or else worn. However, it was still maintained in a very clean condition. The toiletries in the bathroom were quite standard and perhaps not the best that could be expected in a hotel of this class. The public areas of the hotel were perhaps slightly dated but this wasn\u2019t an issue for me. The open atrium was appreciated and it contributed to the feeling of spaciousness within the hotel. I was located on quite a high floor, being in an executive deluxe room, so I didn\u2019t experience much noise from the atrium or externally. The location of the hotel was good and convenient, as is often the case in Singapore. There was a large shopping mall connected by a door to the hotel area, which I took advantage of. I thought the Marina Square shopping mall was quite an upmarket one and had a good foodcourt as well. At the time of stay, the MRT stations nearby for the Circle Line weren\u2019t open but I can imagine how they would add to the convenience of the hotel\u2019s location. I had dinner through the room service, which was just the standard burger with fries with a drink and soup. The meal was definitely above-average in quality and not too pricey. I caught a taxi twice from the hotel and the staff helping with that didn\u2019t seem particularly friendly. They didn\u2019t come across as being the most approachable or pleasant in getting me into the taxi car and out. The check-out was a good experience, there was a management member on the reception level who offered to help with my luggage. Overall, the hotel offered quite a satisfying experience.

The location of the hotel is not the easiest to deal with if you don't know your way around Singapore, but if you're there for a leisure or shopping trip, do not worry, as every nearby mrt station is link by shopping malls (though it could be quite a bit of a walk). All in all not a very suitable hotel for elderly as it can be quite a walk everywhere with a lot of stairs. The room is very comfortable though the bed is not the biggest we've ever seen. The bathroom perhaps a bit dated but still very comfortable and very clean. We also ask for several items through the housekeeping and they're always prompt with our request. The room service is very hard to get hold of (we tried calling several times and always getting a busy tone - in the end my partner decided to call the operator and problem solved - there's always someone to take our order if we placed it through the operator).

There was also a huge balcony. The bathroom was huge with a bathtub and an adjoining shower and his and hers sinks along one huge vanity. Since we only had one day in Singapore, we didn't spend a bunch of time in the hotel, but enjoyed it nonetheless. One of the great perks is that the hotel is linked to the Marina Square Mall.

But it was too late,I rejected him as he wasn't there when we needed him most, so we continue to drag everything to the 4th floor reception and to our room. Check in process was quite smooth.

It was quite noisy in the morning and afternoon as it is near the exit and maybe the housekeeping storeroom, I can hear the staff talking and the opening and closing of doors. We were very disappointed to find that the TV wasn't working, and two of the sockets on the wall were also not working. It was late and we were tired, so we didn't let them know till the next day.

However, when we told them, the problem were fixed and I was happy again. Until this morning when I woke up to no electricity. Something tripped the power overnight. I immediately phoned the service line and they sent a someone immediately to fix it. Internet PLEASE Be careful! They charge per device! Its $20+ per device per 24 hours, which i find quite ridiculous. As we had a few devices, the internet charges came to $88 per day. so that will mean that 4 nights stay, internet will be $352????!!!! We went straight to reception on the 2nd day after realizing this, after much haggling and waiting, they finally decide to give us a discount, but told us firmly. \"We are only doing this this stay, not for the next one, you have to pay for everything the next time\".

Club room- Lovely modern decor with large comfortable beds, well equipped with a nespresso machine, large screen TV and surround sound system. There's a free DVD rental service at the club lounge with a decent selection of movies. Dim the lights, turn up the sound, and you lying down in your own cinema. Cocktails at the club lounge provides a good selection of finger food and the staff are friendly and courteous. Toiletries were high end- crabtree and evelyn on one occasion. They leave chocolates/ sweets on your bed which was a nice touch. Room service was good - they acceded to requests to whip up items that were not on the menu. The only negative thing that I had to say about the club room stays was this - We unintentionally left 2 pieces of clothing in the hotel closet when we checked out. These items had been laundered at the hotel and were still in their plastic covers tagged with our hotel room number. I only realised this two weeks after and called the hotel up. The hotel staff then confirmed that our items were in their store and we had to go down to retrieve them. I was quite surprised that there wasn't a service to call us up to inform us of the items that we had left behind, considering that we stay in Singapore. Suite- Somehow we had a very disappointing experience during this stay. Firstly, our room was not ready till 2 hours after check in. So we were lodged in a club room initially. This was inconvenient because we were travelling with a baby and we couldn't unpack and fully unwind in the temporary room. The non-smoking suite, when it was finally ready, reeked of smoke and we had to keep the balcony doors open in an attempt to clear the air. When we complained, housekeeping brought in an air ioniser which helped a little. The decor of the suite was rather simple and did not have a DVD player and surround sound system. Housekeeping staff had a tendency to knock just once and swipe open the door without waiting for even a second for a response. Perhaps that was our fault for not keeping the DND sign on all the time. Overall: We'd still return again because the club rooms were THAT good. It's location is great for shopping and dining out. Just a few steps down and you have access to 2 large shopping malls and the subway.

Would like to highly recommend a visit to the new show \"voyage de lavi\" - showing at the venue beside sentosa casino. Its spectacular. Get the green seats for around S$100 each. Just ask the taxi to take you to sentosa casino, walk in and you will see the signs to it. Showtimes on weekends were 7.30pm and 9.30pm for memory.

The hotel is situated in one of Singapore top spots near Esplanade, The Suntec City and The Singapore Flyer at Marina Bay. It's also good that it faces the skyscrapers of the financial district, which is located on the other bank of Singapore river mouth. So, you can get the spectacular view from your balcony, especially when you're on the top floors. The rooms in the hotel are rather big which is not usual thing in most of Singapore hotels. If I'm not mistaken, now after the opening of circle line of MRT, the subway station is also several minutes on foot from the hotel. 2 years ago it took about 10-12 minutes to get the City Hall station, but all the way you could go by the underpass with a/c. Nevertheless, I think that it's usual for Singapore when you spend in the hotel only nights, so, booking an expensive hotel may pay the cost when you can really afford this or when you have a good reason as honeymoon:) If I remember, we've payed about US$180 per night for standard room, but we had some benefits, because we booked the hotel by the Singapore Airlines programme \"Singapore Stopover Holiday\".

The breakfast was just ok, the lobby bar is ruinously expensive and the housekeeping was very hit and miss. The food at Peach Blossoms (the supposedly Cantonese restaurant on level 5) was nothing short of apalling.

The room was large enough for our luggage and the hotel's baby crib which was great. But what made the Marina M stand out in our memory was the terrible service esp from its housekeeping department. We noticed a trend in Singapore's hospitality industry in recent years. Mainland Chinese have taken over most of the menial jobs. While I welcome the influx of cheaper labour, what Marina M doesn't realize is that they bring along tardy service standards and a poor command of English. On 2 separate incidents with housekeeping, it took an hour and 3 phone calls with each incident. #1. I requested for a hot water flask to hold boiling water as I have an infant on formula milk and I'm against leaving hot water in a plastic jug. It didn't arrive. On calling back, I was told that they didn't have it. \"What? Don't the restaurants downstairs have them?\" \"No... the restaurants and housekeeping are separate units.\" \"I don't care about your hotel's bureaucracy, just get me one\". By then, my baby was screaming. They called me back 15min later. \"the flask in your room is made from metal (when I told her of my aversion towards plastic & boiling water)\" \"$@%! the freaking kettle is made of plastic!!\" I was positively livid by now. Finally, after 3 calls and nearly an hour later, lo and behold, a little thermos flask was delivered by a staff without so much as a word or smile. #2. (There was a nice Hitachhi flatscreen tv in the room. Not bad. Except that they have either streamed the hotel channels with analog cables or the settings are totally off. The picture quality was totally awful & pixelated. The in-house remote control was also crap as it doesn't have a numeric keypad - which means that one has to scroll through 20 channels to reach number 21. But that's not the point.) There was something wrong with the control, so I thought batteries had run of juice perhaps. I called service desk who then relayed to Housekeeping my request for batteries. 20min later, I called again. Where's the guy? and then 30min again. Finally, a mainland Chinese staff came up. When I asked what caused the delay, he asked if I spoke Chinese. Sure, I'm ethnic Chinese. Even then, I got no satisfactory answer on why housekeeping took a whole hour in a late afternoon to respond to my needs. The last incident was regarding Conceige. Checking out, my husband called for a trolley as we had 8 pieces of luggage. It took 30min(!!) to arrive in our room. The buffet breakfast was below average from a so-called 5 star hotel's standard. Everyday for 3 days, the smoked salmon wasn't replenished once the little plate was emptied. Lattes or capuccinos came from an automated machine and because of the crowd and noisy Chinese tourists, the restaurant felt like a canteen. Thank God it was only a 3 day stay.", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cVery slow and arrogant reception staff\u201d", "Author": "Shah_2012", "ReviewID": "UR66583325", "Content": "I recently stayed for 5 nights at this hotel.

I requested that I have a flight to take and if I could be attended first, guess what they said?? - You should come early. How early do you want one to come down. Have been waiting for 35 minutes in the que. I approached the duty manager and guess what she says, everyone is waiting to be served I cannot help you. A gentleman who was in a hurry went and requested and he was bluntly told by a red women staff that they cannot do anything and just wait for your turn.

However, the whole room-with-a-view thing I didn\u2019t really need to worry about, because there are hundreds of perfect vantage points to photograph and experience this city while walking around. What\u2019s odd about the design, is the direction the windows are facing, none face the perfect photo opportunity of the central business district, you choose either harbor/marina or city view. It\u2019s quite a lean off the balcony to get the shot above! The Marina Mandarin Hotel was a good deal all-round, rates high on my list. Food prices very reasonable, room outstanding, amenities and location could not be better, then again, it\u2019s hard to go too far wrong in Singapore. I\u2019d recommend any of the hotels in the Marina, Riverwalk and Central Districts based on location, though prices can get a bit steep with many of them.

The Bad: Showed my Meritus dining card to the receptionist but she did not want it...... she had to call my room later to ask me for the membership number because she forgot to take it down earlier (this promo is for the Meritus dining card). Supposed to get welcome chocolates but there were none in the room. Called the receptionist and she said it will be sent up later as they are arranging for it now. Waited a while and called her back, she said the chocolates will be sent up during turn down service in the evening. Chocolates did arrive at 8 plus pm but there was no turn down service. I was entitled to an upgrade to a premier room but the room i stayed in did not seem all that \"premier\" to me, just that it was on a higher floor. Rooms are spruced up but the balcony looked so old and tired, they haven't done anything to the balcony since the hotel opened. Deck chairs at the pool were poorly maintained, the one i saw had some sort of insect nest on it, while another had bird droppings and the fabric was torn. Parking is limited to one parking coupon per stay (according to both the telephone receptionist and the counter receptionist) but when we asked the conceirge, he said it was one parking coupon per room per day, so i managed to get 2 free parking coupons instead. Wanted to ask the chamber maid a question but she was non-conversant in English. Asked the restaurant captain on the charges for breakfast (my room came with breakfast but we were having a friend join us for breakfast). The restaurant captain told me they have a buffet breakfast for $40 and a continental breakfast for $28. So of the 2, which am i entitled to for my room? He could not understand my question, and so i started from the top. He told me to have a seat while he found out. He walked away and spoke on the phone, returned to me 2 minutes later and said \"yes, i have found out for you that if your friend is joining you, you will have 2 free breakfast and 1 paid breakfast\".

Stayed for one night with my partner to celebrate my birthday. We were efficiently checked into our Club room on the top floor from the club lounge. The room was overall modern, spacious and well equipped (but I've heard from friends that the regular rooms were rather dated and small). The Nespresso machine and free cable internet access in the room were nice touches. However, we were disappointed when we entered the bathroom and noticed that there was bits of hair on the vanity top and hand towel that was hanging off the vanity top edge (from the last occupant who did some hair trimming persumably). There was also a personal bottle of leftover shower gel that was left in the shower. The bathroom had obviously not been thoroughly cleaned. Called the club lounge staff and they promptly had it re-cleaned. Complimentary cocktails at the club lounge was overall pleasant, with a moderate variety of canapes, bread, cheese and drinks (inc wine and champagne). Was pleasantly surprised with a birthday cake during the cocktail, and as we were already full by then, the staff kindy helped to deliver the cake to our room later that night (was a very delicious and generously sized chocolate cake by the way). Also, the free parking coupon was much appreciated. Downsides to the hotel (other than the initial toilet mishap) included a queue to Aquamarine for breakfast (which did not take longer than a 10 min wait, maybe they were fully occupied as it was chinese new year?), and overall lack of attention to detail. This being said as there was no bed turndown service at night, despite the \"make up room\" sign being lit up (in fact our room was not attended to by housekeeping at all during our stay - less the re-cleaning of the bathroom); the pool was a little dated and water looked murky with brown plant-like elements within when I was swimming in it; and when I had requested for some wine glasses and cutlery, it took about 30 mins for it to arrive. The stay was thus overall enjoyable (which was largely due to the fact that we had stayed in the club room rather than the regular room). However, having stayed at the Fairmont just a couple months back, and with the better deal I had received there with my Feed At Raffles card (with AMEX platinum), and more importantly, the impeccable service and attention to detail they provided, would prefer to go back to the Fairmont in future for a short local getaway.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "Sualsa", "ReviewID": "UR55491396", "Content": "I stayed here for 3 nights over Christmas and thought it was wonderful.

I left the hotel feeling that I hadn't been able to penetrate it's veneer of commerciality. The staff were all fantastic and couldn't be faulted in terms of service but they were never genuinely friendly. It was almost as if they had been trained in customer service using a specific manual and they stuck to the script religiously. I'm a fairly gregarious guy and will try to strike up conversation with most people to get an insight into their lives - thats what travel is about for me. However, it was just too damned difficult to get past their reserve - perhaps its a Singaporean thing. Facilities wise the hotel is top notch - everything you'd want is there and all is quality. The pool area I found especially attractive especially after a sweaty stroll round Singapore city! The pool attendant was helpful and attentive but, again, somewhat remote. If I had a criticism, it would be the prices of food. I was on a room only deal and having been to Singapore several times before, I knew that the best food is available cheaply at Hawker centres, so I didn't use the hotel facilities.

The cost was around SD $65 pp for the buffet, or you could upgrade to include wine and beer for around SD $90 pp. Getting around in Singapore by taxis is fairly cheap and easy. We caught a few taxis and everywhere seemed to be no more than SD $10. Apologies for the approx.

The only other hotels who offered this were the Mandarin Oriental and the Ritz-Carlton.

The hotel is located on top of the Marina Square shopping center, which is convenient but, ultimately annoying. You can avoid this, however, by exiting the hotel on Raffles Blvd. Unfortunately, this isn't the most pedestrian-friendly part of Singapore, though, as a rule, Singapore isn't teribly pedestrian-friendly with labyrinths of under- and over-street passages. Anyway, the hotel's well-located and the new MRT line will have a station closer than the current City Hall station (which to access you have to walk underground through various shopping centers. My suite was large, around 65 sqm, with 2 balconies. I paid for a Central Business district view but could only really see this from one of he 2 balconies. From the room I could see the cityscape, which was fine. The hotel's at odd angles so I'm not really sure what the views are like from the other rooms. This is an \"Atrium Hotel\" so the sound does resonate a bit and you can hear the piano on the 4th floor and the Christmas festivities were loud but bearable. PROS: Nice lounge breakfast and cocktails. Prompt room service of high quality and inexpensive (around 25 euros for an appetizer and main course). Very effecient and couteous staff. CONS: Children were allowed in Club Lounge even though it's supposed to be reservered for over-12s. Lounge service disorganized and understaffed at breakfast and cocktail hour. Complicated lighting systems in rooms. Seemed to be a fair number of package tourists, even at the Club level. RECOMMENDED: Yes, if you get a good deal. Wouldn't pay rack rates or equivalent prices to other 5-Star hotels.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "JB", "Title": "\u201cGreat, Elegant, Beautiful...but a bit Pricey\u201d", "Author": "semuaputih", "ReviewID": "UR52144217", "Content": "Been here to attend a 4 days seminar at Suntec Spore.

The Executive Suite on 15th floor was really two adjoining rooms, one arranged as a lounge and the other the bedroom, so there were two bathrooms, two TV's, two minibars etc. In truth we did not use the lounge room much, but I guess it was nice having the additional space. However, the really big plus was that we enjoyed Meritus Club benefits. The best part of this was the Meritus lounge on 21st floor. The breakfasts there were really good with a wide selection of hot/cold dishes and eggs made to order. In the evenings there were complimentary drinks and canapes, all delightfully presented and served. The Meritus Club staff were superb under the leadership of Jess. Nothing seemed too much trouble to them. They were always attentive and charming and helped greatly in making our stay so enjoyable. Possibly, for a future stay we would not take a suite, but definitely take a Meritus Club room on 20th/21st floors. Our room was well cleaned by the housekeeping staff, and any small requests were quickly attended to. The maid who serviced our room was always smiling and welcoming and did a great job. I was sorry that she was not around on our last day when we wanted to thank her for all her efforts. We didn't eat too much in the hotel, only because there were so many places to eat close to the hotel. However, the odd meal we did have in Aquamarine Restaurant and in the Atrium Lounge were all excellent.

The ceiling vent had probably not been cleaned in months, but other than that, no complaints about cleanliness. However, the towels are very thin and worn, as was the bathrobe that even had holes!

Book online at the hotel website and check out the deals. A good thing to do , if you don't mind the height, is the Singapore Flyer - the views are mangnificent and we took great photos. As it rained during our 2 days we took the underground shopping walk to Raffles City and exited to Raffles for lunch at their coffee shop and a browse in their gift shop - just love the ambience and the rickshaw driver outside. Sad to leave and could have stayed another day or two at the Marina Mandarin.

All acolades go to the staff and management. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough for a luxury stay. I would encourage you to upgrade to the club room which is way beyond expectations. This is the best hotel we have stayed in. On entering the hotel we were immediately greeted and attended to. We were escorted all the way from check in to our room and shown all the amenities in our room. We were given a cooling towel at check in. We were so delighted to be allowed in our room well before check in time as we arrived early. The hotel foyer with its atrium is something else. Everywhere you look there is such attention to detail, really equisite. The views and location are ideal. Going up in the lift that overlooks the atrium is fun. With a special coffee maker in the room and a fantastic shower, which was more like a stand up spa we were spoilt all the time. The turn down service with a little treat left on the bed was a lovely touch. The bathroom amenities were top quality. The staff are very impressive, they are very professional but without being robotic. They really make you feel at home and comfortable. The club room was awesome, you couldn't want any more and even surpasses expectations. They serve Mumm champagne at evening cocktails with a wide choice of food available. The choice of cocktails was very good. We tried the Singapore Sling whilst there. During the day the club room even has a wide choice of snacks available including chocolates, chips and even cashew nuts. There was a separate room for internet access and plenty of computers available. This hotel is perfect and if there was anything to be a little negative about it would be the size of the room which is not exactly spacious. But the soft colours makes it feel very comfortable.

The hotel is attached to a shopping mall which has numerous restaurants, but, best of all, is the food court/hawker centre where you can dine for next to nothing.

This means that the view from one side of the hotel is of a buildings work and the noise is disruptive 24 hours a day. The worst part was from midnight onwards and is very audible in the room. Even ear-plugs made no difference and it makes the whole experience very unpleasent. How can one enjoy the room and the view with loud drillings and banging? Spoiled the stay for us. Other noise problems come from the design of the hotel and because of the atrium design noise from the bar (such as the pianist singer) comes through to the rooms even on the higher floors at night. We had a late checkout as part if our room rate but the hotel claimed not to have received our request then would not honor it fully. I had it in print clearly. Took pressure to get this in the end and as it was one of the major reasons why we chose the hotel initailly very annoying. We did use the business lounge and found it was too small and crowded for the people there. It felt more like a normal restaurant and bar due to this. So if you are booking a club room for the peaceful breakfast that would be a mistake. The mineral water filled pool is a plus but it lacks the ambience and atmosphere of other similar Singapore hotels. Very stark area and when I used the pool it was full of people swimming lengths and getting angry when others got in their way. I'm disabled and it was a bit intimidating. Not had this problem before and wonder if the pool is being used by Singapore residents, such as businessmen after work and they come here purely to swim lengths. There are many postive points about this hotel and it comes down to personal taste in the end. This hotel was not for us - we like quieter, less glitzy and less crowded but many people would disagree.

Then I tried to rince the bath tub with the shower head, the water was spraying everywhere coz the hose came loose. I had to mop the floor with the only big towels we had. I went down to tell them the condition of the room was less than satisfactory, all they could say was \" Should wee change the room for you?\" We already unpacked everything, so we couldn't be bothered.

A location which is perfectly described as magnificent. We had been welcomed to our hotel with smiles and personal check-in at our room no. 1602 on the 16th floor, which boasts superb views over the Marina, the Esplanade Theater and over the Marina Mandarin' s Swimming-pool landscape. Our check-in was fast and friendly and our luggage was also delivered in no time within minutes. We also had received free water for two and signature chinese welcome pineapple cakes! The first thing we had seen was the WOW! Atrium which stretches all 21 floors, Folks! Our room was very modern and had been recently renovated with a clear message of luxury and relaxation in mind incl. a large 37inch Panasonic LCD TV which offered BBC World News, CNBC, Asia News Channel, korean TV, japanese TV, local TV, malay and arabic TV plus Pay TV movies for 18 SGD plus 5% tax. Our room had many asian accents and muted colours of the exotic east plus a large comfortable queen-sized bed with white linen and several pillows to choose from. Overall the room had a colour scheme incl. cream, gold, brown and beige all en-lighted by the massive floor to ceiling windows and our 16th floor balcony with massive views over Singapore and the people downstairs moving to and from the pool! We also had a fully stocked mini-bar, glas fixtures and large mirrors and a very modern writing desk and executive style seating was also on offer for us, Folks! We should not forget the resident artist with studio at the Marina Mandarin which is well worth a look! Plus the fabulous art on the wall especially on the fifth level of the Atrium! The hotels location is also somewhat of a shopper' s paradise as well with such malls as the Suntec City Mall and Millenia Walk to name a few as neighbours to the hotel. Plus many other hotels count as neighbours of the Marina Mandarin incl. the Conrad Singapore and the Mandarin Oriental and the Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore and others. The hotel is rather famous for eating and drinking as well and we enjoyed a superb dinner at the world-famous Ristorante Bologna located at Level 4 in the stunning Atrium of the Marina Mandarin - the restaurant is one of the best italian restaurants in Asia and has won many awards over the years! We enjoyed the following incl. red wine from Tuscany ( 2005 ), Aqua Panna waters, a Bologna Cesar Salad ( the best! ), one signature lasagna fresh out of the oven, my better half enjoyed incl. her Tagliolini with lamb ragout and her tiramisu and we also had a Zabaglione with masala wine and hazelnut crunch. Such Dinner stays in our memories a very very long time! This Restaurant come highly recommend and it offers also refreshing prices, too! The Service was professional all the way and very friendly and the atmosphere oozed of real charm in the heart of Singapore. During our stay we enjoyed also 2x breakfast at the Aquamarine Restaurant which was always very well visited in the morning and incl. the following: coffee, pineapple juice, waffles, fruits selection, yoghurt and nuts selection, bread selection, jam and butter selection plus peanut butter, miso soup ( so good! ), chicken sausages, vegetable selection, salad and fruit compote plus bircher muesli, apple juice, salad with thousand island dressing and muffins! Plus much much more! We sat on both sided on each morning incl. on the terrace and the indoor Restaurant! Beautiful presentation and the choice make this breakfast a real winner on our second visit to Singapore! The hotel offers a superb choice of wining and dining incl. chinese, italian ( which we tried for dinner! ), international, Senses - The Patisserie, 24h Roomservice ( which we also tried incl. Chicken Satay with rice dumplings and full condiments incl. red onions, cucumbers, Chicken Lhaksa, and two creme brulee vanilla, all first-class and well priced for such a superb hotel! ) We should also mention the stunning Atrium Lounge and Bar which was busy with locals and guests from around the world on each evening! During our stay at the Marina Mandarin we had taken the opportunity to visit also the world famous Raffles Hotel incl. the Raffles Museum, Long Bar for a Singapore Sling and visited the Raffles Creamery for ice-cream and the Raffles Shop for memories! We had also seen two wedding celebrations at the Raffles! Wow, Folks! Another Singapore highlight was the view over Singapore from the 70th floor of the Swissotel, The Stamford Hotel ( the highest hotel in South-East Asia ) which lies within walking distance from the Marina Mandarin and can be done with the Raffles Hotel in one go! Wow, Folks - again! We also have visited again the Merlion - the symbol and protector of Singapore! This should be all done while staying at the Marina Mandarin - one of the best hotels in Asia and indeed the world! The hotel offers also a fantastic pool with terrace over Singapore and water fountains plus pool bar and the pool is open 24h each day of the year! Wow, Folks! The St. Gregory Spa is a member of the Leading Spa' s of the World and the hotel is also a member of the Leading Hotels of the World! ( Singapore' s only member at this exclusive chain of hotels! ). We had 2 nights / 3 days at this urban oasis in the heart of stunning Singapore. This was our second visit to the Lion City and we look now forward for many more visits to come to Singapore in the long-term future! Our time here at Singapore was fast and the check-out of the hotel was fast and friendly with many a greeting and love of come-backs as well plus our booked Hotel Limousine to the Changi International Airport - a black brand-new BMW 5 Series by the way with uniformed driver as a highlight of transport of our stay! We also highly recommend the Airport Shuttle Bus Service for superb views from the mini-bus from the Airport into Singapore, which we had taken from the Changi Int. Airport! We highly recommend the hotel for value, location, shopping, sightseeing and people who love hotels and Singapore like we do! Now we were off with Air Asia to Kuala Lumpur again, but before we visited the brand-new and exciting Crowne Plaza Changi Airport Hotel at Terminal 3! Well done!

For all of you who have experienced Changi Airport, you will understand how efficient, clean and spacious it is. There is no hassle whatsoever in getting off the plane and making your way to the transport points to be on your way to your hotel. We didn't arrange a private transfer to our hotel as you can probably do it much cheaper yourself. We caught a taxi to the hotel and it was about 18 S$. As you approach the exit of the terminal you queue respectfully at the taxi rank and, on average, have to wait no more than a few minutes to get your ride. To the hotel we went. As we arrived we were greeted by the staff and escorted up to the, I think, the fourth floor to check in. This process took only a few minutes and before we knew it we were at our room, unpacking clothes for the third time! The room was very spacious, clean and had all the amenities you'd expect from a 'Leading Hotel of the World'. The room had a mini bar, TV with satellite channels, complimentary water and fruit, and all the usual bathroom products that save you hoarding shampoo all around Asia! The hotel itself has a magnificent looking atrium, with numerous restaurants and bar. We only ate at the hotel for breakfast and found this an asset to the hotel. You had a selection of east and west delights and were as fresh as you can get. The service from the staff was very efficient. We made use of the wonderful, refreshing pool on a number of occasions as it was a welcome relief from the very sunny, hot and humid weather that you get in Singapore. The pool area has a number of sunloungers and very attentative staff taking food and drinks orders. We loved the pool area! 10/10 for the hotel as a whole. Singapore has lots to offer travellers of any age. It a modern, bustling city that oozes style. The daytimes can be spent wandering around the city, visiting places such as Chinatown (amazing selection of handcrafts, clothes, foods etc), Boat and Clarke Quay for its amazing selection of bars and restaurants (whatever you type of cuisine you are sure to find it here), the Marina area just opposite the hotel and the famous shopping area of Orchard Road. We visited all of the above and thoroughly enjoyed. We even took a very touristy boat ride up the Singapore River, well when in Rome etc!! All good fun and gives you a feel for Singapore as it is today! We also visited Sentosa Island. Its ok for a day trip but wouldn't stay there! Its packed with tourists thsi is something I try to avoid these days. Saying that we had a good day there. There is an aquarium and other attractions but most of all there were decent, man made beaches, good views across the Straits and a Cafe Del Mar (Good music of course!). The cable car over is probably the best bit - although if you are nervous of heights, as I am, don't look down!! :-( The nightlife is fantastic! There are so many bars and restaurants you will never get round them all. Our first stint of nightlife was at an old convent complex called Chijmes. It had a good selection of bars, clubs and restaurants and was only a short walk from the hotel. The main area, that we loved from the second we got there was the Boat and Clarke Quay areas. The latter is so energetic it\u2019s contagious! Wonderful bars and restaurants and the perfect way to end your day or early morning as I found!! The costs in Singapore are on par with the UK depending on where you went. Food and drink can be expensive or as close to your budget as you like - we ate in the food courts on one or two occasions and loved the atmosphere, food (if you like Asian fare then you will be spoilt for choice and it won\u2019t break the bank - very cheap in these places for food) and people. When we were there the Singapore authorities were having a practice run for their national day parade. We were lucky enough to see military parades, flyovers and the most amazing firework display I've ever seen - I just wish I was there for the real thing (in Aug I think). We loved Singapore. The city is a modern metropolis that has charm, culture and the best nightlife around. Its people are very friendly and always on hand to offer advice if needed. As far as big cities go, I always felt safe and never intimidated. The hotel is an excellent base to explore the city and would highly recommend it to all who wishes to visit the city. If I ever return here I will be sure to stay here again. Thanks to the staff of the hotel and people of Singapore!", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value Club Level\u201d", "Author": "LucindaGray", "ReviewID": "UR28491513", "Content": "We recently stayed at this hotel for 6 nights (Mon - Sunday) in a Club room on the 21st floor. During a previous visit to Singapore in august we stayed in a club room at the Oriental (which was outstanding) but due to tighter purse strings this seemed like a good compromise. Which is most definitely was. We booked our room through hotels.com which was hassle free. Upon arriving at the hotel we were escorted up to the Club level to check in which was dealt with professionally and efficiently. we were taken to our room and the usual guidance was provided. The room itself was large and spacious with all of the amenities you would expect with a high end hotel. Being a female I like to check out the toiletries which I was pleased to see were by Elemis. :) The Club lounge itself is not as big as some other hotels and is split into a separate dining area and 'lounge' area. The breakfast was plentiful and a good selection available. as a club guest you can dine at the hotel's main restaurant Aquamarine which I did once but found the service very hit and miss. The internet connection is excellent and the cocktail hours are good. They serve Mumm champagne, a variety of beers, spirits, cocktails and red/white wine. In all honesty if you are on a leisure break in this wonderful city and enjoy an evening tipple then upgrading to a club room is worth every penny. in a city were it costs S$14 for a beer the costs soon mount up! Drinks are served with a canape buffet which was ok but not great. The Club staff were generally wonderful, there were a couple of surly ones but i have found this to be fairly normal. The other staff members more than make-up for grumpy colleagues. We had a problem with our room after our first night, namely that there was a strange water seepage through the bathroom floor. After informing the club lounge manager, a maintenance man was sent to our room and the leak inspected. it turned out that they were going to have to take out the shower and toilet for a burst pipe and they moved us to another room. This was handled in a very efficient manner and within 20 mins we were in our new room with our clothes hung up in the wardrobe. In regards to the rest of the hotel everything seemed of a high standard. The fitness room was more than adequate and had a reasonable selection of free weights and cardio machines. The pool was also very good. I did not visit the spa although it is meant to be excellent. We enjoyed a fabulous meal in the Peach Blossom restaurant which was surprisingly well priced. For starters and mains with soft drinks and Chinese tea the cost was about \u00a338 as guests also receive a 20% discount. We also enjoyed late evening drinks in the main Atrium bar were they have a pianist and a singer. This normally finishes around midnight. Costs in this bar are high with a bottle of Jacobs Creek Cabernet Sauvignon at S$65 a bottle! Location wise I found it to be excellent. I like the Marina Bay area a lot as it is fairly quiet and is being developed rapidly. The hotel has a connecting doorway to the marina shopping centre which has a great food centre on the top level and good shopping. You can also walk through this to Raffles City via the Raffles Citylink shopping mall making the MRT station about 10 mins away when walking at a leisurely pace. I would stay at this hotel again as the price per night was very good for the standard and club level facilities. It wouldn't be my first choice in Singapore but it does come a close second.", "Date": "April 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cService with smiles\u201d", "Author": "rubysophie", "ReviewID": "UR28042631", "Content": "Lovely friendly staff and locals in a lovely spotlessly clean hotel.

There is also a free shuttle bus between the various Singapore shopping malls. The hotel is attached to one of the shopping malls so there was no need to even go outside in the heat. The hotel is also centrally located to the City Hall train station, so were were able to catch the train (inexpensive) to the Changi Museum and the worthwhile Bird Park in the same day, although at opposite ends of Singapore. We did catch a taxi to the Botanic Gardens (a visit the orchid area is highly recommended if you enjoy gardens), Orchard Road and Little India, as the taxis are very reasonably priced too. The hotel room was spacious and well serviced, although not enough milk supplied for more than 2 cups of tea/coffee per room. The tariff included a tasty full buffet breakfast. We had a night departure flight so had a late checkout at 12 noon, and the hotel stored our luggage and allowed us use of hotel facilities including swimming pool and hot pool showers complete with towels, soap & shampoo, until our flight. Other than breakfast, we did not eat in the hotel due to high restaurant/room service prices. Instead, we ate at food courts, one in the attached mall, at a cost of Singapore dollars $4-5.50 per main dish -a bargain. The shops are open until about 9pm every night. While waiting in the hotel lounge for our transfer to the airport, we made the mistake of ordering coffee without checking the price, and were charged Singapore dollars $15 per cup!

The location of the hotel was excellent, with a passageway accessible from the 4th floor that leads right to Marina Square the shopping Mall. Marina Square itself have sheltered access to other nearby malls like Suntec City and City Link Mall, so for the shopaholics, you can still get tons of shopping done while staying dry when it pours. The only gripe is its a fair walk from the nearest MRT station, Cityhall. Takes about 10mins if you walk briskly, and the walk can seem to be abit too long when you need the showers after a long day. Loved the design of the hotel, high ceilings with a circular design to compliment the shape of the building itself. From every floor of the hotel, you get a full view of the hotel lobby on the 4th floor and hear birds chirping every morning and evening (I heard they bring in the birds especially on these 2 timings each day so guests can feel closer to nature; nice touch!). The room itself was very clean and spacious enough to warrant the SGD269 per night I paid for. Comfy beds, plasms TV, and bright clean bathroom. My event lasted until 5am and I had to wake up the next day at 7am so I didn't have a chance to try what channels were available for entertainment. The only thing I felt they could have thrown in was the buffet breakfast, which cost an additional SDG40 per person at Aquamarine. Check-in and check out were efficient, even a last minute request for a 40-seater coach to send my guests to the airport was met promptly. The only thing I noticed about some of the staff is that they tend to greet tourists with a smile while us the locals, even though we were hotel guests as well, were ignored. I have encountered this many times and it still irritates me that some of them practice such discrimination. My overseas guests had a ridiculous experience with the hotel staff that ended up with the hotel staff ordering my guests to return to their rooms and demanding them to flash their key cards to prove that they were indeed hotel guests. An experience which led to my overseas guests vowing they would never return and us the local hosts embarrassed that a 5-star luxury hotel could do such a thing. But then again, I thought I needed to give an objective review of the locations and rooms itself, that explains my entry.

Among the five hotels that I checked in Marina Bay, this has arguably one of the best view and also the best price. This hotel belongs to the Meritus Group which runs a collection of mid-upper 5-star hotels in Asia. Arriving I arrived by taxi which is just 15 mins drive from the airport. Upon arrival at the hotel, a lady staff in Marina Mandarin\u2019s signature fiery red cheong sum was on standby to greet me and showed me to the reception area. And she already knew my name without me telling her. Impressive! Check in was swift and I was soon escorted to my room. The Room I booked a suite since the price is just slightly more than the room and I was told it has the best city view and Executive Club privileges thrown in such as free internet, laundry, breakfast, cocktail etc. I requested for Esplande view and was slightly disappointed that the Esplande was only visible from a corner and not a direct view. Apparently, the triangular structure of the building means no rooms actually face the Esplande. My premier \u201csuite\u2019 is actually two connecting rooms turned into a \u201csuite\u201d. It\u2019s rather strange because the two rooms are identical except one of the room, the bed and working desk was removed and replace with a sofa sitting area and a small dining area instead. Accordingly, everything is \u201cdouble\u201d in this suite in that there are two bathrooms, two closets, two minibar, two balaconies, two TVs and strangest of all, two room numbers and two entrance door. I have mixed feelings about this kind of \u201cshort-cut\u201d design as the room was clearly not designed as a suite in the beginning and I was reminded constantly that it\u2019s two inter connecting rooms and not a suite. In retrospect, probably I should have just booked the standard room which will be cheaper. Bed was a bit too hard for my liking and the room did have sound-proof issues as I could hear noise of guests walking by and music from the lobby lounge. But it wasn\u2019t too loud to be disturbing ( I\u2019m at the 16th floor, lower floors may be more affected ). Bathroom is a full marble bathroom and well equipped with hansgrohe rainshower. Premium toiletries ( Elemins ) were provided. Water pressure can be a bit better. Room looks new and was clearly just recently renovated with high quality ( though not top of the class ) materials and fittings. Overall, it projects a very contemporary and modern look. Furniture, sofa are all very comfortable. However, the sofa chair is missing an ottoman. The TV is a Panasonic 37\u201d plasma that has good picture quality which I watched the Olympics closing ceremony. There\u2019s also a Nepresso Coffee Machine and complimentary coffee / tea, a nice and much welcomed extra for an avid coffee drinker as me. Common Areas The hotel is a triangular building with a central atrium that soars 21 storey up. Entering the lobby and reception area for the first time conveys a great impression of spaciousness and grandeur. The hotel has 3 restaurants, one Chinese, one Italian ( closed during my stay ) and a caf\u00e9. Morning breakfast at the caf\u00e9 was rather ordinary with standard item breakfast stuff, nothing special and a bit disappointing. The common areas have a very ornate \u201coriental\u201d look and huge beautiful chandeliers adorned many of the common areas. There\u2019s a large swimming pool and a spa and gym. The Executive Lounge ( called Meritus lounge ) consist of two interconnecting lounges, one with a sofa area and the other, a dining area for serving breakfast/cocktail. There\u2019s only a handful of guests during my stay. There\u2019s a outdoor area which has a great view of the Raffles Boulevade area. Breakfast at the Executive Lounge is of better quality than the caf\u00e9. Generally, the common area especially the lobby and the soaring atrium impresses and compare very well with its neigbours. I did walked over to take a peek a the neighbouring Pan Pacific and Mandarin Oriental. While the Pan Pacific d\u00e9cor was rather advant Garde and unique, the Oriental was downright depressing with a stark dark and claustrophobic interior. Overall, the Marina Mandarin has the most beautiful common areas. Service Service wise, the staff at Marina Mandarin more than live up to my expectation. Staff are uniformly very polite and friendly and always eager to help and more delightfully, it\u2019s always done with a smile. I was also always greeted by name in the Executive Lounge, a nice touch. Every request I made was handled speedily and efficiently. This is miles better than the over-rated Grand Hyatt hotel which I had the misfortunate of staying ( and with a higher price ). To be fair, the occupancy during my stay was rather low as it was during a weekend so this may partially explain the attentive service I received. Location Being located at Marina Bay area, the hotel is connected is right in the middle of the second best shopping enclave in Singapore after Orchard Road. And Orchard Road is just a short taxi ride or a few MRT stops away. The hotel is directly connected to the Marina Square shopping mall with lots of shops and eating outlets and within walking distance to the equally massive Suntec mall and the more specialize Millenia Walk. It\u2019s also located very close to the highway that connects the area directly to the airport ( just 15-20mins ride by taxi ), so it\u2019s ideal for transit passengers looking for an overnight stopover as well. Conclusion Overall, the Marina Mandarin is a great hotel especially for the price paid. Everything is as per expectation ( except the design of the \u201csuite\u201d ) and while it stop short of being the very best, it\u2019s a good choice for those who would like to visit Singapore and a fine example of Singapore hospitality.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlon Downtown", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Hotel I've ever been\u201d", "Author": "fredbocaj", "ReviewID": "UR19305782", "Content": "Perfect situation in Marina Bay Rooms: modern, absolutely clean and luxurious Great Breakfast Excellent service", "Date": "August 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roma", "Title": "\u201cVery good 4 stars\u201d", "Author": "FabioC", "ReviewID": "UR19202540", "Content": "The hotel is very well located, and offers an excellent 4 stars service.

This is not through any fault of the hotel, but due to the building work going on outside the hotel. There is the constant noise of jackhammering and every single day without fail there has been a practice session for the Singapore National Day which is in August apparently. We are on the 21st Floor facing the harbour and we can hear it word for word, plus the brass bands and all the singing. Its driving us crazy. As an example, it has just turned 9a.m. here and we can hear some woman on a microphone saying \"check 1, 2 check 1, 2 \". NOT what I want to be woken up by. Even as you sit by the pool at times, you are drowned out by the noise (through your iPod no less). The hotel check in was efficient and pleasant and the staff very nice, however the hours for breakfast are a little short, especially if you are staying in the Club suites, breakfast ends at 10a.m., which if you are jet lagged like we currently are, its hard to haul yourself out of bed and be ready by 9a.m. (they start clearing up at 9:45a.m. and ask you to fill your plate so that they can finish). The food is the major disappointment. For the LHW Hotel we expected better food as we have stayed in many hotels belonging to this group before and the food has been outstanding. The room service menu is ordinary and the restaurants are average when compared to the others in the area. The buffet in the Aquamarine is nice at lunch, but its virtually identical at dinner which is a shame. On a positive note, the bird songs during the day is beautiful as they have the birds around the atrium and the nearby shopping is easy to get walk to. Travelling into Orchard Road takes about 15 minutes and costs between $7 and $9. Would we stay here again, no. Obviously the noise is not the fault of the hotel, they cannot help the massive building work happening in the harbour, nor can they be held responsible for the rehearsals for the National Day, but frankly its been a pain in the neck and I feel resentful at paying these prices and then having dreadful nights sleep and not being able to relax in the room due to the noise.

The beds are situated by the windows rather than by the door, and on the one occasion I went to bed early, I really couldn't hear the music drifting up from the atrium. Maybe they've listened to previous comments and reduced the volume. I've been to Singapore many times and always like to stay in a 5-star hotel, as it's an affordable luxury. Unlike Europe where I live. Previously I've stayed at The Fullerton (lovely, but it's now very expensive; not the S$250 it was a couple of years ago) and Raffles The Plaza (great location above the MRT station, but impersonal and dull. Now called The Fairmont). Marina Mandarin's main advantage is its uniqueness. The atrium is lovely, and it feels great walking out of your room - none of that dark-corridor-in-a-non-descript-hotel stuff. The breakfast was good and the service very friendly. The rooms spotless and well equipped. The only downside is the distance from the MRT. Taxis are cheap, but as a single traveller I usually enjoy (honest!) using public transport. The walk from the hotel to City Hall MRT, whilst all underground, gets tedious rather quickly. That could be because I spent a week there. One or two days and it's a novelty. Maybe. Don't be put off though - I don't like staying near Orchard Road and much prefer the location of this hotel (and the others I mentioned above), and the walk from the MRT is through shopping centres so you can wheel your luggage most of the way. If the price of this hotel is no more than The Fairmont, or even the Swissotel (which seems oddly expensive now) then stay at the Marina Mandarin.

Club rooms are much more luxurious with good coimplimentary bottled water (still and sparkling) and a fine selection of gourmet coffee. Breakfast at the club floor has a nice view but food is more limited compared to the restaurant where other people (non club floor) goes too. The hotel is not new and shows signs of aging but is nicely refurbished. Club room, although nicely decorated and designed, feels small and cluttered. But the free gourmet coffee, sparkling water and Crabtree&Evelyn toileteries make up for it.. Overall, a very good hotel.

Where the hotel excelled: 1. All hotel staff were extremely friendly and notably polite. They spoke excellent English, and offered help before being asked. 2. This hotel has the best bellmen I have ever encountered. I didn\u2019t have to carry my own bags at any point \u2013 a real treat for a weary business traveller. 3. The hotel is centrally located in downtown Singapore. Getting around was very easy \u2013 especially on foot. 4. The hotel has several different restaurants - Chinese, Italian and seafood. The food and service were above average in each one. 5. Cabled web access was available in the hotel rooms, for a fee. 6. The rooms were clean and quite spacious. 7. The atmosphere and d\u00e9cor of the hotel are striking \u2013 22 storeys of rooms are situated around a massive open atrium that is topped with a glass skylight roof. On the fifth floor, unusual tropical birds are kept in brass cages. Their calls can be heard throughout the hotel during the daylight hours. On the fourth floor, the large bar area in front of the reception desk includes space for musicians and performers. I heard several talented singers, pianists and violinists each night I was there. Things that could be improved: 1. Signage was a problem. Except for in-room literature, the only indication of locations for restaurants, meeting rooms or hotel amenities was written in small, hard-to-read script next to the floor selection buttons on the panel in the elevator. 2. The temperature in our meeting room was appropriate for hanging a side of beef. Despite repeated, well-intentioned attempts by hotel staff to adjust the room to a warmer temperature setting, we continued to be uncomfortably cold. (I suspect part of the problem is the location of the thermostat/heat sensor. It is set way too high on the wall \u2013 just below the ceiling. This is probably unnecessary in a facility that is used exclusively by adults.) Things that were unacceptable: Nothing was unacceptable about this hotel \u2013 it is pretty spectacular. Bottom line: This is an above-average hotel with superior staff and world-class ambiance. This was my second stay there, and the Marina Mandarin lived up to my wonderful memories of the place.

The hotel was fine - very clean, all the facilities we wanted / needed, and thanks to prompt e-mail communication before we travelled, I was confident that we would get the important connecting rooms (always a worry when you have booked 2 rooms with children). I would say not a five star though - maybe 4? We checked in without any problems, had some delays in getting the connecting doors opened, and an issue with power to one of trooms, but that was soon sorted out. We arrived on a Sunday evening, tired and hungry and were disappointed that there was no 'casual' dining available in the hotel - only lobby bar snacks, or one expensive more upmarket restaurant was open. We went into the adjoining shopping centre (bit like 'Mr Ben' - go through a door in the hotel and you're right in the middle of a huge mall!) but sadly everywhere except McDonalds or Starbucks closed at 10pm on Sunday! This is obviously not the hotel's fault, but just a warning to other people arriving at this time. The breakfasts were fine - a bit busy due to the number of conferences in the hotel, but food good and varied. The gym was good, and the outdoor pool very welcome after sightseeing. Pool service (drinks, food) was also very attentive. The location was ideal for conference goers / shoppers wanting to be virtually in a mall, and also very close to Raffles (we had drinks in the Long Bar with our 2 children - definitely recommended) but we would have preferred a location nearer to some more restaurants (wish I had taken another posters advice to stay at Swissotel Clarke Quay! Lots more bars and restaurants there). Apart from location not being the best for what we wanted, the 2 negatives of the hotel in my opinion were as previously mentioned by other reviewers: 1. Caged birds 'tweeting' in he huge atrium lobby - seemed very cruel 2. Lobby music - piano / violin etc - not unpleasant music, but went on well past midnight, and made it difficult for our children to sleep. The design of the hotel is such that you could hear the music right up to the top rooms. I probably wouldn't stay there again, there are many good hotels in Singapore, but to be honest we found 3 full days in Singapore to be sufficient for us, and were ready to go on to Thailand at the end of our stay.", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cMarina Mandarin epitomises Singapore\u201d", "Author": "SheldonB14", "ReviewID": "UR8680133", "Content": "We booked five nights at the Maria Mandarin via the hotels website.

Check-in was rather robotic, and did not have the friendly touched of Bangkok. There was some discussion as we were first told that there were no non smoking rooms available, then told we could have a twin room. After a short discussion we had no option but to disappointingly settle for a smoking double. The room was a reasonable size and was clearly recently renovated, was clean and the bathroom stocked with the usual products as expected. There was a good view across town. In the morning there are bird cages hung up providing a relaxing medley of birdsong. In the evening the lobby bar offers the service you would expect of a five star hotel, and with the huge atrium does look spectacular when lit, but my recommendation would be to get out and sample some of the local bars. The Marina Mandarin is linked to the Marina Bay shopping centre, and the esplanade beyond which contains a good selection of open air restaurants, more of which can be found at Clarke Quay which is another few minutes walk.

One of the reasons was its proximity to the SUNTEC CITY Convention Centre, as me and my colleagues were attending SOA & ECM Day Conferences there.. When I first checked in, it was to my (unpleasant) surprise that the room wasn't tidied yet, and smelt terrible (cigarette smoke, while I specifically requested for a NON-SMOKING ROOM, they just replied, this was all they had *sigh*). Once the bell boy came up to my room to send my baggage, I complained to him the room hadn't been cleaned yet. It wasn't his initiative to ask me why the room was in such a mess!! So he called someone from another division, to immediately clean the room. But I said I needed to get online and do my business work on my notebook computer, so I told him to clean up the room in an hour's time. They did eventually clean the room after an hour. I had a quick conversation with the housekeeper staff, and he didn't have a good command of English (Singaporeans DO have good command of English). I speculate they hired illegal workers of some sort from some rouge states. At first I wanted to tell him to do some specific cleaning in the bathroom, but as he couldn't understand what I was saying, I told myself \"What the heck.. I got some other work to do.\" So I left him alone. My colleagues had problems checking in too.. The receptionist requested that I, as the principal booker of the rooms to physically be with them as they were trying to check in. (my colleagues checked in way later after me, because they had to be going somewhere that day..). She refused to tell them what my room number was, thus giving them a hard time.. But they eventually let them check in, after a series of angry remarks thrown to the receptionist. After I heard about the incident, I called the front desk if MY COLLEAGUES' names were on the check-in list for that day, and true enough, they were on the list. So why the heck did she go all that trouble to hinder them from checking in? Till this day, I'm still confused.. My colleagues' rooms' air-conditioning was not fully operative in a sense that it's not emitting cold air. It was quite warm indeed.. We specifically asked for rooms with fully-functional air-conditioning units that blew real cold air ! (Singapore is real hot) Three days later, in the morning, broadband internet connection was down, for 6 hours. Hell, I couldn't have any work done. I complained to the duty manager on the phone, that I was really pissed. He replied calmly saying the whole hotel had an internet connection trouble even with the businesspeople who were attending some important meeting in the conference rooms. I told him I was so disappointed I wouldn't stay in this hotel anymore, but he pestered me to give them another chance. Broadband internet wasn't that fast too.. (and they charged very dearly for that.. like S$ 20 / hour of usage, and up to $40 / day).. Download speeds are maxed out at 25 Kb/s compared to the previous hotel I stayed at, Royal Plaza on Scotts, which had speeds of up to 240+ Kb/s (and it's also free there...). I sat at the lobby lounge, surfing away on the web when suddenly cigarette smoke smell began to irritate me, and I kindly requested the waiter to escort me to a non-smoking area. She said, there's no NON-SMOKING area in the hotel.. The day I was about to check out, the lady in the cashier asked me to wait a little while.. as they were doing some \"checkout procedures\" which took over ten minutes. So I asked her what was the problem? Why did it take so long? She eventually admitted to having problems with the system/network. They can't login to the system.. What an absolute mess!!! I needed to rush to the airport, as I was just in the nick of time to catch my flight back to my home city..

So we walked back to the front desk only to wait another 30 mins before begin allocated another room, the reception staff were so unhelpful and didn\u2019t even apologies for any inconvenience. So we went up to our new room to find that it was a double room with 2 single beds, instead of the king room that we had booked. (Why didn\u2019t the staff ask if this was ok?)

I won't deny that the rooms aren't 100% sound-proofed so you do hear the pianist playing late into the night. It didn't really bother in fact the soft tunes might have helped me sleep better. Meals at Aquamarine is superb. The buffet was extremely elaborate, fresh and offered great value for money. Once again, the staff there didn't disappoint. Location wise, it is some 15 minutes on foot to the subway but you don't get bored along the way as the hotel is connected via an underground shopping mall!", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The World", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "terravisum", "ReviewID": "UR7477290", "Content": "Arriving at the hotel after a 19 hours direct flight from NY, I was really looking forward to a nice comfy bed for a quick nap. Despite the 11AM arrival, I was quickly checked in and was shown to my room quickly. The room is about the same size as the one that I had from the Pan Pacific that is close by. It is however a bit smaller than the one from the Grand Hyatt. The bed is a bit on the soft side but otherwise comfortable. The view from my room is slightly better than the Pan Pacific but not by much. The marble/granite bathroom also have the same separate bathtub and shower although it is a bit smaller than Pan Pacific and also a bit more worn out. The amenities are good without being as exciting as the Grand Hyatt offerings. There are a quartet playing music in the atrium every night just like the Pan Pacific and the same bird chirping in the morning. The bird songs are quite soothing for a morning wakeup call. Outside the hotel, is a quick walk to a hawker center that opens every night around 6PM that you can get a quick snack. It takes a bit of walking if you like to reach the MRT but it is not too bad since most of the walking will be inside ti escape the Singapore heat. The Marina Mandarin is not quite a 5 stars in my book but a good solid 4.5. It is a toss between the Pan Pacific and the Marina Mandarin for me.

Ash was present all around the chair arms, and the glass table had the remains of the previous occupants room service stuck in the groove around the glass. I contacted reception to ask to be moved but, was told that there were no other rooms available, but that housekeeping would be sent to deal with the problem.

Literally seconds after she left the room, she knocked on the door and said, \"you luggage is here\". The rooms were very spacious with a view of the pool, which was nice. On close inspection however, they weren't very well cleaned. There was dust behind the taps on the bidet and the toilet had pee stains at the back of the seat.

The coffee was very strong. it is a fair walk to the MRT, but is worth it, it is cheap, efficient and very clean. A trip to local stations cost about 50p each.

The room was brilliant with a fantastic view of the area, including Raffles Hotel and the River. The bathroom was amazing. We had no problems whatever with this hotel and was very satisfied with the service and room. The breakfast was excellent, with a exceptionally large choice for all nationalities. The consierge arranged for us to go on a harbour river dinner cruise, which was an excellent evening and also included a pick up and drop off service.

The service and politeness of the staff were excellent. The hotel is in a brilliant position. You dont even have to go outside to enter a massive, spotlessly clean, shopping centre, and the Suntec Centre is right across the road. Raffles is just a short walk and its shopping centre.

We can not usually afford 5 star hotels so this was a bit of a treat for us. We loved the interior of this hotel ie the atrium complete with piano playing and singing rising up to our floor in the evening and the beautiful singing birds in the daytime. Found the staff helpful and polite most of the time except when one or two were unable to understand English. Also had to ask four or five times for someone to come up to our room and put the extra bed for our son into the room. Not very good service considering they knew we were coming well in advance! Also had problems with water not draining well in the shower, but overall found the room satisfactory. Rooms with view of the harbour much nicer than other side. Ate the buffet breakfast one morning and the buffet dinner one evening. The food was fantastic and service in the restaurants very good. Variety and quality of food was superb. Didn't intend to do this, expected to eat out in the city more often but as our son wanted to sit in the room and watch cable TV we took the option of letting him do this while we sat in the restaurant and enjoyed a meal, went up to check on him every 1/2 hour. Location I would agree is not ideal as only really convenient for shopping mall and Raffles, not the other sights of Singapore. Also not sure how this happened but got talked into some bus tours to the Zoo and Night Safari at a time when we were extemely jetlagged and fuzzy-headed enough to make the wrong decision to book these. This eventuated after a phone call by a tour operator shortly after we arrived in our room. Basically if you book one of these tours you will pay a high price for a bus out to the zoo, which takes forever as it stops at several other hotels where you have to wait for other tourists to get onto the bus - at one point they even merged us onto two different buses. Then we were disappointed to find no actual tour once we got to the Zoo, simply the \"guide\" who had travelled on the bus with us told us to all meet back at the entrance at a particular time. As a result of all the waiting time on the way there and once inside the zoo when she tried to gather everybody together simply to tell us to meet back at the entrance we did not have enough time to see all the wonderful animals and had paid way more than the zoo entrance fee and the cost of a public bus or taxi out there. Quite the rip-off! Overall, had a great stay at this hotel, and absolutely loved Singapore.

There's not much really walkable nearby except for said mall and the Raffles, so you do a lot of taxi'ing...bot a big deal really cause the cabs are cheap if you don't end up in a \"limo\" cab, a bmw charging you $25 for being a bmw, just silly The room was nothing spectacular. I was on the 15th floor, and I will say I had a very nice view, there's a very slender balcony, and if you go on that you have an even better view. But the room was dull and on the small side. Also, I had problems with my shower, the water just would not drain. I had a puddle almost to my ankle after just a couple minutes, so I'd have to stop and wait 5-10 minutes for it to drain before continuing to wash off. Also, the gym was very nice - above average.

As for service, the previous two times were so-so and the treatment we got was lousy, to say the least.
