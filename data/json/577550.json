Perfect place for a first time London visitor as it is only a short walk to Leicester Square, Trafalgur Square and Covent Garden. FREE WIFI THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BUILDING !!! We had a private room and other than sharing a bathroom it was like having a hotel room (and honestly was alot better than some we stayed in along the way).

It is the reviews of people who obviously expect champagne on a beer budget that really give this place a worse name than it deserves. Pickwick Hall is located close to everything! Theatre, the tube (Holborn, Russell Square, King's Cross), Covent Garden, even walking to the Big Ben doesnt take all that long from here! So why stay here? You want something as cheap as money can buy, in the most central spot..... thats it! Are there cracks in the walls? yes Is there some mold if you look hard enough? yes Is the place in need of a renovation? probably Does any of this matter? Hell no!! Seriously people, if the free food is left out, go spend 3 pounds on breakfast from Pret. If a bathroom appears dirty, there are 4 others you could try. I'm yet to find anywhere else in London, this close to everything, this cheap, with free breakfast, some of the most comfortable beds around, free wifi, free printing, cheap laundry with staff who really do treat you far better than expected. One the same dates my parents paid 7 times this much for a hotel that didnt even have a fridge or microwave in the room, Pickwick does! I even got a whole dorm room all to myself on the top level for 24 pounds!! I would certainly recommend staying at Pickwick unless you're the kind of person highly picky about accommodation.

Our disappointing breakfast was a choice of three types of bagged sliced bread (like Wonderbread) and jam/butter or cereal, coffee and tea, nothing else. The staff was eating fruit, but there was no sign that fruit was available for anyone else. The woman on staff was a bit curt, but the older gentleman was really very nice and very helpful.
