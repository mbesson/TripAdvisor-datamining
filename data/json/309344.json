{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice looking gardens, but no privacy We looked at this hotel in 07 and we were stopped by security and questioned that time this time we stayed there was no problem for anyone who wanted to use this hotel as a thorough fair to get to the beach every morning surfers would walk thru boards under there arms and on there return to there hotels, The pool is let out to anyone who wants to use it to lay by or swim in and the walls are so thin the room next to the Kitchen we could hear the workers when they started early in the mornings starting the breakfast cooking,The cats and kittens all meow around the kitchen so the noise is heard clearly in the room every morning and evening, There is no shower in the room next to kitchen its hand held and the spa doesnt work either,The gardens are lovely and would only stay there again if it was cheap but has now jumped in price dramaticly due to more tourists, Breakfast is ok no extras in the rooms like shampooConditioner just soap and thats it .", "Date": "Oct 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR394580826", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "alaskanbali"}, {"Content": "Nice little Hotel i a good location       Beach in front of The Sari", "Date": "Oct 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR378690906", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "YellowCrazyFish"}, {"Content": "Gardens nice!       court yard on ground floor", "Date": "Jul 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR366295617", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ellen4"}, {"Content": "Close to the Beach       Pool", "Date": "Feb 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR551572142", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mcmaggles"}, {"Content": "A real disappointment :( Did lots of research and were really looking forward to this little hotel. The positives are it's good position across the road from the beach and near lots of good restaurants. The pool is good and the gardens quite nice. The negatives were the incredibly surly guy on the front desk and the totally vulgar guy at breakfast. He thought he was really funny but I was totally offended by him.We had a deluxe room upstairs which after inspecting the other rooms was the best available. Very modest and depressing with very little privacy. Sitting on the small balcony you can see and hear the people either side of you. We moved to Kamala Pantai and it was a million times better for less $$s. The only hotel of the 7 we stayed in on our last trip that we would not return to :(", "Date": "Jan 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR823866681", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MickiAustralia"}, {"Content": "A great little place Friends stay at this place all the time and recommended it. Great location, small enough to be friendly and feel at home. Some rooms are small but have huge king size beds. The superior rooms have a king size bed with plenty of room. I've stayed their twice. The first time 5 of us stayed in the family unit which is a bit old in the bedrooms and the toilets didn't work well. But the main bathroom downstairs is gigantic and there is plenty of room to spread out. The staircase upstairs is a bit narrow, not for the elderly. It leaked when it poured and a brown dust settled over everything when the rain stopped, something from the ceilings. Happy hour is great with many friends made around the pool in the afternoons drinking Bintangs and cocktails (2 for 1). Handy to everything, beach is straight in front with good surf most of the time on a sand break. The shopping is very handy and an easy walk to the cheap bargains on Sixty Six street. Great restaurants along the beachfront, around the corner is Poco Loco, and found some nice eateries in the back streets. A cheap taxi ride to Kuta or Seminyak. Will stay there again next time.", "Date": "Nov 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR242222540", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "watoz"}, {"Content": "secret hide away A small quiet hotel between the Malesti and the Puri Raja The pool, restaurant and garden area overlook the beach.
