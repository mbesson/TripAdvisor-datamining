The location was perfect for us because it was just about 10 minutes walk from my Mom's apartment. We didn't stay at my Mom's place because apartments in Hong Kong are small and to accommodate 2 extra adults for a couple of weeks is a luxury. I booked the hotel really based on the location and the price, also 2 out of the 3 reviews I read were pretty good We arrived there around 10:00 p.m., I was expecting to see a small room but my first reaction was still \"quite shocking\" to see how small the room was. Anyway, after about 2 days we got used to the size. The room, despite its size, was actually quite O.K. The bathroom was tiny too, but the shower was hot and powerful. They came to clean and changed towels, etc. everyday. The services were pretty good and the staff were helpful. I had lived in that neighbourhood for many years so I knew what it was like. If you are travelling on budget, not planning to spend a lot of time in the room, and would like to see the very local side of Hong Kong, this would be a place to consider. It is very very easy to go around the Island or even Kowloon side from there on public transportation. I would recommend this hotel, but again, you have to prepare that the rooms are quite small.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong / Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201cmodern theme, new and updated, but HK style SMALL\u201d", "Author": "izuj", "ReviewID": "UR39879454", "Content": "if you're living on a budget, the bridal tea houses are an awesome option.. this Aberdeen location is EVEN BETTER because it's not quite where tourists would stay, therefore the price is much better than anything you would find north of the Aberdeen tunnel. what makes it so high on my list is that Aberdeen has a lot of history (used to be a fishing village, and there's still a lot of fishing boats docked in the typhoon shelter) and it's very local. If your into the 'let's get lost' spirit and want to see what local Hong Kong is like, this is the perfect place. That being said, please expect most locals not having very good English. There's a wide variety of food choices to eat all over - local HK noodle places, Shanghai cuisines, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, KFC and Mickey D's, etc.. Also a huge bus stop that has buses going all over HK (buses are my favorite mode of transport as you can see HK rather than being underground in the MTR and not seeing anything but people's armpits and ads), and once you get to the other side of the Aberdeen tunnel, you are basically golden. Wanchai (a HUGE night life semi-red light but has good live bands district) is just on the other side of the tunnel, so taking a taxi to and from isn't too costly (when you're done with Wanchai, you won't really be in the mood for buses anyhow). The hotel is quaint, updated, stylishly furnished, but as I mentioned in the title, VERY VERY SMALL. Much smaller than the Western District one, but their facilities are much newer. With the price difference ranging from $100-$250 less than anything on the other side of the tunnel, you might choose this one over the Western District (again if you are the more adventurous traveler). The only thing that you need to know is that this room is so much smaller. The double beds look even smaller cuz they just fit into the end of the room (yes, I'm saying the width of the room is basically the length of a HK double bed, which is about 6'), the length from the bed to the bathroom is about 6-8 steps (mind you I am 5'1\") so I suppose a nice way to put it is that 'everything in the room is within your reach'. The staff is helpful; very honest and direct. If you get a double room you'd be away from the traffic since it's on a main room and be able to have a less noisier atmosphere to sleep in. For the price, the location, it's a good deal. Too bad it won't fit my 6'4\" friend (why I ventured over to the Ap Lei Chau BTH across the shelter, a review to come) as unless sleeping diagonally, he wouldn't fit. So try it if you're here to try HK, live among the locals and won't be in your room a whole lot, cuz just for a place to stay, it's pretty nice... I might recommend just getting a double bed regardless and don't suggest more than one person in one of the room.. ; )", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "malaysia", "Title": "\u201cfeel like being cheated!\u201d", "Author": "chuending", "ReviewID": "UR26532550", "Content": "i had a bad experience over there. Just feel myself being cheated. I had booked a room for 2 for through internet, and even from the preference coloumn i had mentioned i wanna 2 beds in a room.

In fact, i had been go through some of the review, and understand that the room is small, but i just couldnt understand that why they treat me like idiot and keep mentioning that this is HK standard size double bed!! we have no choice as that was the peak season of HK and i believe i could not locate another hotel in the new year eve. However, it spoilt my new year mood, and my 2009 was started in a bad experience! U might find it is difficult to get the hotel as it is not reachable by MTR. However, you really enjoy the local life of Hong Kees. With the crowded wet and dry market, fruit stalls, and food stalls, we did enjoy ourselves throughout our stay. Further, the bus station is 2 minute walking distance from the hotel, easily reach causeway bay, central through the bus. what i want to mean is, it is not easy to find the hotel, but easy to go central those places from the hotel.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bridal Tea House Hotel (Aberdeen)", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1213966-Reviews-Bridal_Tea_House_Hotel_Aberdeen-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.150 Aberdeen Main Road, Aberdeen, Hong Kong Island</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1213966", "ImgURL": "http://img.travel.rakuten.co.jp/share/HOTEL/109340/109340.jpg"}}
