I called downstairs to the front desk, and they told me that the manager took care of the situation. I told them to come up and smell the room for themselves. We took a nap, but no one ever came to investigate. When we went out later that evening, I told the front desk about the room. He said that he would get someone to look at it. When we came back, there was no difference. The following day we checked out. I saw the manager on duty, and I told him how disappointing our stay was. He said that he \"sprayed\" a cleanser in the air. I told him that it did not work. I also told him that someone was supposed to come and smell the room, but no one showed up.

Paid $104.50 (room rate) + $21.52 (Taxes & service fees) = $126.06 CAD per night for 2 Queen beds plus complimentary continental breakfast. Room was clean, spacious. Bed was comfortable. Concierge (Simon) was very helpful. You get a voucher to give to the waiter when you go for the Continental breakfast. The voucher includes gratuity so you do not have to tip at breakfast. Continental breakfast included the pastries, muffins, make-your-own-waffle, scrambled eggs, bacon, hash brown, orange juice, coffee etc. Beware of taxi drivers gouging you (it only costs $35 flat rate to go from a downtown hotel to airport). The driver tried to overcharge us thinking we do not speak French. You do not need to know French in Montreal. Most people are bilingual, including hotel staff. Hilton Garden Inn is being built right next to the hotel & is slated for completion next year. We stayed on a weekend so there was no construction noise going on. Ask for a room on a higher floor if you want to minimize construction noise during weekdays. The only complaint about this hotel is that the bathroom was too small. There is enough counter space, good water pressure, but the size of the washroom was tiny. When the door is opened it covered half of the bathtub. Otherwise, it is a great hotel. There is a computer in a small room in the lobby that has free internet access for guests. Traveler's Tip: Just around the corner is rue St. Catherine where you can hang out or shop. Nightlife in Montreal is incredible. There are countless coffee shops, one after another. Visit St. Joseph Cathedral. Admission is by donation. This grand cathedral is located on a hill. There's limited or almost no parking in Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal) so take a taxi. Biodome was fun. There's an animal zoo world for 4 seasons. Book a day trip to Quebec City by Grayline Tour (800-461-1223). It's a 3 hour drive from Montreal on a big Greyhound bus. The tour guide gives a history about the city & then you have time to wander on your own.

We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott and was a little apprehensive after reading the reviews online, but the hotel and staff was simply marvelous. Rene gave us suggestions on what to visit and direct directions on how to get there. He came by everyday to see how we had enjoyed where went and then would make suggestions for more places. All his suggestions were dead on the spot. I have not had such great customer service in a long time. The Courtyard staff are to be commend. The resturant food was excellent. We even enjoyed the swimming pool where our children placed Marco Polo. The rooms were clearn and roomy enough for the 4 of us. So I have no complaints about this hotel or its service. I would highly recommend this hotel to all. We went to eggspectations and the food was delicous and homemade. The service again was awesome. The people in Canadian were so very friendly.

I arrived well after midnight, and had expected, from prior experience at Courtyard by Marriott properties, to be able to grab a soda and some chips or crackers from the lobby store. When I finished check-in and mentioned to the desk clerk that I was going to get a snack, he informed me that the store was closed, without offering any alternative suggestions or even an apology. Upon arriving in my room, the first thing that greeted me was a letter on the desk from the general manager apologizing for the noise and inconvenience from the construction site next door, explaining that the hotel had no control over this. Upon entering the bathroom, I discovered that it was so small that the counter extended over the toilet, so that the only way to sit on it was with my elbow on the counter and my leg under it, with the edge of the counter in my ribs. The next morning, I spent several minutes attempting to adjust the temperature in the shower. I finally got in anyway, and discovered that the temperature continued to vary randomly by 60-80 degrees throughout, even when I didn't touch the controls. I didn't actually have a problem with noise from the construction, but I did return to my room at the end of the work day the first day to find that housekeeping had missed making up my room. The problem with the shower continued throughout my stay, but otherwise things settled down after that. The room itself was acceptable -- about what I'd expected.

I don't know what some people expect when they visit a hotel that isn't billed as \"luxury accomodations\", but this is as good as it gets when you're traveling on a budget and are simply looking for a good quality hotel. I'll break this down like I do with most of my reviews. PARKING: Valet parking was about $16/day. We had no problems retrieving our vehicles upon request by simply giving the front desk a 10-15 minute lead time. ROOM: On this occassion I was traveling with several friends and we rented more than one room. All the rooms were spacious, well-kept, clean, stocked, and nicely furnished. BEDS: The beds were clean and comfortable, even with my often-temperamental back. The sheets were of better quality than your average hotel and there were plenty of pillows. NOISE: Nothing unusual. Even as a light sleeper i was fine at this hotel. FRONT DESK: With the medium size group we were traveling with we often had to communicate with the front desk. The staff was always very friendly, helpful and accomodating. From calling cabs, giving directions and recommendations, to assisting us with our luggage and providing us with umbrellas on a particularly rainy morning, these guys always came through for us. It should also be noted here that there was NO issue at all with the fact that we were english-speaking Americans in a french-speaking Canadian hotel. LOCATION: The hotel was easy to find, right up the street from McGill University in the middle of downtown, walking distance to everything. We rarely had resort to using our vehicles to travel. RESTAURANT: It looked nice but we never ate there, so I can't comment. STORE: The hotel store is nothing more than a few shelves of goods near the front desk. However, there were several small shops, bodegas and mini-marts nearby. GYM: Never saw it, so I can't comment. POOL: Never saw it, so I can't comment. INTERNET: Hi speed wireless internet was provided free of charge. We had no problems accessing or using it.", "Date": "May 9, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Courtyard Montreal Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d185292-Reviews-Courtyard_Montreal_Downtown-Montreal_Quebec.html", "Price": "$92 - $201*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">410 Sherbrooke St. West</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Montreal</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Quebec</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">H3A 1B3</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "185292", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b3/13/b313a61b9dfc0ae9aaf8aa67365f1ee81large.jpg"}}
