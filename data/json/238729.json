{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great view Stayed three nights in this hotel, about a 15 minute walk from the Santa Maria Novella train Station, Florence, just past the American emabssy.The room was large  had a fantastic view of the River Arno  up to the Ponte Vecchio (about a 20-25 minute walk). The breakfast was limited - yogurt, bread  spreads plus coffee (great hot chocolate!) but very fresh. Bathroom was large and modern.The street was lovely and quiet, great to be a bit away from the busy Florence streets, but few restaurants nearby. The owners were helpful providing maps and also recommending a florentine restaurant where we had a traditional Florentine bifsteak.", "Date": "Oct 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR606595081", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JohnandLisa"}, {"Content": "Really Fantastic! The Casa Del Lago is a lovely, bright, friendly hotel well-located right on the water near several embassies and transportation. Antonio  his mother (who run the place) were incredibly sweet and helpful. Everyone who worked there had a smile for every guest. The breakfast, although typically small for a freebie, was laid out with great attention to detail  variety, and was delicious. My friend Rebecca  I absolutely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Apr 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR742471883", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Great place and location A really nice, simple clean place. The family that runs it was very friendly and helpful. Fairly close to the center of town although still a 15 minutes walk to the Duomo and most of the other tourists spots. On the 4th floor so it has some nice views (and thankfullly an elevator). It is in the diplomatic corner of town (directly above the Austrian consulate) so it feels particularly safe. One night was around 62 Euros off Expedia. Would definitely recommend to others.", "Date": "Feb 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR831119142", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "The fabulous Casa Del Lago The hotel is located along Lungarno Amerigo Vespucci - around a 15 minute walk from the Ponte Vecchio.

I got my wish - a room with a view in Florence. Casa del Lago was an excellent find - spotlessly clean, quiet (as it is on a one-way dead end there was very little traffic near us), modern amenities, reasonably priced on the 4th floor of a very secure building (with elevator) just blocks from the park (where there was free parking), a few minutes walk from the heart of Florence, and overlooking the Arno river. We could see the Ponte Vecchio from our large room which was simple, yet nicely appointed with very high ceilings, a beautiful window, nice comfortable bed, and a modern bathroom. The staff was very helpful and especially friendly.", "Date": "Oct 22, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR307499203", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d238729-r6024333-Casa_del_Lago-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "238729", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
