I got very skeptical cos i got a bargain (50 usd a night) through my cousin's travel agent (she told me for foreigners the rate is even cheaper.. weird) i was put into a twin-bed room, but cudn't complain cos i didn't specify bedding prefernce in booking, in the second floor overseeing the pond, and the room was immaculately clean. The mattress is great, i had better sleep here than in the more expensive Dynasty. I couldn't sleep at ALL at dynasty cos i could feel the spring of the mattress, but at Bali Rani, it wasn't a problem. I slept like a baby for 8 hours, thanks to the hotel's sensible thought of using thick comforter.. Aircon can be a problem. My friend's room was still not cold after 2 hours of turning the aircon on, while mine, even as it worked, the aircon emitted strange noise in the first 10 mins. tv: full channel listing, including axn, movies, natgeo and discovery, spanish, italian, korean, japan, arabic, chinese channels as well as news such as cnn, bbc, fox and cnbc. Breakfast was very tasty, better than most hotels in the 50-100 usd a night category i have ever stayed in Bali. Drinks here, including alcoholic, are very affordable. sure, there are many restaurant offering cheaper rate, but i don't mine spending 4 usd for a glass of pina colada :)).location wise, it's the opposite of discovery mall and next to waterboom. great for families. the downside: no beach (10 mins walking to beach), and traffic in front of the hotel, and otw from/to hotel can be very busy. bottomline: if i don't need a beach, i will definitely stay here. Otherwise, i'd prefer staying at Kumala Pantai or Pelangi Bali in Seminyak for the beachfront location.", "Date": "Apr 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR923731589", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "safircraze"}, {"Content": "back to Bali This was our first trip back to Bali in years we had stayed at The Kuta Beach Club for the last 3 yrs we had gone but I did check out other hotels on our last visit in 2002 and The Bali Rani was one of them. Friends of our had been back to Kuta Beach Club since the bombing and had said the breakfast had gone downhill since our last visit so we decided to give The Bali Rani ago. It is a little bit further to go to the Matahari but this helps you walk off your breakfast. You have the discovery mall across the road and waterbom park just a couple of doors down. We found the staff very friendly, I loved the pool but I must agree about the people putting their towels on the lounges then going out I think the management needs to address this situation it is a bit unfair if they are not going to be there then maybe after an 1hr their towel should be removed by the pool person.

Mid-way between Kuta Beach/downtown Kuta and Tuban Beach. Walking distance to downtown Kuta and Kuta Beach (to view surfers and sunset!). Plenty of restaurants/cafes/bars nearby and shopping mall is opposite. The Waterbom water theme park is next to ittoo. Traffic along the road where hotel is located can be very bad at night as road is narrow and there are way too many cars/taxis plying the road. These coupled with the endless hordes of tourists waking along the road and the numerous horse carriage joy-rides make it somewhat difficult to walk and/or cross the road especially for the older folks or people with young kids/babies.Overview of hotel: Entrance of hotel is quite nice with its traditional open courtyard look. As the public areas like the lobby and corridors are open the hotel only has air-conditioning in the rooms.The hotel has a nice courtyard with running water around a big gazebo-like area where one can relax and read. The rooms either overlook this courtyard or the swimming pool.Swimming pool: So-so, not too big, probably meant more for sun-bathing :) Pool-side bar opens till late at night.Coffee house: Most people use this place only at breakfast. For lunch and dinner hardly see any one! Suppose they, like us, prefer the wide variety of cafes and restaurants outside, all within walking distance. Cheaper too! Breakfast spread not too lavish but was reasonable, with international as well as local food available. Room: Reasonable size. Reasonably clean but somewhat run-down (as with most of the hotel). Cable TV, coffee making facilities, fridge and complimentary water (2 bottles) provided. Facilities: Hotel is quiet most of the time, except for the pool. There was no music/entertainment at the bar as the main lounge/bar was under renovation. The Thai restaurant (Thai Express) did not seem to be too popular. No safe in room but safe-deposit boxes available for free at main desk. Money changing booths easily available on the streets, reasonable rates.Tour information: The hotel does not seem to have any real info for tourists or tour info. Hardly any real tour brochures. Maybe they expect tourists to go the the tour info booths littered all over the main road for tour info and to book tours.Staff: Courteous, friendly and helpful.Summary of Hotel Bali Rani: Good value for money. Good location in the sense that it is not too crowded but within walking distance to downtown Kuta and all the eating places. Hotel is quiet and not too big or too small. There is a spa located within the hotel (did not try it).", "Date": "Feb 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR641306920", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nshkl"}, {"Content": "Not the best, but nice We moved to Bali Rani from Barong, and it was a good decision.

On the plus side , it is close to shopping and resturants so there is not too much walking that needs to be done !

Give it a miss. I\u9225\u6a9de recently (September) spent two weeks in this hotel. Location: The Bali Rani is well in Tuban (South Kuta) and the large Discovery shopping mall is basically just on the other side of a very very busy Kartika Plaza road. Is a bit of a walk to the beach (that is if you do not get skittled crossing the road!!)Rooms: The room was very clean and the ground level poolside rooms are a must!! I had no issues with the room. There was a good selection of channels on the tv (if so inclined) and housekeeping did a fantastic job.Pool: The pool area is pretty good. There\u9225\u6a9a a pool bar (NOTE: IS NOT A SWIM UP BAR!!!). Pool is not quite as big as it looks in the brouchures and on the net. The area is kept really clean. The only downside is that I would hate to be there during a peak period. If you were not up early to reserve a lounge by the pool, you would miss out. There was no policing of the unattended towels on the chairs. I noted one day that a couple reserved their chair at 8am and then went out for the day and didnt return until after 4pm and every other single lounge was taken. Staff: the staff was generally helpful and courteous. Guest mix: The majority of the guests during my stay were Europeans (mainly germans) with a lot of Indos and Japs thrown in.Food: What can I say...BLAH BLAH BLAH. Food was ok but not inspiring. the thought of Oprah in a thong bikini was more appealing that the buffet breakfast (give it a miss entirely!!!). The food at the pool bar was pretty good for a snack. Go out for your meals!Security: What is that?? The security guys were there purely for show.Conclusion: You get what you pay for. Is an OK hotel but in bali have stayed in better.

I ate at the hotel restaurant one night which was amazing, there was a huge buffet presented for a set price, with drinks and traditional Balinese dancing and entertainment afterwards, a great atmosphere.
