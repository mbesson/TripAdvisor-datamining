I have been going for 7 years ,mainly because of the location and great garden views (if you are lucky). unfortunately the last 2 times they got our booking wrong and we did not get our favorite garden- facing rooms. This last visit we were in a newer wing, directly facing another wing and looking straight into their rooms. The windows at the Russie only have blackout curtains so if you need some privacy ( like when you are walking around the room undressed ) you have to close either the blackout curtains or the outside shutters which means no more daylight. At nearly 600 euros a night for 2 people one would expect more than a hard foam pillow. Having spent a near sleepless night with a crooked neck we checked into the Ars Hotel right around the corner and for half the price of the Russie we finally had some soft pillows . At the Russie the garden is priceless specially in the warm months, the staff is nice but i do not know if i will come back next time unless i bring my own pillows.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scarsdale", "Title": "\u201cHeaven unlikely to be this nice\u201d", "Author": "Michael B", "ReviewID": "UR128298558", "Content": "Rome is my favorite city, and this is among my favorite hotels.

The doorman Daniele was a delight, entertaining the children during this process. All the staff were friendly and the service was superb as you would expect for a 5 star hotel but the thing I noticed the most was how happy the staff all seem and they made our visit a special holiday with their personal touches Rareky have I seen such good service (and we travel a lot!). The hotel is set in beautiful gardens and the restauarnt is set up so you can sit inside or outside to admire the garden. Mario, the restaurant manager, effortlessly arranged our breakfast inside followed by coffee outside in the sun upon request. Finally the Conceirge desk were very professional and when our restaurant of choice was full they booked us into an even better one overlooking the whole of Rome.

The only real negative about this hotel is that it is not quite as extraordinary as its sister property in Berlin, the Hotel de Rome. Russie's location is stellar (more charming location than Hassler) as is the service. The lobby and gardens are serene and gorgeous. Rooms are completely fine though the interior design is a bit staid and charmless compared to what you might imagine at a venerable Italian 5-star hotel. Some things I should give credit for simply because they were so perfect we never noticed them -- great shower, fast WiFi, plenty of readily accessible power outlets, etc. There is noise in the evenings even if your room faces the courtyard but I think that is to be expected given the central location in Rome. It was never bothersome. We never ate at the restaurant except for the breakfast buffet, which was very nice, but the room service food was mediocre. That was probably our biggest disappointment with the hotel. They did lose track of some laundry but to their credit, they were very apologetic and jumped through hoops to quickly track it down and are shipping the item home to us at their expense.

Rome is a 3 night stop in a long business trip, and I was looking forward to a relaxing five star experience. What a disappointment! I got a double room which is quite small and has a few undesirable features. First, the room is old, and in clear need of upgrade,specially walls and ceiling. I asked for a quiet non-smoking room, I got a room on the 5th floor with plenty of noise from the streets below. Perhaps the rooms facing the courtyard are a better choice. The non-smoking floor might as well be smokers floor as the scent crept up, and this being Rome, everyone smokes everwhere. TV service and phone service were spotty, had a few hours yesterday with neither but did not bother to report it. The amenities are not high quality, and neither is the bed. The turn down service is useless (no chocolate!). Worst of all booked the hotel for its one feature: spa with pool and hot tub. Well, they are closed for renovation and I was not informed of this important detail at the time of booking. The one redeeming quality at this hotel is the staff. Everyone is polite, professional and acommodating, as they should be in a five star hotel. Everything else is overhyped and not in line with the high price. Considering this is the most expensive hotel in Rome, I was expecting the experience to match the price. Sadly, this is not the case. On the bright side, the location is good, the garden is pretty, and the common areas clean and well maintained.

Compounding this problem we arrives to a full house off the early New York flight and were told we would get the first room available. We did, and as we were more interested in napping than waiting chose not to wait for an offered better room. The staff was very accommodating and helpful and of course, breakfasting outside while waiting is very pleasant. The room, which was in the wing over the desk, should have been left with the Russians when Rocco Forte took over the property. The room was big enough, and well furnished but its depressing Bronx-like view was depressingly airspace between buildings. Of course, a view overlooking the courtyard can be noisy. All this was fine but the bathroom was TINY. I had to exhale to fit thru the door and of course there was not space for toiletries of an indigent midget let alone 2 adults, one of whom was a woman. I understand that bathrooms in old buildings are a very difficult problem; bath in design and expense but what disturbed me was no one, realizing that this was so small, put the effort into laying out shelving, towel bars, hook and more shelves as one would expect a 5 Star property should. I ended up emptying the tray by the mini-bar and using it to balance on the sink and provide space to put toiletries. Management knows that they will need to rent this room, not as overflow but as part of their regular room inventory, and knows it is charging fully for it so 5 Star management should spend the time and effort, and a little money designing a solution as to making the space efficient and in keeping with what I expect in a luxury property. Reading on Trip Advisor other reviews other guests appear also to have issue with the baths. I love the De Russie. The staff is so Italian charming; the concierge found us good restaurants and were helpful with our transportation. Sitting in the Jardin is memorable and, for me, the location is perfect.

However, we were left feeling that this was our least successful experience in one of their hotels. Let's start with the good things - the property is lovely with an interior courtyard and spacious public rooms. The courtyard area would have been great in the summer - we were staying here in mid-winter so couldn't use it. The location is perfect for those who want to take advantage of Rome's shopping and it's close to a metro station for those who want to explore Rome more widely. But in some important ways it disappointed us. The service, always so sleek and subtle in other Rocco Forte properties, was here noisy and brash, with excessive and loud name-checking of guests. (They must have a policy on this, as it is included in their guest questionnaire.) For example, over breakfast to be asked every 5 minutes \"Signora X is everything OK?\" was a bit trying. The service in the bar was a bit peremptory - we had a sandwich lunch here on one day and weren't made to feel welcome - they actually made us move tables as the one we picked they had earmarked for someone else! And 50 Euros for two sandwiches and soft drinks is my idea of seriously expensive. The other major downside of this hotel is the noise - our rooms were on the third floor but we could hear the music from the bar throughout the day and evening - how is that even possible? The music at breakfast was also at top volume. We were here for New Year's Eve and the downside of the location became clear. The hotel is adjacent to the Piazza del Popolo and this is where the serious firecracker action takes place from 11 onwards - and after midnight the place went crazy. So this is not the place for you if you want a quiet restful stay. On balance, this is still a fantastic chain of hotels, just that the Hotel de Russie is our least favourite.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nancy", "Title": "\u201cA magical Place\u201d", "Author": "Maklouf1", "ReviewID": "UR122213236", "Content": "The location between piazza del popolo and piazza de Spagna is perfect , to shop , to walk , to visit.

I booked a romantic package ( 1 candle light dinner, 1 bottle of champagne and chocolate) for 800 Euro a night. I had been in the de Russie before for dinner and drinks. I liked it very much and thought it was a save bet. As others have said : The hotel location is perfect. The service is outstanding and personal. The restaurant is fantastic and the interior is very stylish. We enjoyed our first dinner and went straight to bed. The next morning I was a bit surprised by the room. It was small ( maybe 16m2) with a bed more queen than king size - the bathroom had only one washing basin and no seperate shower. It looked more like a single than a double room. The aircondition was a bit lound - not much but enough to make me try to shut it down and open the window. That was no good idea as it was very loud outside. Also I realized that oposite, less than 15 feet away, was an apartment with a window. These folks could see me and I could closely see what they where up to - Not really what you are looking for when you book a romantic package. The room was on the second floor - had no view and the toilet was giving strange loud noices when in use. Our second day in Rom was again fantastic - we wandered around , did some shopping and had a good lunch. After return my wife went to bed for a nap and I tried the sauna and wellness section of the hotel - absolutly outstanding. When I returned I told my wife lets get ready for another nice dinner and opened the free bottle of champagne - only to realize that is was Proseco ( according to the pricelist a 35 Euro value instead of 100+Euro for Champagne) We where so pissed off that we went to a restaurant outside the hotel. Sure, I booked a standard room - but when you pay 800 Euro a night you don't expect a very standard room ( with a max value of 250 Euro a night) Next morning when I was still struggeling with my mixed feelings for a verdict my beloved wife had a long look at me and simply said ' next time its the Hussler again'", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cAn oasis of tranquility in the heart of crowded Rome\u201d", "Author": "ed1", "ReviewID": "UR118577607", "Content": "The Hotel de Russie has to rate as one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.

Sebastiano, the front office assistant manager failed to apologise and almost tried to make it sound normal. Very unpleasant start especially when your room rate is around the EUR1k mark. As a way to make up for it and after 1hr of discussions, they offered to pay our lunch. However, the great thing there is that my wife had to wait 45' to receive her salad... - The FT newspaper never made it to my room for the first couple of days. The reception's excuse was that someone was playing with the newspapers - The concierge was rude and dry - The WiFi is something to pay and at a very expensive rate - The room service menu shows rates to which you need to add 15pc on top as it's room service menu. So if i receive it in the hall way do i not pay the 15pc? Why not just add the price and stop looking cheap? - One of the water bottles left by our bed side table had pidgeon excrement on it - The person in charge of the breakfast was intrucive and extremely loud. He kept on asking the same questions all 5 breakfasts we had there. On the breakfast: choice was limited and again for a 5starL it is surprising to see that the eggs were an additional charge. As you can see, what may look as a budget to start with at the Hotel de Russie needs to inflate as everything is on top of it. Nasty surprise was a hair on top of a muffin. Other nasty surprise was receiving dirty / stained napkins. - They say they have a pool but in reality kids below 12 cannot use it - The staff generally speak poor English. For example we would ask at breakfast not have them remove staff on our table and they would. Really unpleasant. - Most amazing of all is that they hosted a wedding in the main garden with music blasting up to almost midnight and waking us up. It seems all guests were up in arms calling reception and asking for them to stop this noise. We too called and had to request twice. Unbelievable for us and for the couple's wedding that had to be cut short; they should not offer this. - The room's furniture looked out of place and well organised. + Nice garden and setting in the centre of Rome + The bellboy, Christian (tall guy), was welcoming and a good guide + The location of the hotel is ideal to either side of the city + We had asked for quite some items for a baby boy which were all in the room", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cA Good Hotel but Certainly not the Best\u201d", "Author": "BASLJM", "ReviewID": "UR116388594", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel de Russie for 6 nights in June 2011.

We almost always stay in Four Season Hotels when available and our review should be assessed on this standard. There is lots to like about the Hotel de Russie, and the hotel perhaps deserves its five star rating (though just!) but it is not even close to the standards of most Four Seasons Hotels, which became very obvious after staying for 5 days at the FSH in Florence (see our review) right after leaving the Hotel de Russie. The Hotel de Russie is a nice hotel, with decent size rooms and a beautiful courtyard (it's most attractive feature). The bathroom was a bit small (though not by European standards) and our room looked onto another building. It was disappointing not to have a courtyard room, though the one advantage of this is that we had no noise from the bar and the restaurant. We had the breakfast daily, which was excellent and, as others have commented on, the maitre'd and waitstaff are friendly and helpful. There is lots to choose from and my only disappointment is that you have to pay extra (lots!) to have eggs. The spa looks great (though we only used the pool) and the exercise room is excellent for a hotel of this size. Like others, we found the wifi charge to be an irritant, especially when paying 850 euros for the room. The hotel's location is excellent, about a 5 minute walk to the Spanish Steps and 45 minutes to the Coliseum. The negatives: while our room was recently updated, and they did a very nice job of the bathroom, the furniture is quite cheap. The bathtub/shower is small and narrow. The bed sheets are horrible: they were so rough that my wife had burn marks on her elbows from rolling over during the night. The bellhops and concierge staff could certainly do with some service training and reflect poorly on the hotel.

There was, for example, an especially heinous circular fake wooden table with a fake gold zigzag base in front of our french doors leading to the garden--with no chairs (we stood at the window to drink our cappuccinos in the morning). It seemed like it was placed in the room haphazardly, and when I joked about having the hotel remove it, I lifted it up with one hand, it was so light. Then I noticed that most everything at this hotel looks like stone and marble and is actually made of plastic--seriously, even the marble relief carvings in the hallways are molded plastic. There was an orange ottomon in the room, a bright red plastic mini-bar/TV monstrosity, and a green chair. This random, cheap decor just did not compute at all for a hotel of this stature. The bathroom was acceptable, but the shower curtain was a stained, small liner that covered only 1/3 of the shower-tub combo--it was the likes of what you find in a Motel 6. My friend's main complaint was that the hotel lacks taste on just about every level, and was incredibly uncomfortable. The bed was rock-hard, the sheets were linen but improperly laundered and scratchy. There is an abhorrent lack of attention to detail everywhere you turn. Now for the lack of service: The room was moldy and smelled dank and damp and made both of us sneeze. They informed us that they did not have another room available other than the presidential suite, so we stayed (it was only the last night). They wanted to charge us 20 Euros for 24 hours of internet access although we checked in at 7:00pm and had to leave at 5:30am without breakfast the next day and needed just several hours' worth of internet service after dinner to get organized before our departure back to NYC. When I explained that we were unhappy with the room and that we would like them simply to comp us for the internet, Reception explained to us that they were \"unauthorized\" to do anything for us and that we would have to go through a formal complaint process and talk to various supervisors to complain. After having stayed at the most luxurious, beautiful hotels all through Italy with exceptional service, this reply was just unacceptable! No one wants to waste even 10 minutes of their time complaining to \"supervisors\" at a hotel. Hotels are in the hospitality business and their staff is hired to make people feel comfortable and taken care of. The last thing we wanted was to deal with some bureaucratic overstructure--more typical of a Holiday Inn-level property--in order to get our internet access comped. We were not asking for anything complicated, and the person at Reception could easily have made a better effort to convince us that he would even try to accommodate our request (we didn't ask for a discount on the room or demand to be moved, for example--just free internet for the several hours we would need it in the room to get organized for our departure). Unfortunately, every other interaction with Reception was similarly bizarre and revealed their utter lack of training and thoughtfulness.

The maitre'd is very friendly as are the rest of the staff. We had a lovely lunch and were informed that our room was ready. We were taken up to the third floor to room 320, a \"deluxe double\"...what a disappointment. The room was tiny and faced a back alley (not the courtyard as we requested) and a neighbor's back terrace that was so close you could reach out and touch it. I asked if anyone lived there and the man who took us to our room said he'd never seen anyone there (a little old lady came out almost as if on cue a few minutes later so we had to keep our curtains closed the whole time).

There are a lot of hotels near the Spanish Steps that are much less per night...I just don't think that these prices are warranted here...for $1,000 per night for a basic room category there should be more wow factors (though linen sheets on the bed were admittedly a nice touch)...everything from cheap toilet paper, bare minimum bathroom amenities and cookie cutter Ikea-like furniture is out of place.

I have stayed in Four Seasons hotels all over the world and they set the standard for me. The room rate average was $1,600.00 dollars per night. Upon pulling up to the hotel, the curb appeal was pretty unimpressive. The building was dirty and chunks of the building was missing right in front of the entrance. The front desk staff was dressed well and took our bags right away which was good but the greeting was not that great-just seemed like a fomality to him. Entering the building is also not that impressive. No sense of entry. The staff that we had to check in was pretty cold and barked at us for our passports. The room was not ready (we arrived around 1PM I believe) so they told us to have lunch outside in the restaurant outside. The courtyard is really pretty and nicely landscaped. The waiters were not very pleasant and seemed annoyed with us for some reason. The room was ready by 3PM. The room was larger then I expected which was a nice surprise. Like other reviews here, the room did smell like mold. The room is appointed ok but certainly nothing special at all. The TV was tiny. The bathroom was a fair size and again ok but nothing special. My first experience with concierge was I would say very poor. I asked for a couple of different recommendations based upon my DK travel book and he basically picked a random restaurant that wasn't on my list and said go here. He called to make the reservation after I said ok and made it for two people. I told him as fast as I could that it needed to be for three and he scoffed and looked angry he had to call them back. We did experience a younger gentleman in concierge that was very very pleasant. bottom line spotty service. The elevators were tiny and scuffed up along with scratched tile. And as other reviews have said, one of the elevators was broken. Broken for 2 days. To be honest, I really don't see how people could give this hotel a glowing review. It really makes me think the management is writing the reviews because this is a terrible value and not even close to a 5 star hotel. And I don't need a message from management because it means nothing to me and you have responded to other guests in the past saying blah blah blah but you haven't fixed anything. The same problems over and over again. Rome is tough if you really want a great hotel it seems like. There is no Ritz or Four Seasons, Mandarin or even a true St. Regis? I heard it is a partner hotel.

Tips to get the best from your stay are: Make full use of the concierge to organise everything and then relax after a long day in the pool. Start with a time defined (stick to it with the guide) tour and organised events but once you have become familiar you can do it cheaper yourself...but may heave to queue more....

If it gets chilly, someone will promptly wheel an outdoor heater to your table. The suite we had was fairly compact, and very contempoary in style. It had a large terrace with a wonderful view of the roofs of Rome from its fith floor. The modern style might not be to everyone's taste, but for me it worked fine, as the furnishing was of good taste, and high in quality. Well equiped with two telivisions, and a dvd player was brought to us on our request. The bed was hard, too much so, but that may be a charateristic in Italy. Service level never disappointed.

The location is tops...equally close to the lovely Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps (and the fan of streets leading from the Spanish Steps. It is a straight line from the hotel to the Piazza della Venezia. The hotel is dreary and a bit run-down. It really does not have a modern decor, but it isn't old-school luxurious either. We had an extremely large Junior Suite with a separate office-type room near the entrance to the suite. Off this \"office\" we had a lovely patio. The three huge windows overlooked the 'secret garden\".....the view and quiet were lovely. I cannot understand why anyone would choose this hotel. The rooms at the Hassler are smaller, but the Panorama of the city from the top of the Steps is unforgettable. The back-facing rooms are pretty enough so the view is largely not missed (especially if you haven't seen it). But what sets the Hassler apart from the de Russie is the cleanliness and the seriously professional service at the Hassler. The rooms are gleamingly spotless. The concierge is dignified and all the staff is quiet and elegant and formal and knowledgeable. To be fair to the de Russie, I arrived from Florence by train; during the journey my wallet was stolen: I arrived at the hotel with no cash or credit cards and the de Russie Front Office Manager greeted me at the entrance and directed the staff to charge the taxi to my room. He was quite sympathetic and he offered assistance. although there was none which could be provided. But if my room had not been so large and so expensive, I would have thought I was in a tour-bus quality hotel: as I said, run-down furniture, the tiniest television I had ever seen and an unimpressive bathroom with a very stingy supply of unremarkable bath products. At all the other five star hotels I have visited in Italy have always outfitted the bathrooms with excellent products. There was a huge amount of closets and lots of comfortable room to sit: a huge sofa, enormous coffee table, club chairs, desk, etc. But drab and dreary with no thought to style whatsoever. The bed was creepy: the mattress pad did not fit the mattress and the sheets were constantly unravelling from underneath the mattress. My son was covered with at least thirty welts when he woke up on the morning: I canfnot claim bed bugs...perhaps they were mosquito bites, but I truly don't know. I also saw a mouse run across the room during the morning, in full daylight.. The housekeepers were loud and rolled their service carts down the halls outside the rooms while gabbing away....I don't generally see this type of housekeeping service at this calibre of hotel. Usually, especially in Europe, the housekeeping is very discreet....not a rolling cart in sight. What I experienced at the de Russie is what I expect from a chain motel. The Stravinsky Bar looked nice, but the staff was unreceptive and as chilly as the night air. We ate in their highly touted restaurant. The food was so dreadful for dinner that I literally could not eat one bite of my main dish. Again, the service was indifferent. They did remove the charge for our main dish. But I noticed that the tables where there were \"romantic couples\" seated enjoyed more appropriate service, befitting a \"fine dining\" restaurant.. I guess they anticipated more course would be ordered and more bottles of wine were to be sold to couples. I was dining with my young son. We were both properly dressed and ordered full meals; our bill was certainly worthy of decent service. Not a smile in sight. Also, this was the first hotel that did not send up a treat for my son, or even a scaled down bathrobe. Every hotel in every country on every trip gave my son a gift ranging from t-shirts to stuffed animals to delicious chocolate treats...the whole gamut. The Ritz in London took my son for a ride in its magnificent Rolls Royce (and there our room rate was one-third the cost of the room at this dump in Rome). Now the concierge! The first morning we approached the concierge. The woman who bowled us down was aggressive, dismissive, and totally unhelpful. Inasmuch as we had been to Rome several times, we were definitely not interested in the bus tours, chauffered cars and extremely expensive rip-off activities with highly padded fees that would have benefitted the concierge at our expense. During our last visit to Rome, we hired an extremely knowledgeable private guide to take us through a four-hour visit to the Vatican. It was a true highlight of a month-long trip to Europe: our guide was interesting and navigated us through the throngs of people. My son was only nine and he enjoyed every last second of this private tour. When I told the concierge about my son's interest in these types of activities, she looked at me like I was crazy and told me that it was inappropriate for me to hire an art historian, for example, or history expert, to guide us through the other interesting parts of Rome because it would be wasted on a kid. She discouraged us from taking a day trip to Hadrian's Villa or Naples unless we hired a car and driver for the day. She also offered to get us a 1/2 hr. horse and buggy ride for the bargain price of 200 Euro (these rides were available literally right outside the hotel door for 150 Euro - still a rip off in my opinion). She only wanted to send us to ridiculous, unimaginative venues. She sent us to an attractiion called \"Rewind\" near the Colesium: she claimed it was exciting and would be perfect for my son. It was a joke! a five minute 3D movie that was completely uninformative and was basically a prelude to a huge gift shop the size of the Colesium itself. We were literally the only two people at this so-called attraction. We have done some corny attractions in some other cities: the London Dungeon comes to mind; also Ripley Believe it or Not....this was a pathetic five minute nothing and provided not even fun in that type of cheesy fun that can be a great way to fill up a day with a child. Beyond boring and a disappointment is the way to describe this activity. Also, it robbed us of the time we could have spent seeing something interesting. The concierge also told us that if we didn't hire a private car it would be \"impossible\" to find a cab to take us back to the hotel. Ridiculous! There were dozens of cabs. The hotel also clipped us for a ridiculous enterprise: it recommended a \"school\" where my son would have a blast learning how to be a gladiator at a price of 100 Euro. This god-foresaken place was a run-down, ramshackle bunch of shacks on a side road of the Appian Way. When we arrived, it was creepy: a mean man started barking orders at my son. The activity was by appointment; the concierge told us that way we were sure to have other boys and girls particpating. Once again, my son and I were the only people there, except for this vicious man. He made homophobic comments to my slightly built son (age 10). He told him he wasn't a real man because, being left-handed, he naturally picked up his replica sword with his left hand. There were ramshackle picnic tables, a dirty yard with no equipment save a bunch of ropes with sand bags hanging from the ends. He insisted my son run through these moving targets over and over again and was as mean as could be when my son \"messed up.\" Before this misanthrope allowed my son to actually participate in the activity we had come for, we were taken into a makeshift dank and mouldy\"museum where this man proceeded to tell us every trivial detail about every helmet, sword, shield and weapon in the collection. There was no place to sit; no refreshment center, no water....nothing. It was boiling hot and I couldn't believe that for 100 Euro we were not even provided with the opportunity to purchase a water or sit on a bench. All we had was this mean man, a dank, dark \"museum\"(really a garage with discarded junk)....and a ten minute lesson on how to block moves this man made in his simulated attempt to vanquish my 65 pound son. He barked and yelled and growled at us both. When the 2 hour torture was over, he kindly called a cab for us, but not before asking a host of prying questions including my age and our religion. I always hate when people go on in TripAdvisor reviews about things that have nothing to do with the hotel...e.g. stupid attractions or bad weather or construction down the road. But HERE the CONCIERGE at this FIVE STAR HOTEL scammed us into these activities!!! I really felt hood-winked, we were robbed by this band of misfits, just as I was robbed by a thief of my wallet on the train! The bill, at checkout, was full of errors. For example, the suite came with a \"package\" that entitled us to watch unlimited pay-per-view movies. We watched three in three days and they tried to charge us for two of them. They also tried to charge us for water at our buffet breakfast: the breakfast was included in the 1700 Euro a night rate. The buffet had water, all types of juices, Prosecco, etc. We had no tea, no coffee, no juice no prosecco. All we had was water and one criossant each. And they had the nerve to try to charge us 15 Euro for water at each breakfast (for which they had no bill or signature, etc.) They never provided me with the Nokia cell-phone during my stay for complimentary local calls. And, as a parting salvo, we used their car and driver service (at four times the price of a cab). The driver, summarily dumped our bags on the curb, no where near the entrance to the terminal nor near the ranks of luggage carts: a middle aged woman and her son....what courtesy! Again, this would not appear in a review of the hotel if the hotel had not provided the service. The concierge was a scourge on the pride this profession generally takes in its important job at luxury hotels (especially in Europe where they truly \"run the show\") to ensure guests' needs and desires are met at every turn.I'd never go back to Rome...but I cannot tell if it isn't because of the truly vexing experience I had at the hotel which overshadowed the days we were there.", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely the best hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "hb7176", "ReviewID": "UR75809914", "Content": "Yes, it is very expensive and the basic rooms can be quite small, but this hotel in a true gem.

Are room was ok but extremely expensive even by Italian standards for what we got. The key issue was the concierge staff. We book two restaurants through them in advance. We asked for both to be at 9:00 pm and got confirmation that we had these reservations. When we got to the hotel they told us that our first reservation as at 10:15 pm. We were on Turkish time (an hour later) and wanted to eat earlier especially after a day of travel. They could not get an earlier reservation and recommend a place like the one we reserved. They said it was only five minuets in a taxi. Well, the place was mediocre at best and was 15 minutes a way by taxi. We could not eat at the outside tables and were put in an inside table that had nothing but an empty room to look at. I think we paid more than $40 in taxi fairs. When we got back we took a bit of a walk and found some really nice restaurants close to the hotel. Prior to the dinner, we went to the garden bar which is in a very beautiful setting. All the tables were booked (probably by locals). We waited around and were finally given a table (not in a very good location). We gave our drink orders to the waiter. We ordered two cocktails and a bottle of water. After 30 minutes we still had no drinks. I asked the waiter about this and he said the bar was very busy but we saw another table that had arrived later then us get served. I asked that he bring the water at least now. He said yes but did nothing about it. We left with no drink after another 15 minutes The next night worked out. Then we were to leave by car and asked that they confirm our rental reservation. They confirmed it but then said we had to leave at 8:00 am that morning because of a bicycle tour that would prevent us from leaving the hotel later. It turned out that the tour had been rerouted the week before and this was totally not required. We had to leave two hours before we wanted to. We got to Avis to find that it was closed and had to stand in the street for another 30 minutes. In the mean time we had found out that there are many really nice boutique hotels in Rome.

It was an exceptional value considering the state of the euro vs the dollar at the time (04/08). To say we were thrilled with our accommodations at both 5 star hotels is an understatement. The De Russie in particular was stellar. The hotel is in a fabulous location. Steps away from major sights, the Spanish Steps and within walking distance of many fine restaurants and shops. Our spacious room featured a king sized bed, sitting area, oversized marble bathroom, luxurious bedding and tasteful decor. Clean lines, art, and fine furnishings made our stay so special. Our room was located on hotel's top floor, and overlooked the walls of the Borghese Gardens and the private outdoor garden/restaurant and terraces of the hotel. In a bustling city like Rome, this quiet and calm green oasis provided a relaxing haven. The view from our balcony was magnificent. The Hotel De Russie also features an excellent spa which features a lovely indoor heated and jetted pool. We booked massages and felt totally pampered. Our package included daily breakfast and a superb dinner at the Jardin De Russie. We dined al fresco by candlelight while being serenaded by soft live music. It was enchanting! The staff at the hotel was so helpful, the service meticulous and food amazing. We stay at lovely hotels everywhere we go, but this hotel in particular was the most exceptional one to date.

I was in the last portion of a 10 day business trip to London, Paris and Rome and wanted to treat myself to a nice hotel centrally located in Rome. At 726 Euro per night, the price tag is well worth what you will save in headaches, long walks back to your hotel and what may be one of the most lavish experiences you will have. It was what I expected and then some. To begin, the location could not be better to walk around the old part of town, it is at the very edge of the Piazza della Repubblica, on Via del Babuino, one of the main shopping streets in Rome. This is the most expensive area to live in Rome, the hotel gardens and all the inside rooms face the gardens of the Palazzo Borghese, so the back drop is scenic. A short 5 minutes walk on the same Via del Babuino and you are at Piazza Spagna. Walk one block down and parallel to it is Via del Corso, another main shopping street. The hotel stay and the concierge personnel made up for the nightmare I was going through, my luggage did not arrive with me. I flew Alitalia from Paris and they lost both pieces. I am back in the US and there is still no news about it. The concierge personnel (Alessandra, you must say hi to her, she is just fantastic, and Giusseppe who had a great dining suggestion after another) did what they could to try and locate my luggage, which meant calls to Alitalia every couple of hours. I got upgraded to a great studio room facing the front of the building, room 510. Linen sheets, silk draperies in muted colors, authentic pieces of art and clean contemporary furniture with an ode to the 40's made the place an oasis, I did not want to leave that room. The bathroom all outfitted in white and grey marble with shining polished chrome fixtures has just the perfect size and perfect lighting. My room particularly was very quiet, even though it faced the street. Upon arrival I dined at the garden restaurant, quite pricey (90 Euro for one person, 2 glasses of Pinot Grigio) under the stars, lit by candles. It was so quiet you could barely hear the murmur of the conversations in the tables around. After a flight and what i was going through, it was exactly what i needed. The lobby and hallways are decorated with original engravings and sculptures placed strategically, the effect is both theatrical and inspiring, clean walls, clean floors devoid of rugs and 16 feet ceilings confirm you are walking into a historical building that had to be preserved at all costs. My check in process did not take more than 2 minutes, the check out process the same. Upon leaving I left a shirt to be laundered which the concierge staff sent back to me at home at no charge to me even though I had specified a courier account they could use. I will definitely make this my only place to stay in Rome, the level of service, the impeccable condition of the building, the halls and my room made for an unforgettable experience I want to bring my partner to share next time I visit this city.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cIncredible -- don't understand the complaints\u201d", "Author": "Japan_Gaijin", "ReviewID": "UR19470551", "Content": "This is a very distinctive property.

We booked the third most expensive suite (Popolo) which overlooks the Piazza del Popolo and after all the hype, we were distinctly underwhelmed! So much so that when we were shown to our suite we had to ask if it was indeed the Popolo Suite! The modern decor was pleasant but all much smaller than we expected. The bathroom - far from being superior - was small with a shower within the bath, no separate shower!! Very poor. We suggest they take a look at the Spirit Suites at Gleneagles in Scotland if they want to know about superior bathrooms!! The roof terrace overlooking the Piazza was large and furnished with a table and chairs plus two recliners. However this lovely area could not be used during the heat of the day because there was no umbrella or awning to shelter one from the sun. We wanted to relax and read on this terrace and indeed have our breakfast there as shown on the website but it was not practical. (When breakfast did arrive it was on a trolley and there is no way that could have been lifted over a large step onto the terrace). When we asked for an umbrella we were told it would be done while we had lunch in the courtyard. However upon returning to our room after lunch nothing had been done. We contacted the desk only to be told that they could not put umbrellas on this terrace because it was on the city side of the hotel. This was the main reason for booking this suite so we could relax in private - a complete waste from every point of view! When we complained we were told nothing could be done but that the manager would arrange for an awning to be put up for guests in the future!! Great!! \"The striking landscaped garden\" - as quoted in the brochure is certainly an attractive area to dine and a calm oasis from the noise of the city outside but the umbrellas were filthy and birds landing on the tables were a big problem. The Secret Garden is very small with very few places to sit and read/relax and we didn't see a single butterfly!!?? Not value for money. A big disappointment. We will not go there again.

I anguished about the choice between the Eden and the De Russie, but having stayed at the Savoy in Florence, I decided to trust Sir Rocco. All of this was arranged in January for a May stay, and so I had plenty of time to worry about the less than wholly enthusiastic reviews on trip advisor. I did worry, but I needn't have. We loved the hotel. I saw no sign at all of any neglect in maintenance. Everything seemed to be immaculate. Our room, which we had booked as a \"deluxe\" room [and we were told on arrival we were being \"upgraded\"] turned out to be an average size room but with a fabulous terrace [on the 6th floor] overlooking the Via del Babuino with views to the Piazza del Popolo.

One major complaint concerns outside noise: My room must have been near an alley or kitchen unloading area, as early in the morning there was the sleep-disturbing clatter of someone trundling a cart of glassware down a sidewalk. I didn't bother telling the front desk. The hotel's public areas were neither notable nor worthy of condemnation. If the hotel hosts a spa or gym, I used neither. Contrary to another poster's opinion, I found the breakfast to be stupendous. All manner of cold meats, fish, cheeses, breads, pastries, fruit, juices, etc., etc. A silver pot of coffee left at my table. Cooked eggs for the asking. Prosecco ad lib! I gavaged myself in the morning and wasn't hungry again until evening, even after full days of walking. I have to think I got my EUR 30 worth. I didn't eat any other meal at the hotel so can't comment on the restaurants otherwise. The location on the Piazza del Popolo is an excellent starting point for sightseeing. There's a great deal of activity around the piazza itself, although at the time I was there it had some hideous reflective display sprawled through its middle. Not the fault of the hotel. On the bright side, I was able to walk from the hotel to Piazza San Pietro in one direction and to the Colosseum in another. Wandering through side streets, I found myself on one occasion at the Pantheon, then later at the Trevi fountain. I didn't have a great deal of interaction with the staff, though I did ask a concierge for a restaurant recommendation for traditional food. He was obliging though not particularly friendly, and his recommendation was just fine. At checkout, I was suprised to find a charge for more than double what I had expected for the airport transfer. I was charged the \"limousine\" rate (hence the larger car) though I had requested a sedan (and had the e-mail to prove it). The manager graciously declined to see the e-mail and simply charged the lower rate. All in all, I would recommend the hotel for its location (and for the buffet breakfast!). However--and only in my opinion--it isn't a true luxury property (even though it's prices might suggest that it is). I wouldn't pay more than about EUR 300 for a room here, unless I really, really wanted a suite, had to stay here regardless of cost, or had money to burn.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France", "Title": "\u201cNot really enthusiastic about the De Russie\u201d", "Author": "Cedric\u03a0erre", "ReviewID": "UR11550417", "Content": "I was hesitating between the Hassler and the De Russie to come to Rome with my friend to celebrate his 36 birthday.

Generally, I agree with a previous post that says the walls are bashed here and there and the furniture is looking drab and faded.

After we identified that we were from the hotel, he said \"From the bar.\". The appropriate thing would have been to send it to us via Room Service. On a plus note, they did upgrade our room to a suite at no additional cost. One other concierge, a very nice woman, gave us great little places to try and she proved to be knowledgeable and eager to please by understanding our interests in food, etc. The hoteld did send us a bottle of Proseco because it was our wedding anniversary. That was a nice touch also but could have come as the result of my complaints in trying to reach them via email numerous times with no replies. The location of the hotel is great for shopping.

I am sure that the celebrities staying at the hotel for the Film Festival the same weekend had a wonderful experience. However, the entire hotel is billed as (and charged as) 5 star and every room should live up to that standard as should the attitude of the concierge staff. We had emailed the concierge about 2 weeks prior to our arrival with a request for a dinner reservation at Dal Bolognese on the night we arrived. We only heard from them that this was not available on the late afternoon of our arrival and when we went downstairs to try to get another reservation we were scolded for our lack of preparation by the concierge on duty!! After that we tried to show them some suggestions that we had brought along from friends etc and these were sneered at. Grudgingly they agreed to make reservations at some of these (which were actually great) The small dark room that we were given in no way felt like a 5 star experience. We had not booked the cheapest room and in fact were told we had been upgraded (hard to believe). When we called to express our disappointment and explained that we had been expecting a \"Garden or City view\" we were told that travel agents often misrepresent the rooms to their clients..hmm but we booked it on your website!! One window looked directly across to the windows of an office building and the other, which was in a little annexe, looked onto an airshaft. We had to keep the lights on at all times. The carpet was stained and the furniture was chipped-not in an antique type of way but in a \"need to replace this\" type of way. In the last year we stayed at the Merrion in Dublin which I would imagine has similar contraints in terms of being an old building right in the center of town, it is extremely plush and luxurious.

This is a grand old lady of Roman hotels who has been through a fair degree of buffing up and some decorative Botox. Service was good though room service admittedly was pleasant but not to US standards. The concierges and front-desk staff were superb. We were recommended a series of great restaurants within walking distance - all on the button and which met exactly our requirements ranging from the night we wanted a swanky, traditional Roman meal to the night we wanted a lighter, trendier tapas type wine bar! Many thanks for the recommendations. Our airport transfer was also arranged via the hotel. The spa is a bit of a disappointment - you cannot really get a proper swim but it is still pleasant for a dip after a day trekking the sights. The Bar is very popular with local business people and can get crowded but the waiters are pretty attentive and make sure residents get seated. Coffees and drinks are much pricier than locally -but hey you're paying to people watch too - we popped across the street for espressos and breakfast. The complimentary umbrellas from the doormen were much welcomed during some downpours - as was their ability to flag down cabs while everyone in Rome wanted one.

We had a deluxe room that had a very good size and an uninspired contemporary design. The bathroom was kind of small and nothing impressive, it didn`t have a walk in shower, only a tub. The service is very poor, beggining with the doormen who didn`t bother to open the door for the hotel guests and when he did he kept talking on his cellphone, the waiters at breakfast who kept forgeting asking us what we want to drink and the concierge who made only bad restaurant suggestions sending us only where he probably had an agreement with the owners.

I checked out of the Intercontinental, when I'd had enough of the inconsistant service there, and I hauled my bags down to The Russie. When I called to inquire about availability, I was quickly impressed when the reservations manager offered me a wonderfully reduced rate. I'm affraid that if I were to have been offered a rack rate I would have had to find other accomodations. However, my reduced rate, to my amazement, in no way changed the level of service that was given to me. When I checked in (at only 11:00am), the desk agent, Michaela, not only apologized for my room not being ready, she escorted me to the the beautiful hotel bar and insisted that I order anything I like (on the hotel of course), then she said that she would return for me just as soon as my room was ready. She did, in less than an hour, still apologizing for the wait, and took me to a gorgeous studio room with a view of Piazza del Popolo. It was incredible! It had beautiful stained wood floors, sky high ceilings, a huge mosaic tile bathroom, and furnished with impecable taste. The sheets on the bed (linen and smelling devine!) made it hard to get up in the morning, even knowing that Rome was outside! Everyone without exception that I came into contact with at hotel was wonderful. Room service, housekeeping, concierge, etc... It was so nice to return to the hotel and actually be greeted by name from the doorman!

I heard from an ex-pat living in Rome, she only knew of it because all the boys from Ocean's 12 stayed there during the shoot. No wonder. It's pretty glam/dolce vida'ish. I stayed in two different rooms, both with wonderful sheets, comfortable beds, beautiful bathrooms, little sculptures and art touches, etc. And if you can upgrade, the higher up you stay, the better your views are likely to be of both the dining area/garden and the Borghese Park (I don't know if that's the official name, please forgive me). The staff is more than charming and eager to help, and if you have a laptop there is access to the internet from your room. I didn't, so I used the little room with two computers behind the front desk. The lobby is pretty lovely but I think one of the major selling points is the courtyard where you can grab a glass of wine and listen to a unique and unintrusive Italian duo performing a quality version of \"Sittin on the Dock of The Bay,\" lulling you into a magical and relaxed state of well-being. The drawbacks: Okay, so what's the deal with breakfast? In Rome, breakfast is cheap and no big deal. But to say if you dine with us, and would like to have choices (that would mean bacon and eggs for the people who don't want to eat like Romans) it's 25 euro! Ridiculous! The Art Hotel on the street behind, Via Margutta, includes breakfast. It just seems a little low-rent that they would charge you extra for this, and that amount! considering how much it costs to stay in the hotel. How much does it cost to cook an egg? Now, if you simply want a capp. and a coronetto or whatever, you can have it in the courtyard and not in the restaurant, but even there, you must wait until they open, 9 a.m. give or take a few minutes -- it's Italy after all -- and even for that simple, nothing breakfast, I believe you pay about 6 euro. In a glam hotel, this seems a little gouge'ish. Especially knowing you can go around the corner to practically any bar and get a great pastry and cappuccino for at the most two euro but you don't want to because you're tired and would like to eat at your hotel. And then, if you order room service, again, prices are high! You can order a 6 euro cappuccino but then there's a 4 euro charge per person for any room service order on top of that. If you are American, that's like a fifteen to twenty dollar cup of joe depending on the exchange rate that day. Even for a caffeine addict, this verges on the insane. Another drawback, and it may seem piccayune, but again, you're staying at a pretty hoighty toighty place, they should have better products in the bathroom. To have thin, liquidy lotion and ineffective shampoos, when hostels like The Beehive offer Lush products and the like, you can't help but wonder, why don't they upgrade? The whole world seems to get why skin and hair products make a difference when you're travelling but this hotel seems a little behind the times and it would be a small investment for them to improve on this area. Lastly, while I thought the concierges were lovely people, I did find their suggestions just a tad antiquated regarding spots to dine. In other words, they knew the fancy, expensive, usual spots to go to, but Rome is loaded with many choices, not to mention new and great finds, many of which are usually much better than the typical, famous, popular places. It would have been nice to have my hotel know about them -- not just my friends. I'd love it if they had seemed more up with the times and I think they could work on improving this with not a lot of effort. Oh, sorry, there is one other thing: not knowing the bus routes in Rome because their clientele, I suppose, only takes taxis -- their explanation, not mine -- seemed snobby and limiting. Most people know the best way to get around Rome is via bus. Yes, they've got the businessmen and the models and the Saudi ladies shopping at Valentino staying at the Russie but you know what? They also have the likes of me, a girl who wants to treat herself to a beautiful hotel but likes running all over the place and getting to know the culture and getting to know the real Rome. That means traveling with the people on Tram 3 and Bus 62, etc., etc. If you want to get around, it's good to know this mode of transportation, and it would be good for my hotel to be able to tell me the right bus to take from Piazza del Popolo to the Borghese Gallery. Maybe a taxi would have been more efficient, but not knowing at all and therefore suggesting a taxi, is not cool in my school, fool. In other words, keep a bus schedule at the concierge desk. You never know who might ask. But see? These are small imperfections. I'm telling you this is a lovely place with a good vibe. They got the look, they got the location, they got the sheets, they got the water pressure. You're good to go, signore. But a little upgrade and a little forward thinking would catapult them not only into this century but actually help them come across as what I believe they truly want to be: a more intelligent choice if not better a better one than say, The Hassler. So, that's my skinny on the place. I do hope you go there and I do hope you like Rome. If you go though, don't do it in August like I did. Stupid! Stupid and Hot! But whenever you go, check out Eustachio near the Pantheon for an amazing cappuccino and Mimi & Coco's for a good late afternoon glass of vino. p.s. I ended up walking through the park to the gallery and it was lovely so all ended up right with the world. And if you're only going to Rome once, do go to the Borghese Gallery. It's just as important as The Sistine Chapel. You'll never forget Apollo and Daphne. And you'll never forget Pauline Bonaparte.", "Date": "August 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "united states", "Title": "\u201cthe best hotel in Rome!\u201d", "Author": "mrs.leacock", "ReviewID": "UR3681827", "Content": "This hotel could not have been more amazing.
