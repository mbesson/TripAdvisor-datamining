{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Isolated, off the beaten path but AUTHENTIC BALI!!! OK, this review was from a stay quite some time ago but I wanted to write one anyway. I did some research and wanted to get a real feel for Bali and that meant staying away from Ubud. I was hoping to get a genuine feel for what Bali is like and I have to say I was happy I stayed here.It was a long drive in and when I got there, I was welcomed as if I were a long-lost friend. I was shown to my room which was a small, two story villa looking out on to the black sand beach. It was rustic enough to make me feel as if I was in the Bali I'd been dreaming of. Please note, this place isn't a super tricked-out Aman resort or anything like that. It's more laid-back and natural. I prefer Park Hyatt's but I wanted a cool jungle resort and I wasn't let-down.The house had a small plunge pool but is more like a large, deep bathtub. The walls are tall enough to romp around your private grounds naked and they even have an outdoor shower which was odd at first but you get used to it.The main floor has the bedroom and around the corner is a decent bathroom with a cool tropical view. There's a small sitting room with a desk and a cute window that opens to your own courtyard. Upstairs is an all marble floor and a great daybed and sofa to lunge around. I loved sitting up there and napping. The cool breeze was to die for.The black sand beach is terrible. It's finely-ground lava or something. The fact is, you'll live at the pool as the beach is too hot and too rough.The pool was great, but not many people where there and that's OK, too. The massage girls were great and I had a bunch during my stay.So, let me recap. If you're looking for true luxury, this place isn't for you. If you want a real authentic Balinese stay in a great village where people walks cows and pigs and even have cockfighting pens, you'll love this place. It was always a dream to go to Bali and I was so not let-down. It was great, juts like out of some jungle movie...The Four Seasons it's not. But it is genuine Bali.", "Date": "Sep 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR637982887", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "nosescott"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608494-d308532-r8839709-Lor_in_Villa_Resort_Saba_Bai-Saba_Bai_Bali.html", "HotelID": "308532", "Price": "$300"}}
