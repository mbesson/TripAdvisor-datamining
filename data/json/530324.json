I read some reviews so was expecting basic but cheap and cheerful and functional. I was so seriously unimpressed after the first night there that I asked to cancel my subsequent 4 night stay. I was told that I would be charged a nights accommodation to cancel the next booking which yet again gave me the serious hump so I stayed there on my return to Rome. The main things that initially unimpressed me were a) There were 3 busloads of poorly controlled noisy teenage kids staying there on my first night so there was not much sleep to be had!!! I guess they must have been on an archaeological field trip to Ostia Antica!!! b) The restaurant was more like a canteen than a restaurant \u2013 very unimpressed with the quality and presentation food!!! Complete rip off in fact. Very friendly staff however even if there was a bit of a language problem!! c) Hotel is pretty much in the middle of nowhere so if you wanted to go elsewhere to eat, you need to get a bus (walking anywhere is tricky are there are no sidewalks / pavements!!! d) The advertised swimming pool was an outdoor pool \u2013 and it was closed. The sauna / steam rooms incur a charge of 15 euros per person to use which is ridiculous so we never got to use any of the facilities!!! e) The Air conditioning control in the rooms was not working. It did not matter what temperature you set the thing to, the room stayed at medium oven heat temperature and was roasting! I ended up staying there for the subsequent 4 night stay and eventually changed my mind back from appalling to the place being cheap and cheerful as I had originally expected. All of the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Anyway, there are pros and cons for the hotel.... a) The initial drive from Fiumicino airport, leaving around 7pm on a Wednesday evening took roughly 1 hour to get to the hotel for the 8 Km journey. Traffic in the area is impossible at certain times of the day \u2013 and we had SatNav so we didn\u2019t get lost (this is not the hotels fault of course). b) Hotel seems to cater for busloads of people \u2013 which if they are kids is a real pain. c) Restaurant for evening meals is very poor for the price they charge!!!! d) Breakfast was OK but you should go early or you will end up with dried out rubbish!! When the kids were there, there was nothing much left. e) 1st room I had was quite cramped and quite basic but functional. 2nd one was larger \u2013 ask for a room with a balcony if you can which will give you some outside space as well. f) TV was tiny and ancient and difficult to see it was so small. Only a small number of channels and these were only Italian language!!! Quite poor for a place near an international airport g) Safes in room worked but are way too small for a laptop!!! h) Beds in both rooms squeaked like a stuck pig every time you move. i) Location is not great at all. For the first thing, there are no footpaths to walk along and in typical fashion, walking along the main road is not exactly the safest thing in the world! So you are stuck without a car! Yeah, local bus (every 15 minutes) for 3 stops to train station then train 1, 2 and 3 to the city centre of Rome. There is absolutely nothing in terms of services (shops, bars, restos, etc) within walking distance apart from the Ostia Antica ancient site. We were told best would be to take a bus for 4Kms to the beach where there are some restos on the front! Best to stay by the beach then!! j) Transfer from the airport by arrangement \u2013 the minibus will collect you from bus stop number 34 about 5 mins walk from the arrivals at terminal 3 \u2013 not very well signposted \u2013 as is the case for most things in Italy! They charge 15 euros per room for this service. Pre-booked transport only however! k) You get a lot of traffic noise from the main road nearby to the hotel. Goes on all day and night. There must be a hospital nearby as there was an almost constant scream of ambulances going past at all times of the day and night!! Restaurant Convivium was a joke. Very poor quality poorly thought out evening meal!!! They has a full menu available but were not keen to sell you anything other than the set daily menu for \u20ac18 \u2013 pasta, steak (which turned out to be pork, water and glass of vinegary wine). If you chose from the full menu, you would pay a fortune for very substandard . The food was canteen standard, the wine was dreadful, etc. The place is geared to churning out mass dinner set menus on the cheap for the bus groups. The prices for off the menu meals were laughable too e.g. Spaghetti Pomodoro (i.e. plate of spaghetti with a tin of chopped tomatoes poured in \u20ac11!!!). Drinks prices ridiculous as well!!! I asked to charge food to the room but was told this was not possible and had to pay cash at the table!!! Hotel bar is laughable. It is run by the restaurant \u2013 you ring a bell and wait 10 minutes for someone to come to serve you \u2013 after a 10 minute wait! Prices ridiculous for what it is!!! Internet: Only by cable in the room. They squeeze another \u20ac3 out of you for 1 hour of slow access (\u20ac5 for 3 hours and \u20ac10 for 12 hours). There is no wireless but they give you an Ethernet cable to connect in the room \u2013 not much use for those with internet phones!!! Access speed very slow. To log out from your 1 hour session and stop the time expiring, you have to enter the address http://1.1.1.1/info and then press logout otherwise your credit will expire! Another disorganised and awkward joke the hotel has to offer you! To get to central Rome is not so difficult and quite cheap. Buy a ticket for 1 euro from reception, walk outside to the bus stop, take the bus (no timetable available but runs every 15 minutes \u2013 allegedly) for 6 or 7 minutes to the stop just after the ruins entrance, walk along and over the footbridge where you find the Ostia Antica train station. Get on at the platform you come to first and every 15-20 mins there is a train to Pyramide (aka Porto S Paulo) which takes about 25 mins and you are then into the metro system. Watch out for the groups of pickpockets / muggers there though \u2013 if you look like a tourist you will be a target!!! Best idea is not to take a wallet with you \u2013 if you don\u2019t have one, it cannot be stolen!!! Given the resto at the hotel is a overpriced poor quality joke you might want to look for other options. Nothing much else in area unless you take the bus to Ostia Antica \u2013 the best of the limited choices in central Ostia Antica is a small resto called Piazza Ravenna in a nice side street \u2013 run by an older couple \u2013 good honest reasonably priced food. There is a local bar / pizzeria in the back streets about 10 mins walk from the hotel \u2013 shuts at 9h30pm \u2013 very much a cheap and cheerful place as well. Not open every day! There is a mid size supermarket called DOC about 10 mins walk away from the hotel \u2013 slightly difficult route behind barriers on main road but easier heading away from road an cutting through the local football club. Small bar and pharmacy in small parade of shops next to it. Pizza place as well which I never saw open. Summary: Cheap and cheerful place to stay. Staff very helpful and friendly. I initially thought no way but on reflection, I would probably stay again although there must be hotels in more convenient locations that this one!!!", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chennai (Madras), India", "Title": "\u201cBasic and utilitarian\u201d", "Author": "Wanderlust_XLers", "ReviewID": "UR123627645", "Content": "Ostia Antica is a good choice if one is not looking for luxury and finesse.

A comfy bed, nice terrace, TV, minibar and an extremely powerful shower. All spotlessly clean. Breakfast was a buffet affair with a variety of pastries, fruit, ham, cheese etc. There is a restaurant right next door which does great pizza and you can buy it as a takeaway to eat in your room if you wish (2 good size pizzas cost us \u20ac14). The communal bar and lounge areas were clean and comfy and the staff were very helpful. It takes 30-40 mins on public transport to get into Rome.

The hotel offers a shuttle bus to the airport for 15\u20ac per room, but this stops running at 11am so for afternoon flights a taxi is needed (approx 35\u20ac).

We had the use of a rental car during that time which enabled us to visit many sites, cities and towns. We also had the opportunity to stay at 8 different B&B's and or hotels. This was by far the worse experience we had during this trip and close to the worst accommodations we've ever had during our many years of travel. The nice clean lobby and the outside swimming pool area are the only positive things that this hotel has going for it. The first room that was given to us had a broken door jamb (did someone just break in recently???), and the door couldn't even close properly....the key card didn't work and would not turn on anything that it was suppose to (lights, tv etc). We then asked for another room but not before the front desk asked us if we knew how to use the electronic key card properly. Room number 2 was better but looked like it was from the 70's....unlike any style that I've seen before. This one at least had a deck(which made the room look brighter) and since it was only for a one night stay....well...we conceded that it was ok after flipping back the bed spread and seeing that the bed sheets looked white and clean. Pros: Close to the Ostia Antica ruins(about 1.5 km by car) Cons: Out dated rooms. Bathroom sink was clogged badly so we could only turn on the tap and have the water trickle out or the sink would start to fill up, Shower faucet fell out in my husband's hand, Shower nozzle was full of grunge and needed to be cleaned, top of the bathroom door had a layer of dust on it. Towels provided felt like cheap dish towels, List of swimming pool rules was a page long, Double bed was actually 2 twin beds pushed together...which is ok except that my side of the bed had steel coils digging into my back all night while my husband's side was more padded(obviously his side contained a newer mattress while mind didn't), Also bed was too short for North American standards, the result of pushing twin mattresses together.

The hotel shuttle runs on scheduled hrs (check them because it;s about a third of the cost of a taxi) and if your flight arrives so you can phone them, pick up is usually 15-30 minutes.....not too bad a wait for the savings. The shuttle will also take you over to the beaches, shopping. or the ruins at no charge. Some people complain that the shuttle is not a 24 hr a day operation, but you get what you get.

Some staff have bad attitudes and you just kind of have to work around them......my wife and I have stayed here several times.....its cheap and very well placed.

My driver (Adriano) was very friendly, although didn't know a word of English. Was able to communicate a little better using Spanish, which is my main language. When I got there I asked about a restaurant nearby and was told that the only one was the one located within the hotel premises. Check it out and realized that it was too expensive for a night meal, so I just had a box a cookies that I found in the small refrigerator in my room. The front desk attendant was OK; I found him a little arrogant. My room was a right size, but the bed was very unconfortable and had a stentch. The room looked very old with tired looking furniture and the bathrrom, although large, was also very old looking with cheap looking shower. At least the water was warm, so I took a shower and went to sleep. Hardly any, because of the uncomfortable bed. Next morning a got up early and headed towards the airport. My shuttle was ready for me. I was pleasantly surprised when the \"new\" front desk attendant told me I had time for breakfast and that it was free. There was a selection of cheeses and bread, cereals and fresh fruit. I liked the coffee, even though it came from a machine. The traffic was heavy, but thanks to the skillful shuttle driver (Adriano, again!) I got to the airport on time.

The room was small, cramped with a view over the car park and had a strange smell. There were three beds in it. We asked for another room overlooking the back--but that proved impossible. We took a different room on the front, top (3rd) floor. Though it was equally small and basic, at least it didn't have a 3rd bed taking up limited space. The furnishings look like sub-IKEA. We had a terrace but no chairs to sit on. The shower stall was the cheapest kind of sliding doors that don't work--flimsy and constantly sticking. There is a small pool but you have to pay 6 euros to use it--even though the room costs (for us) was about 135 euros a day--which seemed vastly over-priced. Despite what they advertise, there was no wireless internet connection up in our bedroom on the top floor. You have to pay for internet connection in any case. When I asked for a prosecco on the terrace, the young waiter brought it and then asked for 7 euros in cash. He wouldn't put it on our room tab. I finally realized he was hoping to pocket the cash, when he relented and said \"it's a gift\" and edged away uncomfortably. It was the usual breakfast buffet but NO fresh fruit at all--just tinned fruit salad. We had to ask for a bowl and ask for cutlery as the overworked staff couldn't keep basic items supplied.

The previous night we'd been put up at the Aris Garden Hotel in Ostia, which was miles better and cost the same and has a great swimming pool. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere. It's also too far to walk in the heat to the Ostia Antica ruins, which are on the same road but about a couple of km away along a main road with no pavement/sidewalk. The only good thing and the reason people stay there is the cheap shuttle bus to and from the airport. The first thing that happened was that my group had to check in without me because I was called to the theatre for an urgent problem. Since the group is well travelled and the person I left in charge of check in spoke Italian, I didn't think there would be any problems, also because the hotel had received a fax with our rooming list and knew that we were arriving. I was so wrong! Next thing I know I get a call from the personal cellphone of one of the artists telling me that the hotel would not let them check in because I wasn't there to \"guarantee\" for them. The receptionist had also been very rude to the person I left in charge, who by the way is the director of the artists as well as main dancer. What made it worse in my eyes was that, although the receptionist had my cell number and the group obviously could have given it to him if he couldn't be bothered to find it on the fax, he didn't even offer to call me, leaving my group to have to do it themselves. When I managed to get to the hotel a couple of hours later everything had been sorted out and people were in their rooms. I saw the WiFi sign on the hotel door and in the reception and asked whether they charged for access and the same receptionist said they did. I remarked that prices are usually skyhigh and would just connect my portable through my cell phone and he told me their prices were even higher than the ones I mentioned. In any case, the service turned out not to be working, not even on the lobby computer. That same afternoon, I called reception (there was a girl this time) to ask for a couple of room number belonging to my group and was promptly asked crossly whether I didn't have a rooming list with me. I replied that the guy in the morning hadn't provided me with one and I hadn't asked, after the various misunderstandings, and she herself admitted that when the guys are there in the morning they always make a mess of things. So much for company image! The rooms were okay but not worth the price we paid. A few people in my group said theirs were really dirty, both walls and furnishings. My bathroom had no light except for the one on the mirror. Fortunately we were at the theatre all day and only needed them for sleeping. Breakfast was ok as far as pastries and cakes were concerned but the coffee from the automatic vending-type machine was horrible. Luckily a waitress offered to make me some at the bar. At 10.00 o'clock, as soon as I'd had breakfast, I wrote out on a sheet of paper how I needed my invoices made out and left them with the same male receptionist that had been rude the previous morning, asking him to please have them ready by 12 when we were leaving. I was back at the desk at 12 and, obviously, he hadn't even started on them! There were a lot of people checking in and out and he was alone except for another girl who was just standing around and not being much help. He thus wrote out the first invoice and got my company's name wrong. I pointed this out and he got angry at me and showed me a sign that said that requests for invoices must be made the night before. I told him he had our reservation fax that clearly stated we would need an invoice and that in any case I'd handed him all the details again 2 hours previously. In a huff, he started on the invoice again, while the girl made a sarcastic comment in English to him (did she think I wouldn't understand?!?!?!). My group and I finally left and when we got to the next hotel one of our group realised she'd left her passportl!!! And I had checked the night before whether anyone had left their passport and was told that apparently they'd all been picked up. I really dreaded calling the hotel back. The afternoon receptionist was there and she wasn't at all helpful either, just said that they could not arrange for it to be sent but that we would have to send a courier to pick it up. Luckily our main office is in Rome and they were able to send a courier, end of the story.

It's unfortunate that the previous reviewer described such a terrible experience - ours couldn't have been more opposite! The staff were fantastic, so lovely, helpful and chatty - we were so sad to say goodbye to them! When we struggled with finding the hotel from the town centre on our arrival a phone call to the hotel had staff guiding us in the whole way. They were truly great and then took great care of us throughout our stay showing us how to get in to Rome and move around the resort. They warned us not to take taxis in the area as they are too expensive, far from ordering them for us, even providing us with a shuttle in the morning to the local station to take the train in to Rome. The hotel was situated about 25 minutes from Rome centre by public transport. A bus stops right outside the hotel and takes you to the local train station - Ostia Antica. This train takes you to the Metro station - Pyramid - in the center of Rome. The last train from Pyramid to Ostia Antica is at 10pm and the buses appear to run very late. Each night, after our day of sightseeing in Rome, it was a pleasure to get back on the train and get out of the city back to our hotel. The hotel does not offer dinner, but as we had a car with us we went to nearby Lido de Ostia - right on the beach - for supper on a couple of evenings and there is a lovely castle close to the hotel which has a very romantic restaurant in it's grounds. The staff were also happy to call out for pizza for us if we wanted to take it easy in our room after a day on our feet taking in the sights of Rome. The rooms were of an average size, very clean and modern with mini bar and TV which provided CNN for a news catch up at home. The bathrooms were lovely - very new with a great power shower and a good sized bath. The breakfast in the morning was traditional continental, although 1 day we treated ourselves to a traditional English breakfast at Babington\u2019s at the foot of the Spanish steps. I would have no problems in highly recommending this hotel if you want to see Rome but can't afford the really expensive hotels in the centre and don't want to risk paying less for a city based hotel and ending up in a horrible place. The price of this hotel is excellent and the accommodation and staff top class. If you don't have a car with you, I'd be hesitant in recommending it - simply because once you've finished your day in Rome and traveled back to the hotel, you might want to take a rest and hit the town again in the evening.
