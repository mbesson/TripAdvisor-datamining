{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Beware The Ripoff We recently stayed at the Hotel Florentina while visiting a trade show, based on the recommendations of some overseas business associates.The hotel is very small with minimal amenities. Small rooms, not much for breakfast, tiny televisions. Their web site claims that they are a 10 minute walk to the Messe. Perhaps to the nearest point however it is much further to most of the exhibit halls and a taxi is a must.The hotel's policy requires several weeks advance notice for cancellations during times of trade shows.Although we originally booked for 5 nights, at check-in we informed the front desk personnel that we would only stay for 4 nights. The clerk indicated that this would not be a problem.At check-out a different clerk told us that we were not allowed to check out early and that we would be charged for the additional night. The clerk claimed that they could have rented the rooms to others attending the show however this claim holds no water. Most of our business associates checked out of the hotel the same day as we did as that morning was the last day of a 5 day show and, other than those who had to stay and pack up, everyone was leaving.We requested a manager at check-out time but were told that none were available for several hours. As we had a flight to catch we could not stay. The hotel charged our credit cards without our signatures and we have been trying to get credit for this ever since.There are many other nice hotels in Frankfurt that are at least as close if not closer to the Messe and to good restaurants. There is nothing special about this hotel. Watch out for the ripoffs and look for another place to stay in Frankfurt.", "Date": "Aug 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR663758018", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "cheapcruiser"}, {"Content": "great little hotel Stayed for 2 nights, on a family break in Frankfurt,staff very helpful and nothing was to much trouble. room was light and airy, but the camp bed in the triple room was not suitable for an adult, also the time we stayed was very hot by our standards and air conditioning would have been a blessing.The hotel was very clean, well decorated and maintained.and not too far from the city centre and other amenities , we found that taxis are not expensive and there is a good public transport system less than 10 minutes walk away.The buffet breakfast is ample, and there are a number of good eating and drinking estabilishments close by.We would stay there again,", "Date": "Jul 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR660384601", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "neddyk"}, {"Content": "Nice little hotel We enjoyed our one night stay at the Florentina.

The room was new, nice and clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. I appreciated the complimentary internet for guests which worked great - fast. The complimentary breakfast was tasty - cereal, granola, yogurt, all kinds of fruit and vegetables, coldcuts and sliced cheeses, toast, boiled eggs, fresh juice, tea and coffee. They served the tea and coffee to you. I never went outside to their garden but it was in a nice quiet neighbourhood but still very close to the Hauptbahnhof train station and historical landmarks.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and will recommend it to my friends.", "Date": "Sep 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR794837093", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "CanEurotraveller"}, {"Content": "Small, stylish, friendly and convenient My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Florentina for 3 nights in June 2007. We were delighted by the friendly staff, good buffet breakfast, comfortable and pleasant rooms. The location was excellent, 7 minutes to the Alter Oper, 7 minutes to the main railway station. Our Room was clean and comfortable facing the main Westend Strasse which was very quiet at night and still had hardly any traffic during the day despite being 5 minutes from the main streets. During our stay there was a heat wave and temperatures were 27 degrees at night, but although there was no air-conditioning, the large windows opened fully (we were on the 3rd floor) and we managed to sleep fine.The only down side I can mention was that the shower seem to have a leak as part of the floor was wet after using it, but this was not of great consequence.Having stayed at the Palmenhof on a previous occasion we would definitely return to Hotel Florentina for its friendly service and very good rates.", "Date": "Jul 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR449528078", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "FairTraveller1"}, {"Content": "Great service, kindest staff!
