The room was small but comfortable and nicely decorated. it was convenient to have a restaurant next door but it was pricey for breakfast which was the only meal we ate there. 4.00 for a glass of orange juice is ridiculous and then I find it for free in the lobby afterwards with champagne!

The staff at both the hotel and cafe are friendly and helpful. The hotel offers an informal wine tasting in the evening and an excellent coffee bar in the morning. Trolley stop nearby for visiting downtown, etc. , close walking to all things at The Wharf, Embarcadero and Ghiradelli Square. There is a Trader Joes, Cost Plus World Market and Safeway all within a very short walk. We selected great picnic ingredients at Trader Joes (Cheese,Proscuitto, Bread,Cornichons, wine, etc.) for our Golden Gate Park visit. The store even provided picnic utensils. The only hotel glitch; we asked when making reservations if the hotel offered down pillows and they said yes. Since arriving, we have asked twice for down pillows and each time they arrive promptly, smiling with two pillows that are not down.

The room was very nicely decorated and comfortable, we found it very quiet and slept extremely well. The staff throughout hotel and restaurant were friendly and helpful. We liked the environmentally aware touches like the recycling bin in the room and the option to decline housekeeping for one or more days, in return getting a voucher for 5 dollars off a meal in the restaurant. Of course this saves the hotel money but also saves on energy, detergents etc and as we really don't mind making our own beds and hanging up our own towels, it seemed a good idea. Just one warning, again for European visitors, like many places we found in the USA, people seem to eat dinner very early (we had a drink in the restaurant bar at 6.30 and it was full of people eating dinner). We walked around the nearby area on our first evening and found the restaurants all closed early at around 9.00. So we ate in the hotel's Italian restaurant that night and found it was very good, but otherwise we had to get the cable car up the hill to the downtown area.

On arrival we were led to one of their meeting rooms where reception was temporarily located - the actual reception area was being renovated. There was a slight delay due to all three clerks being busy with other guests but we were offered a glass of wine, orange juice or iced water whilst we waited. At check-in we were offered a free upgrade to a mini-suite - I'm guessing because they'd overbooked the twin room on our reservation - but that was fine by us. The receptionist was friendly and efficient and was happy to explain all about the hotel and the area. The hotel is in the Fisherman's Wharf area, one of the major tourist destinations of San Francisco and only a few minutes walk from the waterfront, Pier 39, the Powell-Mason cable car line and the F-Line historic streetcars. A few minutes more and you'll be at the Powell-Hyde cable car line, Ghiradelli Square and the Maritime Museum and park. There are plenty of small neighbourhood shops nearby where you can get provisions as well as tourist gifts. There are many restaurants nearby ranging from the excellent to the not quite so and, again, doing some research on this site and others is worthwhile before you get here. Typical American breakfasts are available at many of them so a stroll out for breakfast is a must. Our room was on the top (4th floor) overlooking the street so we did get some street noise. In this part of the city that's almost inevitable. The only time it was a real problem was about 3am one morning when some girls, well into drink, went past the front of the hotel and made enough noise to awaken the whole neighbourhood. The room was spacious, clean and well furnished. There is a mini bar, which we didn't use, but the fridge is capable of storing your own things so we got a few beers and soft drinks from the 7eleven and kept them cool in there. There is also a coffee maker in the room with good quality ground coffee provided, which allows for an early morning kick start without leaving your room. The bed was comfortable and very large; the bathroom clean and well stocked with towels, shampoo and so on. The shower had excellent pressure of both hot and cold even though we were on the top floor. During our stay the reception area renovations were finished to a very high standard. There is now plenty of comfortable seating, direct access to the excellent Cafe Pescatore next door and a pc and printer for guest's use on which we checked in for our next flight and printed off our boarding passes. If you have your own laptop, tablet or smart-phone free WiFi internet is provided throughout the hotel including in each room. Each evening the manager hosts a wine reception \u2013 though not necessarily personally \u2013 where you can have a glass of average to excellent wine and meet other guests. If you're unsure of what to see or what to do this can be very valuable for picking up ideas and recommendations. Add to this the friendly and welcoming staff and this proved to be a very good choice of hotel which I can happily recommend to others.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel near Fisherman's Wharf\u201d", "Author": "NDW_Wimbledon", "ReviewID": "UR128249783", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 days while visiting San Francisco.

We did have to carry our luggage up a flight of stairs, but there were many there who volunteered to help. We were given a room on the first floor which seemed to be fine, except that if street noise bother's you the outside rooms have windows that are against the sidewalk and street thus making it slightly noisy during the night. We were in Room 123 and although we did get over the street noise, the room was right next to the lobby that was under renovation. There was only a plastic cover in what I assume must have once been the door. This cause us 2 problems the following morning. First, they were working on tearing up the old flooring and by about 8:30 in the morning they were running loud machinery in order to do this. It was so loud in our room that we could not hear each other speak or hear the television. It is a good thing that we were on East coast time and that we didn't want to come back to the room mid-day to relax. Secondly, the dust that was produced from the work easily came in through the plastic cover over the hole where the lobby door use to be. The man working at the front desk that morning was more than willing to let us switch rooms, but with all of our stuff already strewn about in the room I felt this was an inconvenience. He did offer us breakfast for the two mornings of our stay in the hotel restaurant which was a very nice thing to do. I felt that the room was a nice size, nicely furnished, and overall the staff was wonderful. However, the fact is that I feel the rooms near the construction should not have been given to anyone unless it was at a reduced rate and that the customers are given prior warning as to what they may encounter. We had no warning that it would be that loud when we were given the room and we were paying the same amount as others staying on a higher floor, away from both the street and construction noise. If the construction noise and issues had not occurred I would rank the hotel as a nice one, but I felt we were taken advantage of by being given this room that even the desk clerk cringed at the next morning when I told him which room I was complaining about.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cEconomical choice in San Fran...\u201d", "Author": "Sazelle", "ReviewID": "UR127195497", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for one night on March 31, and checked out Sunday, April 1.

It was inconvenient to heft the luggage up the fire stairs into the hall/ballroom area, but attendants were readily available to lend a hand. Despite the makeshift concierge and check-in desk, everything went smoothly, we were given a complimentary upgrade, and as Best Western members we received a certificate for 10% off our lunch or dinner at their Cafe Pescatore downstairs. The room was one of the best sizes we've encountered in San Francisco (this being our second trip, third hotel in the city) and it was very clean. We asked for a courtyard view room so it would be quieter, but I imagine once you get above the second floor, the view from the street-facing rooms would be very nice. It is a very convenient location to Fisherman's Wharf and restaurants, also. If you plan to stay there any time soon, be advised renovations will be going on.

I was there to visit Coit Tower, the Cable Car Museum, Chinatown, Pier 39, Ghiradelli, and Alcatraz. Upon arrival you drive up to the entrance where a valet person will park the car yourself. There's no self-parking as it's all valet. By the way, it's $44 a day. The reservation clerk greeted us with a smile and explained everything to me before checking in. She gave me the room I requested. I stayed on the top floor. Upon entering the room I noticed how nicely it was decorated. The room is contemporary looking. One side of the wall was mirrored, which made the room look bigger. What I didn't like about the hotel: 1) The Bed. It was pretty flimsy. Woke up with a neck ache. Good thing I bought Bengay with me. Plus, the location of the bed was so close to the entrance and right across from the bathroom. I think it would have been better if they moved the bed closer to the window. 2) Toilet. You had to hold on to the flush otherwise it doesn't flush. 3) Bathroom. I actually have no problem with the bathroom overall but the light switch controlled the light inside the bathroom and outside. So when you wake up in the middle of the night to use the toilet you turn the light on and it shines right to the room, waking up your partner. 4) Air Conditioner. It worked but in the middle of the night it was a bit muggy. It started working again in the wee morning hours. 5) Check Out. Took a long time. Had two other people ahead of me and only one clerk. I think I waited a good 7-10 minutes just to get my receipt and turn in my keys. 6) Parking. $44 a night was a bit steep I think. What I like? 1) Staff. They were all very friendly and cordial. 2) The Restaurant. It was conveniently located next to the hotel. They serve breakfast until 10 a.m. They also do room service. 3) Location. It was walking distance to Ghiradelli (a good 15 minute walk), Pier 39 and retail (Cost Plus and Ross). 4) Room Decor. It was contemporary and the room was clean. 5) Fireplace in the Lobby.

We have stayed in different locations there. Tuscan Inn Fisherman's Wharf is one of the nicest and most pleasant places we have ever stayed when traveling-anywhere. We also felt this to be one of the safer areas for night walking when staying in Sn Francisco. We would gladly stay at Tuscan Inn again. The Tuscan Inn manager is Ed Sincoff. We met Ed for the first time when we stayed there recently. Ed is a very nice and capable businessman. I found Ed to be running a really nice hotel and learned he was respected by those who work for him. Jose is the gentleman at the front desk who I seemed to reach most often when I phoned the Inn. Jose and the numerous fellow staff people, I discovered, are very friendly and knowledgable. I noticed among everyone from clerks to cleaning people, to parking valets, all seemed to be enjoying their jobs at the Tuscan Inn and sharing San Francisco with visitors. Tuscan Inn is a larger, yet quaint, hotel centrally located in the Fisherman Wharf area of San Francisco. From the standpoint of the physical rooms, we choose upgraded rooms allowing us a bedroom seperated from the living room. This allowed privacy for office work, and privacy to enjoy the second LCD TV. The king bed was great- soft enough to be comfy and firm enough to allow wonderful sleep. While we were there I slept through the 4.0 earthquake. (Great bed!) The bath was a larger comfortable size, and had marble. The shower was wonderful with a lot of hot water and excellent pressure. The bath had an exhause fan. The room was clean and inviting. There were plenty of windows and they opened for ventilation. The heat/AC units were very efficent. The hotel itself is undergoing lobby renovation which may be done as of this writing. The new marble outside the building entry is very beautiful, as will be the new details being finished in the building lobby. There are two elevators, both with ample room. We seemingly never had to wait more than seconds for the elevator to arrive. The hotel does have a free coffee/tea bar in the mornings, and a managers free wine tasting each evening. The hotel has a nicer restaurant located in its building just feet from the entry. Plus the Fisherman Wharf area has all types of food, in all price ranges within walking distance any direction. (You must try the sour dough bread for breakfest Just two blocks onto the wharf. It is delicious!) If you need any supplies while at the Inn, there is a major drug store one-minute away on a neighboring block, and a Trader Joe grocery two-minutes walk on another street. I did see airport vans stopping at the Tuscan Inn. Plus Cable cars, retro trolley cars, regular large city buses and taxis are available within brief minutes of the Inn. For this reason your car is not necessary in the wharf area and can be cumbersome in most of San Francisco. But if you do have your car Tuscan Inn has a parking garage on premesis. Be aware, parking in San Francisco is not cheap-anywhere! If you are adventuresome and want to play ticket roulete with the meter people, you can park free overnight-until 7AM on many meters in the wharf area. But do read all parking signs carefully. There are more than 40 ways to get a parking ticket in SF. If you enjoy walking, Alcatraz tour boats are walkable from the Inn. If you want to sight see, why not walk to the Powell-Market street trolley and ride it across the city, and change cable cars to go yet another direction. Then on the way back, get off the cable car in China Town. Enjoy yourself shopping and sight seeing and then walk back down the hill to Tuscan Inn. By then you will understand why my family believed Tuscan Inn is one of the best places to stay in San Francisco.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cLovely place, lovely people, easy access to Great public transportation.\u201d", "Author": "MinneapolisMaude", "ReviewID": "UR126022564", "Content": "Stayed for 5 nights on a business trip.

The reason I am writing this review is not the hotel location but the friendly and helpful attitude of the staff and the quality of the rooms and service. There is an excellent Italian restaurant and bar linked to the hotel reception area. However, the main attraction for me was that the hotel Manager holds a very friendly session every afternoon at 5 p.m. in the reception area with a selection of free local wines and pizza.

The nautical theme is a nice touch, and the place is quiet even if you face the street. I would certainly come again. The room had a clean, cozy feel, and we were given a king facing Mason St. after being stuck in a queen room facing an airshaft. The staff was fine, if not super friendly -- the place is really busy, so they seem somewhat distracted. This place is run by Kimpton, but it truly feels more like a Best Western (you don't get Kimpton points, only BW). It is standard, not luxurious. Some things were not so good. The bathroom products sucked, and so did the bathroom itself. The bed was just ok, and the pillows weak. The TV was not the best, though supposedly new. But I found the room relaxing. The street (North Point) in front is busy, but still fairly quiet, especially at night. Parking is easy to find on the street, so no need to valet. You just need to put money in the meter from early in the morning (7am), and watch the no-parking hours (middle of the night) because the days change depending on the location. Within a few blocks are a Walgreens, a Chase bank, a Safeway and a Trader Joe's. Pat's Cafe is a good local brunch place on Taylor, and Hollywood Cafe down the block was busy for brunch though we didn't try it. Overall, there are not so many good restaurants close by, but the area is really convenient to North Beach, and you can catch a bus or cab to Chinatown, Polk St., Russian Hill, Nob Hill, and the Marina. Telegraph Hill is walkable -- we saw Coit Tower from our room. Taxis were easy to find, since Fisherman's Wharf is so close.

I found the extra touches were missing which stopped me from thinking this place was great rather than just good. The room was small (I had a queen) and very noisy. This wasnt from outside noise, considering the location the noise level from the streets was very low - i did request a high, quiet room though. However, the fridge and air con sounded like jumbo jets!! It kept me awake every night, I couldnt use the air con as it was just too loud. The storage was minimal with 2 drawers and a small wardobe that the doors were falling off of.. The products available in the rooms are basic and cheap, bar of soap anyone? not as described on the website. The minbar was expensive but I think most places are, I bought wine and snacks at the Safeway which is located just across the street and kept that in my room - a bottle of wine here was 4 dollars!!!! In the minibar a small bottle was 16... The thing that started my slip into slight negativity was upon arrival I was asked for a card so he could charge 500 dollars to it as insurance. WHAT?? I was not made aware of this before, after paying for the holiday 500 dollars was not something I had readily available, apart from my spending money of course! I didnt even have a credit card with me to do this, just a debit and will have a hefty charge from my bank for the exchange, fab. I undertsand why they do this but every other hotel i have stayed in you pay for minibar etc when you leave... If this is how its done in America then fine but I didnt know and wasnt happy. This was not the start to what turned into be the most incredible trip I had hoped for.. Keith was very helpful though and pleasant. The concierge was very helpful with transport questions I had and the doormen always say hello. Jose checked me out at the end of my stay and he was abrupt and not as friendly as Keith. Housekeeping were brilliant, always happy and did a good job. Although one day I put my 'do not distrub' sign up.. They then phoned me to ask if i wanted my room serviced...

Because the Inn is not right on the waterfront, the crowds that swarm the waterfront are absent. There are 2 groceries (Safeway and Trader Joe's) within 1 block, plus a Walgreens. Great location! The staff was very helpful and always friendly. Every time I saw a staff member they greeted me happily. Perks: Coffee and tea service every morning in the lobby, Wine reception every evening (5-6pm) in the lobby. Free Wi-fi. They also have a conservation program where if you put a sign on your door by a certain time (declining room servicing the next day), then you can pick up a $5 voucher to the restaurant next door. Additionally, we got a promotion by booking online and got a $25 Shell gas card at check out. Mini-fridge in room (stocked with pay as you go items) but the staff invited us to remove those and use as we see fit, careful to instruct us to leave their items \"in plain view\" so we wouldn't accidentally be charged for things we didn't consume. The room: We had a standard room, King. The decor was nice, the room well cared for and clean. Small room, but plenty of space. Our room faced the inner courtyard (which we requested, as we had read complaints of noise in street facing rooms). The bed was obviously not new, but we slept well. Plenty of pillows. The hot water was fast and it was HOT! The only odd thing was the apparently ADA-compliant door between the shower/toilet and the sink/closet area.

We participated in the FLEET WEEK activities, my husband is a WWII veteran and had spent a considerable amount of time in SFO during the war, but this was my first visit and I was very excited, but quickly became disenchanted. Our room, the size of a broom closet was on the first floor and our view was a blank wall. It was almost like a garden apartment. We asked to be moved to a higher room but were told nothing else was availble. A $299/night view of a wall was very upsetting. Not at all what what I had expected In addition to the high room rate, we were also billed $44/night for parking. Which probably should have been $42, but the amount had been crossed out in been and $44 written in. I assumed they were penalizing FLEET WEEK guests. We couldn't get the thermostat in our room to function properly, it was very complicated, so the first night we were very cold and unable to get anything but cold air blowing. The first morning we woke up, we were in a hurry to get to the dock to cruise on the Jeremiah O'Brien. Didn't have much time but when I went to dry my hair, I could not locate a dryer. I called housekeeping and got voicemail, so I called the front desk and they told me they would get a hair dryer to me as quickly as possible. They did, it only took about 15 minutes, but I shouldn't have had to ask for one. Before we left we asked to have the heating system looked at in our room as we did not feel it was working properly and we had been very cold during the night. Upon our return, we had a message from engineering telling us to call them when we returned and they would show us how to operate the thermostat. After the engineer was in our room for over 20 minutes, he couldn't figure out why it wasn't working but if we had any more trouble, he would be there until 11 PM, it was already 10 PM. Needless to say, it was another cold night. Also, when we had checked in on Friday, we were informed that there was going to be a neighborhood festival on Sunday and that we would be stuck at the hotel for 12 hours unless we left first thing in the morning and came back later than night. They also advised we would not be able to get our car out of the garage during that time because all of the roads around the hotel would be blocked off or jammed up with traffic. We had enough. It felt more like punishment than pleasure having to stay at this Best Western. So, Sunday morning we packed up early, went down to the front desk and told them they were checking out. I was informed they were going to charge us $75 for leaving early. They were more worried about getting their $75 than why we were leaving. After explaing to the desk clerk why we were leaving, she did agree to waive the $75 fee. In addition to the $299 rate, the $44 parking fee and the misc. taxes and fees, our daily charge for this hotel was almost $380. We were able to relocate to the Holiday Inn Express at SFO Airport, and for $150/night we had a beautiful room overlooking the Bay, free parking and about half the misc. taxes than what we had paid downtown.

(Plus, the place we stayed last time, Fairmont Ghiradelli cost $600+/night now.) Tuscan Inn didn't let us down. Why we loved this place: 1. Location - Tuscan Inn is located in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf. It was so convenient to walk everywhere ... Fisherman's Wharf eateries, shopping, Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, cable cars, Ferry Building, downtown, etc. Getting to/from Napa/Sonoma was a breeze. 2. Rental Car - We needed a rental car for just 1 day (during the day) and didn't want to pay for overnight parking. Both Budget and Dollar are right next door. 3. Cost - it was the cheapest 3-star hotel in Fisherman's Wharf, and it even included a nightly wine reception. 4. Clean - While the rooms are a bit dated (i.e., peeling wall paper, tube TV, a little rust in the shower, worn towels, etc.), the room was spotless. Every day we could count on housekeeping cleaning our room and bringing clean, fresh towels. 5. Comfort - Aside from the occassional street noise, the room we received was very quiet and the bed was very comfortable. My husband and I had some of the best sleep/naps ever. 6. Service - From the valet to the reception to housekeeping, everyone met us with a smile and hello. Tips: 1. Arrive early to the wine reception or you will NOT get any hors d'ouerves. 2. Turn your A/C or heat to low to avoid the loud \"kapow\" when the unit kicks on. 3. Except where marked for cleaning, you can park on the streets at Fisherman's Wharf for FREE between 7 pm - 7 am. 4. Skip the long wait & $$ at Pescatore and go to IHOP a block away.

There may be better places to stay that provide better value, but sometimes location makes the higher price worth it. LONG VERSION The reviews citing an average rating for this hotel accurately portray my experience and I give it an average rating as well. Please note that this was my first trip to SFO and so I cannot offer any guidance as to whether this hotel is any better or worse than any other hotel in the same area. We paid $200/night not including taxes, etc. A few quirks throughout our stay but nothing that caused me concern or necessitated a call to the front desk or manager. Our room was on the outside wall facing Mason St. As other reviews have pointed out, probably the worst attribute about this hotel is the noise from outside which is pretty powerful and at times annoying. It is worse on weekends than during the week, but there are various distractions all the time such as busses, loud cars, people yelling, and across the street is a parking garage for a small mall that has a buzzer to warn pedestrians every time a car is coming out of it. We can't reasonably hold this against the hotel especially since the entire wharf area is a very busy place and traffic noise should be expected. However, all of this noise could likely be dampened if the hotel modernized its windows (see photos) which at least in our room were in serious need of replacement. If you can deal with \u201cwhite noise\u201d, we found that the air conditioner created enough of it to drown out the noise from outside. Unfortunately there was no \u201cfan only\u201d option on the AC unit, only cool and heat, which meant that when the room reached whatever temperature you set it at the unit shut off and there was the street noise again. A better solution would be to set the TV on a \u201cstatic\u201d station and at a volume that would take care of the street noise. If you can\u2019t survive with \u201cwhite noise\u201d or street noise, the best advice I\u2019ve seen from other reviews is to specifically request an INSIDE room. The room itself was adequate size with a King bed, bureau, TV (not flat screen or HD), desk, two chairs, closet, and adequate sized bathroom. I\u2019ve read other reviews stating the rooms are small; however they are not any smaller than most other hotels I have stayed at. We found there was plenty of room to move around and did not feel boxed in. They certainly are not suites, but they are not shoeboxes either. Regarding other reviews that claim the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything your neighbors do, we did not experience this. The entry doors to the rooms however are close to each other and are somewhat noisy. We could hear our neighbors entering and leaving their room (and I\u2019m sure they could hear us), but we never heard them once they were inside their room. Perhaps they were just quiet neighbors. The bathroom was in very good condition except for some mold we found on the ceiling (see photo), and there was plenty of hot water for showers. On one occasion the ballcock on the toilet did not close and I had to lift the tank cover and reseat it. Not a big deal and otherwise no problems with the bathroom or hot water. The AC/heating unit in our room looked new (see photo) and worked flawlessly. We found the hotel staff mostly friendly and helpful. I\u2019m not sure if they call them doormen or bellhop anymore, but a young man named Matt was great and stands out from the rest of the hotel employees. My only real complaint is that the concierge service is lacking with only one person available. Someone got to her before us and kept her busy for the better part of an hour. We only wanted to know what bus to take to the Golden Gate Bridge so asked someone at the front desk who sort of knew, but didn\u2019t really know, and ultimately told us to ask the young lady who was acting as concierge. Well she was still busy with the other couple who got to her before us, so we found our own way. Overall, we found the staff was pleasant, professional, and helpful. The room cleaning service was very good except for the last day. We went out touring around and came back around 1pm tired. My wife has a medical condition and needed to rest but the maid was just getting around to our room. We went down into the lobby and sat there for about 30 minutes then went upstairs to check our room again, and the maid was just finishing up. As we opened the door we found we had a rollaway bed in our room, which was interesting since we never requested one. We assumed that perhaps the next occupant of the room had requested it and the hotel had just brought it early. We asked the maid about it who seemed surprised that WE were surprised to see it there, and quickly removed it. We laid on the bed to take a nap and about 5 minutes later some other maid opened the door without knocking and asked if we had a bath-mat. I looked and said we did and she closed the door. About 10 minutes later some male opened our door without knocking and when he saw us inside said \u201cwhoops, sorry\u201d and closed the door. I still don\u2019t know if it was a hotel employee coming into the room for some reason or if the maid had not closed the door tightly and someone just went to the wrong room and was able to open the door. While my wife was very annoyed that two people had opened our room door and invaded our privacy, I felt no harm done\u2026we were dressed and just resting but it were certainly a very weird series of events. Lesson here\u2026LOCK your door from the inside if you REALLY want privacy. The hotel has a restaurant which we tried once for breakfast, but we found the service lacking and did not return. We were seated promptly but it took a while for the waiter to approach us. I ordered a coffee and got one\u2026and only one. Our breakfast was simple and directly off the menu but it took longer to serve than we thought it should. Having finished my first cup of coffee and almost done my meal, I was ready for another coffee (or ANYTHING to drink) but our waiter was either not to be found, or busy keeping his back to us so that I couldn\u2019t get his attention. Unable to delay any longer, I flagged down another waiter and asked if he would please get me a glass of water, which he did promptly. There is an IHOP a block down the road with impeccable service and so we ate breakfast there the rest of the week for half the price of the hotel restaurant. Wireless internet access was available free in the room and worked fine. There are two elevators and both worked fine, relatively quickly, and we experienced no crowding or lines for them. Longest wait for an available elevator was about 30 seconds, and most times we had the elevator to ourselves. We found the bed mattress and pillows very comfortable and slept very well. I would classify the mattress as firm, although it had a soft top layer on it. There are a few things I do take issue with regarding the hotel which caused me to rate it only average and I leave it to the reader to make up their own mind of their importance. First, I think a $200/night hotel in the 21st century should have High Def TV\u2019s in the room, not outdated CRT models with only 10 or so channels available. This is one of those things that is a tip off the hotel is not investing in its own infrastructure which can sometimes point to larger issues with the hotel. A $200/night hotel also should not have mold in the bathroom (see photo) or have door hinge pins coming out (see photo). These are minor maintenance issues, easily identified and fixed, the occurrence of which also suggests the hotel is not investing money in its infrastructure. Think of it, all it takes is for housecleaning or maintenance staff to carefully inspect each room between occupants. At most, a five minute room go-around with a checklist is all that is required. Mold especially is a no-no, and shame on Best Western for not identifying and fixing the mold in this room before making it available for occupancy. A $200/night hotel also should not have windows in the condition we found them (see photos). Not only did it not close tight, but the handle was not firmly attached and came off in my hand whenever trying to crank the window open or closed. A tightly sealed window would help cut down on the outside traffic noise and make for happier customers. The window condition is another suggestion that the hotel is not investing in its own infrastructure and simply trying to extract as much profit out of the existing building as possible. In summary, the hotel is adequate but value is debatable. Management could easily increase the sense of value by performing simple maintenance inspections and investing in the infrastructure. There are many hotels in the same area that might provide better value.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThe Tuscan Inn - A wonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Paresh04_11", "ReviewID": "UR117142485", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel from 7th August to 21st August 2011.

We were a little hesitant at first as some of the reviews on here are not full of praise. However, we are very glad that we followed our instincts because this is a fantastic little hotel and we could not fault it! We arrived at 1pm and although check-in wasn't until 3pm we were able to go to our room straight away. The guy on the desk was extremely helpful and made us feel very welcome, providing us with exact instructions on how to get to AT&T Park that night for the baseball game that we had tickets for. Our room was small but perfectly well equipped, spotlessly clean and was well decorated, with a great looking bathroom. There was a coffee maker and complimentary toiletries. There is a minibar but as is always the case in hotels, the prices are ridiculous, but we used it as a fridge to keep our own drinks in. We had not expected to get breakfast included as we had booked the hotel as room only, but were given a free continental voucher for each of our three mornings which was great. This is waiter service and had a choice of tea, coffee, juices, muffin, crossiant, or toast and a bowl of melon and strawberries. You could also choose to upgrade to other items at half price. Although we enjoyed this breakfast (as it was an unexpected freebie!) we're not sure we could have been happy to pay $12 for it as it wasn't very big. There is a Safeway and Walgreens within one block of the hotel, so we could easily have picked up something else for breakfast, and there are a couple of other cafes we saw within a block also. The hotel is VERY well located, just a five minute walk from Pier 39, but set back enough to be quiet and not feel too touristy. The hotel can booked transfers too and from SFO airport which we used on our return instead of getting a taxi, saving us $15, and was very efficient. We did a good job at getting out and about while we were in San Fran. We got a 48hr bus tour ticket which took us all over the city and across the Golden Gate Bridge. We went to watch the Giants at AT&T. We took a half day trip to Muir Woods and Sausalito (booked before we travelled with Viator). As in many US cities the food seems to be either burgers or high-end restaurants, with a number of Clam Chowder restaurants in San Fran. We would highly recommend Knuckles Bar at the Hyatt on North Point. This is supposed to be a sports bar but more like a good mid-range restaurant with reasonably priced, good quality food. We ate there two nights!

It's one of those places you have to see... After driving from Monterey, we were glad to pull up outside the Hotel, and looked forward to staying in a Best Western after having good experiences with this Hotel Chain so far on our Road Trip... We went in and were greeted by a friendly guy and allocated our rooms... All good so far... Clean rooms, comfy beds, the Hotel seemed nice and we were RIGHT BESIDE Fisherman's Wharf... Fisherman's Wharf is a nice place to walk around and take it all in... Driving around San Fran in the rental car was fun.. The steep streets and the iconic views really were a sight to behold... Very enjoyable... The first night there and we went down to the wine reception in the lobby... Quite nice, but not as great as some reviews make out... Some people chatting together, some people taking advantage of the free wine and drinking as much as possible... That night we hit the town... We went to an Irish bar that was close to little Italy, where a \"honey trap\" which was employed by the bar in my opinion, tried to get us to drink and eat as much as possible and also tried to land us with her bill too... It didn't work out too well for her or the pub, and she should have thought twice before trying to pull the wool over the eyes of a couple of Irish people who couldn't be bothered with her tripe talk... She was told where to go... I think she was used to getting her way with most travellers... So I hope she enjoyed the plates of uneaten food she ordered and stacks of drinks. We went to Shanghai Kelly's pub after that, and met an Irish guy that had been living there for 16 years... He told us that it was common enough, and our suspicions were likely correct... So... Back to the Hotel... We drank our fill, and I ended up in the Hotel room before my wife and my friend as they stayed outside for a cigarette... I was not asked to produce any ID... After 2 mins I had fallen asleep! After a very long time, I eventually woke up to my mobile phone ringing... I had been drinking after all, and it was a long day of travelling... My wife was downstairs with my friend and they would not allow them to go to up the room... Since it was my credit card paid the deposit, they wanted my ID. My wife and friend, both very friendly people, had asked for them to wake me, or let my friend into his room (adjoining to ours) where he could provide proof that they were guests... The room was in his name and he showed his ID, but once again, since my credit card paid the security deposit, they wanted my ID??? The Chinese girl that was working at the front desk wanted proof that they were guests before letting them even go into the elevator... Ok, I understand they don't want people coming off the streets posing as guests... ... But after failing to wake me via the room phone, they could have had security escort one of them up and into either my room or my friends room... Is it THAT INCONCEIVABLE that your husband may have fallen asleep in the room?... IS THERE NO OTHER WAY to check other than insist that I MUST answer the phone and come down with ID?... They gave my name and room number and my wife showed her Irish ID with her married name and it still wants enough... The other room was in my friends name, and he showed his ID, but because my credit card paid the deposit they refused to accept it... The room is in his name!... He's showing you his ID! When I finally showed up after 45 minutes of my wife and friend pleading with them, although we had drink in us, I could tell she was on a power trip... Its such a pity... Even AFTER I showed my ID, we were only then escorted to the room by security to show MORE EVIDENCE that we were guests... He was a nice man, and said he was just doing what he was told... There were plenty of other ways to deal with this, and there was no need to escort us up to prove again, after I showed my ID... My friend had ID and his room was in his name, and my wife had ID, and was the only other guests from Ireland with the same surname as me and she knew my name and room number etc etc etc... Common sense.. My wife was cold, tired and upset... It ruined a nice stay at a decent hotel... that particular member of staff was on a power trip and was a rude and horrible person... I complained the next day, and a friendly man at the front desk explained security etc... He had been made aware of the whole scenario, obviously warned to expect a complaint, or just told during chit chat... I'm not stupid and I understand to a certain extent the policies that must be enforced, but working in sales and customer service myself, that particular member of staff was rude, unhelpful, and made me regret paying my hard earned money to stay there, only for my wife to be treated like a junkie that walked in off the street... They even said the next day that my wife was intoxicated and that's why they were so adamant that she prove they were guests! How dare they... We are on holidays enjoying ourselves!... She was not abusive and everything she said made perfect sense... I am appalled, and I intend to make a formal complaint... for all the good it will do!... But maybe they keep a close eye on the jobsworth girl at the front desk... I liked the location, and the hotel was nice and clean with nice staff... But that girl ruined our stay... If you see any of my other reviews, you will find that we don't fuss or complain, and are easily pleased... I still gave this Hotel an average rating... But that girl is in the wrong job... She should work at the security checks in the airport... It would suit her down to the ground... Pathetic excuse. MAKE SURE to take a bus tour around the city... very nice... china town, little itally, the golden gate bridge, the iconic streets etc... Also... BOOK Alcatraz well in advance... It was brilliant.. The self guided tour was the highlight of my visit... Just do it. There seemed to be a lot of homeless people in the area, and in fact all over the city... That was unfortunate too. Enjoy San Fran...

Best Western reservations was good about trying to help me book a double room for an additional night but one wasn't available so we booked a suite for 1 night. When we arrived at the hotel, they did upgrade us to stay in the suite for the entire trip so we didn't have to change rooms. This was a really nice bonus. We were in a 2-room suite on the 3rd floor. The rooms weren't very big but it was nice having 2 separate rooms, 2 TVs, and a refrigerator. The pull-out couch was a very small double bed but my children are young so they were okay in that. Everything is fairly basic at this hotel. The bathroom itself is large but the shower & the sink area were quite small. My biggest problem here was that there are no curtains on the windows, at least in this suite with 2 windows. Only white plantation-type shutters that will not shut out the morning light. A nice bonus is the appetizers & wine offered in the lounge area around 5pm daily. We tried the attached restaurant for dinner one night & it was a decent Italian restaurant.

We had my 94 year old mother in the room next door and she was also very pleased, except with her stringent breakfast requirements. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The bed was exceptional. The staff were very friendly and attentive. As far as we were concerned there were only 2 negatives. Each room has a coffee maker, which is not good for making tea. They took about 50 minutes to get the water hot enough to make coffee or tea, and did not get it hot enough to add milk. I enquired about a kettle or jug, but they did not have one, so it meant making the tea, adding milk, and putting it back into the pot and wait another 15 minutes, so having a cup of anything took at least an hour. At least they did have refrigerators in the room. The second was the onsite Restaurant. We travel a lot, and this was our 20th World trip, each over a month, so are well used to hotels. It is an Italian Restaurant , and the food seemed fine, but not everyone wants to eat Italian all the time, and there was nothing else on the menu. The breakfast was served there, and it was a la cart, with a fairly limited range, but the pricing was good for what they had. This made getting breakfast a slow process, not getting what you actually wanted. On the last day, we found the Restaurant at the Marriot, about 150m down the road, this was a full buffet and was excellent, but a bit more expensive, so we were annoyed that we only noticed in time to have one dinner and the breakfast there the next morning. Both were excellent, the breakfast was a bit more expensive, but a lot more varied. As far as the hotel went, we were very pleased, except the minor problem of making tea. They were happy to bring a jug of hot water on request, but that was out of their coffee maker, so not exceptionally hot, and the San Francisco water is very chlorinated, where pure water was $3/gallon at the nearby 7-11.

Both times we booked a 2 x Queen bed room for 4 people - 2 adults and 2 children \u2013 the first time our room was as expected, very comfortable, very clean and nicely decorated (just like the photo\u2019s on their web site) but a little small once we had 4 large suitcases in the room. Our flight arrived in the morning but as they had a room available we were able to check in early. The second visit at the hotel on arrival we were told there were no 2 x Queen rooms left on the non smoking floor, so they put us in a one bed king room with a sofa bed. I was rather disappointed in this, we had booked the room some 5 months prior to our trip, if there was not going to be 2 x Queen beds available, why did they accept our booking? I wish they had been honest at the time of booking because if they did not have a room as we required available then we could have made alternative arrangements. Once we set up the sofa bed in our room we hardly had any room to move and very little room for our suitcases, so it was rather cramped. The sofa bed was VERY uncomfortable so I did not get a very good nights sleep for 2 days. As a result we were a little disappointed in this part of our stay the second time. Besides this, I would highly recommend this hotel. The rooms were nicely decorated and very clean. Both times we had a view of the street, a little bit noisy but quieter when we had the window closed. We had dinner one night in Caf\u00e9 Pescatore which is located in the hotel, the food and service was excellent. We also had breakfast there each morning which was also enjoyable. For the first visit we were given breakfast vouchers for a continental breakfast but not for the second visit which was a bit strange as our booking was exactly the same for both visits. There is a shopping centre across the road from which you could buy food and supplies. Our rooms had free Wifi and an in room safe. The lobby area is very inviting and there was also a computer available for use but it was out of order most of the time we were there. We used the Valet parking for one night for our hire car as it was convenient for us to do so but be aware of the cost if you do decide to park your car there (approx $40 per night). It was a short walk to Fishermans Wharf, Alcatraz wharf and other attractions in the area and we felt it was a good safe area for us to stay with our two children. They also stored our luggage as we had a late flight on the day of our departure. All staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful.

The staff was very knowledgable and hospitable. We ate dinner at the hotel's Cafe Pescatore and was very impressed - not the typical hotel restaurant. The king bed room was a little cozy with the end of the bed being 2 feet away from the dresser...but the bathroom was nice sized, the bed was comfortable and I'd stay in the room again in a heartbeat.

It can be noisy in rooms facing the courtyard because air conditioning/heating/fan units all back onto it and the noise carries. But they offered to move us, and anyway earplugs were good enough for a restful night. The main gripe is because this time I had a hire car. Headline price $44 for 24 hours. Ouch. Still, the website said \"For just an additional $10.00 more on top of your rate, you are receiving parking. What could be more perfect than that?\" Except that it wasn't $10 on top of my rate, it was $10 on top of the headline rack rate, which was already $50 more than the discounted one, even for last minute bookings. So it works out as $60 for parking, not $10. A bit sneaky? I phoned them to see if they could do anything. No good. Eventually I booked, and decided to suffer the charge at the hotel. When I arrived, they aggressively pushed the parking. They offered to discount it to $40. As I unloaded our luggage we must have been asked three or four times if we wanted them to park the car. When I asked about alternatives, they said there was another car park over the road, but they told me only the hotel allowed me to come and go. But they failed to tell me that 100 yards from the hotel there was FREE STREET PARKING (turn right, and it's opposite the large bus park). Albeit that I needed to check what days there would be street cleaning. But from Saturday evening to Monday afternoon I was able to leave the car without charge. Luckily, I stumbled across this because I went straight out on a drive after arriving at the hotel. But if I'd paid $80-$120 dollars for hotel parking and found the street parking was free, I'd be furious. The way the hotel pushed their parking rather than telling me all my options was disappointing at best. And less likely to trust them, which was a shame.

The hotel offered the option of skipping the daily cleaning, which of course is not unique, but new in my experience was the $5.00 voucher for use in the restaurant. We did this twice. Added to the 15% discount offered upon arrival, it was a nice little savings for an excellent meal. We recommend the special (available on Friday and Saturday) - cioppino, a delicious seafood stew which includes the local dungeness crab. A real treat! You might want to make a reservation as it was always bustling - a good sign. Oh yes - you can also bring your own wine (if it's not on their list), which we really liked because we had purchased wine on our travels through Paso Robles and liked being able to enjoy it with an excellent meal.

You can be at Pier 39 in under 10 minutes walk and take in all the shops or the famous sea lions. There are two lines of the cable car within 10 minutes walk as well. The bed was quite comfortable. The rooms are clean and very acceptable, though I really do HATE low flow showerheads, and the bathroom here was guilty of having one installed. I would have appreciated some curtains on the windows (not just shutters) because too much light got through when I was trying to recover from some jet lag. Do be aware that there are charges for using the in-room safe. There are complimentary wine tastings in the lobby early the evening, which are a great way to sample some local products and say hello to a few other guests. Staff are courteous and very friendly. The concierge service was especially helpful. The restaurant in the building serves a very nice breakfast and has a simple bar if you're after a late night drink, although prices are a tad on the expensive side. There is a supermarket and drug store over the road and can be reached in three or four minutes from the hotel's front door. McDonalds, Subway and Burger King are all nearby. During my stay, there was only one elevator operating. It was very frustrating! I would imagine when they have them both working again it wouldn't be so bad. My experience was that it was quite an ordeal just to get upstairs! By biggest tip for anyone staying in Fishermans Wharf is to get away and see more of the city beyond Fishermans Wharf! Take a cable car and see the city on the move. Go and explore Union Square or Haight-Ashbury.

The bathroom door could only be opened partway as it hit the bed.

Overall, thought this was a good place to stay, our 2nd trip to San Fran. Pros: Convenient location near Fisherman's Wharf, easy walk to everything. I think the reason for most of the glowing reviews is the extremely reasonable rate for a San Fran hotel. This is not the Ritz Charles, but it is a very nicely updated, clean, and comfortable hotel. Rooms were small but modern with a Tuscan theme, well-maintained. Two of our family had interior rooms including myself, and I personally slept like a rock. We stayed at Union Square last time and I liked this location better, easy walk to restaurants and shops. Wine reception was a bonus (though about what you'd expect for free wine) and lobby was not extremely large and became very crowded during that time, nowhere to sit. Ate at the restaurant a couple times for lunch and dinner and it too was good. Female concierge was very helpful and all employees were pleasant. Cons: Small rooms, wierd setup with the sink outside the bathroom a few feet from the bed. No way to turn the bathroom light on without turning the light over the sink too, which illuminated the room in the middle of the night, waking the other person up in the case of couples. My brother had an exterior room and said that there was a lot of noise both from the street and the maid service starting in early am. My mom was not happy that she caught the maids throwing the decorative bed pillows on the floor while cleaning the room, though I'd imagine that a lot of hotel employees probably do all kinds of things while cleaning that no one really wants to know about. Anyway, she later got sick that week and blamed it on the maids . . . Overall, would come back again and would recommend.

And they were right! I loved this hotel, even with the couple of quirks I had. First, I arrived after driving for almost 8 hours, I was tired. As soon as I walked in the lady at the front desk dropped what she was doing to check in me in. Impressive. While checking in I was told that I was getting a complimentary upgrade to a King size room. \"Fabulous\" I thought to myself. I had a lot of bags as I was staying for 3 days while on a road trip. The bellboy ran, got a cart and took everything up instantly, while the attendant parked my car. So far so good\" I'm thinking. Then I got into my \"kingsize\" room. I own a king size bed and this was not one. This was quirk one. But the bellboy had already offloaded my luggage, I was beat, and it was late in the evening so I did not call to make an issue of it. But the room I did get was cute, clean, quiet and comfortable. It even came with a lighted, magnifying makeup mirror. The hotel does have wireless internet that works like a charm and they have the ability to print things for you if needed. I was there on a package deal so my room included complimentary Continental Breakfast in the attached Pescatore (?) Cafe, a nice touch. In the mornings they have the local newspaper there and a coffee/tea station set up until 10 I think they said. The brochure said hot chocolate too but I didn't find that. The restaurant was charming and I got just as excellent service there as I did in the hotel. Nick greeted us for a couple of mornings and made us feel right at home. They have an \"upgrade\" menu for the continental ticket holders and for $5 you can choose something off this menu instead of the standard bread and fruit. The Apetito (a ham and cheese omelet) was wonderful served with homestyle potatoes, juice and coffee. In the evenings from 5 to 6 they have a complimentary wine reception that was a welcomed treat after a long day of walking. Nice to sit by the fireplace sipping wine while unwinding and a great way to \"meet your neighbors\" a darling couple from Cincinnati joined my husband and I for a nice fireside chat. The brochure said there were to be tidbits to go along with the wine but all I found was a crumbly tray and I got there at 5:10 and stayed until after 6 and nothing was refilled, so that was a bit disappointing, but the wine was fabulous. I had booked the tour to Alcatraz and took off walking in the morning to get to the dock for boarding, what a nice walk. Out the front door two blocks and turn right easy directions and I was there within 10 minutes. The parking at the hotel is valet only but I never used my car once. I walked every where around the area and the two times I needed to go any distance the attendant out front hailed a cab for me and i was whisked away within seconds. No waiting around. So my only other quirk was the parking rate. It was $25 a night with my package, higher if you didn't have the discount. So even at $25 I thought that was a bit pricey, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment. Every so often I would have a question about the area (directions/where to go) and no matter who I asked up front I got a courteous and immediate answer. Even when checking out I must have been asked by 5 different employees if I needed directions or a map. It was a wonderful knowing that even after checking out I was still being taken care of. They currently are working on one of the two elevators but even that didn't slow down getting around. I saw doggie treats by the front door and I can only speculate that they allow pets. I didn't see any while I was there and I definitely didn't smell any which was a plus. Overall, this hotel was great! Excellent location for the Fisherman's Wharf area. Excellent staff. Nice amenities. It would be absolutely perfect if the parking was included or reduced even more, but I digress. I'd stay here again and in fact will be staying here again on my return visit in a couple of months.

There are many moderately priced (I-Hop,Denny's) places for breakfast, as well as grocery and drug stores near by. The best deal for getting around San Francisco is a MUNI PASS @ $26.00 for 7days unlimited use on all public transportation including trolly & cable cars.

We were pleasantly surprised at how the lobby looked. It basically looked exactly as the picture on the Tuscan Inn webpage. Our room was small, but good enough for 2 people who travel light and don't spend lots of time in the room. It was nicely decorated and very clean. The bathroom was roomy compared to a lot of hotel rooms I've been in. The location could not be better. There are lots of attractions in walking distances of the hotel. There is a Safeway grocery store across the street, and a Trader Joe's behind the hotel. There is free wi-fi access, as well as a computer in the lobby for customer use. In the morning, there is coffee and tea served in the lobby. In the evening, there is wine served in the lobby, limit 2 per guest. Information of note on this: I believe the website used to say there was biscotti served with the coffee, but no longer says that, and there isn't any served. It's possible I read this in some reviews. Also, it appeared something had been served on a large plate at the wine reception we attended, but we got there 10 minutes after the reception started and the plate was empty and not replenished. Not a problem however. More notes: At check-in we were asked if we needed the key to the wet bar, which we declined. However, this cut us off from the use of the refrigerator. I don't know if there was a fee for the key to the wet bar, but if you're interested in using the refrigerator, be sure to ask up front. Also, the wet bar/refrigerator is built into the dresser in the room, so drawer space is severely limited. Also, be warned that the street in front of the hotel is quite dark at night. There is a lack of lighting on this street. While we didn't feel unsafe, it is worth mentioning. Not that this is the hotel's fault. Now, the bad news: Some of the staff at this hotel is problematic. The night I was at the wine reception, I overheard the guy serving the wine say something about one of the hotel guests that would probably have caused a fight if the guest had heard him say it, and deservedly so. The housekeeping staff knocks lightly then lets themselves in without much wait. We were dressed, but it could have caused embarrassment... twice. But my biggest staff problem: We arrived at the hotel early, and our room wasn't ready, which was no big deal. The woman at the desk went ahead and checked us in, and told us if we gave her our cell phone number she would call when the room was ready. Then she took our luggage to the side of the counter and told us they would store it until we returned. Four hours later, and no phone call, we returned to the hotel. A different woman was at the desk (the first woman was still around), and checked in all over again, and our room was ready. Lo and behold our luggage was where we left it, available to anyone who reached for it. I realize they were busy, but this did not leave me with a good feeling for the front desk. All complaints and comments aside, this was a good choice in hotel. In the event I return to San Francisco, I will check at the Tuscan Inn for availability first.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBest Western's really are the Best\u201d", "Author": "LY55", "ReviewID": "UR82443366", "Content": "We had an excellent stay at the Best Western Tuscan Inn in July this year.

Alternatively, why not hire a bike and cross the Golden Gate before heading down to Sausalito, take in the boutiques and cafes before taking the ferry back to San Francisco (only costs about 9 dollars one way).

We chose the hotel because we loved the location, and we enjoy earning our Best Western points when traveling. We chose a non-smoking, king bed room. As stated in other reviews, the room was small, but it was also well appointed. It had everything we needed. The bathroom had a small tub, but this was not a luxury hotel, so that was to be expected. The bed was comfortable, the tv worked, and the room was quiet. That was all we really needed. Usually Best Western hotels include breakfast with the room rate, but this one does not. Instead, the hotel offered a hosted wine tasting each afternoon from 5pm to 6pm. This was nice, as each person was allowed two full glasses of wine, but we only made it back to the hotel in time one afternoon. We were too busy exploring the city to get back in time for the wine tasting on our other two nights at the hotel. We would have preferred the free breakfast each morning instead. There were several restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, including one attatched to the hotel, but a free breakfast is always nice to have. We were able to walk to Fisherman's Wharf from our hotel. It was very convenient for that purpose, which is why we chose it. Other than the hotel not including breakfast, the only other issue is that Best Western would not give us points for this stay. When I questioned the Best Western customer service about this, I was told that I received a special AAA rate for the hotel, and as such, my stay did not qualify for the rewards points. This was not mentioned on the Best Western website where I booked my stay, by the hotel when I presented my rewards card for check-in, or on the reservation paperwork emailed to me by Best Western. I am disappointed by this bait and switch by Best Western. I might have chosen a more upscale hotel if I had known I would not receive points for this stay. I do not hold the hotel responsible for this, but I would have liked to have known ahead of time by either Best Western or at least by the hotel itself upon check in that I would not be receiving points for the stay. Five years ago we stayed at the Marriott nearby, and we might have chosen that hotel again for this stay had we known about the points.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yakima, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat location to wharf, far away from everything else.\u201d", "Author": "jblizard", "ReviewID": "UR73242400", "Content": "Within walking distance of fisherman's wharf.

I had been expecting the room to be quite small based on some of the reviews but we were pleasantly suprised to find a very reasonably sized room. The furnishings were a bit dated but otherwise clean and functional; the bed was very comfortable with quality linen and the pillows were good quality too. The bathroom was not huge but had a bath tub with overhead shower and a toilet. The sink was just outside the bathroom door and there was a wall mirror as well as an illuminating vanity/make-up mirror which I found very handy. There was a safe in the room which we found very convenient and made use of. There is a sign in the lobby which seems to indicate there may some kind of small charge for the safe but we were not billed for using it so not sure under what circumstances the charge would apply. There was a coffee maker in the room which we used on a couple of the mornings however there is fresh coffee available in the lobby free of charge in the morning as well as free newspaper. We also had free wi-fi in the room which was very handy as we had brought our own notebook PC and were able to stay in contact with friends and family via Facebook and e-mail etc. The hotel hosts a sort of \"happy hour\" between 5 and 6 pm where the guests can get free wine and pizza in the lobby which was great fun. The idea behind it is that guests can meet up and interact with each other and therefore be more sociable - great concept! We had the free wine on a couple of nights and chatted with other guests there. Even if you don't know anyone (as was the case with us being from the UK), it didn't take long to strike up conversation with other people and soon we were chatting and exchanging travel tips and tour suggestions. The chap who arranges sightseeing tours in the lobby (sorry did not get his name) was so bubbly and helpful even though we didn't actually buy any tours from him as had already pre-booked on line. There were only 2 things that were slightly annoying during our stay; one was the noise from our air conditioning/ventilation in the room which could not be turned off (I'm a very light sleeper and had to use ear plugs but my husband slept fine and was not overly bothered by the noise). The other thing that in my opinion would deduct some points from an otherwise very nice hotel is the water pressure in the shower was very weak. We are used to a power shower at home in the UK and in comparison this felt like a trickle to us! Other than these minor annoyances, we had a very good stay and would not hesitate recommending this hotel to friends and family. San Francisco is a beautiful city with lots to offer and this hotel makes a nice base where to rest after a long day of sightseeing. We did not park at the hotel as we picked up the rental on our last day after checking out, but we saw that the parking charges are quite steep (in line with other places in this city) so motorists need to take the parking fees into consideration when booking.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlantic city nj", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, Convenient location\u201d", "Author": "cranstonsnord", "ReviewID": "UR64176959", "Content": "Pleasant accommodations.

A small table to sit at, with a chair, a dresser with a tv on it, plus a desk and a chair and a small closet. The bathroom was a decent size. Our maid was Amy and she did a great job, we were on the 4th floor. All the concierges were good, but we were help mostly by Bridjette, she was friendly, happy and very helpful. They had complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby and everyday from 5 to 6 they had a complimentary wine reception, everyone could have a couple glasses of wine plus there was a pizza bread to nibble on.

We found that we didn't need to rent a car, which is good because parking is not free and some people complained about that. We took tours, you get pickup at your hotel for them. We can walk from hotel to the wharf. We got a San Francisco city pass, which included 7 days on the muni, streetcar, trolley or the F-line. the pass also included a few siteseeing attractions...this pass cost around $60.00 a person...very well worth it. I think the concierge has a small map with all the bus routes shown on it, take this map with you, so you can figure out what bus takes you where....once you get tired of walking...just find a bus. Another tip.... across the street from the Tuscan Inn there is a safeway store, etc. We picked up pop, junk food, water, muffins, fruit etc,...this is cheaper then using the items in the mini bar in the room. they also have small safes in the room, but it costs $1.70 a day to use.

Downsides are noise (I'd ask for a quiet room, if such a thing exists -- otherwise, noisy pedestrians and garbage trucks are likely to at least momentarily interupt your sleep), and smallish rooms. Also, if you're travelling with family or as a group, note that the 2 bedded rooms are only doubles; queens are MUCH more comfortable for 2 people (including kids!) to share. Also consider the location. Most tourists will find Fisherman's Wharf pretty enjoyable, but you are a bit removed from the \"real\" San Francisco. It's a shame that the cable cars are a pricey 5 bucks to downtown -- it would be a great way to get downtown (it still is, if you come off season and don't mind overpaying a bit extra for \"the experience\").

We took the boat tour down to the Golden Gate and around Alcatraz but if we were to ever go back we would save our money and instead when you book your bicycles ride to Sausalito and take the ferry back. It is less expensive and you will go right by Alcatraz. I don't know if you get any narration about the prison though if you take the ferry so if you are a history buff that may not be the way to go.

It was a great choice! The location can't be beat. The rooms were bright, clean and the windows open. What I noticed most is the room (king size) was very small. It was difficult to find a spot to put two big suitcases --- to live out of for several days. So we were constantly stepping over them and around them. There is an in-room safe which is great. The room also had a small refrigerator but it was kept behind lock and key. Why? We don't know and were too busy to really care, but found it odd. Another odd thing we noticed is a majority of the room doors opened OUT into the hallway, rather than into the rooms. Ours opened inward, but we definitely noticed most opened out. Our room was very quiet and the window opened up to overlook a cute courtyard. The lobby also had several great gathering areas for meeting your party or just sitting to enjoy your book outside the room. Next door is a Safeway and a Barnes & Noble bookstore. Both of which were great for stocking up either on water or grabbing coffee in the morning. The Wharf is just a short walk up the street, as is a laundry mat if needed and the stop for the Muni cars. The several gentlemen who worked the front desk in the evening were great and all were very helpful during our stay. They were also very patient in explaining directions on the map etc! The staff in the morning seemed to need another cup of coffee as they weren't excited to see us. Just a difference in personality I would assume. We did ask the Concierge, located in the lobby, a few questions one morning and realized that to be a mistake. Both of us having worked in tourism for over 14 years were very disappointed at the level of service provided by this gentleman. No suggestions of \"I would recommend, if you are in that part of SF then you should try to eat dinner here, here or here. Some options for sightseeing there would be X, Y, Z.\" It was very apparent to us that we were beneath his level of being a worthy tourist.

The location is good, and the overall decor is nice, but there was nothing that I can really rave about. This was our first trip to San Francisco (myself, my husband, and two teenage children) and we stayed at the Tuscan Inn for two nights -- a Saturday and Sunday. The first night we had a room on the outside perimeter of the building, facing Mason St., and the street noise was absolutely unbearable. It was not just cars and traffic (which I would understand) but screaming, yelling, honking, and all kinds of commotion -- especially at about 2am, which is when I'm assuming the local bars let out. The noise from inside the hotel was not much better. The walls were paper thin, and my son woke up in a panic at one point because he thought the voices he was hearing were INSIDE our room. We asked to be moved to a quieter room the next day, and the front desk was very accommodating (I got the feeling this happens all the time). The second room was smaller, with a very inconvenient bathroom layout, but at least it was quieter and we were able to sleep. We never tried the coffee/tea in the morning or the manager's reception in the afternoon (we were out sightseeing most of the time), though they are a nice touch. Our room rate included breakfast, which was a croissant and fruit at the on site restaurant. It was fine but, again, nothing I can rave about.

Everyday we would start our day with coffee and tea. Then we would walk out the front door and walk down to Pier 39 which is two blocks away. From there we could get to anywhere we wanted to go in San Francisco. All the buses and trolleys had stops at Pier 39. Also the boat to Sausalito left from Pier 39.

Across the street from the Tuscan Inn was the Northpoint Shopping Center which has a Walgreens, grocery store and a hair salon. We asked a man working at the grocery store for directions to another store and he walked out of the grocery store to show us where the other store was. What a nice person!

I guess some people go for image. I was looking forward to a nice stay based on what I had seen on BW website and the reviews here. I was disappointed. This is the type of hotel that has a fancy lobby and nice pictures and decorations throughout the building, but as for substance--lacking. My room was supposedly upgraded to a larger room, but if this was the case I'd hate to see the smaller rooms. The room had fancy colorful furniture, but was small and lacked certain things a higher-priced place like this ($170) should have. There was no hair dryer, no microwave, and I am still not sure if I was using shampoo or some type of lotion (the tube didn't really say clearly). Their windows were stylish, but who cares when the view is lousy and they are small and only open slightly? They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park (it costs extra to park) and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it. I did this and it took them a long time to get my car. There is no real parking space, so I had to pull up in front of the hotel in a small space. If there were others wanting in at the same time, someone would have had to park on the street or drive around the block.

The location was PERFECT just a block and a half from fisherman's wharf and in walking distance to the pier with the sea lions, ghirardelli square, (forget the #) and the start of the cable car tour on the hill, and also was a block and a half from the starbucks where the streetcar stops to take you to other parts of the city. But what we really liked about it was the little extras. The lobby was very pretty and I remember there was a pretty mural either out front or in the lobby that made it stand out as more unique and not cookie cutter motel-ish. The free wine tasting every night was a wonderful extra and welcomed relaxment in between a long day of sightseeing and evenings out. That and also the free coffee and tea (and a variety of tea which I liked) every morning were little extras that we felt made you feel like a welcomed guest and that they are going out of their way to make the hotel special. We also ate at the restaurant but as it was over a year ago i don't really remember I know it was good though, just don't remember how good or how expensive, wasn't particularly memorable.

We were in town for the Bay to Breakers. What a wonderful spot. We had a car, so we started with the valet. He was very friendly, and explained just what we had to do to retrieve our car \u2013 when they were available (24/7), how long to expect to wait to retrieve the car ( about 7 minutes), etc. He also helped us with our bags to the front desk. The front desk staff were very friendly and efficient. Our room rate was all in order \u2013 we\u2019d booked a TravelZoo special, and the front desk had the right rate, and the right parking discount. We asked for a high room, and off the street. We got exactly that. We went down for the free wine reception, and had a great time. We met a number of other travellers, and the wine pour-ers and hostess were very friendly and efficient. The wine reception each night became an event we looked forward to (for more than just the wine!). The wine is Charles Shaw (two buck Chuck) so you wine afficianados should not get too excited, but it was fine for our standards. The room itself was a little small - pretty normal for the wharf area. But it was immaculate and nicely decorated. The bed was big and very comfortable. One interesting thing \u2013 the room doors open out to the hallway, rather than in to the room. This makes the room seem slightly bigger, as the door does not swing into the room, taking up space. I\u2019m surprised more hotels don\u2019t do this. The bathroom door does the same thing, making the bathroom seem slightly larger. The room was very quiet. We'd seen some reviews saying the rooms that face the street are noisy, so by asking for a room off the street, we got a very quiet room. The air conditioning worked perfectly. Yes \u2013 we needed air conditioning in San Francisco. It was unseasonably warm when we were there. We ate in the hotel restaurant \u2013 an Italian theme \u2013 and it was very good. Good food and service. The concierge was very helpful and extremely friendly. We did find the concierge was very busy in the mornings, trying to arrange tours for people. We didn\u2019t use the workout facility. The hotel has one computer (with printer) available with free internet. And free wi-fi throughout the hotel which worked flawlessly. This is a Best Western, but it is operated by Kimpton - so it is pet friendly. They advertised that with a picture of the manager's dog on the check in desk. All in all it was a wonderful stay and I\u2019d highly recommend it \u2013 we did get an amazing rate, so that made it seem even better. The location is excellent if you want to be near the wharf. It was a two block walk to Pier 39. And the street it was on (North Point), was busy enough to always feel safe walking, but not so busy that you felt crowded. The only downside, is not a fault of the hotel \u2013 rather, my personal preference. We usually stay in the Marina District, but we wanted a hotel near the wharf so we could walk to the Bay to Breakers (we didn\u2019t want to stay near Union Square, even though it would have been more convenient).

We chose the Best Western Tuscan Inn as our base whilst in San Francisco on the first three nights of our tour. We arrived at SFR approximately 1 hour late due to flight delays at London Heathrow and in the pouring rain and, of course, suffering from jet lag. Despite all this, we found the Tuscan Inn easily in a city strange to us. After reading other reviews on Trip Advisor we made sure that we had a \"Garden View\" room as we knew that the jet lag would see us awake at about 2:00am! I don't know about the street view rooms but we had no problems with noise whatsoever. The rooms were pleasant, clean and did not disappoint. The hotel is certainly well placed for access to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 etc. My wife suffers from arthritis and cannot walk far but we had no problems in walking to the departure point for Alcatraz tours, Mr. Toad's city tour, Cable Cars, etc. Staff were helpful and generally friendly. The daily wine reception was a great idea as it got guests together and talking about their experiences of the day. Was a little upset by waiter serving wine at the second of these we went to. On arriving we initially spoke to some other guests and I then went to request two glasses of wine on behalf of myself and my wife - reaction was, in broken English, - \"Only two glasses each!\" I explained we had just arrived and this was our first drink. \"NO, only two glasses\" \"We haven't had one yet!\" \"I must see your room key\" With annoyance I retrieved and displayed the key and finally got a glass of wine. I know they don't want clients getting drunk at their expense but at the end of the day it wasn't even quality wine just a very cheap plonk. Only other downer was $38 per night for valet parking.

Our king size bed was comfy, but I thought it should have had king sized pillows as well instead of three standard size ones. The lighting was good which my husband really appreciated because he did a lot of reading during our down time. The bathroom was an adequate size. The sink area is a bit small but there is a small glass shelf above the toilet and one shelf under the sink where hotel towels and a blow dryer are stored but there is enough room for a couple of toiletry bags. The bath has one of those large rain shower heads which we loved and it was so quiet too! The shower curtain rod curves outward to allow more \u201celbow\u201d room which we really liked. As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\u2019s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay. There is a nice clock/radio which also has a CD player. We couldn\u2019t figure out how to change the time on it so we just called front desk to request a wake up call each morning. The hotel is charming and comfortable, and the staff is great. The location is hard to beat with a Safeway, Trader Joe\u2019s, Borders, World Market and the cable car all within a block of this hotel. Pier 39 is just a short 5-10 minutes away. We were sort of sad to leave as we transferred to another hotel at Union Square for the second part of our stay.

There were three of us and I had booked a two double bed room and had a confirmation to prove it. I had chosen this hotel for that particular reason as I was having difficulty getting a two bed room at nearby wharf hotels. I was given a king room with a cot on check-in. After a few trips by the clerk back to the manager who remained out of site I was told I had not booked a double bed room but a double occupancy room which wasn't true. They said they noticed we had three people so had automatically provided a cot to our room, I was told they were full and there were no other rooms available. When we got to our room the cot was already there but due to the small room I had to re-arrange furniture to get it to fit, in doing so having to re-assemble their cheap particle board table. The room faced a side street, the street directly below became very active at 5 am with motorcycles in particular in addition to trucks noisily heading up the street. I'm a sound sleeper normally and nothing wakes me so this was just a sign of how noisy it was. I managed to get switched to a two double bed room for our next couple of nights and experienced what all the good reviewers must have. The room was significantly larger, still small but liveable, and although still on the 3rd floor it faced the wharf and what I would have thought was the busier street but the traffic was much quieter and I didn't hear much at all the next two mornings. The valet's were a little slow and I hated the vulture baggage guy. I don't have a problem being helped up to the room although I;m fine doing it myself. This guy immediately put all my bags on the cart while I was pre-occupied with the valet but then while I was trying to correct the problems with the room at check-in he was impatiently trying to get us to hurry up in spite of me telling him just to leave the bags. The location is great, I opted for a Fisherman's wharf stay for vacation having stayed near Union square on business in the past and I'm glad I did as it was easy walking distance to Chinatown and the touristy area of the wharf.

Check in was quick and my boyfriend and I were given a queen room on the fourth floor facing the street. My boyfriend's first response was \"wow, this is a tiny room\", but it was what I was expecting considering the location and that this is only a 3-star property. It was in fact a small room (a King size bed would not have fit) with a tiny closet and 2 drawers for storing clothes. Good thing we only packed carry on luggage and didn't have much to put away! The room was always clean and the maid staff was friendly, saying \"hello\" and \"have a nice day\" as you passed. We were frequently in and out of the room to change clothes or take a nap and never walked in on a maid (or were walked in on ourselves). One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned! One bad part about the room was that some street noise traveled up, although we were only really disturbed one night when there was a car parked on the street playing loud music with people around it laughing and talking loudly. Pros at the hotel: Staff - Very friendly and helpful. We had to send and receive several faxes during our stay and they were always happy to help. We used the concierge to book theater tickets, which worked flawlessly, and we also called the front desk around midnight our last evening and asked them to arrange an airport shuttle the next day, which they did the following morning when the shuttle company opened. Amenities - While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day (which many people attended). The restaurant attached to the hotel is nice, with a great little bar area and friendly bartenders. The restaurant breakfast menu is pretty minimal, but it does the trick. Location - This is the best part of the hotel. Two blocks from Pier 41, one block to the F line street car two blocks to the cable car.

On arriving at the hotel we were told that one suite was ready and the other would be an hour or so. When we got to the suite that was ready we found that it was not a one king bed suite but a two bed suite. I rang reception and spoke to a person called Jamelia to ask to be allocated the right type of suite as per our reservation confirmation. Her attitude was appalling and this is where the lies started. She initially said that the reservation had come through incorrect from Best Western or that I had not booked correctly on the website. I offered to take the Best Western reservation confirmation to reception as evidence and she said that this was of absolutely no interest to her and that it made no difference. She then said that there were no king bed suites at the hotel at all and that all suites had two beds. I asked her why their website stated that this type of room was available if they did not exist as she had just stated. She said the website must be incorrect. Next we were offered a standard king bedroom, and I pointed out that this was a cheaper room than the suite we had booked. She said 'well you got a good rate by booking on line'. Like that matters. I had paid $1900 up front for the suites 2 months\u2019 prior when making the booking. I then asked if the next suite would also be two beds instead of the king bed as she had just stated that this type of suite did not exist. Unbelievably she said that this next suite would have a King bed contradicting the lie she had just told us. At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour. The funny thing was that when we got to the room, there were welcome cookies and a welcome note for a Mr and Mrs Bonfiglio. So, sorry to this couple as they probably got a load of lies and bull when they arrived to find that they did not get the room they had booked. The hotel is also very noisy but I guess this is inevitable considering the location. The free drinks are great if you and like the feeling of getting something for nothing. Please also beware of the restaurant at the hotel. They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6. We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge. On the plus side some of the staff were nice and helpful especially the concierge who was most gracious. The suites are a decent size, clean and the d\u00e9cor is not of a bad standard. If you want to be near Fishermans Wharf the location is great. I did contact Best Western on returning home to see what response I would get after the investigation. Apparently the hotel had told Best Western that we were contacted directly by the management during our stay and that the matter was resolved (we were not contacted). While they apologised for the inconvenience they said that there was nothing more to do as we were eventually given the room we had booked.

With this hotel we received a free 1 hour tour/cruise around Alcatraz and down to the Golden Gate Bridge. You also get 2 free transportation passes each day of your stay that we used for the trolley systems. Their travel system is called the MUNI and includes the trolleys or the city buses. The drivers are a great help for any questions you have. We used the trolley and buses for the Golden Gate Bridge. WE Loved the Trolleys!

Yes, there IS construction going on, and it started every morning at 9:00am for us; if you will be gone by this time, and away until after supper, then there shouldn't be a problem, provided you have a room facing the courtyard (away from the busy street in front). Issues we ran into: -Didn't have the room as requested in my reservation, so they had to put me in a queen bed on day 1, then move to a king days 2-4. -The first night, we also had to be moved at 2:00am because our ventilation started clicking non-stop--repair person came, suggested we just move rooms. Would have been ok, if not for: -Construction at 9:00am each morning. Heard it loud and clear on floors 2 and 4. -Also, placed us in a king suite that was joined with another room via a private doorway; the noise from the other family with kids was evident as of 7am as well. But, we couldn't move again because there were no other rooms available with king. -Showed up for breakfast in their restaurant at 10:31am--I'm not exaggerating--would not serve us, since they said they stop taking orders at 10:30am--the place had one other couple in it--could they afford to lose business over one minute? I guess so. Perhaps I had higher expectations, or perhaps not...Staff at front desk was fine, obviously the restaurant could use some work...Rooms were clean, always done promptly. Location was nice for getting all around the city; we mostly walked from place to place, even to and from downtown along the Embarcadero. The reno's look to be in full swing; I would doubt anything will be winding down in the near future; I'd certainly call their front desk and make sure that there are NO renovations being done prior to coming.

We were very pleased with the hotel's location right in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf/North Beach...close to great restaurants (Pat's Cafe & The Buena Vista), transportation (buses, trolleys, & ferries), and the waterfront but what we weren't informed of was the on-going, messy & noisy renovations (Frommer's listed the property as having completed room renovations in 2005). There was no mention from hotel staff...all that was present was a dumpster out front and a small sign on our floor (2nd) saying sorry for any inconvenience.

After reading countless reviews of this property, I was confident we could have an enjoyable stay here and avoid any potential pitfalls - and we were not disappointed. I discovered a special rate at Travelzoo, which probably swayed me to try this hotel, and made my own reservation with Best Western. There was no problem in them honoring the special rate. If you are bothered by street noise then be sure to ask for a room with a courtyard view. The courtyard is tiny - but we could not detect any street noise in our room on the second floor looking over the courtyard. Currently (January 2008) they are remodeling some rooms on the upper floors, and there is considerable construction noise in some areas that started after 9:30 AM and stopped by 5:00 PM. It would be a good idea to ask for a room away from the construction for the least noise, if you are going to be in your room during the day or sleeping in late. Gregory, at check in, was quick and polite and helpful with our request for a courtyard room. The room is a bit on the small-side, but I think that is the standard in San Francisco with only a few exceptions. Our room was very clean and fresh-smelling. One window did open, which kept the room from getting stale. Drawer space was minimal, with only two small but deep drawers, and the closet was a little small. Clothes for two people for five days maxed out the tiny closet. There is a refrigerator in the room with is also the mini-bar, so there isn't a lot of room in there for take-out food, but is ample for medications, etc. If you plan to use the refrigerator, make sure to take a key to the mini bar, or it will be able to get into it. The room includes a ironing board and iron, although using it would make the room a bit cramped. There is a wall-mounted hair dryer in the bathroom. The restaurant in the hotel - Cafe Pescatore - does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced. Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course - pizza. However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1-4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service. We were very happy with the location of this hotel. Within two blocks (and not even uphill!) you could catch the Mason-Powell cable car, also many of the Muni Buses go by the hotel and the \"F Line\" historic streetcar is only one block away. Just a 3 block walk north and you are on the waterfront of Fisherman's Wharf. There are two grocery stores (Safeway and Trader Joe's) within 2 blocks of the hotel. One of the things we enjoyed most, was walking away from the touristy area of Fisherman's Wharf and onto the side streets to look for restaurants. There are many smaller places with very good food at very reasonable prices, all within walking distance. Each night when we returned to our room, it had been cleaned up very nicely and restocked. We made sure to tip the housekeeping staff each morning, perhaps that insured that they did an outstanding job every day. We felt we got a reasonable value for the $99 rate we received and assuming we could get a similar or better rate, we would stay here again.", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kalamazoo, MI", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, but room 127 noisy\u201d", "Author": "vmoon8965", "ReviewID": "UR12327355", "Content": "We stayed at the Best Western Tuscan Inn between Chirstmas and New Years.

My husband called the day before to ask if we could check in early as we were due to arrive 3 hours before check-in time, which is 3 pm. They said it would not be a problem. We arrived at the San Francisco airport and took at taxi to the hotel. The cost for the taxi was approx. 40.00 plus tip. We decided to take a taxi as we wanted to get checked in fast because we were due to take the Alcatraz tour at 1:55 pm. When we arrived at the hotel there was no problem getting a room. She told us the only room ready was facing the court yard. This was fine as we knew we'd only be sleeping in our room so the view didn't matter. We were given room 421. The room was small but it was fine for sleeping. It was clean, although I did notice several spiders in the room. Just small ones though. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. There was internet access available through your TV. There was a keyboard provided. We did not use this service but thought it was nice that it was available if needed. The room also came equipped with an alarm clock radio. There were a few things that bothered me, after leaving a tip the first day the maid never bothered to refill our shampoos, conditioner, or soap, and removed the part bottles that we had not used. I had thankfully kept some from the hotel we stayed at in Toronto before departing. The other thing that bothered me was after returning to our room in the late evening our window was left wide open. It was freezing cold in the room and I don't think it warmed up even with the heat on until the next day. Now I know we were on the 4th floor, but still I don't think it was proper for the maid to leave our window open all day/evening. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours. We chose to eat there both mornings. For dinner we ate at Pier 39 both times. Swiss Louis the first night. It was fantastic! The second night we ate at the Wipe Out grill, it was okay. The hotel is very central to everything and I would stay there again for its location. We felt very safe walking around at night and we did see some vagrants but not one of them bothered us. I was surprised at the amount of homeless people and beggars but none of them bothered or even asked for money. Most of them just held out cups or had signs or were street performers working for tips. We come from a small farming community of 6000 people so if it didn't bother us I don't think it should be a concern for others. There were excellent street performers which we found very entertaining. We especially enjoyed the guy who does spray paint art. We purchased one of his paintings for 10.00. What a bargain!! One word of advise is to pre book your tickets for the Alcatraz tour. Luckily I had read here on tripadvisor that the tickets sell out fast and usually days or weeks in advance and I had bought mine a month ahead. I booked my tickets online through their website. There were several people looking for tickets on the Saturday and the next available tour was Wed. morning at 9 am. Lots of disappointed people. You want to take the Hornblower Alcatraz tour at Pier 33, you get to visit Alcatraz and do a audio tour. It was fantastic. We also did the Aquarium under the bay. It was wonderful as well.

Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about. Maid service was prompt and outstanding. But, it was close to the Wharf and soooo convenient. So, maybe the price was warranted. BEWARE though....parking is $45 + tax. I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all. Then the clerk told me the price. Woah!!! When we arrive at the valet stop, the valet told me that if we have AAA, the price would be $25. Cool. When we went to check out, the front desk clerk said that we could not have the discount because we did not make a reservation to park. WHAT???

The only problem we had with the room was the noise level coming from the street. We were on the 2nd floor and facing the street and the noise was AWFUL. We were woken up once or twice by really rowdy passersby. The hotel can't control this, but there should be better windows or something to insulate the sound. We've stayed in large cities before and have never had this kind of problem. I'd stay at the Tuscan Inn again, but I'd request a room facing the courtyard.

We also used the convenient shopping across the street to buy some bagels at Safeway which we stored in the bar refrigerator.

You have to brave the F-Market streetcar (which was often jam-packed) to get to Downtown San Francisco for more 'up-market' dining.

In our opinion, a bit of faux Italian d\u00e9cor, some nice throw pillows on the bed and smaller than average rooms doesn\u2019t really stretch to \u201cEuropean-style Boutique Hotel\u201d. This hotel can trade on its location which, although a rather ugly and unappealing area full of tacky tourist shops, predictable chain restaurants and large number of tour groups, is an excellent base to explore the city. We booked a non-smoking room with a king sized bed. We asked for a room on the top floor and preferably not facing the street. Although our room was indeed non-smoking (more of that later) and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi-story parking lot (although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view!). Five minutes spent unpacking in our room and we soon found out why we had been recommended to ask for a room not facing the street. The noise was terrible and even when closed, the windows (old, thin and full of condensation) provided no insulation. There were no curtains (just sliding wooden shutters that we had to shove a chair against to make sure they were closed properly) which didn\u2019t help. I asked the front desk whether we could move rooms. The woman was very helpful and said that as they had declared a number of rooms non-smoking she could offer me a room on the 2nd floor which would be much quieter as it faced a wall. Alarm bells rang in my head when she said they had made rooms non-smoking but I agreed to go and look. As soon as she opened the door the smell of stale smoke hit me and I said that if that was all they could offer then we would stay where we were. She told me that due to the high number of non-smoking rooms requested they had to make more rooms available. So be warned if you ask for a non-smoking room!! Also, avoid rooms on the ground floor facing Mason Street \u2013 not only will the street noise be terrible but there is a permanent smell of stale urine along that sidewalk. Our room was small by American standards although the mirrored wall (thankfully behind the bed!) made it look larger and bright furnishings helped. Our a/c unit worked although was noisy when put onto the cool setting. We kept it on the fan setting as it seemed to help to drown out the street noise \u2013 garbage collection at 6am was particularly nice! Room could have benefited from fresh paint and our carpet had a large iron burn and was damp under the a/c unit. Closet was small and would not hold our bags. Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer. In room safe would have been nice addition. Bed was comfortable & we were not bothered by noise from other bedrooms. Attached restaurant was overpriced and food looked average. We had breakfast there one day and it was nothing special. Boudin Bakery an excellent nearby option for breakfast/lunch and with Trader Joes right next door you should not need to avail yourself of the very expensive mini bar in the rooms. For much better Italian food head up to North Beach \u2013 5 to 10 minute walk \u2013 where you will find a good choice of independent restaurants and cafes around the Colombus Ave/Washington Square area. You will be surrounded by locals (rather than tour groups) and will have a more realistic Italian experience.

The area (Fisherman\u2019s Wharf) can be unsafe at times. We spotted the usual pick-pocketers/bag snatchers hanging around the crossings in the area early evening time. They work in teams waiting for you to be distracted waiting for the walking man signal. If go to this area always be extra vigilant, also with street performers, again they are a distraction to you. We used to love San Francisco but we\u2019ve decided we won\u2019t be going again.

So it's good for Pier 39, the Bay trips, Ghirardelli Centre and the Cannery, but that is really all it has going for it. The room was small but it did have a desk, table & chairs and unit for fridge/TV stand. This meant it was all a little cramped. There was no wardrobe , just a curtained off rail. The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath/shower. There was an individual air-con unit in the window which was very noisy and didn\u2019t generate much cold air. We found it much better to just open the window which obviously wouldn\u2019t work on hot days. We overlooked a small courtyard but the other windows were very close so privacy was an issue. The maids woke us the first day by shouting to each other outside the room at 8am but it didn\u2019t happen after that. The room was cleaned, but not spotless, and the bed was made badly. This sloppy attitude was much the same at the front desk where they didn\u2019t really seem to know what was going on and there were usually queues as they were slow to deal with people. They were polite and did help eventually, but it was hard work. The hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why? It\u2019s not a great breakfast is it? And there is a coffee machine in the room. I would rather save the money. It has an adjoining restaurant which we used for lunch one day. Service was poor and they got our order wrong, but they did correct it at no extra cost and the food was good.

Although we are \"locals\" having lived in SF Bay Area for the last 16 years, we were attending a wine event at Fort Mason and didn't want to have to drive home. When I got a GREAT deal ($99 INCLUDING parking!!!!) I jumped at it. But being the Wharf had no great expectations, and didn't really need much more than a bed for the night. This hotel is a weird hybrid.. calling itself Best Western, but being in partnership with Kimpton Hotels (which for those that don't know is a chain of more upscale boutique hotels). I have to think this is why the hotel looks and feels a lot better than other Wharf hotels I've stayed at previously. And frankly more upscale than other Best Westerns too. Staff were very pleasant, always asking if we needed directions or anything (we didn't, but it's nice to be asked) and smiling and opening doors etc. (including all the maids and bell boys we encountered) Small touches, but very pleasant. We didn't make it to the wine hour (having been drinking wine all day, it was not high on our agenda!) but have done that at other Kimpton hotels and it's a nice extra. Our room looked like a room in a Kimpton hotel, nice bed with decent white linens with burgundy and black throw pillows and accents. The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable. The great thing for us was the free parking. Normally parking is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal. What I didn't realize at the time is that the park the car across the street in a public lot (I assumed it would be in covered hotel parking). Agree with other comments that breakfast at Cafe Pescatore is nothing to write home about, but again, my expectations were low, as it is just that kind of area.

We arrived on the evening of december 5th, and the check-in staff were helpful and efficient. The room was a fair distance from the elevator, but adequate, and no different to most others in this class of hotel as far as amenities went. Our room looked out onto a very small internal courtyard, & plants and flowers made it quite pleasant, but one had to be careful about the shutters because other guests could see into the room. The reverse applied, of course! The next morning, we went down to the adjacent restaurant, which had been in prior publicity material, for breakfast. We didn't enjoy it, because some of the staff seemed to have little English, and misunderstood our requests. We were given saute potatoes that were inedible because they were so hard and undercooked, and the coffee wasn't so good, either. We sent the potatoes back, and the bill was reduced by a small amount. The Eagle Cafe on Pier 39 is a far better bet, and has a view of Alcatraz whilst you're eating. We used the hotel's safety deposit without any problems, and the checkout was good and swiftly done. The hotel is quite close to Fisherman's Wharf and the terminus of one of the Cable-car lines, and also close to the streetcar line, so getting into the city centre was easy. The general area that the hotel is in is a bit scruffy.

I explained to her that we were staying in the \"Tuscan Inn!!!\" We both had a good laugh, but never got to watch the movie.

The courtyard room we were assigned was dark and dingy and since we are fresh air oriented, when we opened the windows we heard 30 +air conditioning units humming away. Couryard rooms are darker than street rooms. The interior of the room was sort of Rococo with a mishmash of colors. The room itself was small and crowded with old furniture and knick knacks. The bathroom had several problems. First ,it was tiny ,old and not at all modern. When I woke up early in the morning to use the facilities, a light outside on the vanity wakened my traveling companion. The inn advertises coffee and tea and biscotti in the morning. Regrettablyt, the biscotti were tiny pieces, quite inedible. The lobby is very busy, with lots of tourists rushing around, apparently quite a few on bus tours. We think the hotel needs a major redoing in almost every respect. Before we reserved, we asked the front desk about the mattresses and were told they were new. My side had that typical depression you find in a hotel bed where a person has been sleeping on the edge and the mattresses have not been turned or simply were not of good quaity to retain any support. We later in the day checked out several large chain hotels in the area, and found them not more expensive and just in more fantastic shape. So, we will never stay at this inn again, barring major renovations.We advise travelers not to be impressed with what the hotel sounds like, and to pass it by.", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Good Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Swamilama", "ReviewID": "UR5731631", "Content": "Spent 3 nights at the Tuscan Inn just after Memorial day. We booked through Expedia which was cheaper than the Best Western site. The hotel is about a 2 block walk to the wharf and 4 blocks to a cable car stop.. Based on recommendations here, we asked for an interior room...which meant we had a view of the roof....or someone else's window...but it was a nice roof, since they placed some potted plants up there to make you forget that you were looking at the roof. Next time I'd ask for a room on the street. I think I'd take a nice view for a little noise. The rooms were very nice and clean. Bathrooms were also very nice. No free internet here though. Some Best Westerns have it, others don't. Down in the lobby, they serve coffee with biscotti in the morning and wine and beer in the early evening. The wine and beer draws a big crowd so get there early...but it's great to get a couple of free drinks. The bus line and electric car run right in front of the hotel. Forget about driving your car anywhere (and you have to pay to park here...about $20 a night I think. It's also valet only, so anytime you get your car...a tip!). In this city public transport can take you anywhere you want to go. Just pick up one of the multi-day passes at the cable car ticket booth (the booth closes about 4pm...something the hotel concierge did not know much to our chagrin). This hotel is much cheaper than others that you'll find in the wharf area, but still very nice. We would absolutely stay here again. Restaurant tips: Try La Taqueria on Mission Street. Okay...you don't usually come to SF for Mexican food, but man the tacos are good here. Not the best area of town, but you can get there by the bus and the trip is definitely worth it...yummmmm. While over in this area you're not too far from Haight Ashbury (don't miss Amoeba records) so combine the trip.

After reading other reviews about getting an inside room facing the courtyard I was ready to request that. Our flight was an early a.m. arrival and when we arrived the front desk let us know there was already a room available but it was an outside facing room. Since it was on the fourth floor we went ahead thinking it might be a little quieter since it wasn't on the street level. They let us know if we wanted to switch after the first night that wouldn't be a problem. We ended up staying in the room they gave us and it was just fine. In fact, I was thrilled to look out our window and actually see the towers of the golden gate bridge peeking over the other buildings between our hotel and the bay! We lucked out and were there when it was clear for a couple days. It was a bonus to be all checked in mid-morning and we were able to take off and enjoy the city right away. The location is great since it is only a couple blocks to Fisherman's Wharf, the ferry for Alcatraz, Pier 39, Ghiradelli Square, cable cars, bus stops, and there is a small shopping center across the street with grocery store, etc. to stock up on whatever you might want to keep in your room for snacks, drinks, etc. If you're traveling to SF for the first time and have kids with you I think this is a perfect location. The staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly, from the front desk, concierge, valet, and housekeeping. I would ignore the review or two that complain about this hotel. Some people aren't happy no matter what. The coffee and biscotti in the lobby in the morning was nice and all the guests that I talked to seemed very pleased to be there too. (coffee tasted extra good to me!) The lobby was decorated nicely. Too bad we weren't able to enjoy the fireplace because of the heatwave. Overall a nice atmosphere. The only slight downside (and it was slight) was the room size was a little small. I knew that going into it and was prepared so it wasn't a big surprise. We traveled with two teens and had a wheelchair to store in the room too but there was still enough room to put clothes, suitcases, etc. and still walk around the room. The beds were also very comfortable. It just might not be for someone who wants to hang out all day at the hotel in a roomy room.

The bed was comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was sufficient enough to rinse conditioner out of my long hair without use of the ice bucket. We stayed 2 nights July 11 and 12. Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in/out privilages. The garage kitty corner from the hotel is $22 plus tax but does not offer in/out. We did take the car out once for a spin around the city and a drive down lombard street. What fun that was! Not much traffic going down the hill. My husband kicked me out of the car at the bottom so I could get some great pictures of the crooked street from the bottom of the hill. Parking in the city is a royal pain!

No kidding, less than 5 minutes walk and we were right at Fisherman's Wharf. The only slight complaint I had about the Tuscan Inn was when we checked in, we were given a key to the honor bar but when I opened the door to the bar, it was completely empty. No big deal for us as it's too expensive to eat out of it anyway. Was just curious to see what they would stock it with. I'm a travel agent so I'm pretty picky about my hotel rooms but I have to say I will be suggesting this hotel to my clients.

The Tuscan took us in at 10:00 am and let us check in immediately, gave us a courtyard view room (which is always quieter at the Wharf), and gave us a $149 rate (AAA) for a BEAUTIFUL room. We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom - it was room 459 - and the room had all the amenities we were looking for. Refrigerator, minibar, free wi-fi, iron & board, hairdryer, down comforters (they were HEAVEN) and pillow top beds. It was decorated beautifully in white, black, burgundy, and a touch of teal, with a mirrored wall to give it a more open feel, and wooden louvered shutters. Even the shower pressure was decent. The lobby (which has a fireplace and very comfy furniture) has a wine tasting for free between 5-6pm each night and you meet dozens of really nice people from all over the world. There is internet access near the fireplace area at a nominal charge if you don't have wi-fi. The restaurant, Pescatoro, is excellent. The rooms are spotless and the employees are as nice as you could ever want. Ask to see a few rooms before you check in, because the room size and location can vary between floors and sides. Ours has two double beds. Some of the king beds had very comfortable sofa beds, which we had 2 years ago. All in all, the location was perfect - a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage-type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over. The Wharf is about a block away. Just beware if you get the SuperShuttle to the airport - if you tell Supershuttle you are staying at the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf it's $23 for 2 people and if you tell them you are at Tuscan Inn, literally across the street, it's $30 for 2 - something about contracts with the hotels - and they pick you up earlier than they say so BE ON TIME wherever you get it.

Public transportation (you can buy unlimited passes for a varied number of days) is more than enough and can take you everywhere without having to worry about parking (or paying for it).

They also are related to the Kimpton hotel chain. The hotel has 4 levels with a variety of King, Double, King Suite and Double Suite rooms available. Experience: We had arrived on a late flight and only made it to the hotel at about 10 at night. The single front desk clerk told us they had given away our original room with 2 double beds. Instead they said they would give us a suite with 1 king sized bed and fold out couch. This was not what we wanted but there were no rooms with 2 regular beds and it was late at night. They agreed to change us to the next available room with 2 double beds. Upon returning to the desk in the morning we were given key cards for room 439 with 2 double beds. This was much better as my son said a night on the fold away couch bed was awful. I can understand this as I lay down and could feel the springs of the bed. Although I understand it is first come first serve I think it was wrong to give away a guest\u2019s room especially if they have notified you of their late check-in. Room: I will not go into details about the first room we had (King Suite) as I did not pay much attention other than where the washroom, bed and TV were as it was late at night when we checked in and all we wanted to do was relax and go to sleep. Our actual room featured 2 double sized beds with TV, honor bar (we liked the extra room left to store our own store bought products), a work desk, chair, coffee maker and . The room itself, although \u201csmaller\u201d was not cramped but not nearly average hotel room sized. The washroom was not overly large but big enough to comfortable move around in the morning. There was also a small closet in the room. Our room had a court-yard view which means it faced in the inside of hotel. This was good because it was quiet. Do not worry about the view from you room as the best views are in Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in one of the restaurants. I\u2019ll write more on that later. The room is not (or at least should not) be very important to the tourist traveler in San Francisco\u2019s Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. The area is full of exciting things to do and places to eat. If I exclude time spent sleeping I think I only spent 3-4 hours total time in the room during the week I was in the area. The only weak point of the room was that there was very little storage space for clothing and person articles. Services/Amenities: In accordance with the Tuscan Inn\u2019s Italian style/theme a coffee/tea/biscotti service was open from 6am till 9am in the mornings. In the evenings from 5pm till 6pm a wine, beer and sparkling water service was available. Guests have the opportunity to sample local Californian wines as well as Italian beer and water. The hotel does not feature any sort of pool or exercise facility which would have been convenient to have but not necessary but definitely good to have. The hotel offers free wifi (wireless high speed internet) to all guests who have a laptop. The signal was accessible throughout the hotel. This is a definite plus for any traveler with a laptop. I used it to keep in touch with people back home, find stores in SF as well as look up reviews and recommendations on area restaurants. Parking at the hotel was a hefty $32 per day with unlimited in and out privileges. We never called down in advance and once we informed the valet from the lobby our car was retrieved within 5 minutes. Very good! Final Word: The Tuscan Inn by Best Western is an excellent choice for tourists who want easy (and I mean really easy) access to the Fisherman\u2019s Wharf area as well as business travelers doing to the financial district (there are 3 daily shuttles). The hotel is located near many restaurants in the Wharf area as well as an onsite restaurant called Caf\u00e9 Pascatore serving tasty Italian food. For breakfast I recommend walking the 2-3 blocks to the IHOP near the Radisson on the Wharf.

But, what was just as good was to come back to the Tuscan Inn each day. The Best Western Tuscan Inn continues to review well on Tripadvisor because it continues to live up to its reputation in both price and value. This is not budget hoteling, but its not the Hyatt either. I continue to find BW's in unique places with good property locations. We stayed in the 330's on the Mason street side as opposed to the busier North Point side. We even had a veiw from our window of Coit Tower. Traffic noise was minimal, too, and surprisingly calm at night. Watch out, though, for the windows extending out especially with little kids in the room. Rooms are a bit tight especially if you get the two doubles. Decor looks nice (trying for the Tuscany feel) and let's just say the beds were soft, cozy, but firm so no issues with sleeping. Surprisingly quiet at night, too. Bathrooms, though, are plenty big. No room for rollaway so Grandma got her own room, but she did baby sit one night. Also, we got connecting rooms, but check first because there are only so many available. Nice to have when travelling with other relatives with kids. Yes, happy wine tasting hour is a bit crowded, but fun and a great way to get in the mood for nice night out on the town not to mention getting some ideas from other travellers. Besides wine, the hostess (I think she was the night manager) served Peroni beer which was unexpected and refreshing. In the mornings, of course, the coffee (very good) and biscoti's are available down in the lobby same as happy hour. Can't beat location, Mason and North Point. Minutes away from Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, etc. No. 9 Fisherman's Grotto is classic for dinner and cannot beat the view. We also did the Beach Chalet at teh end of Golden Gate Park one night with surfers and Sunset views to die for. Upon arriving into SF via 2 autos, it took us less than 10 minutes to get to the hotel from the Bay Bridge exit and onto Embarcadero until we came to North Point. You can walk to the Buena Vista (best breakfast and Irish Coffee), North Beach (Vesuvio's a must) and even Lombard street, but at night take cabs for sure. Despite not having a pool, the kids loved the Tuscan Inn, too. Lot's of great comfy space in the lobby. The Concierge at the Tuscan was excellent considering he was constantly busy. Front desk staff were always pleasant. Maid service was prompt, too. When we arrived we simply pulled up to the hotel and had the bellman help us. Parking is an issue in SF so either pay the $30.00 plus a day to park at the Tuscan or find something cheaper in the city. With MUNI (1.50 for adults, .50 kids and seniors) and cable cars ($5.00 one way or 10.00 all day anytime) you don't really need autos do you?

I read other reviews about noisy air-con and thought \"fool...switch it off\". Well, even in the \"off\" position, the air-con emits an sporadic, intermittent hum and vibration, which, combined with the fridge resetting itself during the night conspire to deprive you of sleep. Earplugs didn't work. I asked to be moved after the first night, thinking this was unique to the particular room we had been assigned on arrival (454 - which faced a wall, by the way.)

I'd recommend this property, especially to first-time San Francisco visitors. It's modern, clean, efficient, comfortable, and professionally run with courteous staff. On your second visit you might opt to stay a greater distance away from the tourist schlock of Fisherman's Wharf.

Or, like me, if you've been to the city several times, you might choose to stay here because it is so close to transportation: A bus stop is right across the street; one cable car turnaround is literally around the corner and another is a few blocks away, and the Pier 41 ferries are a 5-minute walk away, as is a streetcar line. (You know all those warnings not to drive in SF? Pay attention! Don't Drive. You'll be having fun while some other poor sod is looking for a parking space that isn't there.) Although I didn't notice much of an authentic Tuscan note, my queen bed room was Europeanly small. Not cramped or inaccessible, just compact. (I had a glimpse at a king room, which was larger. More later.) The bed was comfortable, the closet and storage space was sufficient for one or two people traveling light, and the bath was not cramped. If there are two of you and several bags, plan on stacking most of the bags in a corner of the room. The room had a few annoying decorative items -- like a four-foot long round pillow carefully placed at the same location on the bed by the maid every day -- that seemed spawned by a marketing maven. Apparently, all the rooms are similarly afflicted. Oh yeah, if you don't like mirrors, go elsewhere. One entire wall is covered with mirrors. The restaurant on the premises is the Cafe Pescatore. Breakfast there was fine, but I ate elsewhere for lunch and dinner. The cafe is comfortable and service was attentive and polite. Plan on spending $15-$20 on breakfast. Room service at the hotel is limited: Breakfast items from the Cafe and lunch or dinner from a neighboring pizza joint, But, hey, this is San Francisco. Why are you eating in your room? The hotel provides complementary coffee and biscotti in the morning and hosts a winetasting in the late afternoon, If you forget something, a Walgreen's, a Safeway and a Trader Joe's are each about a block away.

Other's have urged requesting an interior room overlooking the courtyard. They're right. Streets in the neighborhood carry a lot of traffic, and rooms on the streetside might be too noisy for your tastes. (This isn't unique. Traffic is heavy almost everywhere in SF.) I'd booked an interior courtyard room with a king bed, calling the day before I arrived to reiterate the request.

Quinn, the night auditor, came to our rescue. He volunteered to have someone get our car out of the garage and return it to the Hertz office a block or two from the hotel. While we were making these arrangements, the valet secured a shuttle service to get us to the airport on time. On our return home, there was a follow-up message from Sean, the assistant general manager, telling us that indeed the return had been made. Our stay at the Tuscan Inn was wonderful in every way, but for Quinn, the valets, and Sean to go the extra mile so we could make our flight was extraordinary!

The bathroom was also small; it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you (no joke!). Other than the small room, the location was great and very close to all the attractions of Fisherman's Wharf. I thought the $29 per day parking was ridiculous, but I hear that's the standard in SF. We experienced no noise problems while staying here, but we had an inside courtyard room. The staff was not overly friendly nor helpful. The concierge, Daniel, was also not that much of a help. If you were simply asking for directions, suggestions, or general information, he acted a bit snooty. However, I witnessed other guests buying tour tickets through him, and he was much nicer.

The location is terrific - two blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. We stayed there with another couple in 2 rooms. Upon arriving, there was a very long and confusing to do with the valet parking - we hadn't gotten our luggage out of th car and the valet wanted the keys. We were told to take our luggage out and wait for the concierge, who never showed up. There were about five other cars in the area - we were told if we needed the car, the valet would get when we needed it. There was a fee of $29 per day for the parking. We parked the car and never needed to take it out until we left. We checked in during the daily \"wine tasting\" the hotel provided. That left the small lobby loaded with people blocking the desk and walkways. The wine tasting is a great idea but the lobby is so small that the crowds block access. I was totally amazed that the other guests didn't budge out of the way so we could get to our rooms. Check in was quick. Our rooms were very small but beautifully decorated. We had no view - all we saw out the window was the back of another wing of the hotel. There was a mini-bar but it was locked and we did not have the key. There was a small refrigerator in the room. The furnishings were lovely. Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom. The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, creams) were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle. The beds were comfortable, the shower was hot, the towels luxurious. There was an ice machine on our floor but the soda machine was out of order. There was a 7-11 convenience type store down the street so we simply got soda there while we were out. Our air conditioner was terribly loud our first night there. The second day we stopped at the desk and spoke to the friendly clerk who had it fixed for us when we came back that night. There is a moderately priced Italian restaurant in the hotel that we had a deceont dinner at, but there are so many restaurants on the Wharf we preferred to eat there. We found an IHOP around the corner for breakfast. It is a 2 block walk to the wharf and the location is very convenient. We also were within walking distance of the cable cars and even walked up to Lombard Street. We paid $169 per night. While the rooms were lovely for that price they were extremely small, but the location was just perfect.

This was a GREAT decision. I have never stayed at a Best Western before, but I think this is not your typical BW hotel! The lobby was decorated beautifully, giving you a feeling of being in a European hotel. Cocktail hour in the lobby with the fireplace burning was a delightful treat. They offered three styles of wine, Peroni beer, Pellegrino water, sodas, and a snack. Amazingly, with a 3-night stay, we made cocktail hour 3 times. You could chat with other guests, or just keep to yourselves; the atmosphere was warm and friendly. The complimentary coffee and biscotti in the morning was another hit. Their biggest challenge was keeping the coffee urns filled, as everyone seemed to enjoy the coffee. We ate at the attached Italian restaurant the first night due to exhaustion, and found it to be outstanding. This is not your typical spaghetti and meatball restaurant. The restaurant was decorated beautifully, the wait staff was professional without being snobby, the menu was creative and delicious. The tiramisu for dessert was one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. I feared the room size because of the other reviews, but I think we got lucky and received one of their larger rooms. We requested 2 double beds for 3 women, and were expecting a closet-sized room. What we received was more than adequate. We were in the back of the hotel with a \u201cview\u201d of the inner courtyard, but it was quiet and we got a peaceful night\u2019s sleep. Other guests on the street-side of the hotel were not as fortunate due to excessive street noise. The rooms were freshly and creatively decorated, and meticulously clean. The furnishings were bright and cheery (looked new), and having the one wall mirrored not only made the room feel larger, but with 3 women staying in the room, we never had to fight for mirror time. The goose-down duvets are another European touch. If I had to find one negative thing in the room (and I\u2019m searching), it would be that the shower and toilet were in a separate room from the sink (good thing), but the light switch for the shower was tied into the same light at the sink. So, if one person wanted to shower and required the light on, it would also light up the sink area, which was in the bedroom area, hence, would disturb the other sleeping guests. The Concierge always had a friendly smile and was willing to help with any questions that came his way. The front desk and the housekeeping staff were equally as friendly. As far as parking is concerned, we were shell-shocked at what most of the hotels charge for parking\u2014up to $40/night. The Tuscan is $29/night, but if you search for a package rate on their web site, you may get parking included in your room rate. Great value. Also, there is a public garage across the street from the hotel if you want to self-park. I don\u2019t know what their rates are though. The hotel is in a great location; you can walk to anything in the Fisherman\u2019s Wharf area. In fact, we even walked to Lombard Street one morning. Now that was a hike! And, conveniently, there is a Safeway and a drug store hidden in the parking garage across the street. Yes, hidden.

Suitably fortified, we set out on our first evening feeling very positive about the hotel, San Francisco and the world in general! The King size bed was longer and wider than the equivalent in the UK and extremely firm and comfortable - we're now shopping for a replacement at home using this as the benchmark. Morning coffee, tea and biscotti in the lobby was very convenient and as with the evening wine sessions, provided an oppurtunity to chat with other guests and swap tips on where to go and what to do.

The hotel is eco-friendly, which I liked. They only change your sheets and towels everyday if you request. If you don't want them changed, they still remake and clean the room. The towels were nice sized and thick, and there were plenty of them. The shower head was up pretty high which is great for tall travelers. There was also a curved curtain which allows you more room when showering. I especially liked the aromatherapy bath soap, lotion, shampoo, and conditioner.

During our stay, I spoke with both Quinn and Neal at the front desk, two valet attendants, and Daniel the Concierge. All were very friendly and courteous, and quickly answered every question that I asked. We never tried the restaurant in the hotel, as we had plenty of options in the blocks surrounding the hotel. The hotel is conveniently located, two blocks from Fisherman's Wharf, and close to the cable cars, trolley stops, and the Blue and Gold fleet (Alcatraz tours). For $6 round trip you can take the nearby trolleys to China Town, Nob Hill, Union Station, and Powell Street. If you want to see the Golden Gate Bridge, you can rent bikes or two seater and four seater motorized vehicles from a few places within two or three blocks of the hotel. The bridge is about 3.5 miles from the hotel. You can walk to the Gold and Blue fleet for tours around the bay, to Angel and Alcatraz Islands, and to Muir Woods. Also, a Super Tours office is just a block or two up North Point. One morning as we were walking out, there was gentleman there who annouced to folks waiting in the lobby that he was with \"Grayline Tours\". The room we stayed in was a bit tight. It was actually two rooms, with a sofa bed, desk, coffee table, and television in the first room, and a bed, dresser, and television in a seperate room. The bath in our room was fine, not extraordinarily big, but not cramped either. It only had a shower. The only con was the limited space in the bedroom. There wasn't a lot of space for the luggage. However the bed was extremely confortable. Overall, I was happy with the room. The other room, reserved for my mother, was a single room, with much more space. She was very happy with her room. I will attempt to include a picture of her room. We stayed in three hotels on our trip to San Francisco and Las Vegas, and when it was all said and done, this was the hotel we all agreed was the best stay overall.

The snide, sadistic clerk at the desk was completely unapologetic and sarcastic. QUINN. He said he found us another room that was like the one we'd reserved non-smoking King. We also always look for free wi-fi. We were taken to another hotel where the room was totally reeking of cigarettes, because it was a smoking room, and 2 twin beds. By then it was almost 4:00 A.M. Internet access was not free. I was so upset and angry, and that desk clerk is nothing but a black hole for Best Western's public relations. There was no\" MISTAKE\"-there was no \"MISUNDERSTANDING\"But there was an abundance of ill will and greed. If a late arrival guarantee has NO meaning, and is not honored by the hotel, than how can I trust their hospitality code? I have NEVER had such a crappy experience at a hotel. I really feel that he sized us up and decided to try to wield power, because there was nothing we could do.

The hotel is an Italian mediterrean theme everywhere, entrance, lobby, garden courtyard, restaurant, and rooms. The staff are 100% present and attentive to your every need. Their friendliness reminded me very much of the Aloha spirit at Hawai`ian resorts and hotels. The lobby is small and cozy with a gas log fireplace, perfect for taking away the chill after those cool, foggy walks down to the waterfront. Guests actually talk to one another during morning coffee, and the free hour of wine at 5 pm. I highly recommend this hotel, for both quality and economy.

I'ts about 2 blocks to Fisherman's Wharf, 2 blocks to the cable car turn-around, 1 block to the F-Line trolley car, and 3 blocks to Pier 39.

The remote to our tv wasn't working (a new one was set up promptly.) The bed was comfortable with a nice thick comforter. The courtyard was in full bloom with beautiful flowering plants. We didn't get a chance to sample the afternoon wine as we were gone most of the day. Valets quick to get the car out of the garage and very helpful with directions. The hotel restaurant was a bit over priced but good service and good quality. I would stay there again and would highly recommend.", "Date": "August 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again!\u201d", "Author": "moose19", "ReviewID": "UR2452331", "Content": "Courteous, responsive service and a great location!

Comfortable hotel in very good location for ferries and Pier 39. Check in was quick and efficient. We had booked one room with a King size bed and a sofa bed for our 2 teenagers, thinking that when the sofa bed was put back during the day we would have more space than having 2 Queens. The price prohibited booking 2 rooms, which we had done in Vegas and Anaheim. We regretted it, as once the sofa bed was pulled out there was very little space and the maid did not put it back during the day. The sofa bed only had one blanket and my daughter was cold, so we requested an extra blanket but she was still cold, so we requested a duvet (quilt) but despite asking for it twice it never appeared. We glimpsed rooms containing 2 Queen beds and they seemed to have more space. Other than that it was a pleasant stay, the room was clean, our bed was really comfortable and the reception staff were friendly. The free morning coffee and evening wine reception were both good opportunities to meet other guests. The adjoining restaurant was very good and I agree with a previous reviewer that the Tiramasu was the best I had ever tasted. It is a pity they don't serve a buffet breakfast, so we went across the road to the Sheraton to the the restaurant there and the breakfast was very good. We also used the I-Hop which was just round the corner. Another dissapointment was that we had requested a courtyard view but could only see 2 pot plants up a corner, we could also hear noise from the street late at night. I think I would only stay here again if there was just 2 of us sharing a room, when I am sure it would be really comfortable. I agree with previous reviewer that you need warm clothes in San Francisco, the evening trip on the ferry to Alcatraz was very cold and windy and the morning trip to Muir woods was cold and damp! However, when the sun burned off the mist it was pleasantly warm. We booked a coach tour of Muir Woods and Sausalito and a jeep tour of San Francisco on the internet www.alcatraz.us and they were both excellent.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorktown, NY", "Title": "\u201cNot worth it\u201d", "Author": "NYCookie3", "ReviewID": "UR2328921", "Content": "The rooms were tiny and still decorated in the 70s style.

We loved the location and were able to walk to take a trolley to all of our desired local destinations. The hotel staff was great and housekeeping went so far as to organize the toiletries I had brough from home and had left scattered on the vanity.

I am originally from the Monterey Bay area and my fiance is from Alabama. This was his first trip to CA and he fell in love and had an awesome time. The hotel restaurant is overpriced and average--I would advise venturing out. The only real problem I had was at checkout. I received my bill and paid it and was walking out the door when I noticed it was incorrect. They had overcharged me by at least $600. I turned around and went back to the front desk clerk who informed me that he could not make a correction and give me a refund but handed me a card with accounting's number on it. He advised me to call them once I returned to DC (because they were currently at lunch). Given that he couldn't understand what the error was when I was standing in front of him pointing it out. I was not about to leave and hash it out long distance over the phone. After 15 minutes of refusing to help me and telling me it was beyond his control and out of practice to make corrections at the desk, another woman (a manager?) overheard and asked what the problem was. I explained and she fixed it in 3 minutes and gave me a refund. Perhaps he was still in training or was the kind of person who liked to pretend he knew what he was doing and didn't want to ask for help. Outside of this incident, everyone else was great.
