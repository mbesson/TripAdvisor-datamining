(we stay in a lot of chain hotels - so we try to look for other places to stay when we can.). This is the perfect \"anti-chain! This hotel is old. We love it! The perfect hotel to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary! There are beautiful antiques and frescoes everywhere. Our room overlooked the garden. (The first time we stayed here we overlooked the garden and asked if we could do so again, and they accommodated our request.) Since this hotel is right on the road leading up to St. Peter's, there can be a lot of street noise, so if you can get a room that does not overlook the street, you'll probably be more likely to have a peaceful nights sleep. In the three years since we last visited, we can tell they have done some upgrades; for example the shower is more \"American\" thus giving you more space in the bathroom. Our room had a sitting area, and then a separate door leading to a very comfortable king sized bed and small closet. There was a TV in both the bedroom and living area, but we never turned it on - too busy touring!! :) This is a perfect location for us. We like being close to St. Peter's; as well as walking distance to many other attractions and churches. The ONLY negative thing I can think of would be relating to the restaurant. It is grossly overpriced; and when my husband asked for two separate dishes, they were \"out of\" both. Again, the staff was pleasant, but we only ate the one meal there. A very good wine list to select from though...

I stayed at Columbus hotel for two nights in June 2011 for a business trip. The hotel has a great location as it is very close to the Vatican (2 min on foot). It is also not far to the other major sights in Rome. The building is absolutely stunning. It is easily 400 years old, has high ceilings, large staircases, and the public areas are lavishly decorated. The rooms are also quite large and feature full bathrooms. They have free parking and a nice garden area where guests can take their breakfast. This is where the positive aspects cease. Some points that annoyed me during my stay were: - the room's decor was beyond spartan. The furniture, most notably the beds, were just old (the mattresses were OK, though). There was also a total lack of any decoration to make the room seem more inviting. - the walls were paper thin; I could hear Mike & Linda's conversations every morning from their room next to mine. - the air conditioning only works on certain time slots; the evening shift was from 2000 - 2400, for example. - the bathroom was very dark. They had to actually screw a spotlight next to the mirror so that guests could shave. - I'm certain the desk chair dated from the hotel's inauguration. I almost fell through it sitting on it. As a caveat to the above, I'd like to say that my colleague had a much better experience than me, so I might just have had bad luck.

Here are my reasons: First, I had to switch rooms because the air conditioner (installed high up above the doorway) produced only hot air. (I stayed here June 1-8, 2011). One front desk staff person told me that the air conditioner worked like a central air unit, and only produced cold air from 8AM-12PM, then another staff member said it was 8PM to 12AM. I didn't believe either, but went along with it so they would let me switch rooms, which they did the next day because they themselves realized, after visiting me, that it was very hot and uncomfortable. After switching, the new air conditioner worked fine as well as all the time. So why did they lie? (I later learned that I wasn't the only guest of the hotel who had the same problem - but I don't know whether his issue was resolved.) Second, the plumbing in the second room (especially the toilet) didn't work properly. The toilet paper wouldn't go down - bad water pressure, I assume - and the hotel wouldn't fix it. After telling them about it for the third time, they told me to flush the toilet as may times as it took until the paper went down. (Who would say that?) Every morning I left it, thinking that the maids who clean the room would deal with it, but they didn't - they just closed the lid. What did I do after that? You don't want to know.

Good reviews appear here on TripAdvisor, but a low price combined with a central Rome location with parking rang alarm bells. My concern was totally misplaced, as the Columbus is a truly fantastic hotel. Literally a stones throw from Vatican City, the location couldn't be better for visitors there. For the rest of Rome, it meant a short walk, but Castel Sant'Angelo is just a couple of minutes walk, while Piazza Navona is around 15 minutes. Even the Colosseum is walkable, taking a leisurely 40 minutes to get to. However, given the hotels position, right on the approach to the Vatican, taxis are plentiful. The hotel itself has a small car park, through a narrow gate, which is unusual in Rome. The building itself is unremarkable although pleasant, but once you get inside it's fantastic! A large reception area with stone floors, high ceilings and endless old artworks on the wall greets you. This theme is continued throughout the hotel, with random lounges, reception rooms, seating areas and more, all very grand. There's even a grand piano lurking in one room, perfectly tuned. A spacious bar, with Wi-Fi, and a classy restaurant are available too, with the latter serving some fantastic, if pricey, food. The room was very spacious, although somewhat basic. That said, it fitted the style of the hotel perfectly, where a modern identikit hotel room would have felt out of place. A large bed, plenty of floor space, a desk and a TV balanced on top of a mini-bar made up the room, while the bathroom had a good, powerful shower and again, plenty of space. Air conditioning was available, but some vented window shutters proved more pleasant, allowing you to keep the fierce summer sun out during the day, but allowing fresh air in. In a world of identical chain hotels, the Columbus somehow felt 'real'. When we'd got back each day from exploring Rome, we still felt like we were in Rome, not a faceless hotel.

But it is exactly what I wanted in visiting Rome for the first time. I spent 5 nights at Columbus in May '10, and I chose it because it offered a great combination of location, value, and historic flavor. As you have read or will shortly, the building itself is wonderful in the sense that it drips with history - a former monestary, it sits between St. Peter's Square and the Ponte Sant'Angelo - and with a good throw you could probably get a stone to either. There are paintings throughout the hotel that are hundreds of years old, and the large shady courtyard with center fountain is splendid (especially in the early eveing with a glass of wine). This alone is reason for many, including myself, to love the place - that feeling of staying within proximity of so much amazing history. But again, know what you want. If for you it's more about ammenities, service, etc, then there will be higher-rated options. Some potential drawbacks: the rooms are plain at best - if you travel to Rome so that you can spend a lot of time in your room then choose another hotel (although the monks that once slept in them would be impressed). Also the hotel is not very near an underground rail station, so i walked a ton. I stayed on the courtyard side so sleep was fine, but careful if you're on the street leading to the Vatcian because I understand it can be quite noisy. Breakfast was fine - not fancy, but satisfactory with cereal, yogurt, cakes, ham, cheese, and good coffee. Sorry, can't comment on the restaurant for dinner, other than it's pricey and in a beautiful room. The service/staff? Fine overall. Some very polite, some not so much, but never rude. There was a misunderstanding which caused a mid-stay move to a smaller room, but I was fine with it - in fact I had a double room to myself for two nights at a single price, and they let it slide.

The tile was damaged in sections, but the bathroom was very clean with no mold. Our beds were comfortable and clean. The problem: the carpet was disgusting and filthy! I've stayed in third world countries with cleaner carpets. The pink carpet displayed a clear trail of filth into the room and around each bed, tracking the walking patterns. I thought perhaps this was just our room, but I got a peek at the room across from us and its carpet was exactly the same. We had to use the hotel slippers provided. Lastly, the reception service varied widely. Our first morning we had to be at the coliseum at 8 a.m. and so at 7 a.m. we asked the front desk to hail us a cab. They told us to walk the two-three blocks to the taxi stand. We did and found that at that time, not a single cab was to be found. We began the walk to the coliseum on our own until we eventually found a cab. As my daughter in an ortho boot for a fractured leg we were trying to restrict her amount of walk, thus the need for a cab. We were disappointed upon our return to the hotel to find them gladly hailing cabs for other guests. And, our first evening we asked the hotel to recommend a nearby restaurant. They sent us to a self-service counter a block away were a terrible counter meal cost us $100!! The few times we approached the counter to ask questions, we found we were simply wasting our time.

It is a former monastery and is austere but beautiful. Rooms (we stayed in 4 over our various nights so had a good idea of what they were like in general) were plain. Old tv sets, plastic lamps on the nightstands, some bathrooms more spacious than others. One room had a bathroom with a shower off to the side so you showered in the room itself (kinda wet but the kids enjoyed it.) Rooms facing the main street are fairly noisy so ask for a room facing the courtyard if you think it may disturb your sleep. Hotel staff is polite, not friendly, but always polite. I have read other reviews complaining about hotel breakfasts in Italy and every hotel we stayed in appears to have the same basic breakfast - and it was far more enjoyable and varied than what I expected: eggs (hardboiled), meats and cheeses, yoghurt, fruit (canned), cakes, breads, croissants, etc., in a beautiful dining room. Location is amazing if you are interested in visiting the Vatican. For us to visit over Christmas and stroll a block to St. Peter's to receive the papal blessing on Christmas Day - awesome.

It was fine for us as my son knows his way around the Metro and the bus stops (I believe it is the #62 that stops barely a half block from the hotel and winds its way around Rome.) One last thing, lunches and dinners at the hotel were amazingly expensive and we were used to the expensive food in general in Rome. Perhaps it was the Christmas holiday time but dinner was 105 euros per person and lunch was not a whole lot less. We did not eat at the restaurant because of the cost but we did stop in for a late night drink one night and it was a beautiful place, they treated us to cookies with our drinks and it was a lovely time. Just don't expect posh rooms even though this is a 4 star hotel and you will be fine.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "aberdeen", "Title": "\u201cLovely atmosphere-ideal location-helpful and charming staff\u201d", "Author": "kdlbs", "ReviewID": "UR48782726", "Content": "Very good value for hotel just steps away from St. Peter's.

I have never been to Rome before and I traveled with a female friend. We were looking for a good hotel that was close enough to everything and also had some Italian / Roman charm to it. What we were not looking for was your everyday american \"sheridan or Hilton\" type hotel. Let me start by saying the location is excellent. The hotel is probably 3000 feet from St. Peters Basilica, The Vatican Museum, and maybe 10000 feet from St. Angelos Castle. From the Hotel we walked to the Trevi Fountain, Piazza Novenna, Spanish steps, and just about every other attractions. For the Collosseum, it is maybe a 20 -25 minute walk or you can simply walk to the subway station (5 minute walk) and take it to Termini Station, then get on the B line and take it 2 stops to the collosseum. Another thing we found very helpful was the fact that directly across from the hotel was the Hop on Hop off tour busses. You can buy a 24 hr pass or a 48 hr pass for 19 or 23 euros a person and basically use the bus as a cab taking you all around the city and stopping where you feel like or riding up top and seeing the whole city for an hr or two. Definitely worth the money. We didnt take a taxi once, except to get to the airport on our last day since it was an early flight. Room: I read alot of mixed reviews and was somewhat nervous, but once we arrived in the room, it was absolutley fine. We stayed in a double bed in room 410. The room was cozy, with a small window looking out towards St. Peters Basilica. The bed was a little springy but overall no problem. The bathroom, while very small shower (VERY SMALL) was very very clean and nicely tiled. There was an inroom safe and a TV that got 2 english channels. All of the front desk staff were helpful except one rather grumpy person. I didnt pay any attention to him and it did not affect our stay at all. They all spoke english very well and were helpful when we asked about how to get places etc etc. The resturant was very expensive and we chose not to eat there. There are more then ample places around the city to eat. At night time the street infront of the hotel becomes a ghost town as the vatican city pretty much closes up. Thats no problem as when you walk out of the hotel go to the right, walk for 2 minutes over the bridge and your right in the city of rome with lots to do. Its actually really nice to come back to the hotel at night and have it be nice and quiet and peaceful. I would consider it more of a plus that it is quiet outside at night. The continental breakfast that is included is ample to get you through the morning and a good part of the day. There is cheese, salami, bread, cereal, juice, and some other \"interesting\" stuff. Defintiely worth it as other hotels charge 11 euro each and more if you go outside. There is also internet for 2 euro an hour (very good deal). Overall I highly recommend this hotel, even if you are \"not looking for a spiritual location\". The hotel is centrally located. Depite what the maps show, everythign is VERY close in Rome and you can walk just about everywhere. I have photos of the room and hotel and will try to post them later as I do not have them on me. I would defintiely stay at the hotel again. And as a point of reference, I am in my late 20's as is the female I traveled with.

We had reserved a junior suite, and were very pleased with the room. The living room and bedroom were decent-sized; though the bathroom was somewhat narrow, it was still comfortable and inviting nonetheless. The staff were quite friendly and spoke a fair number of languages. They also had a breakfast room and separate restaurant serving lunch and dinner, both of which were quite good. The breakfasts offered milk, tea, coffee, and various juices as well as an assortment of breads, fruit, cereal, sliced meat, coffee cake, etc. It was all light, but quite filling and always tided us over during our mornings of sight-seeing. Their restaurant was WONDERFUL, and served a number of appealing dishes; we enjoyed the staff and food so much that we usually ate there for dinner. However, the downside of the restaurant is that it is quite pricey and towards the weekends is often full. The biggest problem that we had at Hotel Columbus was that the internet service was quite unreliable and cost 1 euro per hour. This isn't a business-oriented hotel really, it is much more accomodating to couples and families than anything else. The second problem we found was that it was quite a ways from the airport, and so cost about a 44 euro taxi ride. Other than the Vatican, this hotel is not immediate to any major Rome attractions, so expect to spend money on taxis! The best part was stepping outside the hotel and seeing the Vatican just a short walk down the street. The view of it is phenomenal! Anyone primarily interested in the Vatican and museums should definitely stay at this hotel. But anyone who is more interested in night life will probably not enjoy the location of this hotel; the area around the Vatican is very quiet at night, though the trattorias and pizzerias stay open fairly late.

Visiting several websites, viewing pictures etc we could see that it was not a luxury hotel but that it would be more in keeping with the location - ie next door to the Vatican and the Castel San T'Angelo.

The room is cleaned every day with fresh towels. Very clean, very basic but all the essentials (except an iron). The view from the room was of the top of St Peter's Basilica above the roof tops - amazing. The bathroom had bath, separate shower and was roomy.

The room was very small, barely enough room to move around and very little space to put two suitcases. One suitcase had to sit on the floor next to the bed blocking access to the armoire. The bathroom was modern enough but the shower was extremely narrow.

The elevator was out of service and several of the clerks were rude. The bartender couldn't make a decent mixed drink to save her life. This hotel is rated as four stars! My recommendation would be to stay somewhere else.", "Date": "June 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NM", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "lgp49", "ReviewID": "UR5364120", "Content": "Stayed at the Hotel Columbus, Via Concialiazione, Rome for 5 nights in mid May 2006. It's a great location for the Vatican, and it's also close to Castel SantAngelo. It's not a bad walk to Piazza Navona, Campo Fiori, Pantheon and Spanish Steps. Nice room although the air conditioning didn't work too well and the beds were bouncy but hard. We found all beds in Italian hotels to be similar, even in the Courtyard Marriott by the Rome Airport which is brand new. Staff was pleasant and there is a bar-tabacchi right outside run by a couple - husband from Boston and wife Italian. Good coffee and beer and sandwiches. Only thing not close by were decent restaurants, but we were usually willing to walk over the bridge and find one elsewhere.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lurgan, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLike living next door to the Papa!

It was a last minute thing and we did not have time to look for anything else. Needless to say we were aghast at the price but felt we had to take it. We arrived in Rome by train from Florence and took a taxi to the hotel...35 euro. It was an amazing sight as we drove up to see St. Peters just steps away. It really blew us away. Over the course of 3 days we spent a great deal of time in Vatican City... The hotel is over 500 years old and has lots of history.. The front desk was friendly and helpful. The rooms are sparce , no frills.. and no pictures on the wall. The double decker sight seeing bus was available across the street, which made it easy for us to see the other famous sites of Rome. All in all a great experience but very expensive.... P.S. When we were looking for lodging we toyed with the idea of staying by the airport as there were several hotels available in that area.... Do Not Book a hotel room by the airport if you are sight seeing....All roads may lead to Rome, but the road is several miles away.", "Date": "May 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Easter\u201d", "Author": "RO888", "ReviewID": "UR4998235", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay in Rome.

Hotel Columbus was the only available choice we found, and eventhought a bit pricy, it is well worth the stay: Set in an old monastery, a stone throw from St Peter, this is a Hotel with charm and caracter, that gave us a cocoon of peace, beauty and tranquility for our entire 4 nights stay.

I was a bit concerned after reading some negative reviews, however we enjoyed our stay. Our room was a double en-suite; it was functional and comfortable, the window overlooked the courtyard and the top of St Peter\u2019s Dome could be seen above the opposite roof (we were on the 3rd floor). Although I tried hard to speak my phrase book Italian most of the staff seemed to understand me and/or speak English. We found the staff very helpful and friendly. We took our evening meals in the hotel; although not cheap it was very enjoyable. It cost us 180 Euros in total for the two meals; each night we had 2 courses each, a bottle of house red (very very nice) and coffees, plus a tip. We found the 1st course from the menu, very filling. There are without doubt less expensive, good quality places to eat in Rome, this was just a treat. We also used the taxi service to the airport at the end of our stay, it cost 50 Euros to Ciampino, and again we thought it worthwhile value. Let\u2019s face it, when you're in Rome you\u2019re not going to want to spend much time in your hotel, especially if like us you\u2019re on a short break; we found the Columbus ideal, it was secure, friendly, comfortable and ideally located.
