What we really like about Hotel Philia is its excellent location (near the train station and the Metro station Castro Pretorio). All mainstream attractions of the eternal city are easy to reach, but also less touristic places like our beloved \"San Lorenzo\" (the university's neighborhood http://www.feelhomeinrome.com/rome-blog/index.php/san-lorenzo/). Also the \"Pizzeria del Secolo\", in the same street, is probably one of the best to-go pizzerias in town. The hotel is not the Ritz, but if you are going to spend most of the time out of your room (as you should if you are in Rome!) it is quite OK. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast is superb.

Generally the staff was helpful although their English wasn't very good. On the bad side, there was no ventilation in the bath and it smelled bad, there was no air-conditioning and the maid didn't show up one day. The night staff was very dismissive when we complained.

Staff friendly and helpful enough..gave us maps and explained routes on the metro to where we wanted to go. The 'hotel' is actually 2/3 floors on a building shared with others. The sign out front is very small. The rooms were horrible. Terrible stagnant water smell smell coming from who knows where. Old fittings, a towel rack that falls apart, a toilet with 1ft. clearance in front of it and a shower designed for what seems to be a child..not even a place to rest your soap in the shower!! No hand towels were provided and the towels were very hard and made of an unusual material. There was no local temperature control and the units were switched off. We opened the window to get some cool breeze in and to get out the smell. The noise of drunk partiers and police sirens was so much we had to decide between sleeping with the smell and heat or using ear plugs..we chose the earplugs. There are about 7 channels on the tv, none of which are in english. To get to the room we had to use a prehistoric lift smothered in dust and cobweb.

More then modest entrance (with a small table on building's wall), but after that... Small but clean, nice, well equipped rooms, good service (it is really a hotel, do not hesitate). The location is ideal - four short blocks from Termini central station. Next day we went with our luggage to take our car (at Termini) by feet - it is so close. Via Palestro street itself is not noisy and full of trattorias, restourants and other food services right near the hotel - we were excited and used the opportunity.

Boy were we wrong. On arrival, the check in area was cramped and dirty as was the lift up to our floor. It felt like something out of a 1980's horror film. As we walked along the corridor it got slightly better but as we entered the room our hearts sank. The room was small, dark , noisy and smelly. The bed was so very uncomfortable and the blankets were not clean. Trying to get to sleep was a nightmare as you couldn't help but think of all the other guests who had used the bedding over the years, without it being washed in between - that's how it felt. However, worse was still to come...there was some noise from the rooms above ours which we thought would settle down shortly. However when 3 o'clock came, we realised that the chance of sleep that night was going to be slim. We decided the following day that we could not endure it for another two nights and booked into the hotel imperiale, which was lovely. However, when we came to check out, the manager was really funny with us and I actually felt very threatened. I kept asking how much I needed to pay, but he was unhappy about us leaving and wouldn't give me a straight answer. We will never go back there again. I have stayed in many hostels before and none of them have had such poor standars as this one. yuk.

It is also very well located.

We had been traveling through Italy for about a week and stayed at similarly-priced places throughout Italy, including in other large cities such as Venice and Florence. However, what we saw at this hotel was WAAAY below avearge. The room was dark and hot, facing the inside of the building. When we opened the windows, a bunch of mosquitoes flew in. When we called the concierge to ask about how to turn on the A/C, we were told that it doesn't work and WILL NOT be fixed. The room had a bad smell about it, resembling a swamp or possibly a sewage drain. The walls were covered with mosquitoe guts killed by similarly unhappy guests, I am sure. The surprise came every morning when I discovered that my leg had bites all over--not mosquito bites but some other type. We realized that these were probably bed bug bites. THe staff was rude and unfriently. The breakfast was mediocre--croissants, yogurt, coffee and juice--far worse than at any hotel we stayed at in Italy.
