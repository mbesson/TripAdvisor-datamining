Getting to the hotel from Berlin's Schonefeld airport takes around 50 minutes on the S and U Bahn train system. When you arrive at Schonefeld walk 400 meters to the station, it's there where you can purchase a ticket. The ticket price is \u20ac3, you need to ensure you get a zone ABC ticket. The train to Friedrichstrasse takes around 20 minutes, change here to an S Bahn train to Anhalter Banhof, the hotel is 50 meters from the station exit. The rooms in all Suite Hotels are exactly the same. Free WIFI and Movies are available although the login system for the WIFI is painful. The rooms are large and have both a bath and shower, although sometimes it feels like your in the cabin of a ship! The only negative points on the rooms is the lack of air conditioning, this means leaving the window open and subjecting yourself to the regular noise from behind the hotel ( it can be super loud on the weekend). The hotel has a very basic gym, a restaurant and bar. Breakfast is \u20ac12 and is not worth it. Free muffins and coffee/tea are available in the mornings which is a nice touch. The hotels location is perfect for exploring Berlin. The Topography of Terror ( a must visit ) is 5 minutes walk add another few minutes and you'll be at Checkpoint Charlie. For shopping and eating head to Potsdamer Platz, everything you need is in this area, shops,restaurants and bars!

They have an ash tray right outside the front door for smokers, which you have to walk through all the smoke to get into the hotel. Even though I booked this hotel in May and I am an AClub member, we were given room 431, a disable room with 2 single beds, 1 chair and not a very functional bathroom. We went straight down to the reception to see if we could changes rooms and they said they were full and to come back down tomorrow morning before 11 am and they would change rooms for us. Next morning we packed our bags and went down at 9 am and they said that we could not change rooms because they were fully booked and everybody checking on that day was families and they needed all the double rooms. So that meant that my wife and I were spending our wedding anniversary in separate beds. On the third night we finally changed rooms to 512, this was much better, 2 chairs so 2 people could sit down. The rooms were large, modern, clean and well set up. It had a large flat screen TV with movies and internet, telephone with free national calls, microwave, fridge, and kettle. This hotel is very well set up for the internet, if you have your own computer or you can use the ones in the lobby or on your TV all for free. The lifts seemed to take forever and were not handling the amount of guess staying at the hotel. We did not eat breakfast there, because we thought 13 euros was bit much and there are plenty of places to eat close by. We had a nice drink in the bar after getting back after the New Year\u2019s celebrations.

There were English channels on the tv and a good selection of free English movies (as well as several other languages). Two plump pillows each on the bed, good soundproofing and blinds at the windows complete the upside. On the downside, the bed was the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in - the mattress was so hard I woke up several times during the night (we both did, and the other half usually sleeps anywhere!). One thing to bear in mind when visiting - the little kitchenette is useful, however only two paper cups are provided, no plates, spoons, knives or forks so if you plan a little room-based picnic be sure to take your own.

It also has free wi-fi, and free cable access to the internet as well. Staff were consistently helpful, but Sebastian on the front desk/bar was a godsend - he really helped us understand the Berlin S and U-bahn system, a few times being able to tell us of easier routes. And always with a smile and a twinkle in his eye, regardless of the time or day! The only really downside was the lack of an evening hotel restaurant, but this was easily overcome with the variety of local restaurants - especially the Italian on the corner. The cafe/bar across the road was excellent for breakfast (and better value) Berlin itself was great - what you would expect of an historic cosmopolitan city. Day trips to Dresden and Leipzig are all manageable and relatively cheap on the very efficient and clean German Rail network. Germans seem to be a very misunderstood people - they do have a sense of Humor, and providing you spend a little energy to speak in German, the rewards are well worth it.

This Hotel is basically what you would expect of a \"Novotel\", but, the rooms are what you would expect of a \"Suite\" hotel. Good points about the hotel: - It is a nice sized room - Very Modern rooms and lobby - Clean Hotel - Comfortable Hotel - Has a mini-fridge in the room - Nice breakfast - The location is excellent. It was convenient that we had a station for the S bahn one minute away from the Hotel. A few bad points are: - When we arrived the spare duvet and pillow did not have cases and there was supposed to be two extra duvets and pillows but there was only one and it took a while for these to arrive. - The air conditioning in the rooms don't work very well, our room got very hot. Tips: -If you get an ABC welcome card/train ticket (we got our tickets for 72 hours) you have unlimited travel for on the buses and trains. We found that this was vital by the third day because we used it so much. - There is an Aldi supermarket which is a 2 minute walk away. Buy snacks and drinks there and put them in your mini-fridge, it is cheaper than the snacks in the hotel. - Some attractions in Berlin you have to book as far up to a week in advance. If there is anything you wish to do, research when you have to book first. - Hit the popular places, museums and attractions early in the morning, come back to the Hotel for a rest for an hour or to, then go shopping. We found that we could do a lol more things in Berlin when we did this for the first 2 days. - Do not go to the Legoland discovery center if your child is older than 8. We visited it and it cost us 50 euros to go in. We did and we felt like it was a waste of money for what we paid for. It is basically only little play areas and two rides. Don't go if you are older then 8 or if your child is really into Lego.

The suite in this obviously new and modern hotel was spacious with a large double bed, a comfortable sofa bed, a large table / desk with a couple of chairs, two separate wardrobe areas and a third area with shelves and a safe . The toilet (with hand basin) was separate to the main bathroom, which featured a full size basin, a huge bath with a shower attachment for washing hair etc and a separate shower cubicle. Toiletries such as shower gel, shower cap etc were provided as was a small fridge, a kettle and a microwave together with a selection of teabags and coffee sachets. Unlike a lot of hotels, the level of lighting was good making it possible to read comfortably late at night. The wall mounted flat screen TV could also apparently be used to access the internet but unfortunately the instructions provided for using the Suite Box were cursory and I could not work out which button on the mini keyboard was the enter/return one. Fortunately, a couple of PCs, with normal keyboards, were also provided in the foyer, making it possible to get a short internet fix each day. There was generally a lack of information about both the room and hotel services - things like the timing for breakfast, the location of the laundry room, the fact that the room had a pull out room divider etc etc The hotel was in an easy to get to location, being right next to the Anhalter Bahnhof station on the S Bahn system and only one S Bahn stop (or a short bus ride) from Potsdammer Platz and with easy access to all other parts of the city. There were also restaurants and supermarkets only a few minutes walk away. My room was at the back of the building and the downside to this was the level of noise from people visiting the building next door in the evenings and also early in the morning on the day when the bins were emptied, meaning disturbed sleep . Whilst I was generally happy with the hotel, some aspects of the housekeeping were sloppy, which you do not expect in a German hotel. The shower gel in the shower cubicle was allowed to become totally empty so that I had to drip across the bathoom to find something else with which to wash and a couple of the light bulbs were not working and were not replaced.

No plates or utensils are available. I had trouble finding paper plates and plastic utensils in the neighborhood, even though there are two discount supermarkets within two blocks. Novotel has designed a room which makes very efficient use of a lot of space, e.g. there is a room divider that can separate the sleeping and working area. There are separate rooms for the toilet with washbasin (at the room entrance) and the bathing area which included a shower, washbasin and separate bathtub (opposite the sleeping area). The bathing area has only swinging double bar style doors. The hotel staff were cordial but did not go out of their way to help.

Another time they looked up a telephone number number of the place where I wanted to get opening times but did not offer to call for me. I stood at the desk and tried to reach the number using my American cell phone and got a recording in German. I called again and handed it to the clerk who missed the message. Only then did he call on the hotel phone. The hotel is about a 4 block walk to Potsdamer Platz but there is a subway entrance to Berlins outstanding public transportation system right on the corner.

A few other features that were unique are free four hour car loans (a 400 Euro damage deposit is required), free Thursday neck massages for guests staying more than a certain number of days etc. This hotel would be ideal if your are coming to Berlin for business, given the workspace and internet.

In addition, the personnel never greeted me personally, which I am accustomed to by other Novotel locations, consequently, it was a somewhat impersonal experience.

Breakfast is pricey, but they provide free coffee (kaffee), tea (tee), and some type of pastry in the lobby. The only downside (and this is a very American criticism) is that they do not allow the air conditioning to run if the temperature falls below 20 degrees Celsius. If you're here during a transitional season, that means the A/C can run during the day, but will shut off at night. This can cause some uncomfortably hot sleep and because our room overlooked a noisy road, it was unpleasant to sleep with the windows open.

Firstly the location is excellent. Where we were staying (Winters Hotel) was basically on-top of the monuments, the problem was there wasn't anything else around it. This hotel however has two supermarkets, a pharmacy, a bar & a restaurant within 100m's of it. This made life a lot more pleasant in the evenings when we just wanted to pop out to eat & hit the sack. To make things even better, the hotel checked us in immediately (9am) so we could get rid of our luggage & relax. The room is well appointed with TV, free internet, mini-bar fridge and more. The TV/internet systems are connected so you can use the TV if you want for web surfing. The toilet/shower section feels similar to those in a caravan or plane. It's a large fiberglass-style section that (for lack of a better explanation) has been 'added' to the room. In saying that it was extremely clean and had a huge shower & bath in it, you will forget it's not tiled when you sit in a bath that size. The only reason I mention this at all is it may not suite some people, but as I said it is so clean & spacious I thought it was great. There are also 2x computers with printers in the lobby for free use. The only thing we didn't like was the doors to the bathroom aren't solid, but don't worry they are for the toilet.

Arrival: we were welcomed as if it was a favor they were doing to us. 2. At check in: despite having PAID for a non-smoking room, we were given a smoking room. Quoting the receptionist: \" No, that's not how it works. You WISHED for a non-smoking room, but we don't have it. So now, deal with it.\" I was shocked and speechless. I've PAID for a non smoking room - if you told me you didn't have it, i would have stayed in another place. Besides, it was after 10pm, we were tired and still needed to have dinner. 3. First room: The room was stinking - not only like cigarettes, but also like rotten, there were hairs in the towels, horrible. 4. We went back to the reception. After arguing for another half an hour, finally she said that the next day we could change. We opened all the windows, but the smell wouldn't go away. None of us could sleep. 5. I would expect that after such occurrences they would simply change our luggage to a clean, non stinking room. Again, it was only my wish. So we went down to confirm the approach - but that was not in their scope. So we went to pick our luggage and... surprise - we had to wait half an hour for the lady to come around and store our luggage - after all, in her eyes she was mercifully doing us a favor. 6. The next room was not stinking, but was not clean neither. The two glasses in the toilet were dirty from the previous person (and remained like this for the entire stay); hairs around the place, they did not clear properly any of the 2 nights we stayed in the non-smoking room. so... in short: service: don't expect any - be pleased that you are allowed to stay there (unbelievable) cleanliness: ops... don't expect it. location: not my favorite spot in Berlin, but it's not the worse - you have an S-bahn station at your doorstep. rooms: ugly, small, dirty Notes: - They claim to have a hair dryer in the room.

Everything about it suited us -- location, condition, decor, service. As others have commented, the hotel seems very new, and the rooms are large, colorful, and nicely decorated. The bathrooms are great -- the toilet is in a separate enclosed area from the shower and bathtub (yes, there are both -- and they are separate and large), which is convenient for a large group staying in one room. Parking is available for 10 euros a day -- which includes in and out privileges. The parking lot is shared with the nearby Accor Hotels (Etap and Ibis). I agree with the other commenters that the breakfast is the worst part of the experience. We only tried it once, and we wouldn't recommend it. The breakfast area has a sterile, hospital-canteen look, and much of the food does come in little plastic containers. I think they have given into pressure and offered some items \"out in the open,\" such as powdered scrambled eggs served out of a warming tray, but it seems like an afterthought. It's better to go next door to the Ibis, which has a 10 Euro breakfast buffet, or the Cafe Stresemann across the street, which has good breakfast options and a charming, interwar German atmosphere. The location of this hotel can't be beat. It is a short walk to the section of the wall still standing (near Checkpoint Charlie), the Wall Museum, Potsdamer Platz, and even Unter Den Linden is an easy walk. The Anhalter Banhof S station is across the street, and the U-bahn Kochstrasse is also very close. Buses M-41 and M-29 also pass right by the hotel.

When I arrived I was greeted by a nice staff however she told me that they only had a room with one bed and a sofa that I could put a pillow on and sleep. The only two bed room was a handicap bedroom and it didn't really have a shower because it is a shower head and a curtain, there is no shower wall, the water goes on the bathroom floor. The bathroom has holes in the door so you can see... and smell.. everything that people are doing inside the bathroom. The worst part is that for the second ''bed'' that they give you .. they gave me a bag with sheets and pillows so that I can make the bed myself. Even at the hostel I stayed at they made the beds for me, what kind of service is that? When I get to the room I review their different rooms and the room they originally told me about was not just a sofa, it was a sofa BED.. something she told me it was not. I asked but she said no, its just a sofa for the second person in the room. I called 5 minutes after I checked in to switch rooms and they said it was not possible anymore and seemed pretty annoyed by my call. I am not sure what happed in 5 minutes but Im confident that no one checked in becuase the hotel was dead.. ehh at least its clean, but service isnt good at all and breakfast is \u20ac13 and internet is \u20ac7 per half hour.

The hotel itself is located on a street with several other Accor Hotels. The Suitehotel is located directly accross the road fron the Anhalstr Str. U-bahn station so access is excellent.

The toilet is separate from the bathroom, which had both bath and separate shower cubicle. There was also a kettle with tea/coffee and a microwave oven - handy if you are on a tight budget. We'd got a triple room for the same price when we booked which gave us quite a lot of extra space I expect. We only tried the bar in the hotel (which can be recommended!) and did not eat there. The menu looked alright but we fancied something a little more 'local' out in the city. Breakfast is pricey. They do an all you can eat buffet for 12 Euros. Needless to say we skipped this! There is actually a bar/cafe directly accross the street which sells set breakfast at 8 Euros and if you venture into town you can get some impressively large piles of food and a coffee for about the same, and there are many cheaper options.

It is part of an almost entire street full of Accor Hotel brands. From the budget option Etap to IBIS and then the Suitehotel (being the most \u201cupmarket\u201d one). The room was booked directly with the hotel at the very good rate of \u20ac80/night including breakfast (or what passes as breakfast at the hotel but more about that later). I was a bit taken aback when the receptionist told me \u201cat the Suitehotel you always pay in advance\u201d. Well as customer I tend to pay once I received the appropriate service. That\u2019s why normally hotels take an imprint of you credit card but the Suitehotel insists on full payment upfront. Strange tactics but I guess they are catering to the lower end of the market\u2026. The room itself was large(ish) containing a desk, sofa and bed. In addition it had a fridge (normal mini bar size), microwave and sink. I have to admit that I failed to see anything that resembled any hotel suite I have ever stayed in but I guess for \u20ac80 one can\u2019t expect too much. The strangest part of the room was the prefabricated plastic pod in the room that contained the bathroom, toilet and kitchen element. It was something straight of outer space. The plasticky walls made the whole thing feel cheap. Not a good design. The kitchen element was lacking any plates or cutlery and there was no suggestion as to where you could get it. The bed was large but unfortunately covered in nylon bed linen. There is no excuse these days for nylon, ever! The biggest let down with regard to the room however was the air-conditioning. Despite being set to the lowest temperature it failed to cool the room to an adequate level. My suspicion is that this is just a fan rather than aircon system. During my stay it was 32c in Berlin so aircon was a must. Opening the windows at night was not an option either as there is a bar/nightclub entrance at the back of the hotel with people causing all sorts of noise all night long. As I mentioned breakfast was included in the rate and what the Suitehotel tries to pass off as breakfast was a complete mess. They are obviously trying to be innovative but it doesn\u2019t work so food comes in miniscule prepared plastic pots containing odd combinations like chorizo with pepper salad etc. You end up with a mountain of plastic refuse and still feel hungry. The breakfast area is also far too small to cater for the number of hotel guest so trying to get a seat was a nightmare. Usually breakfast in German hotels is great but this was very unsatisfactory. Having said all that the hotel is very cheap, clean and well linked by public transport.

Hotel was really good quality for the price. I booked 3 weekend package rooms which were really cheap (\u00a360 per night for the room). When we turned up at the hotel they wanted an extra E10 each night for a 4th person supplement. This was despite the fact that I had phoned the hotel to confirm that i would not be charged any more when we arrived. Luckily, after a bit of arguing the hotel agreed not to charge me any extra for these rooms as i had already paid in full. Unfortunately, I had also booked another room on a more expensive rate (as they had run out of cheap rooms) which i paid for at the end of our stay. The hotel again wanted to charge me an extra E10 per night for the 4th person but this time they would not back down and charged me. This was despite me having phoned up to confirm I wouldnt be charged! This was very disappointing. However, the rooms were still cheap and therefore we didn't let it affect our holiday. Just beware if you are thinking of booking this hotel that there is supposed to be a 4th person supplement. The rooms were massive with 1 double, a couch bed and a pull out bed. There was also a pull out divider in the middle of the room to seperate the sleeping areas. The bar area of the hotel was nice and beer was on tap 24 hours. it is located opposite Anhalter Bahnhof U station and is 10 mins walk to Potsdamer Platz - so a very central and handy location. A word of warning, DO NOT go to the Stresseman cafe opposite the hotel entrance. We waited 30 mins to be asked what we wanted to drink and another hour before food started to arrive. After 90 mins we were still missing 2 drinks and most of our food so we left. The staff seemed surprised at our decision to leave! Unbelievable. Oh, and the food that did arrive was rubbish. There is a little kebab shop called Bistro ?something? diagonally across the road from the hotel. They did really nice kebabs, burgers, etc. If you want to do something a bit different go to Spindler & Klatt restaurant / bar. You get your food served on beds whilst listening to cool tunes. Theres also an outdoor bar overlooking the river with more beds. And dont worry if it gets a little cold, the staff give you blankets. Its similar to Superclub in Amsterdam (but not quite as good).

Berlin is also very flat so its easy to walk to most places - 5-10 mins walk from Potsdamer Platz, 20 mins from Brandenburg Gate, 10-15 mins Checkpoint Charlie.", "Date": "October 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cMinimalist but Fun\u201d", "Author": "__", "ReviewID": "UR5968757", "Content": "This was a fun hotel in a convenient location.

Congratulations to all involved. Located 500m from Potsdamerplatz, across the road from the U-Bahn Anhalterstr. HUGE room, incredibly clean and modern, great design concept - have already recommended this hotel to eveyone I know who is heading to Berlin. I paid 70 Euros pn through internet; rate the rack rate is around E100 which for what you get is still good value. Could not believe my luck on this one. Possibly the best hotel I have stayed in in Europe. I was one but the room could easily sleep 4 or 5 without feeling crowded. It was like a palace after the shoebox I had in Amsterdam. If in doubt, look no further. Will definitely stay here again.

The spacious well-designed rooms, the bathroom, the staff, the value, the coffee, the whole concept, are all excellent and we were immediate converts until we went to bed.
