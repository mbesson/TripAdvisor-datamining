We had beautiful views over the bosphorus and lived in the dining facilities (breakfast, afternoon snack and dinner) which provided a great variety of food, drinks and turkish delights. My son is a picky eater and we would order a burger from room service for dinner and have it delivered to the club dining area. So we eat with him, there is an amazing number of nuts in food in turkey. So if your children have nut allergies you need to be careful. I had no problems with taxis but loved walking down the hill to the tram which would take you well into the old city for 2 trl. We did that our first afternoon to visit the spice market, walked back over the galata bridge, ogled all the fish restaurants underneath, caught funicular (3 trl) up the hill (entrance is just over bridge on left) up to istikal st which is famous walking st. Bought tickets at tram for few trl and caught back up to taksim square as were tired. Then wandered back to the ritz thru the park. We used the pool which was large and facilities which were fine but not nearly as nice as the four seasons bosphorous. Also down the hill were ferries which are easy and fun to ride around between asia and old town. So would agree that there was not a lot of restaurants close to the ritz but if you can stay at the club levels, you can just relax in the hotel without having to run out. It was great for the family, baris the concierge was very helpful. Also dolmabache palace is just at bottom of the hill as well...

The good things: The rooms are small but very nice with wonderful finishings in the bathrooms. The spa is incredible and the pool indoor pool unbelievable to say the least. My daughter and I used it every day after sightseeing and were usually the only ones there. We had wonderful facials and massages at the spa and the staff there were incredible. Breakfast was very good and by the end of our stay, one server had our hot breakfast beverages ready for us without asking. The bad thing: Locaion is a bit rough but magnified by the unethical cabbies in the \"old town\". We went into the old town every day and didn't think it would be a big deal as it's very close and just up the river. The first day we realized there was a problem when a taxi driver refused to take us back to the Ritz because of a \"football\" game... we'd hear this again and again for various reasons. We finally found the the train and took it back, walking up the hill to the hotel. Not a big deal during daylight but wouldn't want to do it at night. We got another taxi at the hotel (always good and ethical when you get them at the hotel) into town for a show... after the show my 10 year old daughter and I were told by the taxi driver that he had to drop us off a very long, dark block away from the hotel due to a \"football\" game (which didn't exist). I was quite angry and told him there wasn't a game and how dare he drop a woman and her 10 year old daughter off at night a deserted block from the hotel. He told me he'd watch me go in. Then I paid him, he took the money for a moment and then returned it to me saying it was ripped. I was so angry I found anther bill for him and left. The next night we had the same experience from the old time.... he couldn't drop us off at the hotel b/c a football game and then tried to change bills because the one I gave him was ripped. This is when I really understood this crooked game and told him take it or leave it as I didn't want his counterfiet money. He then proceeded to check out the bill he tried to slip to me in the light of his internal cab light as he thought it must look really fake for an American to notice. We then determined we couldn't go into the old town at night and would always come back via train before dark as the long empty block you have to walk past isn't a place you want to walk by as a mother with your daughter at night. Bottom line, if you are with your husband/boyfriend the walk back up from the train isn't a big deal but if you are alone as a woman or with your children and want to explore the old town don't stay here, stay in the old town at the Four Seasons. It's really a shame that Istanbul law enforcement hasn't done anything about these corrupt taxi drivers, there are even signs when you leave certain shows warning you about them. We currently live in Dubai and have traveled all over the world and have not ever seen anything so blatant and corrupt... probably because I was an American woman alone with her 10 year old daughter. I won't return to Istanbul for that reason alone there are plenty of other wonderful places to visit in the world.

First of all, if you want four star service and four star surroundings, I would recommend the Four seasons on the Bosporus or the four seasons in the old city. The ritz is located across the bridge in taksim square and the hotel itself is located on the top of a small hill overlooking a football stadium. If you would like to stroll out the door and into the aya Sofia then look elsewhere. There is a car dealership downstairs and that's about it for places to stroll to. But the service is typical ritz plus something extra, the rooms are large and well appointed and there is an endless supply of turkish delight in the lobby. The staff were very warm and particular kind to our 2 year old son, lavishing him with snacks and toys as well as hugs and pats on the head. There is a gym and indoor swimming pool (like most indoor swimming pools with low ceilings, it appears better in photos than in reality). There is a lounge downstairs and a formal and informal restaurant upstairs. The old city is a 15 minute drive across the bridge, but depending on traffic, this can extend to 30 min or more. There is also a tram system, but you have to make your way down the hill and cross some pedestrian unfriendly roads to get to the station which was not an option with a toddler and a stroller. Overall, the ritz is a great hotel but given the superior locations of other similarly nice and pricey hotels, I would give it a pass next time to try out one of the 2 four seasons.

Every member of the staff was courteous and attentive, without being overbearing or snobby, a rare quality in a hotel chain that caters to a specific clientele. We were told that there are no rooms, other than a presidential suite, that face the old town. We opted for a corner room that faced the Bosphorus (full Bosphorus), which was fine. Our room could have used a refurbishment as some of the furniture and carpet looked past its useful life. That being said, however, the shower was the best one I have encountered bar none. Whatever the opposite of a water-saver shower head is, this hotel has it. Hold on! The spa was lovely, although being completely underground makes lying on a beach chair around the pool feel a bit strange. The only meal we ate was the buffet breakfast and what I can say is \"bacon!\" It was excellent, but after two weeks in Turkey, I essentially ate all of the bacon available at this hotel. I would stay here again. The walk to Taksim is an uphill affair, past a somewhat dodgy encampment. We never felt unsafe but were taken off guard with people sleeping in a park (behind a fence, so don't fret when you read this). The hotel could have done a better job catering to the tourist who likes to discover things on foot rather than just for those who cab it everywhere. We walked back and forth to Taksim several times, which you will do considering every taxicab will take you for a ride, except those you hail from inside the hotel compound directly.

The hotel has two swimming pools. There is a large indoor pool surrounded by loungers and a large hot tub.

First of all the city is the best I have ever visited , after Paris of course. It's architecture is well integrated with modernism. As for the hotel, what can I say , ? It was surely an out of the world experience. The building however is only half hotel and the top most floors are all residential. The scintillating tinted windows and the height of the structure will surely grab your attention in taksim square. It is located at walking distance from the hyatt and on the banks of the bospherous , a piece of property every Turkish craves for and a view every traveller strives to soak in . Surely a feast for the eyes. The interior are well decorated and the receptionist and the sentinel are warm and friendly. They do everything in your favour to make you feel home. The rooms with club access are great with breath taking views of the river. As for the club lounge, there is plenty to eat and drink and I went ballistic at the gamut of pastries and sweets , which included the famous bakhlawa. The breakfast is spectacular and there's a large spread every morning from I guess 7 to 11 a.m. the spa is said to be exquisite and relaxing and has facilities like steam ..... Turkish bath or hamam as they call it. My parents gave it a thumbs up and of all the thing I was ALLOWED to do, I found the swimming pool the winner. In the reception you will find a few bowls of sweetened marshmallows, they call it something but I can't recollect it. From the 20 foot ceilings to the cobbler in the lobby to the various carpet shops in the basement to the food , the experience truly felt like a royal treat.

The Four Seasons is the perfect location for the major tourist sites and being able to walk out the door and reach them in 10 minutes was wonderful.

Rumelli offered great views and was practically deserted when we were there. Fair warning...there's a lot of climbing involved and there are no handrails but the rewards were worth it. Bebek was fine, nothing special, a few boutiques and stores. Ortakoy was more interesting and we had a lovely lunch right on the water at the House Cafe.

A couple of times we just hung out for a few hours at the beautiful indoor pool, which was a nice treat and very relaxing. Apparently it is the largest indoor pool in Istanbul. The hotel gym was also very nice. As soon as I stepped on the treadmill one of the trainers there came over and offered me some water. After I finshed I had the whole gym to myself. As in most non-North American countries the gym was not as well equipped as a big hotel gym, but it was certainly one of the best European hotel gyms I have seen, with newer Techno gym treadmills and Technogym weight machines, plus lots fo free weights and ample room. This was a pleasant surprise as many Euro hotel gyms are tiny and have really old equipment. Ocassionally we heard the very loud football game from the stadium outside our window, but it was not a big deal. It was also fun to get a birds eye view of the game.. We also had a Heli-Pad outside our room and it was fun to see the helicopters come so close to our window. The views from all the of the rooms and restaurants are spectacular. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming for business or for a holiday. It is elegant and quiet with lovely service. As an additional tip, we have read that you can get ripped off by taxi drivers. This is true. We avoided this by carrying lots of small change and making sure the meter was always on and stayed on.

The hospitality is both generous and graciously offered - dishes of turkish delight abound, apple tea is offered in the lobby and nothing is too much trouble for the charming staff. Service was first class and everything was spotless and beautifully maintained. Our room, though not decorated to our taste, was comfortable if a little full of large pieces of furniture. Staff were universally helpful and the buffet breakfast excellent. What lets the RC down primarily is the location. Part of a commercial development on a traffic island, walking anywhere from the hotel is taxing. Walking to Taksim Square is not easy because of several busy road junctions to negotiate, high kerbstones and a lack of pedestrian crossings. We are agile and confident enough to deal with such situations normally and yet we still felt uncomfortable and apprehensive about crossing these roads, even though Taksim Square was only a fifteen minute walk away at most. The heavy traffic meant that a morning visit to the old city was not really an option for us and we sought advice from the concierge. He recommended the Dolmabahce Palace, just a stone's throw from the hotel and more easily reached by means of a second elevator which offered access to the other side of the hotel and an easier pedestrian route to the Bosphorus. We spent a very enjoyable morning there and were glad we didn't attempt to go downtown at all. Clearly, if it's a first visit to Istanbul, it would be disappointing not to see the main sights. The situation of the Ritz Carlton does not make that easy, for sure and however lovely the views from the sixteenth floor, whatever level of fantastic service you receive and however scrumptious the breakfast, sadly the RC is just in the wrong place.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cWorst Located Luxury Hotel in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "ms321", "ReviewID": "UR68588261", "Content": "We stayed here post-cruise and should have listened to a waiter on the ship who told us not to stay here.

Postivite points.... Restaurants: Apart of our vacation package, we were able to eat the breakfast buffet in the main restaurant. The buffet has a wonderful mix of traditional Turkish, European, and Western cuisine. The wait staff immediately sat us each morning and always offered a variety of teas, coffees, and juices. One evening we had a late dinner in the lobby of the hotel (at the Lobby Bar), and sat and watched the wonderful view of the Bosphorus. Again, the late night menu is very tasty with a variety of \"snacky\" foods (mozzarella sticks, salads, soups), etc. There is also an outside Lounge with heated lamps for the breezy nights. However, only drinks are served here and not food. Spa/Turkish Bath: The hotel offers a full service spa and Turkish Bath. This is a GREAT alternative to have a traditional Turkish Bath in the hotel, but not at one of the many public Turkish baths that are found in and around Istanbul. Two of us tried the Turkish Bath and it was great! I was totally scrubbed down and relaxed by the time my Bath attendant finished. :) Definitely a well deserved treat to try! Staff/Concierge: Very welcoming, friendly, ethusiastic. There was a slight mix-up/miscommunication in the initial rate when we booked the hotel three months prior to our arrival. However, the staff literally did everything possible (with a little help of American Express Travel) to fix the rate. Even when we were going to move to another hotel (nothing personal, but trying to stay within our original budget), they were able to match the rate of the new hotel. Yes, clearly EVERYTHING is negotiable in Turkey. Rooms: We had two rooms on the 9th floor (914 and 915), which were conjoining rooms. This is a perfect set up if you are traveling with a group of 4 or more and/or have two rooms. Room 915 (which was the corner room), was larger than the other room and had an EXCELLENT view of the Bosphorus (see picture attached, as taken from the room view). Points to Consider.... Security at arrival: Upon arriving at the Ritz Carlton Istanbul, all cab drivers (and other vehicles) must be swept for bombs. This was a bit overwhelming at first, but I understand why. You will also go through a metal detector everytime you enter the hotel. Internet/Business Center: I did not bring my laptop along on vacation, but I wish I did! There is free wireless internet in the lobby. However, there is a \"business center\" available, but its 8 Euros per every 15 minutes! Location: The Ritz sits up on a hill above the main Stadium in Istanbul. During our visit, the Soccer team was celebrating its successful Soccer season--and celebrate they did! For two nights in a row, there was a HUGE HUGE HUGE fan celebration, which spilled out from the stadium and into the streets. If you decide to stay at the Ritz-Istanbul, make sure you inquire if there are any major sporting or other events. As this will be a logistical concern on how to get in and out of the hotel. All in all, I had a wonderful time at the Ritz Carlton- Istanbul.

A wonderful experience -- I echo the comments of other reviews with respect to the excellent service, the comfort of the rooms, and the quality of the pool and fitness centre. A couple of things I would point out, however: the hotel is oddly situated. It occupies several floors of a large office building/shopping complex and from the outside is utterly charmless. There is a nice entrance on one side, but it is difficult to reach by car as it is on a long one-way street. From the other side one must enter through this shopping arcade. I had one taxi driver who had never heard of the hotel and got completely lost, even when I provided him with a map. If you don't mind a short walk, the tram is by far the easiest and fastest way to get from the hotel into the old city. The tram stop is about 7 minutes from the back door (through the shopping arcade), and it's a quick and cheap ride. If you're staying at the Ritz Carlton and looking for interesting nightlife, don't miss Istiklal Caddesi (Independence Avenue). It's about 15 minutes away on foot, across Taksim Square, and has countless shops, bars, clubs, and restaurants that are lively into the early hours of the morning. I also took a ferry ride across the Bosphoros which provided great views - but the Asian side was a bit of a letdown. All in all, a great stay, in a great city, in a great hotel.

We stayed at the presidential suite - thanks to the hotel who upgraded us - and it was beaituful. The hotel is located in the european side and close to all the modern amenities while the old town is few minutes way on a taxi ride. It is close to all modern shopping ammenities and less than 5 mins taxi ride to Taksim Square. The hotel facilities are excellent, staff are very friendly and accomodating and while the Club was closed, all the facilities were made available to us in the main restaurant.

Much has been made in previous reviews regarding the location of the hotel in an area far from the historical sights and on top of a hill...bottom line if you are paying the money to stay at this hotel already, the few taxi rides it takes to get you to the historical sites will not break you budget. Taxis are plentiful and not expensive. The Dolamache Palace is just at the bottom of the hill from the hotel (less than a 5 minute walk) as is the historical tramway which you can also take to the historical sites if you so choose, rather than taking taxis.

The Ritz chain is my favorite and is generally the most consistent luxury chain in terms of quality. However, on balance, our experience was only average.

The hotel's location on a steep hill inconvenient to shops or restaurants discourages walking, though inexpensive taxis are easily obtained. We were disconcerted by the high level of security: all vehicles entering the property are searched and everyone must pass through a metal detector and put personal belongings through an x-ray machine before entering the lobby. The interior and our room, on the other hand, were lovely, and the terrace bar was pleasant and welcoming, with a fine view of the Bosphorus far below. The downsides: we paid a premium for a Bosphorus view room, and if you stood wa-a-a-ay over in the corner of the window, you could barely see a sliver of the Bosphorus. More problematic, however, was the presence of a large amusement park directly across the street from our room. It started gearing up at dark, and at 2 a.m. the noise, music and car horns were still keeping us awake. By 3 a.m. the place finally closed, but the result was a sleepless night despite a very comfortable bed.

This is about the ugliest Ritz imaginable. It is a tacky glass tower that is completely out of place in Istanbul. WHAT WAS THE ARCHITECT THINKING?!? If you appreciate fine architecture, the Kempinski or the Four Seasons would suit you better. Another thing to keep in mind - the Ritz is hideously expensive. I have stayed in many hotels of the same calibre as the Ritz, but I can honestly say that the Ritz surpasses them all in terms of the price of hotel services.

We were met with apple tea and treats on arrival and a courtesy tray of goodies was delivered to our room shortly thereafter. They uncomplainingly changed our room when we came back from Cappadocia to find ourselves booked into an unacceptable third floor room overlooking a utility building (we were pleased with both our 6th and 7th floor rooms). The concierge was helpful -- bending over backwards to make good recommendations for our dinners. Breakfasts were included with our room most days (part of a weekend rate package), although the 50 lira per person on the remaining days was high, as was the 10 lira price for a cup of coffee/tea. On the plus side, shoe shines overnight were complimentary and the housekeeping and turndown services efficient. This is not a \"charming\" hotel -- it's a big, modern high rise. It's not within walking distance of most of the historic/cultural sites other than the Dolambechi Palace -- but the cab rides were only 6 to 10 lira and a quick 5-10 minutes to most sites. Walking out of the hotel for an inexpensive breakfast or non-hotel dinner involves hiking up a fairly steep hill in a not terribly nice part of town before reaching the hopping Taksim Square commercial district, where there's a substantial nightlife and loads of interesting places to eat. That said, we would definitely stay here again. The Four Seasons, another of our potential choices, is terrifically located in the Sultanamet area but is a bit more closed in, with smaller rooms and outrageous prices. We did, however, enjoy an afternoon tea break there in there beautifully appointed greenhouse restaurant and it appeared to have the quality and outstanding service you expect from a Four Seasons.
