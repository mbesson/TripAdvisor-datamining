I quickly parked the car in a spot in front of the hotel (it is almost impossible to park in front of the hotel - the closest parking available is one block away). The street is busy and I had to take our luggage to the sidewalk. My parents and my uncle called the reception from the intercom outside to ask for help with the luggage while I looked for a place to park. As I returned, twenty minutes later, they were standing on the sidewalk, freezing cold, with our luggage. No one had come out to help them. I took our luggage to the reception myself and SURPRISE, the ONLY elevator available in the hotel was out of order. So I had to climb two floors carrying our own luggage. The elevator was out of order twice during the week we stayed there and my family had to use the stairs with a lot of difficulty. My mother, once, felt too weak to climb the stairs, so she took a seat close to the front desk while we went upstairs to get our cameras. When we returned, my mother told us she had been told by the front desk to move to another chair because people who were checking in had PRIORITY to use the chairs closest to the front desk. For an Ibis, the hotel is a shame. Very cheap liquid soap in the room, very cheap towels (drenched after one use - and often had to call the front desk to get dry towels because the cleaning staff did not change them), no safe in the room, no extra pillows (it was an exercise of patience to get two extra pillows for each room), heating didn't heat as expected. The overall cleanliness of the rooms also fell below our expectations. The front desk was always unhelpful and seemed to be bothered by the guests who approached them with questions. This was my fourth stay in Madrid, the first one in this hotel. I love the city and never expected such awful service associated with the Ibis chain. Honestly, if you're looking for an inexpensive hotel do a little more research and you will find dozens of other options (some of which are better located than this one). This hotel and its service define very well the difference between being inexpensive and being \"cheap\" with a negative connotation. Really disappointing experience. About it being close to the sights in Madrid, it is a good 20/25 minute walk down a street to get to Puerta del Sol. And to reach the hotel at the end of the day, it's the same 25 minute walk but going up a slope. Seniors may feel discouraged to walk that much. The closest subway station (across the street) neither has escalators nor elevators. So, if you intend to get there by subway, you'll have to exit three or four blocks away from the hotel at a different station. For a tastier (and worthier of your money) breakfast, try the Starbucks around the corner or some other nice pastry shops around the hotel. We had prepaid our whole stay, otherwise we would have definitely gone to another hotel nearby. Do a little more research and do not let your first contact with beautiful Madrid be tainted by the cheap service of this hotel.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loughborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cEverything we needed.\u201d", "Author": "Graham G", "ReviewID": "UR123395281", "Content": "Ibis hotel in Madrid was very good, very nice place and everywhere in Madrid is easily accessible from the location of the hotel.

I planned my vacation since march, of course I didn't know then that the pope will come. We wouldn't have gone!!!! The only \"good\" thing was that the room had a separate bed for my child ( 5 years old), so we slept ok. The elevator is very slow and breakfast is a joke. We literally didn't have what to eat. And we payed extra breakfast for the child. We could have bought him a sandwich, it would have been cheaper. Breakfast: bread, slices of cheese, slices of ham, butter, jam, some fruits, some yogurts, cereals and coffe and juice. That was all!!!! Not even a boiled egg!!!! However, we were very pleased with the front-desk lady, who was very helpful. They don't have food in the hotel, although the sign with 24 hours snacks is very big. Only slices of pizza which is not very good. The explanation was that there are many restaurants around. Actually, there are not so many and they are with specific foods. The good thing is that the hotel is close to the metro station Bilbao, but it's a very big mistake to take the metro from airport. I didn't understand why there was the complaint about the metro... now I do. We had 4 trolleys, we were tired, there were lots of spots where you have to carry them on the stairs!!!! However, if you decide to take the metro, the easiest way is to take line 8 from the airport only until the Mar de Cristal station ( not to the end of the line) and then change to line 4 and go directly to Bilbao. The journey is longer, but is better than change 2 times ( how we did) and it's cheaper: 2,50 instead 3 ( because line 10 it's in another zone). When you exit the airport, at the information point, take maps of the metro and of Madrid ( they are free and you need them). Be careful if you leave from terminal T4S!!!! The check-in is at terminal T4 (RIDICULOUS!!!!!!) and only then take the train from terminal T4 to T4S. If you want to go to Plaza Mayor, the easiest way with the metro is: take line 4 from Bilbao to Alonso Martinez ( one station) , then line 5 to Opera Station. It's the easiest way. If you want the closest El Corte Ingles, take line 1 directly from Bilbao to Sol station.

On previous visits to Madrid, I have stayed in Room Mate properties or ME Madrid -great \"destination\" modern hotels, with postcard views from my window, but at 3 times the price of IBIS. This visit was planned at the last minute, over a European holiday weekend; as a result, the usual places were booked or more than twice the price of my usual bookings. I knew which area(s) I wanted to stay in, and was a little apprehensive about the location (as I had not really \"strayed\" as far north as Bilbao fountains). WOW! A great location in Madrid for this visit - convenient to the areas where I was spending the majority of my time, but far enough from the rowdy holiday crowds I encountered until early in the AM. FOR ME - Huge room. - Location!!!! Everything from shopping (adjacent to Fuencaral, a main retail corridor that goes all the way thru Chueca to Sol), dining (Cafe Colonial across the street for \"traditional Madrid\" breakfasts, with tons of restaurants along same street as hotel), transportation (Metro across the street: from airport, only 2 euro, and FAST) and nightlife (located at the far north of Chueca, where the majority of clubs and bars are located) - PRICE!!!! - added novelty of staying on the street named for the \"matir\" who started the French/Spanish riots of 1808, on the anniversary of the uprising. Kinda neat :) BUT.... - not for a luxury traveller - VERY basic rooms, with futon-like \"matress\" - not for someone wanting Burger King for every meal - not for the evening \"early birds\" (my neighbors were all coming back to their rooms around 10, as I would be going out for dinner!); Madrid can have very late-nights, with people in the streets until 2 or 3 every night. Even though this is more \"residential\", there can still be late-night noise that may disturb children or light-sleepers - it is a little bit of a hike to the \"museum triangle\", Sol, or even Gran Via. Although the Metro is on the corner, the main \"turisitic\" sights are about a 20-30 minute walk. I really love the neighborhood - quiet enough to give the \"feeling\" of Madrid, without as much of the hubub of Gran Via.

It was impossible to find when getting out of the Metro. Admittedly, that\u2019s partly my fault, because I didn\u2019t print the map. But it\u2019s just as much the Ibis Hotels\u2019 fault. The map on one of their official websites did not name the Metro stop, much less mention which of the six exits to choose. When traveling with a now frustrated partner, and you both have heavy luggage that must be carried up a flight and a half of stairs to get out of the station, that\u2019s key information. Worse, one of those six exits is half of a block from the hotel. Few people we asked knew about the hotel, it\u2019s not marked on any of the maps in the Metro station, and when we finally did get near the hotel, its entrance is nearly impossible to find. Unlike most hotels, this hotel has a simple, single door underneath the vertical sign\u2014defiinitely not a typical hotel entrance. Furthermore, the street entrance is one level below the registration desk, and there\u2019s only a stair and a tiny freight elevator to reach it. So I wasn\u2019t exactly a happy traveler when I checked in. But the perky front desk agent got past my admittedly sour attitude, and the room\u2014while basic (especially in contrast to our rooms in Barcelona and Valencia)\u2014was comfortable, had a great bathroom, and had free Internet. After we recovered our happy moods, we went exploring and realized that the hotel was in a good location, about a 20-minute walk from the Gran Via, and another 10- to 15-minute walk from the historic Plaza Mayor, a half of a block from the Metro station, and had a number of restaurants nearby, including a terrific Peruvian restaurant and a local chain restaurant we liked\u2014Vips (whom we learned owns the Starbucks operation in Spain and Portugal). One drawback to the location is that a theater is on the lower levels of the building and there are lots of clubs and restaurants nearby. That results, in turn, in a lot of street noise late at night. We had no difficulty sleeping, but we did hear the noise. Although we didn\u2019t purchase it with our room, we took the ample and reasonably priced breakfast buffet each day. The guests, too, seemed like nice people from all over Europe and the UK. Although the lobby and breakfast area on the entry level seemed a bit compact, the staff had room to store our luggage on the last day of our visit, when we had to check out by noon but were not leaving for the train station until 5 pm. In fact, the staff was always kind and helpful, and provided knowledgeable tourist information about the sites and the Metro system whenever we asked for it.

As other travelers have noted, there are a lot of nice places around the neighborhood (though my tastes were more towards the shopping and fun coffee/dessert shops and restaurants around, rather than the bars because I was six months pregnant at the time we stayed). I _might_ consider staying here again, but only if it were still under $100, and everywhere else in the center of Madrid was still around $200, as it was when we were there in June 2007, but I wouldn\u2019t stay there pregnant again. My chief problem was the fact that, although everything was shiny and relatively new, it was all very, very cheaply constructed. The bed was a piece of plywood supported by two vertical pieces of plywood in an \"X\" configuration (if you know what I mean), so the support was all wrong, with a hard foam pad for a mattress. I found it so intensely uncomfortable that I could hardly sleep unless exhausted; my hips ache just thinking about that bed. I kept asking for pillows, and by the end of our three nights was using a layer of pillows on top of the mattress to try to soften it up. A lot of the pillows, though new, had small holes in their seams that leaked tiny square pieces of foam all over the room. The bathroom was gleaming new, but the shower stall (no tub) was already starting to fall apart due to the general shoddiness of construction: one side of the glass enclosure was starting to fall off at its base, meaning that I was afraid to touch the sides of the shower stall for fear of breaking something. The showerhead was nice, though (three speeds). A sewer smell did tend to waft out of the shower drain in the evenings, unfortunately, since I was spending a lot of my sleepless nights sitting in the bathroom reading so as not to wake my sleeping husband. My last complaint was regarding the floor: there was carpeting, but it was so thin that walking around barefoot, it felt more like walking on the concrete it was undoubtedly covering up, and also the \u201ccarpet\u201d was more like felt fabric; although it was probably regularly vacuumed, it must have really sucked up dirt because my feet got black from walking around in the room barefoot. That was the only cleanliness issue I had with the place. One important good thing: it had really great air conditioning. I have to admit that all these complaints reflect the fact that I\u2019m a pickier traveler than I used to be; when I was 20-25, I\u2019m pretty sure I would have though this was a great place for the money.
