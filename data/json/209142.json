The two rooms shown in their brochure looked much nicer than this one or else the photos were enhanced!!!The hottest the water ever became was warm - not much good for me as I like a hot bath especially in December! The large bed had no headboard, the sheets and blanket were short and there was only one beside table and light. An old TV was on top of an empty old small fridge. The sink was opposite the bed but had no towel rail. The built-in cupboard was so narrow that the hangers had to be turned on an angle to close the door though there was a good safe in there. Wifi was very slow. Breakfast was 0800 to 0900 (no good if an early start was required) and there was very poor selection for breakfast though the service was fast. Everything was done on the cheap especially considering the price and the fact that there was plenty of proper small hotels nearby. Pros: It was clean and warm. The staff was OK.

As outrageous as that may seem, it's a fact of life if you want to visit London. The location is good; we chose it for its price and proximity to the British Library, where one of us was working. It's a short walk to either Russell Square or St. Pancras / King's Cross stations, so we had easy access to many different Tube lines. Our room (#5) was decently decorated; the curtains and bedding seemed relatively new. The room was clean and spacious, had a working hair dryer, tea kettle, TV, and refrigerator. The street is reasonably quiet at night, and the curtains did a good job of blocking light. As mentioned in previous reviews, our bathroom was built into the room, not a separate room. However, it was not a plastic cubicle (I had one of those for a year in an apartment in Munich, so I know my plastic bathroom cubicles). It also was not a shower stall in the middle of the room -- which I've seen in hotels of this class in London. I do have to say it's the only time I've seen linoleum used as the tiling in the shower, but the shower was fairly spacious. My only real complaint was the noise -- whenever the toilet was flushed or the shower was in use, the pipes made a ton of noise, so there was no sleeping in while the other person took a shower. Photos of the bathroom are attached. It may be different in other rooms in the hotel; I can only vouch for our room. Breakfast was decent -- eggs, bacon, sausage, cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee or tea all included in the price of the room. It's a very small breakfast room, and the two large dogs do circulate through the room and beg. This did not seem to bother most guests, who appeared to be dog lovers, but if you are not a dog lover you may have a problem with this (I'm neutral on dogs but felt that given the size of the room, and its use in food service, the dogs should have been kept out).

For:- It is cheap, it's clean, it's very quiet, it feels very safe, the breakfast is plentiful if not exciting, the rooms have all the amenities one would want- including tea & coffee, the beds are comfortable, it's in a brilliant location for tubes and other London transport, the staff, who seem to be members of the same family, are typical of us Brits i.e. polite but fairly distant and business like; they don't know you so they're not immediately going to be your best friend! Against:- It's definitely no frills, there aren't any public rooms like a residents' lounge for example, the amenities in the rooms are a bit 'amateurish' e.g. old style t.v. no satellite or anything like that, hairdrier hanging by it's wire from a hook on the wall, no staff to look after you; it's a simple family run concern. The main thing to comment on is the 'bathroom' that I notice has been a theme running through many reviews. BE UNDER NO ILLUSION you do not get a 'bathroom'. The facilities comprise a pre-formed plastic cubicle about 1.5 mtr square which sits in the corner of your bedroom and has in it a lavatory, small wash basin and miniscule shower tray. The shower hose actually comes from the sink taps. Incidentally, you have to use the shower to fill the kettle as it won't fit under the taps! So you certainly have the faciilities for washing but they are basic and 'cosy' to say the least. As has been said before, you get what you pay for. \u00c2\u00a389 in London is a snip. You expect to have clean, warm facilites and at the Jenkins that's what you get. For one or two nights, it's fine.

Both my husband and I had a lovely time. And got a great night's sleep, every night. I have rarely received such a warm reception at a private hotel anywhere. Sam and Felicity both were gracious, warm, and genuinely helpful. They were extremely knowledgeable and answered all of our questions and offered great local information. The property is from the 19th century and as such all of the rooms are configured differently. I was able to get a good look around and there are a great number of variations. In response to most North American's desires for private bathrooms the owners have nicely converted a small corner of each room into a private bath. I found it spotlessly clean and completely serviceable. Yes, it is small, but certainly provided everything I needed. To note - the suite on the third floor had a very large built in bathroom. If you require that much time/space in there - just book that room. Or just ask for the specifics you want and I'm sure you'll get what you need. We had room 12 on the third floor, facing Cartwright Gardens. It was quiet and perfectly suitable. And very clean. We really appreciated the refrigerator stocked with drinks, the tea kettle with tea service on top, and a safe in the closet for our valuables. Two things you won't get in any UK hotel at this price - or even for a lot more. (Book room 12!) Breakfast was great , ample, and served by the owners: eggs, sausages, bacon, beans, toast, tea or coffee and orange juice. As well there is fresh fruit, yogurt and cereal as well. Climbing the stairs to the room after such a huge meal was hard! If you care to eat outside the hotel I'm sure you'll get all of the above and a chunk of blood pudding and pay 6-8 Pounds each. Felicity has two adorable labrador retrievers (Georgie and Tiggy) who visit every so often. They both wag their tails all the way through breakfast while begging for handouts. You won't find that anywhere else. The location of the hotel can't be beat - it sits between no less than three tube stations: Euston, Kings Cross/St Pancras and Russell Square. Depending on your Underground destination you have access to six different lines within an 8 minute walk. The British Museum is a 20 minute stroll away. And airport transfers are a breeze - Sam can arrange a private taxi to Heathrow for 26 Pounds. For evening entertainment and good grub: O'Neills was a great Irish pub around the corner, and the Lamb is another British classic about 15 mins away. Carluccio's in Brunswick Square has great, outdoor, Italian dining. We will certainly stay here again when we return to London.
