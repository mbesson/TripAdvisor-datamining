We looked at an awful lot of hotels before deciding. Overall, a very average hotel with some good points but also some bad points as well as some points that don\u2019t work in its favour because the hotel don\u2019t make some things clear. I\u2019ll list them in the above manner and I\u2019ll be honest and just let the information help inform any decisions you may be making, First the good: - The hotel was very close to Las Ramblas and very convenient to bars and shops - The hotel was clean, neat and tidy - The staff were not overly friendly but not rude \u2013 they did their job as well as can be expected. - The rooms are air conditioned \u2013 thankfully! - The decor of the hotel downstairs is very nice and well worth a picture or two - Two computers are downstairs free for guests use \u2013 useful for printing out boarding passes (just delete history afterwards) - Don\u2019t be put off too much by any reviews that go on about the area the hotel is in, it\u2019s just off Las Ramblas and like anywhere else in the world while travelling \u2013 be sensible, keep wallets & purses in your pockets and don\u2019t use backpacks. We didn\u2019t have any problems with the street the hotel was on \u2013 it was a lively area and we liked it. - Free water and coffee...(as long as you like it black) Now the bad: - Very noisy, like I say, it\u2019s a very lively area and street with a few bars out the front of the hotel - Rooms are overlooked, so curtains drawn for some privacy and be prepared to be stared at if you\u2019re lying in the back patio area - \u2018Double\u2019 beds are actually two single pushed together and not connected so you\u2019re liable to fall down the middle - Very, very little hanging space \u2013 4 to 5 hangers for the room; we have to leave most of our stuff in the bags and only hang out what we planned to wear the next day Finally, the \u2018things that can\u2019t be classed as bad but still disappoint you a little\u2019.... - Yes, free wi-fi but that doesn\u2019t extend past the first floor so if you\u2019re on the second or third don\u2019t expect to be able to take advantage of this - The free fruit advertised is nothing more than a few apples - No bar in the hotel but they do make that clear - We knew from previous photos that the \u2018pool\u2019 couldn\u2019t really be classed as a pool and that it was nothing more than a paddling pool but we were still disappointed to see how small and narrow it was and that there was rubbish floating in it on a number of days that we were staying. - Yes, free water and coffee but you have to grab the water early in the morning as it does tend to run out and the coffee machine broke down at least once while we stayed Overall, very average and not a 4* hotel by any shape or stretch of the imagination. Not great but by no means bad and didn\u2019t take away from the great holiday we had. If we were visiting Barcelona again we would probably go for a bigger brand 3* hotel to ensure a bigger room, bigger bed and something a bit quieter. My partner has also posted a separate review and has posted up the pics we took so I won\u2019t bother reposting these.

Great location within Las Ramblas slightly towards the marina end which makes it a little quieter and within great walking distance to the scenic water front. Was slightly put off by reports of noise and no sleep so we requested a room on the higher floor when booking. On arrival we received a room on the top floor which was great! The room was clean and spacious with a floor to ceiling window. The temperature gage in the room was useful and we turned it up a little to make it warmer. The bathroom was fabulous with a fantastic powerful rainfall shower! Rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day and towels changed too if you wanted. The free wifi located in the bottom of the hotel along with free water, coffee, tea and apples was a lovely touch and the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel decoration overall was very grand and modern and felt more expensive than what we actually paid! Only thing to be aware of is local pickpockets in the side street of the hotel who tried to make conversation and then proceeded to try and steal my boyfriends phone. Luckily we knew his tricks and pushed him away. However this is typical of Barcelona and the hotel doors could only open by a member of reception or with the door key so I wouldn't say it put me off the hotel at all!

Considering that any decent 4 star that I've been to has one, and also the reputation of the Ramblas (even though personally I found it quite unfounded), the lack of a safe was a let down. Also, we got rooms which faced the street and there was a lot of noise late at night. Try getting rooms that are away from the street if you fancy a quiet night in.

The hotel was extremely easy to find, located just off Las Ramblas next to Drassnes metro station. It is an absolutely fantastic hotel location wise for the metro, for Las Ramblas, for the gothic quarter and for the harbour and we were extremley pleased. We were greeted by friendly staff every time we arrived or left and were helpfully offered storage for our luggage while we waited for the rooms to be serviced and for when we could check in. The downstairs of the hotel is stunning, the staircase sympathetically in keeping with the more modern aspectes of the hotel. The lounging area very pleasant and the H20 area, (a place for free tea, coffee, apples and water) a lovely touch. Though may I suggest leaving a small carton of milk in the fridge for those of your guests who enjoy tea with milk. Our room was very clean, comfortable bedding, beautiful bathroom and plenty of storage and hangers for clothing. However, there were some signs that the room was falling into a little disrepair with some rather large black marks on the wall and quite a big hole in the wall. It was a shame because this would otherwise be a lovely room. The room is also not soundproofed. And that really did irk me. The website clearly states that it is and really, that should be taken off as we could both hear the room next to us moving things around and being quite noisy, as well as the music that it is played around the hotel and the echoing of the large staircase.

Saying that, it was adequate and we had no big problems or anything but as a few more recent reviews have stated, I can't help but feel it's over-hyped. It's certainly not the funky experience a lot of the reviews here seem to suggest, but more like a stay in a reasonable 3-star Travel Lodge or something. I'll list the positives and negatives as we honestly found them: Positives: - It was located just off Las Ramblas and therefore handy to everything. - I wouldn't be put off by the reviews about the dodgy street - we found it quite full of character and the London Bar next door is a great wee spot. Like anywhere in Barcelona, just don't flaunt your belongings or be careless and you should be fine. - For a central location the hotel was pretty quiet at night - we had a room at the back. - Any of the funkiness the hotel has is in the communal area - the black and white staircase is cool and the seated area at the back is fine. I guess it just depends how muchtime you think you'll be spending there - there's no bar in the hotel itself. - The hotel room was clean and did have a nice bathroom. - Free water (when the stocks haven't run out.) - The staff are neither unfriendly or overly-friendly, they do their job and in our experience no more, no less. Negatives: - We booked a double room but got that annoying thing where they've just pushed two singles together - dead on if you're secretly quite happy to put a bit of space between yourself and your partner, annoying if you fancy a bit of romance as you'll end up falling down the middle! - Fee Wifi doesn't reach the upper floors - we were on the 3rd floor and had no signal. - Very little hanging space in the wardrobe - 5 hangers. - The room is very over-looked - you'll pretty much have to keep the curtains closed the whole time while you change etc if you're remotely shy! Then again, book a hotel this central and what can be expected but a blind would have been nice. - The free fruit is a bit over-exaggerated - more like a couple of apples. - The swimming pool isn't really a pool, it's just there for looks. It's tiny and had rubbish floating on it a lot of the time - gave me the creeps! So to sum up, it just depends what you want. If I was booking again and just wanted an adequate room, I'd go with one of the big brand 3-stars that you can get a good bit cheaper.

One detail really annoyed during our stay: Our room was located on the side of Carrer Nou de la Rambla and the noice coming from street was really disturbing. 3 out of 4 nights I woke to hear someone shouting or groups singing on the streets.

A very very very very NICE hotel. I have nothing bad to say about it. Every little detail about this hotel is nice, right down to all of quality fixtures and fittings. We managed to get a deal through the Hotel Onix Liceo website to have FREE breakfast included with our stay, I didn't know what to expect, but this was brilliant again, great food and a great selection of it. There was no expenses spared on the quality of the food neither. The dining room is also very nice. The free water and coffee is great! Free WIFI is great, the receptionists are extremely welcoming and give great help and advice. The location is perfect, 1 min off the centre of La Rambla (the main street in barcelona) I would definately stop again. Oh and we also got a balcony with our room although we never specified this in our booking and that was great. We booked the cheapest room (urban room) and this was brilliant so I cannot not imagine how nice the expensi've rooms would be, our bed was HUGE and very comfy!

However, it turned out to be a disaster. We were told to get a reduced rate by mentioning the reference of the conference at time of booking. And so we did, but when we arrived we were denied this reduced rate because according to the staff we did not make the booking the right way, although we did exactly what the conference organisation told us to do. Moreover, we got the most expensive room in the entire hotel. The staff was very unwilling to listen, they took money from the credit card without asking our permission, and we were forced to pay per night instead of paying at the end of our stay. I would definitely not recommend this hotel for conferences. I would also advise to make absolutely sure beforehand what will be the price, and collect all email communication with the hotel, since I heard many other people complaining about having to pay more than they agreed on beforehand.", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales", "Title": "\u201cprime location, beautiful hotel with very friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "hugibr75", "ReviewID": "UR48233359", "Content": "Barcelona is an amazing City!

From the moment we arrived, the staff were friendly and helpful - more than happy to spend time answering anything you asked. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel so can't comment on that but you're only 2 minutes walk from the Ramblas and all it's cafes anyway. There have been many comments about the street it's situated on and I have to admit that it can seem a bit seedy late at night but I really don't think it's bad enough to be worth making an issue of.

Breakfast included yogurts, cereals, meats, cheeses, fruit, pastries and some hot dishes. All were to a high standard.
