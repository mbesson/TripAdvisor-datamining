It's also 2 minutes from the tube so access to all the London sights is quick and easy. However, the room itself was cramped and smelled stale. The curtains looked very grubby and didn't even fit correctly. The en suite bathroom door barely closed and the shower head attachment was broken. Also, when our neighbours went into their bathroom it sounded like they were in ours!!!! The breakfast was, to say the very least, disappointing. We were expecting bread rolls or croissants. Instead we receieved 2 slices of toast each, cornflakes, a pot of yoghurt and a pot of hot water!! When we asked what the choice of cereal was we were told there was none. Added to this we got only one portion of butter each. All in all this hotel is quite simply a base. You really don't want to spend any time there at all.

Cold breakfasts were very filling, always delivered promptly after ordering. Also very nice about requests for early wakeup calls, which they do themselves, not an automatic machine.

We had already stayed a couple days at another horrible hotel and could not stand it any longer. We asked for a room for the next ten nights, although on such short notice, we were not expecting much. The hostess was so nice and accomodating, she arranged for a car to drive us back to our other hotel to pick up our bags and bring them back to us. In the meantime, she arranged it so we could stay there for ten nights, even though it entailed her moving us a couple of times from room to room. She charged us the rate for the cheapest room in the place every night of our stay, even though there were several nights we stayed in the more expensive rooms. The first night we were in a basement room, which was nice, clean, and comfortable, although there was not much light. The other upstairs rooms are much nicer and larger. Some face the street (which is quiet at night) and others face a private garden. Still, the basement room is not at all \"mildewey\" as some might have you think. One night, the entire hotel was booked up (there are only 6 rooms) so the hostess let my friend and I stay in her own room, while she slept in the front office on a sleeping mat! She charged us half price for that night, too. She was also extremely helpful when it came to any questions we had about the city and things to do there. She arranged for a nice private car to take us to the airport early in the morning, so we didn't have to worry about a thing. The breakfasts were more than generous--better than a continental breakfast at an American hotel--and she delivered them right to our room every morning when we woke up. They consisted of milk, tea or coffee, cereal, toast and jam, orange juice and fresh fruit. It was so much food, my friend and I often ended up saving the fruit and juice for a mid-afternoon snack. One night, around 11:30 or 12:00 we couldn't figure out how to turn on the tv, so we called the front desk. The hostess was so kind to come up in her bathrobe to fix it for us. Now that's service and dedication! As others have noted as \"the only good thing about the hotel,\" the location cannot be beat, especially for the price. This place cost us only slightly more than a hostel would have, and the quality is 100 times better. It's nice safe location, and my friend and I felt completely comfortable walking back from the shops/restaurants at night. There are alot of great shops and ethnic restaurants along the few blcoks between the hotel and the tube station. And on the weekends, Portobello Market is literally in your front yard. All in all this is a really great budget hotel. The service, quality, and location cannot be beat for the price. It is great for anyone who is looking for a nice, quaint, comfortable hotel and doesn't care about having an excessively luxurious room. (Hopefully people don't travel all the way from London to stay in their hotel rooms anyway).
