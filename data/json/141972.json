She was such a fun and enjoyable young lady for the students and adults that were there. She made this stay so much better! The breakfast was okay, the pool was small, but the location was very good since it was close to major streets and highways.

It looks very well worn. Wireless internet worked good, but the cable TV only had 24 channels and many were fuzzy. The window in my room did not close properly so you could hear highway noise, and the air conditioning worked, but was noisy. The floor was uneven and had squeaks in it. No fire sprinklers, but it did have smoke detectors. The bathroom has a very large counter and was bigger than in most hotels. The bed was older, but I slept well. There is a Subway restaurant attached to the hotel and an Arby\u2019s across the street. Interstate access is excellent to I-70. The hotel really needs a gut rehab, but it will do for a quick nights stay. Checkin was quick and easy. Breakfast was acceptable with cereal, toast, fruit and waffles you can make yourself. The pool was clean. I paid $65 with tax, which seemed high for what you get.

Facility: The neighborhood is questionable. There were holes in the walls. The side doors remained unlocked throughout the night. Every door in the place did not fit the dooframe properly. The rooms are old and worn. The fixtures were old and rusty. The water tastes bad. There were no safety or fire exit information in the rooms. The TVs did not work at all. Most of the other people we were with made the same comment. All TVs had blurry pictures. The breakfast area was crowded and made it difficult just to even get a cup of coffee. The only pro on the rooms was that the mattresses were new and I saw no bugs. Staff: The manager Eldon was extremely rude. He does not seem to understand the concept of customer orientation.His going-in position is that you are lying and wrong and there is nothing he can do. And he acts accordingly. Our toilet overflowed in the evening and so the night manager Alberta gave us a suite (the suites are nicer, but not by much). Alberta was very nice. Too bad Eldon gave her a hard time about her decision to move us to a suite. But it was the facility's only saving grace. We overpaid because we were with a group with a set rate. Eldon tried to charge us extra for having 2 children in the room with us. This hotel was not worth the $99/night we paid nor the advertised price of $68/night. I would not recommend this hotel. I heard rumor that they are knocking it down and building something else. I'm not sure the neighborhood can sustain anything better.", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas TX", "Title": "\u201cGo elsewhere - No housekeeping service provided after 2nd night\u201d", "Author": "pkeese", "ReviewID": "UR12553255", "Content": "I arrived on Friday evening; on Sunday, I left my room shortly after 12noon and was gone until shortly after 6pm.

I really didn't think it was that bad for $60. We stayed here as a last-minute decision and got what we paid for, a bed to sleep in and a quick breakfast in the morning. Our room was clean, you can tell they washed the sheets and vacuumed. The entire building doesn't smell very good, but I think it's because they allow smoking in some rooms. The toliet in our room kept running because the chain was too short... my husband just happens to be Mr. Fix-it so that wasn't really a big deal. We had a fabulous view of the satellite dish and air conditioning unit out our window. That actually made us laugh... why put a window there? It can be loud if there's a lot of traffic, it's not far from busy Shadeland Ave. They serve coffee, OJ, milk, donuts and bagels with cream cheese in the morning so you can grab a bite to eat on your way out. The food wasn't spectacular but it was enough until lunch time.
