The room did have four places for people to sleep, but only two of them were beds. One was a fold out cot and the other was a futon. The futon and the cot were very uncomfortable. At the time, Barcelona was having a hot spring, so the room was warm when we checked in. The staff informed us that the air conditioning was getting turning on that day, but it was not ready yet. Opening the windows helped cool the room off though. The only good part of the hotel was the excellent staff. They were friendly and attentive to our requests. The quadruple room sleeping arrangement though was not what we expected.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grenoble", "Title": "\u201cNice rooms but airless and too hot\u201d", "Author": "funkylittlefrog", "ReviewID": "UR123860508", "Content": "Hotel Azul is situated in a fantastic location just off Plaza Espanya in Barcelona.

Our room was quite large for Europe (apprx. 350 sq feet). It had a separate room for the parents, with TV, safe, and closet; the main room had a pull out sofa sleeper and separate single bed. The bathroom was spacious. The main room had a refrigerator and TV, although the main TV satellite channels didn't work. The one in the bedroom worked fine. Go figure. The staff were pleasant and helpful with typical tourist questions. The best feature about the Azul was the value for a 3 star in Barcelona. It was E125 per night for the quad, and we added on a third night that was down to E99 due to the rooms being widely available (March - off season). It is located on a fairly noisy main street. We had to open the windows in the evening to cool them down since they hadn't yet turned on the air conditioning. So it was loud while the windows were open. But it cooled off quickly and the noise wasn't too bad with them shut for the night. There are several bar/restaurants nearby, and a combination grocery store-fresh meat market (fish, beef, chicken, flowers, wines) is located 2 blocks behind and 3 blocks south of the hotel. The Metro is 1/4 mile up the boulevard. You can also get a bus at the Metro entrance that will go anywhere in Barcelona. Overall it is a good 3 star hotel, although it isn't centrally located and lacks the inherent benefit of being right where the A)action or B)old Barcelona is. While it only takes 5 minutes and 2 stops to get down to Las Ramblas, you feel like you could have found something else had you kept looking. I would go back to the Azul but only if I couldn't find something right by Las Ramblas first.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "abc_def062", "ReviewID": "UR17783693", "Content": "I stayed here in May 2008. I wouldn't normally stay in a hotel of this quality but I left it very late to book so it was the cheapest get. I paid \u20ac100 per night for a very large suite, which was very comfortable and quite good value, but probably more luxury than I needed. The location is only ok for two reasons: one is it's not in the very centre of the city, so you end up having to travel by metro or taxi more than if you were in the centre; two the street the hotel is on is very busy and quite noisy (I got woken up by traffic and had to wear earplugs but I am quite a light sleeper). There is a really nice cafe nearby at Placa Espanya with a very friendly Argentine waitress and good coffee (hard to find in Spain!). The room itself was beautiful and very modern comfortable. The staff were excellent, helpful and friendly. One thing to watch out for are the badly designed windows - I nearly fell out trying to open mine (seriously!). There's a notice beside the window recommending not to open it, so I guess I'm not the first guest who had trouble with it. Not so nice when you're on the 6th floor. :-) Certainly nothing wrong with this hotel - apart from the location.
