This made me feel even more connected to the people, and Venice. I also checked out the street on Veniceconnected.it I was able to survey up and down the surrounding streets (as Safety is somewhat of an issue to me). You will certainly appreciate the impeccable standards to which the room was cleaned each day.The room size was plenty big enough for my daughter and myself. We had our own private bathroom and shower, and I particularly enjoyed the shower being on a sort of sliding bar(I'm rather short, and this is the first hotel ever where I could have the spray at a comfortable level). I agree with countless others that this charming hotel is in a prime spot for all the \"must see\" places. I also loved it's situation in the arts district.According to one of the staff, this entire building, at one time was one dwelling and was on somewhat of a grand level. My description of our room could be that of tasteful, and slightly understated decor. You won't find over-the-top opulence here, but you will find a wonderfully safe clean and inexpensive haven in Venice, and use the money you save on the city! This is the only place for us in Venice.

My wife and I did not agree on it. I found it charming and comfortable, she felt it took her back to her backpacking days. Venice is expensive, so the 120 euros a night we paid gets you much less of a hotel room than almost anywhere else in Italy.

The staff are friendly and helpful. It's very clean. It's got free wi-fi. Here's what could be a problem but we didn't mind: it's a walk up (no elevator), and if you choose breakfast it's is in another location about 10 minutes walk away. We declined. There are minimarkets and real nice cafes right nearby where you'll enjoy yourself more than with a hotel breakfast. Here's what didn't bother me but bothered my wife: our room was small, the bed cover was synthetic and the wool blanket we asked didn't cover the bed, the bathroom is tiny and gets a bit wet with each shower. There is something I would warn about: there's no a/c and Venice can get awfully muggy in summer.

We had ensuite, which actually had enough shelf space! (pretty rare in many hotels) and was very quiet. I wondered, in fact, if the difference between the 'good' and 'poor' reviews might reflect the people who opted for a shared bathroom and those who paid extra for en suite. As far as food is concerned, there is a delicattessen on the corner of the street that sells vegan yoghourts and a wine merchant further up that street that was selling veggie organic wine. Because the place is so central, and so informal, and you get so tired walking around Venice, getting lost, etc. (!) we bought lots of bread, olives, etc. and either ate out in picnics, (or bought icecreams from an incredible place called Grom) or a few times [we had brought tea towels as \"trays\"] ate in our room. Also, there is an incredibly expensive, but nice, herbal perfumerie across the street, which appears to have vegetarian soaps, which smell incredible. We didn't take up the offer of a breakfast at a linked hotel on the other side of the Grand Canal, so I can't comment on that", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCentral, clean, quiet, helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "petermillman", "ReviewID": "UR107254801", "Content": "We had an en suite room.

And then we saw a totally different side of Venice on the Sunday when it was raining & a bitter cold wind was blowing from the north. Slowing heavily on the Mountains around Venice and the the north.

Make sure you get to the fish & fruit markets just north of Rialto Bridge.

Let me elaborate. The second morning of our stay we decided to try out the breakfast. The hotel does not offer its own breakfast, but offers a package where you can pay 50 cents to take a gondola ride to the island across the way, and then pay 5 euro for breakfast at a restaurant that the hotel has a relationship with. I was speaking to the staff member about breakfast in spanish, and I thought she said that she would call the restaurant to make sure that it was alright for 2 more people (my boyfriend and me) to go to breakfast. She called and the restaurant said it was fine. Twenty minutes later when we were actually leaving the hotel, she asked for us to pay her the 10 euro (5 each) that we owed for breakfast. We had decided that we didn't really have the time to go to this restaurant (it's a ten minute walk after you take the gondola ride, and we had a bit of a time crunch) so I apologized and said we were not going. The staff member then became very upset and angrily called the restaurant in front of us and complained that we had changed our minds and that we had inconvenienced all of them.

I normally stay in hostels. However, since Venice's hostels aren't on the main island, I decided to go for a hostel. After a quite depressing search for a place to stay, I was thrilled to come across San Samuele (found it in my guidebook, and all the trip advisor reviews that i read were very pleasant). I was offered a single for 3 nights (during the week) for 59 euro a night. A pleasant surprise at arrival: you get a 5% discount if you pay in cash. No problem! I TRIED to find a bad review on the internet - and i couldn't. Every other place I looked at in venice was at least 80, if not 95 for a single. No breakfast is offered at their hotel, however, you can eat for 5 euro at one of their sister hotels, which are very close to San Samuele. 5 euros was not bad - for the chance to actually SIT DOWN while eating in venice and not feel rushed (cereal, fresh rolls, croissants, etc). My \"single\" was actually a double bed, and the room size was fine. It's very basic - but with a sink in the room, which was a nice touch. The bathroom was shared - but it was always available, always CLEAN, and they also provide some soap and shower gel and GREAT towels (been to similar places that have sandpaper for towels). The staff was always friendly (both at San Samuel and at Art Deco, where I ate breakfast). Samol speaks excellent English, and was always pleasant! The hotel is very easy to find, and is just a 3 min walk from the San Samuele Vaporetto stop, which is great, as when you arrive in Venice, you dont have your bearings, and it can be difficult to get around if you've not brought a good map). I will definitely stay at San Samuele if/when I return to Venice, and I will encourage any of my friends to stay there too!", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boson, MA", "Title": "\u201cCute and quiet\u201d", "Author": "WanderingK", "ReviewID": "UR10143979", "Content": "Venice is expensive, but this is a great little place very close to the San Samuele vaporetto stop.

Our room was on the top floor and was quite small, adequate but somewhat shabby, and we had the shared bath. In three days we were never able to shower on our floor, we always had to go downstairs to find an available bathroom, and there was always someone waiting for the shower after us, so the shared baths can get a bit crowded. Despite that, the bathrooms were very clean. It was really warm the week we visited, but the hotel gave us a fan, which was fine. No breakfast, but that was fine as well - we tried the breakfast at the sister hotel one day and it was not very good - cappuccino at a cafe was much better.

I tried all the convent hotels that were in good locations, and when I learned all were full (the Bienniale di Venetia was going on while we were there it turned out), I started looking at regular hotels. A couple guide books had good things to say about Albergo San Samuele, so I took a chance on it. I would have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The location was perfect: walking distance to San Marco, Rialto and Accademia, as well as vaporetto and traghetto stops, but far enough away from these tourist honeypots to feel like a neighborhood. There are several decent trattorias within a couple blocks (walking toward the nearest large campo), and several bars on the campo from which to relax with a cold drink at an outdoor table and observe the nightly passeggiata. There were also interesting galleries and antique stores, and if one wanted to get picnic food, at least one small grocery store close by. The Italian staff at the hotel were quite pleasant. One spoke English quite well, another didn't speak it at all. I speak Italian, so that wasn't a problem. The room was small, but very clean and pleasant. The bed was very comfortable. I would have liked somewhere to sit and read at night as the tiny lamps next to the bed were no good for reading. Next time, I would bring a little book light. My room was on the front of the hotel, and there was some street noise (people talking and the clatter of dishes from the trattoria down the street), especially on the weekend, but I found that closing both shutters and interior windows helped a lot. It eventually got quiet when the trattoria closed around midnight. We were there in the first half of June, and it was hotter and more humid than I was expecting, so I was greatly relieved to find that the room was equipped with a nice fan that kept me comfortable during the night. (I'm not sure it would be enough for July and August, however.) It also came in handy for drying my hand wash. I feel I should warn that the lack of elevator could be a problem for those with physical limitations. My room was on the first floor (i.e. one floor up), but that required ascending 38 steps just to get to that floor, and I was plenty tired and winded when I finally got there. That is also the floor where the reception desk is located, so that is the minimum number of steps quests must ascend. The second floor is another good climb. On balance, I found this to be a pleasant hotel: clean, comfortable, excellent location, and very good value.
