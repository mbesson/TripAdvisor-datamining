Everyone talked together at breakfast and in the lounge (the only internet access). There's a Tesco a 3-minute walk away from the hotel and there are lots of places to eat in Earl's Court road. Where to start? The room had been freshly painted, but there were candy wrappers under the beds. It was hard to get a good night's sleep - the beds were old and random springs kept poking me in. The bathroom had been fitted with new fixtures, looked and smelled clean, but someone else's hair was in the sink drain when I arrived.

It has a posted weight limit of 630kgs (about 1300 pounds), but I don't think that is very accurate since the 5 of us don't weigh anywhere near that much and we \"broke\" it one morning heading back from breakfast. We were all stuck in the elevator for about 10 minutes while the staff turned off part of the power to the elevator (but thankfully not the lights inside) and tried to find the key to open the door. We were still at the basement level when this occurred, so it was nothing major, but I don't think I would have liked it at any other floor.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "germany", "Title": "\u201cits a hostel\u201d", "Author": "debtravelor", "ReviewID": "UR5564736", "Content": "I booked this hotel because it was an average price for london and near where my relatives were staying for the trip.

It was hot in london and when I asked for a fan to help with the unventilated room I was told that all fans had gone out to other quests.

Everything in our room had at least 2 cigarette burns, including our blankets and sheets. The room was dirty and I did not want to unpack a single item from my luggage.

I am not one to worry about the decorating in a hotel; however, the pepto bismol pink wall color made me slightly nauseous. The bathroom shower was growing things. The hotel staff (including the owner) were EXTREMELY unhelpful. They couldn't even tell us the best underground station to use when going to the London Eye.
