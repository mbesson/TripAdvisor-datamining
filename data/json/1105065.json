{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Experience I have never booked a hotel in Seattle before. I was looking for cheap rates in a decent hotel close to Seattle. This is hard to find.Finally, I found the Days Inn. Thank God!!!I requested a unit on the second floor and explained that I was traveling alone and wanted to feel a bit safer considering I was staying in a not so great part of town.When I arrived the check-in was swift and easy. They were able to accommodate my request for a non-bottom floor unit. The hotel is well lit on the outside and is a nice looking hotel in a shabby location.The inside of my room was surprisingly large and clean. They served a continental breakfast each morning and each time I entered the lobby or lounge a staff member was ready and waiting to help me out.I enjoyed my stay and would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting cheap rates in the Seattle area.For so cheap - this hotel is a ***** (5-Star)", "Date": "Dec 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR639431361", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "MZalbo22"}, {"Content": "Customer Service Problems When we checked in, the power was out. Three hours later, when we left for the evening, it still had not come on. We did not want to return to the hotel after 10 pm if there was no power, and we asked at the desk about check out and refund policies. The woman at the desk assured us we could get a refund, and apologized for the inconvenience, and we checked out.However, a follow up phone call the next day was a different story. A very rude woman insisted the power had only been out for one hour and that no one had told us we would get a refund. It was not her problem we did not stay, and she refused to let us speak to a manager. Another follow up phone call got the same results - in fact, we were told the manager was too busy with important matters to speak with us, and if we gave a phone call, maybe someone would find time to call us back. This person was very rude and insisted she had documentation about the power outage. Needless to say, we expect a lot better customer service from a Days Inn. We understand the power outage, being nearly city wide, is not in their control, but we do expect them to understand it has an impact on their customers and they should honor what they say, not deny it and refuse us access to the manager.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR215638775", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "inconvenienced"}, {"Content": "Recently renovated Evidently Days Inn recently purchased and has renovated the Seafair Inn, Seattle. We stayed twice over a two week period of time. Management was very friendly; offered us breakfast 30 minutes after they had already cleaned up from the continental breakfast, spoke friendly at the front desk and helpful; gave us helpful tips on how to enjoy the city.The hotel was freshly painted with new carpet and tile. They had LOTS of lights after dark and just seemed on top of things. Mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, wi-fi included. Obviously, things can change with the wrong person at the desk but our two experiences were good. Just a good value for an $80 room AARP rate.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR817676508", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Phoenix1414"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d1105065-r22751069-Days_Inn_Seattle_Midtown-Seattle_Washington.html", "HotelID": "1105065", "Price": "$88"}}
