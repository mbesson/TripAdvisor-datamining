I took the room without looking since we were in a hurry. We dumped our stuff in the room and went to eat. We got back to the room about 10p.m. and decided to try out the jacuzzi. I started filling it when I noticed hairs all over in the jacuzzi. I called the office and the lady said she would come clean it. I thought I might better look at the sheet. It had a big stain on it. I asked her to change it. She said they had a new housekeeper . She asked if she could check the bathroom to make sure it was fine. Awhile after she left I went in the bathroom and noticed hairs in the tub. The floor had not been vacuumed either. It was the nastiest place I have ever stayed! I would have left if we hadn't been so tired. The bed was uncomfortable with a blanket for a mattress pad which shifted all night. To top it just before we left someone was going down the stairs and the bottom one broke! The manger offered to give me a free night stay (which I refused!) or give me $23 cash. I took the $23 cash, but will be calling health dept and chamber of Commerce tomorrow.
