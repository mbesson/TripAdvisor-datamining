The hotel is a bit run down for a Ramada. I expected more from this chain of hotels. The continental breakfast was awesome and plentiful but get there before 10am because everything is put away at 10am on the dot. The room was very hot and air conditioner took awhile to start working, pillows small and very lumpy, bring your own, hair dryer not working in our room, I always bring my small one, but besides that it was ok for the time we spent in it. The pool wasn't in operation or should I say no one was there to clean it so we didn't use it. Hot tub was usable but no hot, warm bath like. Speaking of bath, it took about 5 mins to get hot water going in the shower. Some guest were using the upstairs sitting area as their private party area on New Years Eve and it was quite disturbing and loud. Complaint to management got nowhere except to say it is New Years Eve. We went out to the strip to celebrate and when we returned to hotel party was still going strong until about 2am when I finally fell asleep. I told management that this is not acceptable for a Ramada hotel and if someone came in off the street for a room they would have left right away the noise was that bad. People had to yell to hear each other over the noise. We would not stay there again when the Westin Hotel is down the street closer to the strip than the Ramada. Shuttle was a bonus for the airport or to visit the strip because the walk was about 1/2 hour from Flamingo Rd to the Strip.

The pillows were piled on the couch and had no pillow cases. No big deal, right? So I just call down and ask for pillow cases. Granted, it's 11:30 at night and I have to get up at 7:00am for a class. I still need to shower before bed. But I wait for the pillow cases. Half an hour later, still no pillow cases, so I call down again. They assure me they're on their way. Twenty more minutes pass before a pillow case shows up. So I finally can go take my shower. I find a large wad of tangled hair on my towel. Not my hair. EeK. Finally manage to crawl into bed at almost 1am to find that the noisy air conditioner hasn't cooled down the room and the sheets were rough and scratchy. Didn't sleep much.

I highly recommend this place. I stayed there Friday, Sat. and Sunday and paid $165 including taxes. No resort fees. While booking from the web I requested a room on the top floor. This is what I got! The front desk actually was very polite and professional. The king bed room was huge with a view of the strip. Everything was clean. The room had a (clean) couch, fridge, coffee-maker, kitchenette, free wifi with fast internet. The TV was not flat and the channels were very limited (about 15) but this was not a issue for me. The room was really quite: no noise from airplanes, no noise from neighbors. The hotel has a free shuttle to the LAS airport. Interestingly, you can reserve the shuttle whenever you want. Just ask for the shuttle 15 min before your departure time and it will be there. The location is not superior but not bad either. It is a 15 min walk to the strip (flamingo area). You may encounter some homeless people asking you for money but this happens almost everywhere in Vegas. There is a strip club close to the hotel but it is small and doesn't really bother anybody. Breakfast was free and awesome. It icluded from the \"classic\" stuff like donuts, muffins to more fancy stuff like waffles, sausage, omelets, fruits. Breakfast was really good but only available from 6:30 am to 10 am! Closest casino is the Terrible's within 5 min walking. This is a nice casino with not so high minimums. Ellis Island casino is not far away either and they have some good selection of beers. In summary, for the money I paid this place rocks. It is a very clean hotel, semi-professional, with many free amenities (shuttle, wifi, breakfast).

I stayed in the back building, building 2, on the 3 floor, overlooking the parking lot of the Tuscanny, and their landscaping with grass and palm trees.

All staff were great in their own individual way. We was loaned a large water cooler for our trip. We was given a conference room overnight to store all our rations prior to moving off to Kingman, Grand Canyon, Death Valley and Mt. Whitney (in that order) on the 31 August. There are lots of other little examples too numerous to mention. I would highly recommend this hotel just on customer service alone. They definitely match up to what I would expect from a Ramada hotel having stayed in different hotels around the world. I liked the fact that the hotel did not have a casino, which meant the only people in your hotel was guests from the hotel and was quieter than other hotels we visited. It is no more than a 10 min walk from the 'strip'. There is a free shuttle bus for people who wish to use it. I chose to walk as I enjoy walking and felt safe walking as it is along a very busy road. (I am a female) The breakfast was great with a choice of hot food, cereals, fresh fruit, waffles, and tea, coffee and fresh juice. I travelled on a UK military exercise.

Complete nightmare!\u201d", "Author": "Nicholas S", "ReviewID": "UR118587630", "Content": "This has been the worst trip ever, and as a traveling sales rep for the last 8 years, I've traveled an awful lot. I booked five nights here while I was working at a trade show at the Sands Expo center. After the second night I woke up with many itchy red spots all over my body, my arms, back, chest, legs, neck. I was hoping in my mind it was anything but bed bugs, maybe an allergic reaction to something, perhaps mosquitos got in, anything. I got home very late after my third day of trade show work and going out with clients, so I slept in the bed again hoping the itchy bite marks weren't what I feared. When I woke up the next morning and had nearly double the bites that were there the morning before, my fears were confirmed. With the use of the extremely bright Las Vegas sunlight coming through the windows, I peeled off all the sheets and began scanning every inch of the bed, seems, sheets. It only took a handful of seconds until I spotted a clear little bug with a full red belly. I squished it immediately and saw my blood squirt all over the white sheet. I hastily packed all of my stuff in plastic bags, threw them in my suitcase, and called a friend staying at another hotel to come pick me up so I could get a room at another hotel. The real fun starts when I come back the next morning, today, to speak with the manager about my nightmarish experience and the hassle I am going to have to go through to do whatever possible to try and prevent these evil little creatures from traveling back to my apartment and creating an even larger problem for me. The manager tells me housekeeping is going to go clean the room and confirm that the room does in fact have bed bugs, at which point I simply pulled up my shirt and showed him the many grouping of three bites in a row covering my torso. He grimaces at the site and says that they won't have a problem refunding me for my stay, I'll just have to go through Orbitz since I booked through them, but that it wouldn't be a problem and he was very sorry. He told me I didn't have to stick around for that if I had stuff to do, which I did, so I left to do work and came back later in the day. He was off at that point, and the woman in charge had relayed to me that housekeeping didn't find any bugs, so I was basically out of luck. I again pulled up my shirt to show her all the bites, and reminded her that I found two myself in a quick look at the mattress, at which point she just became so flustered she announced to the crowded lobby, \"I can't take it, I'm going home.\" I'm still going to continue to fight this through Orbitz so they can call back and speak with the property manager during the week, and I'll go through American Express as well, but for a hotel to not take care of a customer who has become completely covered in bed bugs and has to deal with the continuing problem of worrying if they will end up infesting their own home, is absolutely mind blowing and infuriating and nobody should ever stay here. There are way too many hotels in this town, saving a few bucks to stay here in no way makes up for the expenses that I am incurring and the ridiculous hassle.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "Title": "\u201cGood location and great value for the rate\u201d", "Author": "hernargentino", "ReviewID": "UR118088682", "Content": "It is just 5 minutes off the Strip.

We arrived after an 8 hour bus trip from Los Angeles, hot and tired. Our room was in building two, which was oppressively hot in the communal areas and in our room initially. Switching on the air conditioning soon sorted that out though! From our window we could see the strip and it really is not that far a walk - slightly isolated at night, but generally we felt pretty safe. Others had noted it is next to a deserted night club (something we only noticed on the last day - its not really an obstructive eyesore) and that it is next to a gentlemen's club. The latter is unavoidable as you have to walk past it to get to the strip, but we didn't actually see any activity around there so it didn't really make us uncomfortable at all. There are adverts for prostitutes being wheeled around on vans and handed out by the so-called \"clickers\" all over Las Vegas, so I suppose it is to an extent in-keeping with the theme of the place... The rooms are large with television and fridge / freezer. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Free wi-fi was also greatly appreciated. Breakfast is complimentary and comprised hot items like scrambled egg and sausage, selection of cereals, pastries yoghurts, toast and English muffins. However, nice as this was, you had to save room for the novelty wafflemaker. It was constantly in use! But the waffles were very nice. Tea, coffee and juices also available. Not that food is necessarily the most important factor in a stay, but it certainly gives a good start to the day, venturing out on a full stomach. Staff were generally friendly. The check in lady was a little curt, but we asked a gentleman behind the desk about trips out, and although he was unable to help us he tried his absolute best and was very friendly. Check out was also without incident, friendly but unremarkable. I believe there is a shuttle provided to and from the airport, but as I mentioned, we got the bus to Las Vegas, so I can't comment. The swimming pool is of reasonable size (I've seen smaller in much more highly rated hotels), it looked clean and although we didn't use it, had we have had more time I would have liked to as it did look very inviting in the heat!
