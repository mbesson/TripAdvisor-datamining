We depended on them for making dinner and theater reservations, recommending restaurants, and generally advising us. The only downside was that we stayed in the Junior Suite on top floor, i.e. the remodeled attic. Clean, large, adorable, and comfortable... if you're short. Very low ceiling with beams sticking out meant that my 6-foot-tall husband practically gave himself a concussion every day. He actually had a scar on his forehead from one encounter with a sharp-ended beam by the skylight. It was much less of an inconvenience for me at 5 foot 6, but because of the steeply slanted roof, even I banged my head a couple times getting out of bed or while putting clothes in the cupboards at sides of room. I got a glimpse of other rooms on lower floors and of course no such issue there. I have already strongly recommended the hotel to family members who will be traveling to Venice this spring.

Could not have been better for the price. First, as many have said, the location is perfect! Venice is not an easy city to walk in under the best of circumstances and hauling a suitcase is impossible! The Campiello is a straight 50 yard walk (no steps, no bridges, no crowds) from the Alilaguna boat stop at San Zaccaria which is where you get off coming from the airport. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly, especial thanks to Marco and Dora, both of whom gave us excellent advice and guidance. Second, who cares about proximity to the madhouse of San Marco? Campiello is surrounded, just a few alleys away, with all sorts of the small bacari and osterias that make Venice worthwhile. The room we had was just fine except for no chairs, which management remedied on our request. The bathroom was clean, modern, a bit cramped, with plenty of hot water and towels. Breakfast was fine, plentiful and served until 1000. We will happily stay here again on future trips to Venice. NOTE: Nothing to do with the Campiello, but we were totally unprepared for the massive crowds of tourists, mostly Asian, that swarmed the main parts of Venice, especially Piazza San Marco and every one of the recommended sites: Accademia, Rialto, Arsenale, and every church in the city. Impossible to avoid this if you want to see the places you have read about. We were unable to get out of a shop on one occasion because of a literal phalanx of Asian tourists in a semi-military formation passing thru the alley. Remember that there are no streets in Venice, just alleys about 10' wide so be warned if you are even slightly claustrophobic.

We booked the junior suite at the Hotel Campiello. The location is excellent - two blocks from St. Mark's Square, yet blissfully quiet inside the hotel. The airport water taxi and the vaporettos stop almost at the end of the street (great when you have luggage to tote around). The junior suite is very large, with an expansive living area that features a double sofa bed, a single sofa bed, and room for a rollaway bed, if needed. The room could sleep 6, if you don't mind sharing one bathroom and giving up your privacy. There is a short series of steps leading from the living room up to a private roof terrace. We loved having the terrace to sit on in the evenings and enjoy a glass of wine. There's not much of a view (all rooftops), but it's so peaceful and nice to have fresh air so close to your room. The bedroom is adjacent to the living area and separated by french doors (with an optional curtain for privacy). The bedroom can be set up as a king bed or two twins. The beds were comfortable, the sofa beds, unfortunately, were very saggy and need new mattresses. The room has a lot of charm - it appears to be part of the original attic. It features a mini-fridge, windows that open and plenty of storage. It has a/c, but that wasn't turned on since we were there in April. The only downsides to the room are that the bathroom is located in the bedroom, so if you are sharing with multiple people, they will have to walk through the bedroom to access the bathroom. Also, the room is accessed via an elevator to the 2nd floor and then climbing an extremely narrow and winding set of stairs up into the room. If you have mobility issues or are of an above average size, these stairs will likely cause you difficulty. Also note that the shower stall is very small. Not a problem for us, but we are petite in size. The front desk staff is very friendly and speaks English. I found their restaurant recommendations to be lacking (mostly sent us to sub-par tourist destinations), so do your own research before hand. English skills are very good. The breakfast and housekeeping staff, however, is harried and unhappy. That said, we received adequate breakfast service and the room was clean. Breakfast, as many have said in other reviews, is disappointing, but better than nothing. You'll get the same thing every day, never a variation. Cereals, yogurt, croissants, sliced cheese and hams, hard boiled eggs. The cappuccino was good. It's not exciting, but helpful to have something \"free\" to start your day when you are in such an expensive city. Free WIFI was available, although the connection in our room was spotty. The rate was reasonable for Venice. There are some less expensive hotels available, but I found the location to be very convenient, the room clean and large, and the front desk service friendly, so all in all, am happy with my choice and found it to be a good value for the money. I would stay here again, but might also consider renting an apartment to save on food costs. Venice itself is an amazing city.

We weren't on the water but our room faced the little alley where there was a canal. We could hear the bells chime from St. Mark's Square..all very romantic. We thought the breakfast was great and our room was quite large, and clean. I would definitely go back. Of our 11 days in Europe, this was one of our favorite hotels. We also loved how close it was to St. Mark's. If you walk out towards the water and turn left, the next street over leads to a small square. There's a fountain there that has fresh, cold water and you can refill your water bottles. We did it several times a day for the 3 days we were in Venice.

We found this to be a slightly dated, but clean and comfortable property. The location is excellent, within 5 minute walk to St Mark's Square. That made it very convenient to visit the square early in the morning before it got too busy. Contrary to other posts here, we located the hotel easily. From the S. Zaccaria water bus stop (from the airport) look toward the row of buildings and slightly to your left and you'll see the entrance down Calle de Vin. There is an easily visible sign sticking out over the door. As with all the \"roads\" in Venice, they are pedestrian-ways, and so it can be disconcerting to look down an alleyway rather than a big road like in other cities. Don't be put off by concerns of trying to find the hotel. Another plus of its location is that you get right of the water taxi and there are no stairs to climb or bridges to cross to get to the hotel. We saw many tourists lugging suitcases up and down stairs in Venice - not fun. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I have read a few other posts from people who were annoyed at having to ring a doorbell to get into the hotel. I think this is a good feature! It means that staff are screening who comes into the hotel. We stayed in the 3rd floor apartment. There is an elevator to the 2nd floor and then you have to carry suitcases up a narrow winding flight of stairs. Not recommended for anyone with limited mobility or strength. There was plenty of room for 5 people with a \"queen\" bed in a separate room (actually 2 singles pushed together) and 2 pull outs in the other room. There was one bathroom, a small fridge, a dining table. The rooms were dated . Decor is old and the carpets worn, but the room was clean. Breakfast was excellent. Same food everyday, but enough options to allow for some variety. Hard-boiled eggs, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, salami, cheese, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, juice.

The hotel is in a great location right by the square, but at the same time is kind of in its own little area, so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have tons of people walking by nor do you hear a lot of noise. We found it a little weird that we had to leave our key at the front desk when we were leaving, but I guess it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice because the staff gets to know you and you feel safe knowing that random people can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just walk in to the hotel.

The breakfast was good, no complaints there. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay in this hotel if you are wanting to see the main tourist sights of Venice, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a great location.

On our last day there we got caught by the staff when they were checking tickets. He gave us a really hard time and demanded 50 euros each for not having our ticket validated. He rolled his eyes when he learned we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak Italian or French, so it was a frustrating experience.

Amenities included a large comfortable double bed, full dresser, closet armour, two nightstands, desk, two chairs / folding beds, sitting table, room safe, 13\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TV and a refrigerator. The bathroom was small, but easily accessible. The TV did not work when we arrived and we blew a circuit breaker that took a half hour to locate, but otherwise had no issues with the room. The breakfast buffet was fresh, tasty and the best of all of the Italy hotels we stayed at, including hard boiled eggs, two sliced meats, sliced cheese, three cereals, assorted fruit, red and yellow orange juice, toast, croissants, coffee and tea. Either the room doors or hall facing walls were very thin, as I could easily hear people in other rooms talking and showing, yet I heard nothing once inside my room. Note that while they claim to provide free internet access, it means they have one oldish computer in the lobby that you must wait for; they do not provide wired or wireless access otherwise. Two of the front desk daytime staff, Thomas and Davide, were extremely knowledgeable and provided many helpful tips from museum reservations to vaporetto schedules to restaurants. Unfortunately, I had to deal with a problem back home in the US, which was compounded by the ineptitude of the evening staff.

As such, I can't comment on the service or the rooms at the Hotel as I did not experience it. However, I can comment on my stay in the apartment and it was fantastic. We were 4 (two adults and two kids (8 and 13)) and the apt was perfect. Small kitchen and eating area that saved me a fortune -- all meals but for two were from the grocery store (sandwiches, olives, cheese, fresh bread and fruit). In fact, the breakfast in the hotel was not as good as the breakfast I got from the local stores. The apt included two separate areas for sleeping and a giant bathroom. The room was beautiful and clean. The location of this Hotel is perfect. A five minute walk from San Marco and one minute from the water taxi. I wasn't thrilled with the staff as they pushed a Murano Glass tour on us, over and over, until we finally gave in. What a travesty and waste of time. The concept that a hotel I was paying good money to went out of its way to funnel me to a complete and utter rip off, really upset me. But once I got back to my spacious room I felt a lot better (clearly the staff gets $$ from the tour). Don't go on the Murano trip as the prices are higher than in Venice and while the boat trip there is free, there ain't no way back but by water taxi, which is very slow and isn't free. Getting ripped off is one thing, but losing precious hours in Venice is inexcusable. But for the Murano experience, I loved Venice. There was some flooding but it was part of the charm. If you go knowing you're going to pay high prices and everyone is looking to rip you off, you can deal with it and enjoy the city which is spectacular. Gelatto at night on the Plaza with your kids listening to the battling orchestras is priceless, even if it does cost you $50 for a seat and a coffee.

For Venice in this location, this is very reasonable, about 300 yards from St Mark's Square. The hotel is less than 100 yards from the San Zaccaria vaporetto stop. We flew into the Marco Polo airport. In the concourse you can buy a three day pass for the vaporetto's (canal buses) for 31 Euros. The price includes the number 5 bus to Venice. When you arrive on the bus, take a short walk down to the Grand Canal and get the number 1 or 2 vaporetto (you are not allowed on number 3, for locals only.) The number 1 vaporetto is slow and stops at every stop. The number 2 stops at about every third stop. Try and get one of the front seats and enjoy the trip down the canal. A great way to arrive. The hotel is very clean and we thought a reasonable three star. The bathrooms are very small but functional for one person at a time. No bath but a very nice shower that you could either wash normally in or get blasted by about ten jets. Our room was quite big although we did hear other guests complaining about the size of their rooms. These seem to be Americans who are used to everything being big it seems. There is a room safe and the room was cleaned very well each morning. Breakfast was the usual continental with croissants, bread, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, cold meat, cheese etc. Something for nearly everyone and you could set yourself up nicely for the day. Tips for travellers to Venice Venice is quite expensive, especially with the exchange rate at 1.23 to the pound. If you are up for getting of the beaten track a bit you can still eat and drink reasonably well at not too much cost. If you pop into a local bar (ostaria) you can get a glass of wine or coffee for two or three Euros. If you sit outside at a table in a tourist area it will be double that and four times in St Marks square. We did a number of walks in one of the guide books. If you wish to visit lots of the churches it is worth buying a chorus card for 8 Euros. This gets you into many places that otherwise charge upwards of 2.5 Euros each to go into. If you walk off the beaten track you will find reasonably priced restaurants. We had lunch at a couple. Pizza or pasta with salad and bottle of wine for 35 Euros for two. Restaurants are generally more expensive than Tratorrias but they all have menus outside so you can look at the prices. Bear in mind that most charge a cover charge of two to five Euros for bread and often a service charge of 12%. Hors D'oeuvres are expensive and if money is tight, just have a main course. Some restaurants do a set menu of two or three courses. Expect to pay at least 80 to 100 Euros for a three course meal with wine and you can pay a lot more.

We stayed for 3 nights in May/June, and absolutely loved it. The staff are very nice; while we had some minor issues communicating in English with one of the women, we found Thomas to be frequently available and amazingly helpful (we actually wound up nicknaming any other helpful person we ran across in Italy from then on Thomas2, Thomas3, etc)! They helped us book a Vivaldi concert, tried to help us book the secret itineraries tour (it was full), even loaned us wine glasses from the small bar one night when we brought a bottle of wine in with us. We also always received a response to any email we sent beforehand (and we had many questions) within 24 hours, which really helped us with planning. The staff just made it so nice. Our room was very small, but since we had been forewarned of that by Thomas when we made the booking (we booked a budget room), this was fine and still completely adequate on space. The bathroom was small but great; I've never seen such a fancy shower setup, with a whole wall of functions! For the price, it was wonderful. Plus when we checked in they noted that we had the Rick Steve's travel book and gave us a 10% discount for paying cash, which was very appreciated. You can't beat the location, either. From St. Mark's square you cross 2 canals (the first has the bridge of Sighs on it) and the the hotel is on the next alley - about 5 minutes walk total. The Rialto area was easily found by going to St. Mark's and following signs, too. We could actually see the water when we leaned out our window too. The noise in the morning was a bit of an issue, as the souvenir salespeople pushed their carts by the hotel (it sounded like glass milk jars clanging together), but we got used to it and it wasn't bad when we shut the window and turned on the AC. Breakfast was good, too - cold meat and cheese, cereal, fruit, and yogurt, plus they'd give us fresh bread and bring coffee, tea, or cappaccino to our table. The lobby area where you eat is very prettily done as well. We wished they had a secure luggage storage area there but felt safe enough leaving our suitcases there for a few hours the day we checked out. The decorations were pretty overall, and we liked the chandelier lighting in our room. Overall, Venice was a wonderful place to be, and staying at the Hotel Campiello made it even better.
