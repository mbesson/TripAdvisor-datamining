The water taxi delivered us to the hotel's own private jetty- the coolest entry into a city ever! The location is central but hidden away.

The receptionist (and I apologise for forgetting her name) was exceptional, making us instantly welcome and providing us with great recommendations for meals and trips during our stay. We took endless videos of the gondolas cruising past right outside our window - something we will never forget , especially the gondoliers who sang as well. The apartment was great, very spacious, comfortable bed, huge shower and a beautiful fresh breakfast was provided every morning. They also provide free wifi which was fabulous. It takes only a few minutes to walk to San Marco via beautiful little alleys. Walking in the opposite direction for a few minutes one evening took us to a restaurant the receptionist had recommended - L'Osteria di Santa Marina - and we thank her for the recommendation as the food was excellent, very different from some horrible experiences we had previously had in restaurants close to the San Marco area.

Our room was more like an small apartment and was beautifully furnished and spotless. The location is so gorgeous...on a quiet small campo with a tiny canal right out the living room window where we could see gondolas go by. Every morning, the wonderful staff delivered a lovely breakfast of our choosing and we enjoyed it at a tastefully decorated dining room table. An excellent coffee machine offered one cup choices. The two staff members were friendly, professional and so very helpful with every question we had. Our unit also had plush towels and robes for our use and the king size bed was very comfy. Unfortunately, I experienced a fairly serious health issue and the staff members were extremely helpful in translating, scanning and sending documents to various doctors and insurance providers. Their genuine concern was very much appreciated by us both. Our only 'complaint' was the size of the bathroom area. We have been fortunate enough to travel to various locations in Europe and do understand that European bathrooms are much smaller than in other locations; however, this 'area' was very tiny. There was a separate toilet 'room', a basin in the middle and a shower to the other side with its own door. Typically, we had to stand in the doorway of the bathroom area to stand in front of the basin to brush teeth, blow dry hair etc. However, we quickly adapted; such a trivial issue in comparison to such an amazing suite otherwise! We would HIGHLY recommend this hotel. It is truly worth every single penny. And with only four units, it's very quiet, VERY romantic and very private. And again, I cannot speak more highly of Anna and the young man who worked at the front desk.

My husband emailed to check on our room location only to find that Orbitz had never sent the hotel our reservation and the hotel was booked! After a lot of frustrating back and forth with Orbitz, the hotel offered to move us to the IQs and give us an extra night if we changed our date of arrival, which we did. They were very gracious throughout the entire experience. Orbitz...not so much. Never using them again. When we did arrive at the hotel--in the water taxi the hotel organized for us for 100 euro--we were brought directly to the door of the hotel so no frustrating treks through Venice's small streets with our luggage--we had a lot since we were there for 8 days. The hotel itself is more like a converted series of small apartments with a main area. Anna, our charming host, was there to greet us and gave us the lay of the land. Free wi-fi and breakfast are included. They bring breakfast to your room every morning and you can pick and choose what you like. Our first day we had yogurt, croissants, rolls, juice, milk, and jams. We also used the in-room espresso machine quite a lot. We stopped getting breakfast a few days in because my husband prefers hitting the cafes and pastry shops. Still, a great service for those who want to laze around in the morning. The rooms were very nice...spacious and modern. There were tons of windows onto the canal and campo, although you could make it very dark by drawing the brown velvet curtains. We had a sitting area, small kitchenette, tres cool dining table in leather with four seats, and a flat screen in the living room. The bed (in the other room) was a low-profile bed with plenty of room for two. Loved the \"fireplace\" TV, but my favorite part was the sound of the water lapping up against our walls. So relaxing and romantic--especially when the gondola with singers went by. My only complaint was that the rooms, while very stylish, look a little worn--mainly the places where you can tell they've painted over damage. There were also a few spiderwebs around the room too, but we took care of that with a washcloth. Spiderwebs in an old city are par for the course. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the IQs and especially our time in Venice, which is a magical city. Anna was a perfect hostess who always met our questions with a smile and a can-do attitude.

Venice is truly one of the unique places in the world to visit and most of its hotels are unique as well. The general rule for the upper end Venice hotels is pretty expensive, good service, dramatic facades and lobbies, followed by individual rooms that are small, dated and quite uninspiring. The Charming House IQ truly breaks this mold. The unmarked entrance off the canal is picture book, opening to a small lobby. There is no grand lobby or public area. Guests are given a set of keys to the iron gate fronting the piazza and the heavy wooden unmarked door which opens to a private courtyard. We had a two room suite with 2 in each room and a private entry to each room. The larger room contained a small kitchen area and a full sized living room. Sharing this space was the best of all worlds. Furnishings were urban upscale (think W hotel) as a opposed to old and stuffy. Rooms and the bathrooms are huge by Venice standards. The staff was fabulous. Extremely helpful. They set the table each morning in our living room and catered in a nice continental breakfast and brought ice for evening drinks. The lobby is not staffed all day - they are there from 8 -12 and then 5:30 -8. As there are only a small number of rooms, this is all that is needed.
