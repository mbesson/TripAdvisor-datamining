The bathroom is separated from the rest of the room by sliding translucent doors (so you can open up the bathroom to the rest of the room). The shower is separate from the large soaking tub. The back of the shower and tub are mirrored, reflecting the sink mirror. The sink and counter is one piece of see-through glass. The bathroom lights have dimmer controls. The toilet and bidet are in their own closet. The furniture in the bedroom is sleek and modern. The bed and bedding are great. The rest of the hotel is sleek and modern too. The elevators are glass. A huge, central atrium rises above the ground floor lobby and restaurants. If you are stuck overnight at the Madrid Airport, and you want a fun room, this is the place. The hotel's free shuttle stops at all three terminals which are each some distance apart so that the shuttle bus comes only every 40 minutes or so.

The service was very spotty. I asked for coffee for my room, and was told they did not have any. However, 3 days into my stay a coffee pack shows up. But I only got one coffee pack my entire stay. It also took 4 days before I finally got the newspaper delivered to my door. Other than that, I would grab one from the front desk on my way down to eat breakfast. I also got water put into my room twice \u2026 As far as breakfast, it was a good buffet. I asked on the first day if I could get an omelet, but was told they did not make them. Then on Monday (4 days into my stay) a person was behind the counter fixing omelets. Everything was very inconsistent \u2026 The fitness facility was lacking. There was one treadmill, one elliptical, and one stationary bike in a huge hotel. This was unsatisfactory for a hotel of this size. There was always a line, and you could tell that people were frustrated. In fact, a lot of the people that I talked to were very frustrated by this. As long as the weather is nice, you can run outside \u2026 but one of each piece of equipment? That\u2019s not good \u2026 The hotel was out in the middle of nowhere. You had about a mile walk to the metro, or the hotel van could take you to the airport to the metro. But once you got to the metro you had about a 45 minute trip into the city of Madrid. This was fine, but if you are looking for a hotel in which you walk out the door and you are in the center of the city, then this is not the hotel for you. The lounge was ok \u2026 It was not the best that I have seen or been into.

We stayed there one night in April this year returning from a business trip in central Spain and found the location perfect for a very early start the next day. The taxi ride from the train Station at Chamartin was very quick, only 10 to 15 minutes, and cost \u20ac25 - good value for the 3 of us travelling. Checking in was effortless and the courtesy of the desk staff was exemplary. My Honours card had expired and a new one was created on the spot. We had prebooked this hotel at the rate of \u20ac144 per night which was very reasonable for the location and the standards offered. The rooms were vast and very well appointed. The bathroom was a stunning haven of peace and the furniture was beautiful. The only downside was the location of my room, located on a corner and facing the motorway. This was noisy till quite late in the night and then again, in the morning (though I did not care then having to get up at 4.30 am!). We had a light dinner in the restaurant and the food was tasty, in copious quantity although ordered from the starters menu, and reasonably priced. The service was excellent. There is wi-fi internet but this is not free. We did not use it. The hotel operates a shuttle to the airport which is free, and literally takes 5 minutes from door to door. Note that it is very advisable to pre-book this shuttle on arrival as you check in as there is limited space. The shuttle however does not start until 5 am, and this is a little short for some of the very early departures for airlines such as Ryanair. If your flight is before 6.30 am, you are advised to take a taxi earlier, and instead, as the shuttle will likely delivery you too late facing long queues, unless you have only hand baggage and no need to visit the check in desk. If you however have luggage to check in, beware.

Due to a last minute change in plans, we ended up in Madrid with no hotel reservation and after trying several other hotels, we decided to stay in the Hilton. They staff was helpful and accomodating and set us up in a very comfortable room right away. The decor is sleek and space efficient, and offer the details of a more spacious room by careful design. I found the room to be a wonderful space to relax after a busy day of museums and walking. The problem with this resort is mainly the location, and that it feels like an airport hotel. The lobby, though nicely decorated in the same sleek decor, has a feeling of a temporary stay. There is a conspicuous lack of warmth and home, and you get a distinct feeling that the hotel is intended for the occasional business trip or layover. The closest public transport is about a half mile away from the resort, and a bit obscure. Renting a car in Madrid seems not worth the cost as you spend most of your time walking, and parking seems to be an issue. It would be my impression that the Hilton could offer a shuttle to the Metro if not directly to some of the main attractions. It would go a long way to make the guests feel as though they are commited to housing visitors to the city, not just airport travelers. There is no restaurant to speak of at the Hilton, aside from their overpriced breakfast buffet. For about a third of the cost, you can get the metro to the San Miguel Market and get an amazing cappucino and something much more satisfying to eat.

It's an efficient use of space and very cute! Several disappointments: (1) I booked two rooms for two people per room using my HHonors points (I am Diamond level). Upon check-in, they refused to assign both rooms to the concierge level and would only allow me and my husband access to the concierge lounge, but not the occupants of the other room. This is the first time I've encountered this with Hilton - all other hotels only treat the rooms as the Diamond level status. The hotel was not full, so really surprising that they took this stance. Not sure what they do when a Diamond member books two rooms for family - do they make teenage children occupy a room several floors below the parents? (2) The shuttle bus took almost 40 minutes to arrive a tthe airport for pick-up. (3) The location of the hotel is close to the airport, but close to little else.

Let\u2019s be sure what this hotel is, it's an airport hotel, and therefore it is near to the airport, well terminal 1, 2 and 3. Nothing is near terminal 4 or 4s so it is no worse than any other hotel. There is a prompt hotel shuttle bus as well as a shuttle in to the centre of Madrid (i haven't tried this one so can't comment further). Typically, however, I hire a car and park in the hotel car park which is very convenient. So what sets this hotel apart for me, why do I keep returning? Well the restaurant is wonderful, food prepared beautifully, cooked perfectly and presented as a feast for the eyes. It won\u2019t be the cheapest meal I have ever eaten but I have always feel it is one of the best value.. The bar is welcoming and pleasant and a good range of spirits are available, this used to be a stunning range which was always a pleasure to experiment with, but alas the diversity of rums and whiskies has been reduced, perhaps I didn't drink enough of them, very sad... Interestingly, two weeks ago they added a Heineken tap on the bar which is a welcome addition. So I suppose I should find something to temper this rather one sided review with, so you don\u2019t think I am unduly favourable, and so might lack credibility... 1. The area to the side of the hotel, which does not seem to belong to the hotel, could do with some tidying, look out of rooms x01 to x09 on each floor of the main tower and it is fairly obvious what needs to be done. 2. The practice of Pre-authorisation on credit cards has gone wrong in the past and has locked Credit cards out... This usually solves itself and the staff and management are always most helpful in this regard. This seems to have been resolved now however... 3 The beer is too gassy, this is apparently due to the distance the beer has to be raised from the cellar to the tap, the larger the drop between tap and keg the higher the pressure of CO2 (or CO2 substitute) that needs to be applied to the keg to get it to flow out of the tap. This leads to higher CO2 absorption and therefore the more gas in the beer, which can leave you, the customer, somewhat bloated... Perhaps a visit from a beer dispense expert might provide a solution to resolve this... So 3 minor issues, 1 resolved 2 minor or quick to resolve...

The hotel is new, fairly clean, and relatively well maintained. I woke up the first morning to a mini- bar flooding the room. The staff corrected this and replaced the mini- bar before my return that afternoon. The housecleaning service was not the best. One day, I watched the maid merely brush off the bedsheets, make a mad dash through the bathroom, and disappear in 4 minutes flat. There was always hair on the floor in the room in the corners and the carpeting outside the room was constantly dirty. The Hilton website is extremely non- intuitive, and logs users out after 10 minutes. Another nice touch, and really invites potential customers in. I stayed here for 7 days during a business trip based on the recommendations of a colleague. Upon checking in, I was informed that breakfast was an extra 20\u20ac, then I was informed that breakfast was included. No mention of a rate change was made. I signed their little check in form and everything was fine. My colleague had made parallel reservations and stayed a few days less than I, therefore he was not around at check out to make a correction. Upon getting back to the office and comparing notes, I found I was charged 4\u20ac more per day. Upon calling the hotel, I was told that I did not get the government rate. Odd, considering that my colleague got the government rate, and he made reservations for both of us. I was informed that since I signed their little contract, they would not adjust the rate.

A cleaning lady was called in and she made an argument with he waiter on why this couldn't wait until after breakfast.... not good... a clean floor is a must in any restaurant imho. Maybe the double use of tables is caused by the fact that most hotel guests are put in the corner closest to the kitchen making walking distance for the waiters less ?

The Hilton Madrid has five stars and the rate was quite cheap for a five star hotel but the location provides this price too. I arrived around 21.45 at the Madrid Barajas airport and after collecting my luggage I proceeded outside where it was 4 degrees Celcius. I waited at the bus stop for the hotels Shuttle bus. I had to wait about ten minutes before the new Mercedes van came to pick us up. The driver took our luggage and put it in the back and we seated in the little bus. The bus was very luxurious and after a 10 minute ride we arrived at the hotel. I took my luggage inside and proceeded to the Hhonors check in. Our 3 night stay was booked under Hilton Hhonors Gold membership. I had to wait a few minutes and I checked in with Ms. Mihaela. She was first very friendly and asked if I had a good trip etc. She explained some things in the hotel and told me there were two towers and I could choose in which one I wanted my room to be. I took the central tower and got a room on the 3rd floor. However she refused me access to the club lounge, refused give me breakfast instead, internet or a room upgrade. I was at all not happy with it but I then asked if I could speak with her supervisor. He was busy but she went to the offices behind the reception and then she said they made a big exception and I will get complimentary breakfast during my stay. I was not very happy but I was tired so I would arrange it next day. I took one of the three glass elevators to the third floor and my room was almost at the corner of the hotel. I entered my room and it was way too hot. I immediately put the air conditioning on the lowest but it still did not cool properly. On the right side of the room was a walk in bathroom with shower, bath, sink and another glass door with a toilet behind it. There was a mix from old and new bath products but in one of my towels was a hole in it. Opposite of the bathroom was a closet with safe. I had a big King bedded room with a big TV, desk and a very nice red chair. I had no view at all. I looked on the indoor swimming pool and other rooms from the other tower. There was no welcome drink, no fruit or not even a complimentary bottle of water in the room. Also there was a kettle but no tea bags or coffee. Next morning around 10.00 I proceeded to the main restaurant for breakfast in the atrium next to the Christmas tree. I had to wait a while before someone came and took me to a table but a man brought me to a table but did not ask if I wanted to drink something or did not even bring orange juice. I was sitting there for about 10 minutes and still nobody of the three staff members came to me and I had to watch people entering the restaurant and they are brought to the table and they get orange juice and they are asked if they want to drink something. After a while again, I asked if I could have a Hot chocolate. I had a look at the buffet. It was good and had a wide choice of charcuterie and especially the fresh smoked salmon was excellent. There are some juices and you can even make a fresh one yourselves. There is a chef and many hot dishes. I made a toast and when I sat at my table I got my hot chocolate. I received a small can of milk and a cheap bag with powder on my table. I was shocked to receive it in a 5 star hotel. I could not even expect this in a three star hotel and it was more like a self service highway restaurant breakfast. On my table were a few dirty and empty glasses and plates but everyone failed to take them away for me. I had to eat next to dirty plates. Food was filled by sometimes but service was nonexistent. Next after breakfast I proceeded to the reception because they sell small souvenirs I asked somebody from the reception for buying a Madrid Bull, and I asked if I needed to pay cash. He told me that it was the best thing to do. I so got my wallet from my room and asked to Mr. Hernan for buying the bull but he told me there were all sold out. The other receptionist tols there still where some so he looked and there were still some. It took a while but I received my small bull. Then I asked him the front desk supervisor. Mr. Martin came to me and I asked him about the lounge access and benefits and he immediately apologized for it and gave me a key card for access to the executive lounge and some internet vouchers. He was very, very friendly and helpful too. I asked to Mr. Luis for the shuttle bus and I reserved the shuttle bus to the city center at 12.15 just after noon. At 12.07 I got a telephone call from reception saying if I still wanted to come because everyone was waiting for me. I answered that I have still 8 minutes but I came downstairs. The bus was full but I was put in the front seat next to someone else and it was extremely tight and I felt closed in by the other guest. The driver had turned all air-conditioning and heating out so there was no air circulation in the car. After 20 minutes we arrived in the city center, close to the Prado Museum and other highlights. After diner around 21.00 I arrived back in the hotel and went to the club lounge. Strangely Ms. Mihaela, who checked me in was now working in the club lounge. The afternoon snacks were gone and there was still some drinks, chips and alcoholic drinks. The lounge was modern but not very big. There were two computers and a printer. Soft drinks and beers are available the whole day. Ms. Mihaela was very busy and stood alone in the lounge. There were some guests asking for difficult strong spirits so she had to take care of that but then there was nobody left in the club lounge so there were still some empty glasses and plates. When she came back she cleared everything and she did her outmost best. Sometimes another very friendly staff member takes some carts with empty glasses out of the lounge. Ms. Mihaela does her outmost best and everyone gets a very personal service and she is very guest minded, an excellent example how every staff member in the hotel has to be. Maybe in the weekend an extra staff member is needed in the lounge and in the morning in the restaurant. The club lounge closed at 23.00 and I went back in my room and slept well. Next morning again breakfast and I told Mr. Martin about breakfast previous day and he promised me it would not happen again. Unfortunately when I waited for getting a table I had to wait again 5 minutes before someone came to me and gave me a table. There is a clear sign saying wait here to be seated but I cannot wait forever. A lady brought me to a table but again did not gave me orange juice or asked if I wanted something to drink. Ten minutes later again nothing, nobody came or passed my table and again the manager gives orange juice and drinks to everybody but me when they enter the restaurant. I asked if Mr. Carlos would come and I confronted him with the fact I was waiting for someone to give me something to drink and asked why he brings orange juice but the other staff members don\u2019t. He answered arrogantly that we have to order and if we do not order they assume I do not want to drink anything. I was shocked of his arrogant reaction. He left, without asking what I would like to drink. One minute later he turned around and asked what I would like to drink. I said I want a hot chocolate, but not a bag and milk on my table but one cup of hot chocolate. He did not understand me and came back 5 minutes later that he does not have a drink like that. I had to explain him that I want a cup with hot milk and powder in it and that stirred. He finally understood it and brought it to me later on. Food was again good but on a moment there were a lot of things empty, bread, jamon, fruit. Maybe it was a change of shift because ten minutes later everything was filled by again. I came back from the city center around 17.30 and headed for the club lounge. Again the friendly Ms. Mihaela was working in the lounge and was preparing for the evening snacks. She was working alone, very hard. The snacks were rather limited and it were not the best one I have eaten. There were some cakes and pastries and some breads and some hot snacks. I spoke the whole evening with some other guests and around 20.30 Ms. Mihaela came and asked if wee needed still something from the buffet as it closed a bit later. Ms. Mihaela was very caring about her guests but left sometimes when other people needed her downstairs. I asked her for a late check out and I got one at 15.00 and after that I printed my boarding card from the designated computer in the lobby, free of charge. Next morning last breakfast and I was greeted on time and brought to a table by the manager, Mr. Carlos and he informed me he could make fresh hot chocolate that day. In the afternoon I checked out with Ms. Ana and Ms. Mihaela and I took the shuttle bus to the airport. The hotel is located very close to the airport but no noise at all as the runway and paths of airplanes do not cross the hotel. There is a free shuttle bus to all terminals every 15 minutes. To reach the city center you can either take the very less frequent shuttle bus to the city center or walk 15 minutes to the closest metro and then sit in it for about 15 stops, 30 minutes. The hotel is located in the middle of nowhere but next to the metro station is a supermarket but no restaurants in the neighborhood. I would definitely stay again in the hotel if service is better in some departments. Some staff members are excellent like Mr. Martin and Ms. Mihaela, both a terrific example how everyone has to be.

So this was already given before I got there, and I did not even have to ask for it. Thats how it should be for Elite members. I had obtained a good rate as I reserved/paid in advance, so with the upgrade (executive floor, FREE breakfast and Internet) the value for money was excellent. I arrived and did not even go to the room as someone was picking me up for lunch, and he called and asked me for a banana for his son, and the hotel was quick and efficient in getting it. Check in was VERY SPEEDY, though I had checked-in on line, and already had the room allocated. When I was checking in, I needed to send an email and they were very fast in giving me the access codes. The problem with the Internet was that you can only connect ONE item at a time, and my son was with me with his laptop and iPad, I had my Laptop, iPad and iPhone, so we had to take it in turns to connect. I arrived back at the hotel late at night, and we were checking out in the AM so I did not really see anything of the hotel, but what I did see was excellent. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were nice and big. The Twin room had TWO single beds, not TWIN beds. My son was in bed and the only problem, which I had seen in other reviews was finding the light switch of the toilet (I never did not at night nor in the morning). Due to the modern glass separations in the room (room/bathroom/toilet, the room is not adequate for sharing with people you are not too comfortable with). There was limited Shower-Gel for a twin room, and when you are in a hurry in the morning sometimes you can't afford to call house keeping and wait, so we had to use the soap bars - so it was not total chaos. Also by mistake there were 2 conditioners in the shower but no Shampoo. Breakfast was good though I only had tea and toast, but I checked the whole setup. The toaster was very good. The shuttle service was in time, and there was a large group, so it filled up, but the drivers/bellboy were quick enough to decide that the other coach should also go, and in one minute the problem was solved. Also the distance if you are going to T1,2,or 3 is very very near. T4 is further, but I think there are no hotels much nearer to T4. Overall EXCELLENT hotel for airport and if you get the prepaid rates an excellent value. All the staff were courteous, and efficient. Also noticed they had a car rental desk, which I did not use, but always nice specially in Airport hotels. Might even repeat even if I don't have an early morning flight.

It is close to the airport but I would not stay here and try to sight-see in Madrid, you\u2019re just too far away (the taxi ride from the train station in downtown Madrid to here was about 22E including tip). The hotel is ultra modern in design and you\u2019ll either love it or hate it. There are two towers and all rooms appear to open off the atriums. Our room was smallish but they manage to fit in a desk and an easy chair; the space is extremely well used. The bed was a queen size. Check-in was efficient and polite both times. Things to keep in mind: first, this is evidently a conference center type of hotel. When the conference groups have dinner in the atrium you may hear some noise from that (not much but it\u2019s there). If there are conference groups at the hotel you may also find that they have mobbed some of the facilities (this was the case our first night there). Another thing to keep in mind is that the room is ultra modern meets industrial in design. Our bathroom was enclosed in fogged glass panels. The toilet is behind another set of fogged glass panels. I wouldn\u2019t want to share this room with someone that I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with as there is little left to the imagination. The sliding glass panel doors don\u2019t completely close all the way by design so you\u2019re never going to have real privacy. The room has an adequate amount of storage. Everything you\u2019ll need is here, including a kettle and a bedside clock (unusual in Spain based on my experience). Once the sun set our AC seemed to make progress on cooling down the room; the room get the brutal afternoon sun this time of year and really heats up. There is a tiny, tiny balcony outside our room and a door that actually opens onto it. Think more of a catwalk. I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would want to make use of that tiny thing. My big disappointment with this hotel was the bar staff (this is also where you'll eat if you don't feel like a sit down dinner in the restaurant). If you ask them for something specific they\u2019re quick to respond but they seem to have little, if any, initiative to do things on their own. Both of the times we were there (as well as friends of ours who were there earlier) we found that in the bar area you need to go get the bartender\u2019s/server\u2019s attention if you want anything. They\u2019ll do what you ask but that\u2019s it (it never seems to occur to them to ask if you want another drink, if you have everything you need, if there\u2019s anything else they can get you, etc.). We found the same type of behavior in the dining area during the morning buffet. Extra expense: they charge 17E/day for internet, which is ridiculous. Drinks are over priced. The morning breakfast buffet is absurdly priced if you have to pay for it by itself but it seems you can get it at a discount either when you first book the room or when you first check-in, but you'll have to ask for it (when we asked at check-in they offered us a package price for breakfast and internet service). There is shuttle service between the hotel and the airport. Dining options are very limited here. So, bottom line, if you\u2019re looking to fly out early and want a place for the night, and you\u2019re not shy in the bathroom, this is an option. The high-tech design is interesting and fun to experience but I can\u2019t say that I was impressed by it (allow extra time to find all the light switches).

On the plus side, we didn't have to pay for the room, as we used our Hilton points to pay for it. On the other hand, the non-included charges were almost as much as a Hilton would charge for a room normally. We spent about 2 hours getting to the hotel from the airport. It's only about 5 minutes away, but nobody on the staff could articulate exactly how to get there, and in an airport (with a LOT of signs), it can be very confusing. The fact that the hotel had a sign about 1 foot long, posted at about waist-high at the turn-off, didn't help us find it at all. The service at this hotel is outstanding. maybe it's the friendly Spanish attitude, but we felt immediately that we were welcome and at home. The hotel was quite noisy, but that's less an issue with the hotel, and more an issue with the ten thousand teenagers staying there for World Youth Day 2011. But despite Hormonefest 2011, we still managed to have a quiet, relaxing night. The food is overpriced at this hotel, even for Spain. There is a separate charge for the executive lounge (even for Hilton Gold members like me), and the food in there was adequate at best. A few pieces of room temperature cheese, some cookies, and a few apples; this isn't what I paid an extra 20 Euros per night for. However, the wine might have made up for it...they have a pretty good selection. One tip-unless you ABSOLUTELY have to have internet, don't bother with buying the service. It costs too much for what you get, and is not that reliable. The beds (like most Hiltons) are extremely comfortable...if you need to sleep while you're on a business trip to Madrid, this is the place to do it. And once you find out how the he!! to get around the crazy industrial area the hotel is in, it's really convenient for air travel.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cWow what a great place\u201d", "Author": "JSMinMN", "ReviewID": "UR118962641", "Content": "It's by the airport so a bit out of the city.

I stayed one night while on business. For obvious reasons (it's an airport hotel) the area surrounding the hotel doesn't offer much excitement, you're virtually stuck among warehouses and what looks like factory buildings, so if you plan to base yourself beyond a one-nighter you'll be making a mistake. The big draw with this hotel would be the excellent rooms. I have to say the room are as good as you can expect at any 5 star hotel. They're slick, stylish, spacious, comfortable. Rooms are amazing, let there be no doubt. On the flip side of the coin I would point out a couple of major let downs: 1) The wi-fi is priced at an incredible 20 euros for 24 hours. Which is both unnecessary and annoying. Why charge such an extortionate fee for 24 hours in a hotel where the average guest probably just stays for a night, while waiting for a connection at Barajas. On a general note, there's nothing that annoys me more than hotels who charge for wi-fi, just hide it in the price by adding a couple of euros - it would stop people feeling short changed and ripped off. 2) The attitude of the receptionists was really hit or miss. The guy checking me in was quite professional and friendly, whereas his male colleague checking me out (early morning) got annoyed for some inexplicable reason and didn't even bother saying goodbye!

I would advise an executive room to anyone staying on business, as the executive lounge facilities were also excellent.

During my stay the Spanish Air Traffic Controllers went on strike, causing a surge of hopeful travellers descending upon the hotel.

First the positives: The hotel is near the airport and if you are waiting to catch an early flight then this is a good choice since there is a free shuttle that runs to the airport regularly. We also did not hear any airport noise. We visited the pool and found it to be ok the chairs were comfortable but weird. The rooms we had were satisfactory; we requested and received connecting rooms which is nice when travelling with a family. On the down side: the hotel is not convenient to central Madrid, it is about a 30 minute and 25 euro cab ride to get downtown. You can walk to the Metro, but this takes about 20 minutes crossing a busy highway and another at least 40 minute metro ride to Gran Via. There is nothing nearby such as restaurants, shops or attractions. The hotel overlooks a highway on the side we were on, so there is not much to see. The hotel restaurant was very expensive for a buffet and the selection is not very good. The bar was very expensive, as well. The hotel is not warm; it is poorly decorated and feels like you are in a public office building rather than a hotel. The hotel staff were terse they seemed more concerned with getting their work done than serving their customers!

This hotel is a modern style hotel with lots of glass and the minimalist feel. Aesthetically, it is a beautiful hotel and the rooms are very modern contemporary and beautiful. It has a full spa with sauna and steam rooms and a pool. A small gym with tread mills and an cable machine. They also have a free shuttle to and from the airport and it is roughly a 5 -10 minute drive So if you want to feel like you have not left the US, this is a great place for you. They also have an executive lounge for Hilton platinum members with an open bar as well as snacks. the only negative part is you must consume everything in the lounge and cannot take it to your room. The hotel staff is amazing and very accommodating and were always eager to help , they were excellent!! Also, if you are staying and are Platinum, you do get free internet access. But overall, I didn't really like my stay, and this is what i struggled with. I was in Madrid and It didn't feel like I was in Madrid. The hotel is roughly a 20 Euro ride out of downtown Madrid and if you do take the metro , which we did, it is about a 35 minute ride and a 5 -10 minute walk, so going to and from the hotel can either be arduous or expensive. Also, since the hotel is \"modern\" the bathrooms are not exactly the most private. The doors to the bathroom are nothing more than sliding glass and they don't go all the way up to the ceiling, so if you want real \"privacy\" while you are using the toilet, that could be a challenge (especially if you are traveling on a romantic trip) Luckily we were a couple guys so we didn't care as much. I usually like modern contemporary design but for some reason , the hotel seemed very cold and sterile. All in all, If I had to overnight near the airport, I would definitely stay here, but if I wanted to really get a feel for Madrid, I would stay in town, especially with the prices this place charges.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cMagnificent, first-class hotel\u201d", "Author": "Rynt", "ReviewID": "UR115352240", "Content": "We needed to stay very close to Madrid airport for our return home to Canada (6 a.m. departure). It was difficult to part with 171 euros for the night but we did it anyway. Compare this price to other hotels on our trip (e.g., the Cala Grande on the Cabo de Gata) and you may wonder at the cost. We are not used to paying these prices unless we are going to a very special destination. However, convenience apart, it was such a beautiful place to stay in and I was very sad we could not stay the full 24 hours! The young staff are so genuinely interested in service and do their job with obvious enthusiasm and devotion. Although the meal prices are very high, the quality of the food at dinner matched its surroundings: magnificent! sumptuous! And, although it's true we had to pay a lot for our club sandwiches at lunch (17e each), they were the best I've ever had. Wine is much cheaper by the bottle, as we discovered at dinner. Considering the quality of the cuisine, 78e was a bargain compared to a similar meal in Canada!!! Yet, since we'd eaten our way through the delicious offerings of Barcelona, Valencia, Granada and Seville at ridiculously low prices, it felt expensive. The rooftop terrace and pool were a definite bonus....though the pool was icy, the sunbath afterwards was splendid. One more thing: the chic bathrooms! There was glass everywhere and beautiful green marble floors. However, having once been a chambermaid in my student years, I feel terribly sorry for the cleaners who must maintain these gorgeous glass vanities. But everything was immaculate in spite of it! I note that someone complained in his/her review, about noise. We heard nothing to disrupt our sleep. But I am also impressed that Sr. Clement Felus (General Manager) immediately replied to this concern in a personal note on Tripadvisor. This is the mark of a truly great hotel. I am sure this is also one reason the staff seem so happy to wrok there. And if you have any problems at all in a hotel, the time to complain is WHEN YOU ARE THERE!

It is not a great location if you are on-foot, and want to explore the center of Madrid. There is no easy way to get the the center of the city, and you must wait for taxis. You might feel trapped on the outskirts of the city if you don't have transportation, although I believe that it is a brief walk to the subway station. If you have transportation (e.g., have a ride, taxi, or a car) it is a great base. The parking garage is 15 Euros/night and it is almost always empty, clean and very convenient to get in/out.

Also, if you don't have Executive Lounge access then you can't email them a boarding pass to print out.

This would be a perfect place to stay for a night on a layover at Madrid airport. For those who want to use this Hilton as a sightseeing base (as we did, as we were using Hilton points for a free stay), there are a few negatives. The only venue within walking distance of the hotel is a modest mall (and even that requires walking 20 minutes, part of it through a mid-level barrio, and crossing a busy street on a pedestrian bridge). It is possible to walk to the Metro in 10 minutes through a decent neighborhood - and the stop is the first on the #5 line, so it is easy to get a seat on a trip into the city. But the Metro ride then takes around 30 minutes to reach central Madrid, and changing lines can add several more minutes. There was a strike of the Metro workers while we were staying at this Hilton, and it really crippled our sightseeing for a couple of days. Taxis to downtown Madrid are 20 to 25 euros and hold a maximum of 4 passengers. We found that some taxi drivers could not locate the Hilton entrance (indeed, it is easy to see it but hard to drive to it). Once you are in the hotel, you are somewhat isolated with few options. We did locate one Madrid sightseeing company (Madrid Day Tours, aka Spain Day Tours) that will provide private tours of Madrid and nearby cities (Toledo, Avila, Segovia, etc.) with pick-up and drop-off directly at the hotel. We found this service well worth the extra cost given the location of the Hilton.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Belfast", "Title": "\u201cOne of My favorite 4*\u201d", "Author": "MikePM", "ReviewID": "UR68844886", "Content": "Perfect Airport location, but very hard to find by Car of Cab/Taxi.

I was concerned because some reviews said that taxi drivers had trouble finding the hotel, but the one who picked us up at the train station knew where it was and didn't even need to use his GPS. We were on a Reward stay but, as is typical of Hilton's gracious treatment of guests on reward stays at its European properties, we were upgraded to a room on the Executive floor with lounge access. The lounge actually had a better selection of evening food than the one at the Hilton Diagonal Mar in Barcelona where we'd just been, with a friendly young trainee named Pierre working hard to anticipate everyone's needs and offer refills and extra food. The breakfast offerings in the lounge were slimmer than in Barcelona; mostly breads and cereals. Free breakfast in the restaurant was also available so we chose that. It was fine- the usual breads, cheeses, meats as well as hot items. The lounge had 2 computers with free Internet access. Connection in the room was expensive so I didn't bother with it. I loved the pool- it had a moveable roof over both the pool and sundeck so that the extent of coverage could vary with the outdoor temperature. Ah, but then there's the bad news. They appear to have given some interior designer carte blanche to make the rooms stylish without any notion as to how it would work when actual humans lived in them. The floors in the bathroom, including the shower, were so slick when wet that we put down towels because my husband has a bit of a balance problem. The walls are frosted glass. This means that if you turn on the light when you use it at night you risk disturbing the sleep of the other room occupant. This might cause one to (theoretically, of course) use the bidet instead of the toilet since they both feel the same in the dark. Oops. The shower was lined with mirrors but they steamed up immediately, so my husband noted that they were useless for shaving. The sink was a giant scoop-shaped indentation in the glass countertop, which left little room around the edges for toiletries. This lack of attention to practicality was continued in the restaurant at breakfast where they eschewed plebian salt shakers at the table in favor of bowls of various fancy sea salts at the buffet. You should also ask about airport shuttle times; I overheard the doorman say that during certain times of the day the drivers take breaks and then the shuttle runs only hourly. Make sure you know which one to take.

The driver was extremely courteous and it was a short trip to the hotel). The hotel is ultra-modern, very much a \"corporate\" and American style Hilton but after all, who stays at the airport if they're looking for a cultural experience.Check-in was quick, with questions answered about dinner and shuttle for the next day. The rooms are ultra-modern....lots of glass and high-tech, which was amusing after a week in more boutique European small hotels. The only food available at night was the dinner buffet -- at first we were disappointed because we prefer menu service and thought we wanted something lighter. But after seeing the buffet, we were happy -- very complete, very fresh foods, and not outrageous (35 euros per person, with a 10% discount offered at check-in) for what many airport hotels can charge. (Still, many guests might want something less and there was absolutely nothing else available.) We also had 2 glasses of wine -- both free with coupons at check in. The airport shuttle the next morning left right on time -- although is was totally full. Not sure what would happen if there were more people than seats. If you need to be at the airport for an early or late flight, the Hilton is a good choice -- close, well-run, new, and the perks (discounts, free wine) certainly made us feel better about a slightly more expensive-than-average night. If we had been in Madrid before the flight, we would probably have stayed downtown and taken a taxi. But we had been in Segovia and had no need to go into downtown Madrid for the last night. It was very convenient to get from Segovia by local train to the Nuevos Ministerios metro stop, then take a short metro ride to the airport.

Such hotel need to be conveniently located, with frequent shuttle service (if not connected to airport directly), clean, efficient for check-in/check-out, business amenities (internet...), flexible hours for room service/restaurant and so on. From the perspective, the Hilton Madrid met my expectation (only \"negative\" was the wait for the shuttle from the airport which was above 20 minutes). The hotel has a very modern and contemporary look throughout. This Hilton property use the NOR-1 system for upgrades at time of check-in. For those not familiar with this system, after booking, it allows one to be on a waiting list for a room in a higher category (such as executive floor or suites) at a deep discount versus regular price. If the \"requested\" upgrade is available at time of check-in, the guest is automatically upgraded for the agreed upon extra. There is a lot of debate on the merit of such system, especially among members of Hilton's frequent guest programs. Some would argue that top members should have access to any rooms, including suite, without having to premiums whereas others see the opportunity to get access to a better room that what they would be entitled to for a deep discount. I actually decided to apply for the upgrade and requested the Health/spa room which include an oversized bathroom with jacuzzi. The room as well is much larger than the standard room and seem to feature upgraded amenities - for a very reasonable premium of 19euros. This was a great room and did not regret my decision The hotel has an executive lounge which features two internet/computer station. Standard complimentary breakfast is available in the morning but top-tier members are also invited to enjoy a complimentary full \"american\" breakfast in the main restaurant. Food was of good quality and service was friendly. Another good thing is that the hotel room had been prepared as requested. Due to allergies, I always request feather pillows/duvet to be removed prior to arrival. i have found that this request is carried appropriately only 50% of the time. Upon check-in, they acknowledged my request and indicated that the upgraded room had been prepared as desired - this is even more important at an airport location where you often either check-in late or check-out early and don't want to waste time dealing with problems/housekeeping...

If your flight to Madrid arrives at Terminal 1, 2 or 3 you\u2019ll have a 10-minute ride in the shuttle bus to the hotel. If you arrive at terminal 4 it\u2019ll be more like 20-25 minutes, as you\u2019ll swing by the other terminals to pick up passengers. We waited 30 minutes before being picked up, making our total journey time from the airport to the hotel almost 55 minutes. I grew up in Glasgow, Scotland and a 2-minute walk from the Holiday Inn lobby takes you right into the terminal building! It\u2019s worth bearing these times in mind when you\u2019re heading for an outbound flight too. When we requested a bus to the airport we were told the driver was on his break and it would be about 45 minutes before we could leave. We opted to get a Taxi instead which cost 18 Euros, despite the meter reading 14 \u2013 either that\u2019s something to do with being dropped on the airport, or it\u2019s a scam! Secondly, the price: Clearly their market is Business Travellers, so this might not come as a shock to some of you. The room price is fine \u2013 I have no complaints about this - but Hilton know how to charge for extras. Examples from the minibar: Coca Cola \u2013 4.50 Euro; bottled water \u2013 3.50 Euros; Snickers bar \u2013 4.50 Euros; and Pringles (a 43gram tub containing perhaps 25 of the potato snacks) \u2013 6.00 Euros. If you fancy a Gin and Tonic it\u2019ll set you back 13 Euros. The nearest shop selling soft drinks and snacks is about 10 minutes walk from the hotel, but it closes at 8 or 9pm. You\u2019d get the Coke, the water, the Snickers and the Pringles for the price of a Coke at the hotel. I also consider the cost of Internet access to be high (That\u2019s right, you have to pay for it!). 24 hours will cost you 22 Euros at the business rate or 17 Euros for the, slower, Economy rate. I pay about this for 1 month\u2019s access at home! You can buy 1 hour of non-consecutive use for 10 Euros. We recently stayed at the lovely Parador de Santa Cruz in the Canary Islands where the Internet access was fast and FREE (and the room rate about half that of the Madrid Hilton!) Here\u2019s a tip though: I didn\u2019t pay for any Internet access but found that Skype (the Voice Over Internet Phone) worked just fine! A couple of other things: The hotel is located in a business area. Nearby buildings are either office blocks or industrial units. If you like to take a stroll after dinner, this place isn\u2019t for you as there\u2019s nothing of note in the vicinity. The Metro station is a 10-15-minute walk and the train takes 30 minutes to get to the heart of Madrid. The two rooms we had were both of a very high standard. Both had a very modern d\u00e9cor of polished wooden floor, glass-fronted wardrobe and glass and chrome furniture. The bathrooms had glass bowls, which were beautiful if slightly impractical. The wall from the shower, which faced into the room, was made of frosted glass - which meant that showering wasn\u2019t a wholly private affair! Overall the rooms were very stylish, but perhaps slightly \u2018cold\u2019. During our second stay we had a \u2018Hilton Deluxe King\u2019 room which was 40 Euro per night more expensive than the standard 79 Euro room. If I chose to stay again, I\u2019d stick to the standard room because I don\u2019t think the difference merits 40 Euros.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel for early airport flights\u201d", "Author": "anchmer", "ReviewID": "UR48971250", "Content": "I used this hotel as purely a stop over between flights - one that arrived late and the other that left early the next morning.

The breakfast is huge and delicious; make sure your rate includes it. Also, be aware that the hotel is located in a very hard-to-find place and isn't on many taxi's GPS systems. But you need to know about a big surprise when you let them call you a taxi instead of just getting in one yourself. This problem was experienced by two other guests as well as me within two days. We went to the lobby to catch a taxi, and planned to go outside and get a taxi that was dropping someone else off - there are always taxis coming and going and you never have to wait more than a few minutes. We were stopped (politely) by the front desk staff asking if we needed a taxi. We said yes, and they said 'we will call you a taxi.' I said no, we'll just go outside and get in a taxi that is dropping someone off, and they said 'no, we need to call you a taxi because no taxis will be outside'. I said 'there are taxis outside all the time and we can wait a few minutes for the next one, there is no rush' but they said 'please let us call a taxi'. So we waited about 5 minutes and a taxi came to drop someone off. We went to the taxi but he said 'did you call? I don't want to take you because this hotel likes to call taxis and they give me a hard time if I pick someone up and I'm not the taxi they called'. Then another taxi came and the bellman said 'this one is your taxi'. We started to get in the second taxi and noticed the meter already had time on it - about E3,75 ($5.60). We said 'you need to reset your meter' and the taxi driver said 'no, I start the meter when they call me'. We got out of the taxi and told the belllman that we would not pay for time when we were not in the taxi, and no one said anything about this policy, and besides we had wanted just to get in a taxi as it was dropping someone off, and it was the hotel that had insisted that we let them call a taxi. He acted shocked and offended and said 'no, you asked us to call a taxi and this is the way they do it and you have to pay'. I said 'I am getting in the other taxi and you better not try to stop me', so we walked toward the first taxi, but the bellman told the other taxi driver to get out of the taxi and went inside to get the manager. So the manager came out and started arguing with us herself! She said the same things: 'you asked us to call a taxi, you have to pay the amount on the meter, you can't get into the other taxi,' etc. We refused and said we would walk down the street to get a taxi but we would under no circumstance pay for the added fees that they caused despite our clear request to get a taxi that was already there. By this time, the meter was up to almost 6 euros. Then the bellman said 'look, I will pay the taxi myself for the fee - I pay it myself from my own money if you want a free taxi' whereupon I walked up to him and said 'what did you say? I didn't ask for a free taxi - I also didn't ask you to call me a taxi when I get one myself without your extra fee, so don't accuse me of trying to get a free taxi' At long, long last, they finally relented and let the original taxi driver get back in his taxi and take us, and we left the taxi they had called. The following day, the day manager said to us at the front desk 'oh, you are the ones with the taxi last night - my bellman paid for your taxi'. Obviously our story had been shared with the entire staff - how inappropriate. When we arrived at the hotel two days earlier, a very nice couple was arguing with the bellman about the taxi, and they were very upset. I had not known what they were arguing about at the time. But then I got to know that other couple, who were at the same conference we were, and after all this happened, they told me that the same thing had happened to them - exactly. They were visiting from Nigeria and were still quite upset that the hotel was forcing them to call a taxi when there were taxis right in front of the hotel, and not disclosing the fact that calling a taxi results in an extra fee being added to the fare, in addition to having to wait longer. In other words, this is not an isolated case of someone not understanding something, or an isolated case of some crazy customer wanting special treatment. This is in fact a common occurrence, which demonstrates that normal people do not expect to be treated this way, and also demonstrates the hotel didn't just forget to tell us about the extra fees - they apparently hide these fees from everyone. This is POOR customer service at best, and at worst, is probably indicative of a scheme with local taxi drivers to share the extra profits caused by this absurd policy. It is quite telling how hard the front desk staff tries to get guests to let them call a taxi, and NEVER says a word about the extra fees, or that fact that in most cases while we were there, it would have always been faster to wait for an arriving taxi than to wait for one you call. It was also incredible how long the hotel staff argued with its guests! Not just us, but the other couple, and another couple they knew about - THREE times in two days, hotel staff causing a huge scene outside the hotel trying to force this corrupt scheme onto its own guests. And for the bellman to use sarcasm with me, telling me I wanted a 'free taxi'? It's now been almost a week since this happened, and it amazes me every time I think about it how hotel staff two or three times allowed an angry scene to develop as they argued with their guests about hidden fees.

And offers good directions if you need it. Overall, a great hotel and available thru priceline at a good price. I think my room was $100 before the upgrade that I took. Can upgrade to Exec. level, if you wish, at check in. As mentioned earlier, not a good hotel to tour Madrid as it is a 20 - 30 min. ride to downtown. A caution - pickpockets are a plague of crowded areas, like the Metro. Secure your money and passports if going to such areas. Overall - an excellent hotel to relax upon arrival or before departure. Expensive to eat /park and not real close to many restaurants/shops. If you can get it for E110 or less, a good deal for Europe.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cMagnificent Madrid Hilton is Unique and that is in Black & White with Red all over.\u201d", "Author": "EpicureanFunTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR41723310", "Content": "No one would or should ever stay at an airport Hilton Hotel if they plan on being a tourist in the city. Okay, so we knew that going in but I am a Hilton HH members and I like my perks so instead of staying downtown at the Ritz or the Westin Palace (wasnt that the Sheraton Palace a few years ago) I picked the rediculous Airport Hilton. By the way, I have stayed at both the Ritz and the Palace on previous visits and enjoyed them both. The first impression at any hotel is very important witness my review of the Kensington Hilton where I stayed prior to arrival in Madrid. The situation at this hotel was totally different and took me totally by surprise in a good way. The front desk manager made us feel like we were special in welcoming us to his hotel. The entire staff at the front desk gave a powerful first impression for the hotel. While the hotel is an airport location getting to and from downtown Madrid was easy. The hotel will take you to a central location about half way to the city center where you can get the subway. The hotel, of course, will drop you off at the airport where you can get a subway. And, there is a subway stop in walking distance (a good hike) from the hotel property. Most of all, the subway is easy to navigate and fun for a visitor. The hotel was fun as it breaks the monotonous expectations of typical Hilton properties around the world. This is not your boring airport hotel. The rooms are a nice break for seasoned travelers looking for something different in their sleeping environment. The bathroom doors open up at the V or corner of the bathroom. There is a clear glass sink, seperate commode area and both a shower and tub. The actual bedroom, like the hotel, is black and white with one piece of modern red furniture. Behind the bed is a water color that looks original and provides muted tones in the modern room. No matter how much I travel I am always surprised. This hotel stay took me by surprise when we were stopped walking out of the executive club drinking bottled water. We were told that we had to go back into the lounge and finish our waters before leaving the lounge. I could understand if it were alcohol, but this was water. Oh well, always something new. One morning our order for breakfast (eggs and waffles) took much too long. It appeared that the lady who took our order never followed up to make sure that the food was done. This was a minor problem and rectified on other mornings. My babysitter and children complained that there were not enough chairs around the pool. The pool was very nice and unique as well. I would stay at this hotel again and suggest you give it a try if you want a unique Hilton experience.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms, good experience\u201d", "Author": "coolercb", "ReviewID": "UR40882487", "Content": "We stayed here both when we landed and then came back to wind down after we saw the rest of the region.

Located approximately 1 mile from the international terminal, this hotel is a good choice for the international traveler looking for a clean room prior to or after a long trip.

Following the 15 minute walk though some isolated areas, it is another 30 minute subway ride to the center of Madrid on the busy and crowded line 5. The location was not ideal, but the biggest problem was the service. When I purchased the executive package, I was told that it came with internet access, use of the lounge, and breakfast daily. Unfortunately, the employees were dishonest, and the internet access was only available when the lounge was open which was only for 4 hours on the day that I arrived. Even during those 4 hours, the internet was difficult to use since the 2 computers are in high demand. There is no reason that in-room wireless was not included in the executive package which cost an extra $100. The executive package is clearly a scam. I do not mind paying to allow efficient work during business trips, but I at least expect to receive what I pay for. On a positive note, the rooms were clean and modern. They have good air-conditioning which is a problem in many Madrid hotels. The breakfast buffet was outstanding, and the airport shuttle service was adequate with trips every 15 - 20 minutes.

There's also a good gym and sauna, with pleasant staff in attendance. The breakfast buffet is very good. But - and there are a few buts - the hotel was not even half full when we stayed there and the tables were dirty every day we sat down for breakfast. Similarly, each time we tried to get near reception, there was a 15 minute wait. Understand me - the staff were pleasant, just thin on the ground. We had the impression that the staff were quite frankly overworked, not helped by some of the lengthy and frankly ludicrous queries we overheard from mostly US tourists just grateful to find an Engish speaker. Whatever you do, do not hire a car at the Hilton in Madrid. Their agency - Sixt - is frankly a disgrace. Suffice to say, after weeks of fruitless e-mails, I got through to the ever-helpful Amex to arrange a refund for Sixt overcharging me (2 days car hire instead of 1). Incidentally, if you're driving to the hotel, be warned. It's badly signed (almost non-existent, in fact) and extremely difficult to find. And I lived in Madrid for 11 years. The hotel is fine for a brief, preferably 1-night stay if you're flying in and out - the hotel has a very convenient shuttle to Barajas airport gratis. If you're planning to use the hotel as a base to explore Madrid, forget it. Try the Wellington in downtown Madrid (c/. Velazquez near the Retio park), one of the best hotels in Madrid. The rooms are minimalist, and ok. Beds are not particularly comfortable. Food is very expensive. Brits - order a pint in the bar, not a half measure.

The bathrooms are very cool, with frosted glass doors to the main entry to the bathroom, the shower, and the toilet. Here's the huge negative on this hotel. IT IS NOT CLOSE TO ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT THE AIRPORT. Although the Hilton website says that it is within walking distance from the Metro, and their staff says so as well, IT IS NOT MY RECOMMENDATION TO DO SO. The walk, if you knew exactly how to get from the Metro to the hotel, should take 10-15 minutes. However, this walk involves crossing a major highway, that only has one bridge to cross it. If you don't know where this bridge is or how to get pedestrian access to it, it is impossible to get there. Also, once you get across the bridge, you still have about a 1/4 mile walk, with no sidewalks. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND ONLY GETTING TO THIS HOTEL WITH THE SHUTTLE SERVICE OR BY TAXI (particularly if you have luggage). It's only a 4 euro taxi ride from the metro station, if you can hail a cab. In addition, there are not any restaurants or shopping within walking distance of the hotel. The front desk recommended a mall nearby that was a 15 euro taxi ride. The other option was restaurants back toward the metro station, which is also a cab ride away. There is nothing to do in the near proximity of the hotel, unless you're willing to take a cab. The hotel is very close to the airport and operates a free shuttle to and from the airport, running pretty much whenever you need it, with no more than a 15 minute wait. The pool is very nice, has quite warm water, and some very cool fountains and jets. There is also a sauna in the changing rooms at the pool. The restaurant at the hotel is very expensive. We ate there, just to avoid having to catch cab rides and waste time riding in a cab. The cheapest thing on the menu was a club sandwich at 17 euros, a burger sets you back 23 euros, and a glass of wine was 9 euros.

I got in late that night, and was pretty tired, but they had a very good dinner buffet which made things easy for the weary traveler. The airport shuttle was free, and you didn't even need to make a reservation. And the room rate of 175 Euros was quite reasonable considering what you get. The only drawback is that the hotel is near the airport but not very close to anything else.

The only downer about the room is the view out of the balcony window. On every floor there is an ice room which is very helpful. They have a pool which is sort of inside but the roof opens up. The sun loungers are the best the are leather. They also have a gym,sauna and a steam room.The staff are very friendly and helpful. To the nearest shopping centre is about 20 mins away. You can see it out of the hotel but you have to walk the long way because the hotel is situated on a motorway. You can also walk to the nearest metro station, which is about 10 mins away.

You must take a taxi should you decide to dine outside of the hotel. The food in the hotel restaurant is good, but it is VERY high priced. Outrageous really. The front desk or guest service is good during regular day hours, however, I tried to call down for a wake up call and got no one. I tried over and over again and finally called room service to go get someone at the front desk to call my room. I had even tried to call the hotels main number directly to get a response, but they didn't answer that phone either. I speak only English and found many of the staff unable to understand me, but I guess there is two ways to look at that. Perhaps I should learn Spanish if traveling to a mostly Spanish speaking country. I had a \"Presidential Floor\" 5th floor room and while it was spacious and well appointed, my 5th floor view was of another wing of their building. This may be trivial, but there is not a gift shop at all where you can get simple things like lip balm (Chapstick) or such items you may realize you need or want. In short, new is nice, but consider if you want to taxi everywhere, if you want to spend a bundle on food at the hotel, if you want front desk sevice whenever you need it, a gift shop, and perhaps you may want to stay elsewhere. New is not always best. Oh, and the elevators were not working on my arrivel, but then, the property is new and I guess they have to work through some things like that.

The hotel is still working out some glitches, but all staff at the hotel were trying very hard to please and did an excellent job. Luckily, the shuttle bus arrived at Terminal 4 just a few minutes after I got there. The hotel's phone number is not on the list of shuttle buses at the stop, so I'd recommend that you bring the phone number with you so that you can call if necessary. On arrival, I was upgraded to the \"Presidential\" floor (one of two Executive floors) and given access to the Executive lounge. This might have been a perk of having Gold status with Hilton (but no doubt was also due to the fact that occupancy levels were low). My large room was stylishly decorated in black and white, with a striking and quirky red armchair. The bathroom featured a separate shower (with rain shower head) and bath, a heated floor and speakers. I visited the Executive Lounge, where I enjoyed a glass of cava, a few munchies (not as good a selection as the Paris-CDG Hilton but still decent) and checked my email. (The Lounge has two terminals; in-room access to internet is about 17 or 18 euros a day). I also tried the restaurant for a light dinner (well-executed linguine with clams) and for breakfast the next day. The breakfast spread is extensive. I would recommend budgeting at least 45 minutes from the time you check out to take the shuttle to your terminal. I was told that the shuttle was expected at 10:30, but it didn't show up until close to 10:50. Because I was in a hurry, I asked to be dropped off first (at T1), and the trip took a little under 10 minutes. If you're going to T4 and the shuttle stops at other terminals first, it could take you 25 minutes or so to get to your terminal. All in all, in was a very pleasant experience. I would even consider staying here again for a city-focused visit, because the price was great and it would be feasible to take the Hilton shuttle to the airport and then the metro into the city.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay near the airport\u201d", "Author": "Roger_GB", "ReviewID": "UR16605685", "Content": "This is a stunning new property \u2013 opened 1st June 2008 \u2013 bright, large and modern rooms, stunning public areas, funky bar and restaurant.
