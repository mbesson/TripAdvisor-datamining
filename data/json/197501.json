Room was great - it was only a standard room but it was big by paris standards and the mirror on the ceiling was definitely a talking point! Unlike others on this site, our bathroom was fine - the loo was separate from the rest of the bathroom and behind a proper door so no problem there, the bathroom was well laid out, just a curtain between that and the bedroom but no problem. Fantastic shower - like being in a monsoon! the shower head must have been a foot square, and enough water pressure to make it worth while. Staff were really helpful: as others have said and the welcome was warm and friendly. Local bars and restaurants offer a good choice of something to eat or drink and then of course you have the whole of paris to go at! The hotel does breakfast now, unlike some of the info given by other reviewers - in room or buffet style. All very efficient If I'm in Paris again soon I will definitely return.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Union Beach, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWhat An Experience!!!!\u201d", "Author": "maryish81", "ReviewID": "UR125187693", "Content": "Mac Mahon was conveniently located a block away from the Champs Elysees and the metro was less than 500 feet from us.

When we first arrived, our room wasn't exactly what we wanted, and we were moved immediately and without question or extra charge to a larger room, with a shower and a lovely view of the top of the Arc De Triumphe. As all European lodging is usually tight, the room that was given to us was more than sufficient in space. Price for the location and space is unbeatable.

We were greeted by 2 of the most friendly hotel staff I have met - who also spoke perfect English, which helped after a nightmare journey (tip - for 55 euros you can get a taxi from the airport. worth every penny as the train was horrible and took AGES - and we had to get a taxi from the station anyway!) Upon finding out we were on honeymoon, they immediately upgraded our room and we ended up with the most amazing view of the arc de triomphe. The room was spacious, flawlessly clean and beautifully decorated with the most comfy bed I've ever slept in. You're able to book open top bus tickets from the hotel reception and it's just a short walk to the Champs Elysees where the bus picks up, worth doing as this is the easiest way to see Paris in a short time.
