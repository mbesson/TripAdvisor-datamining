There was dust everywhere, the area under the bed looked as if it had not been cleaned in the recent past, there was hair wrapped around the dust on the leaves of the dying plant and the bathroom was moldy.

We went with some trepidation as we were on the ground floor and had read the reviews about it being noisy etc. We were greeted warmly with a cup of coffee and directions to wherever we wanted to go. The great thing about being on the ground floor was that there was only 1 small flight of stairs to go down. The room itself was beautifully decorated and the bed amazingly comfortable. But you could tell that the room had been designed for its fabulousness rather than practicality as the cupboards and surfaces felt a little wobbly. The room had been recently decorated and was very clean. It wasn't a huge room but my sister and I managed to not get under each others feet. If you intended on spending a lot of time in the room it may begin to feel a little bijou. As other reviewers have said there is no shower curtain, but this I believe was left out as it would have spoilt the lines of the bathroom. The sink tap was fabulous but rather impractical to use (you banged your head if you tried to wash your face so it was easier to use the bath tap). The bathroom was quite small but space was also an issue in my friends more expensive hotel. The door was glass but I believe this is quite common in that part of the world as my friends hotel also had a glass door and so did the hotel I stayed in, in Brussels. This in itself wasn't as big a problem as I expected, you just made sure you didn't put the light on in the bathroom if you were having a shower or were on the loo!! The area was much nicer that up towards Dam square, much prettier and more peaceful. Even in the hotel it was very quiet. It was about a 30 to 40 min picturesque walk from everything so we had no need to get a cab. If I visited Amsterdam again and wanted to stay on the outskirts I would definitely stay there again.

We paid around 400 euro for a 3 night stay in October. ROOMS The rooms are a fair size for a city hotel and bathrooms were modern but on the small side. We were on the second floor of the hotel. As it is a converted Dutch town house, the stairs would most certainly be a problem for the older / less fit traveller. We had a philips Senseo coffee maker in our room (only the upstairs rooms have this), which was fab!!! The coffee was amazing and we were able to make tea also. We bought our own milk which we kept in the fridge in the room. LOCATION The hotel is located on the Nassaukade which is quite a busy road facing a canal. The road noise was not a problem in the autumn, but could be during warmer weather when you might want to open the windows. The hotel is close to the bars and shops of the leidseplein. Have a good explore down the side streets to get the best prices for food and souveniers. STAFF We found the staff to be really helpful in general. I had e-mailed the hotel to advise them that we would be arriving at 11am and were able to take our room early. I had had a bit of a problem at Schipol - i had left my i-phone on the aircraft and the flight staff were claiming it was nowhere to be found :( Robert offered to lend us a mobile phone for our trip and provided me with a laptop to change all of my passwords to e-mail etc. BREAKFAST The breakfast offered at the hotel is 10 Euro and very simple. Although it looked good, bread, cheese and cold meats isn't my cup of tea, so we went out. ATTRACTIONS DEfinatley buy a ticket for the CANAL BUS. THe other companies are not as reliable and the price is really competitive. We also went on the pizza cruise - dominoes pizza and ben & jerrys ice cream with unlimited drinks - soft, wine, beer. Gassan diamonds is very good, the tours are very personal (my husband and i were the only people in our tour group!) and doesn't cost anything.

Location: The hotel is located in a good location close to many of the sights and museums. Its just far enough out of the downtown area so you are not bombarded by non-stop stag and hen parties without it being too far to travel into the centre. Its perhaps a 15 minute walk to Dam Square. Room: Quite stylish but let down by a few basic design flaws. There is a serious lack of wardrobe / cupboard space for 2 people and little room to store suitcases or bags. The lack of a full door to the bathroom is a more serious issue. Anyone using the toilet is basically unleashing the sound and smells to anyone else in the room. Fine for a solo traveller but for 2 people not so good. The shower area in the bathroom is not fully enclosed meaning that the entire bathroom floor gets very wet when ever anyone uses the bathroom. One of my colleagues slipped in their bathroom during the stay, hardly surprising given how wet the floor was. A female colleague commented to me that in her opinion the cleanliness of bathroom wasn't all it could be either. The free wif-fi is fast and easy to connect to. The Stairs: I read a few reviews on tripadvisor before I left and had dismissed the complaints about the stairs as being from our Americans friends not used to European accommodation. I was very very wrong. The stairs are VERY steep and have very narrow turns on them. I would be very nervous about anyone with any problems with stairs tackling these. I understand completely the comments about this being a typical Dutch house, however they are simply the steepest stairs I have ever seen in a hotel. It should be noted there is no lift. Breakfast: 10 Euros, its fairly good value buffet style. You can get cheaper in Amsterdam but its a decent way to start your day as the breakfast room is light and airey. Staff: I found the staff to be very helpful, although the hotel is unmanned between 7pm & 9am. We had some noise issues with very noisy guests over night during our stay and were unable to speak to anyone regarding them. I really want to like this hotel as I had an amazing time in Amsterdam, I do feel though its let down by some basic elements.

The location was excellent, really close everywhere where we wanted to go. First problem we encountered was already on arrival. There is no reception after 9 o'clock! Luckkily one of was arrived just in time otherwise there would have been a 15e extra charge for \"late\" check-in!!! This really wasn't mentioned on the website when making the reservation! Also the pictures on their website have been taken with some wide angle lense, the hotel and the rooms were REALLY small! I was travelling with a friend and requested a twin room. The hotel replied that they have no twins, only doubles. Fair enough. What they forgot to mention is that none of the double beds are full size!! The bed was only 140cm wide and there was just one blanket for us to share!! That's what I have for me alone at home! Now that would be fine with a significant other but with a friend - I don't think so! Especially when we are both quite large size people. We did get another blanket when requested but the bed still stayed the same... Another thing which was a bit embarrassing when travelling with a friend was the bathroom doors: there was no proper door, just a glass doors through which you could easily see and hear everything that went on inside! Not for the shy ones...Also the room was so tiny there was no space to open suitcases and the only table space was the small night stands. I mean it would be ok for 1 night but 2 girls on a 3-day shopping spree??!! But the receptionist Juan really made up for everything. He was so welcoming and nice. Also we really liked the decor of the place, very nice and modern. Only the stairs were really really steep inside and outside. Also this would have been nice to have known in advance. Our room (nr10) was really quiet on the garden side, we woke to bird song in the mornings! Breakfast was not included in room price, it was 10e and quite adequate.

Checking into the room was a litlle more challenging, we have never seen such steep, narrow stairs with a wind at the top before. Whatever you do, please make sure that you have not been visiting one of the local \"coffee shops\" or had a beer too many before attempting to carry your luggage up these stairs. The stairs are dizzying, and we spent our stay with the concern of getting our cases back down when it was time to leave. The room was small and very basic, too much attention to presentation rather than guest needs or requirements. The bathroom was uncomfortable to use, and more privacy would not have gone amiss when considering the design of this room. Even though you are advised in advance of the lack of availability of the staff, and accept that this is OK, the expectation is that there will be no problems during the stay.

It would seem previous travelers don't have the same standards as us. Design : This is where they have put all their efforts and how they justify the price of the room. The clerk made sure to point out the details to us while we were checking in. They have done a good job of transforming a normal Amsterdam house in a small hotel, but get ready to carry your luggage in a tiny winding staircase. Location : The hotel is situated in a great spot of Amsterdam if you want to visit the museums and do some sight-seeing in the canals. There is an underground parking about 5 minutes away (36 euros a day !). Service : It is a small hotel, run by a few people, and you get service you would expect from a youth hostel, not a 150 euros a night hotel. It seems their schedule is more important than ours. Here are a few examples : You can't check-in after 6:00 PM if you don't have a cell phone because no one is there - there's a phone number taped in the window; If you have an emergency during the night - like trying to get in the place since our electronic key worked 1 out of 10 times on the front door and never for our room - you also need to call that number, but the clerk made it clear to us that he didn't want us to disturb him after he left. Other guests ended up opening the door for us on many occasions. The breakfast begins at 9:00 AM, which is not useful for business people or travelers, and the breakfast is poor at best - frozen bread (and being heated in a Miele oven doesn't change that), jam, cold cuts. On the only morning we ate there, the person preparing the breakfast and working the reception at the same time was late, busy on the phone and clearly just out of bed so we ended up getting our breakfast at 9:45 AM. Room : If design was the only standard, then it would be worth a 5, but if you include practicality, it drops to 0 or 1. The room is small, but the size is understandable considering you are in a converted Amsterdam house. There is almost no closet space or room to put your luggage. Not only is there no air conditioning, but also no air circulation at all. If you close the window, the room will get stuffy in a few minutes. When we opened the window, we were attacked by an army of mosquitoes that flew by our tv set and buzzed in our ears during the night - and we still have the bite marks to prove it !. It would seem previous guests had the same problem since there were many mosquito corpses splattered on the walls and ceilings. Other than that, the cleanliness of the room was ok. The bathroom is separated from the room only by a curtain, which is not practical to say the least, even for a married couple. Since there is no shower curtain or door, the entire bathroom floor gets wet after a few seconds. There is close to no shelf space in the bathroom (that's why they leave the towels on the bed each day). In conclusion, we would not go back to NL-Hotel even if they charged half the price we payed. In creating this hotel, too much attention was payed to design and not enough to the needs of the guests.", "Date": "October 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cnever again...\u201d", "Author": "ccrr77fr", "ReviewID": "UR5885117", "Content": "I've decided to choose an intimate hotel instead of a large hotel for our Madonna's concert visit in Amsterdam because i wanted a romantic place for my BF...

The rooms are small but very well-appointed -- sort of the \"lighter\" side of design, with great details but nothing over-designed. The hotel was in a very good location just outside the Canal Belt and we walked everywhere. It's also a short walk from a tram line that goes straight to Centraal Station. Overall, our experience was very good and we would definitely stay there again. Our only criticisms about the room are that the rooms could use a real closet space (the little storage area provided was tiny, with room for maybe 3 shirts on hangers and that's it) and I agree with other reviewers that the bathroom really needs a proper door and not just a curtain to separate it from the bedroom. These were small inconveniences, though, when our overall experience was very good.
