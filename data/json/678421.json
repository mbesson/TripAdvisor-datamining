I'll list a few things that may contradict my rating, but i will stick to the rating at any cost. The walls are rather thin, you can hear the people next door having a conversation if they are a bit too loud, we were lucky there was only 1 such conversation in 5 days. Breakfast is rather limited, but there is something for everyone (one reviewer has listed all the breakfast items so i will not repeat). They have cats in the lobby which join for breakfast - but then again this is common practice in Amsterdam - they may serve a purpose.

I am a massive snob when it comes to hotel, and was extremely worried having read reviews of what it was going to be like. We were four 22 year old girls travelling both to see the city and visit the museums, and go out at night to the bars and clubs. The location of the hotel was perfect - Leidesplein is near and that was where we enjoyed the most. Rembrandt Square was a bit cheesier with some not so nice bars. The shops and cafes around are really great to wander around and Dam Square is not far. The rooms are small - we were in a four person room, which consisted of two single beds and a bunk bed. The bunk bed didnt have a ladder up but it was just quite comical more than anything. The room was small, there wasnt really room to do much but we just sat on the beds to get ready. There wasnt much of a wardrobe, a rail and a couple of drawers but we were only there four days and so kept everything in our cases. The bathroom was small too but clean - it smelled a bit damp at times due to the lack of a window but it had been cleaned well which was the most important thing for me. The beds were comfy and clean (I checked very closely as soon as arriving!) and although the carpet and curtains was a bit old and grubby it wasnt anywhere near as bad as I thought it might be for the price. All in all, its a small hotel with small rooms, and could do with a bit of a tidy up, but its clean for the most part, the staff are friendly (might come off a bit sarcastic) and willing to help you with places to go.

The breakfast 'meats' were scary mystery cold cuts that I avoided. The front desk staff is the weakest aspect of the hotel. Half the time the staffer isn't at the desk and one of the staffers blew me off when i asked him how to use the in room safe, telling me they're not necessary, the hotel is secure. Another staffer was more helpful and I used the safe all the time.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Garrulo", "ReviewID": "UR14864626", "Content": "It's a good hotel, located in the very centre of the city, near Leiden Square and close to the tram stop (1-2-5) that takes you in few minutes to central station.
