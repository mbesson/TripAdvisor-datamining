As mentioned before, the hotel has an odd layout, withe the reception and bar on floor five and the rooms floors 2-4.

Bed was ok, amenities were reasonable, the bathroom compact, with a step up into the shower which caused issues for me having a bad knee, Small TV on far side of the room from the bed, and mini bar with not stupidly priced drinks cheaper than the bar! Heating would be an issue, we had a hot few days resulting in widows having to be left open at night, and although we didn't have the noise of the street pidgeons and the area below with industrial noises meant it was easy to be woken, a/c definately needed. The welcome on the first night of the stay was very nice and helpful, but after that staff were more restrained, there's a nice rooftop terrace overlooking the shopping street below with the kurfurstendamm church memorial to one side, there was only a couple of times where other guests were about, which was a shame, as it could be a nice social point. The hotel seemed safe, although corridors were very dull and the lifts small and jerky. Outside is the berlin version of oxford street, lots of big retailers, so busy in the day, theres not a lot to do round the hotel other than the zoo and the history of berlin exhibition, few restaurants and bars, and its quite a while on the u-bahn to mitte with its bars and clubs. The hotel is write by the entrance to Kurfurstendamm station, with the U1 line(currently undergoing work), but zoologischer garten station has an entrance 30ms away and is served by the U2 and U9 lines with better connections zoo S-Bahn station is 10 mins walk away and is a much quicker way to get round the city.

Booked it through my travel agent here for EUR 83 . The hotel was great value, superb location and I really enjoyed my stay here. Here are my views in favour of the hotel and not in favour of.. In favour: -Superb location, walking distance from the Zoo Station ( 10 minutes),on the main shopping road where everything is just 2 minutes walk away. Karstadt the department store is opposite and the upmarket KA A VE is just 5 minutes away. Its right next to Kaiser Wilhelm memorial with lots of food stalls around, so no problem absolutely for food. -The hop on hop off tours bus starts right in front of the hotel -Very comfortable rooms, very good toilet, and absolutely nothing to complain about. Tv, safe and minibar in the rooms. -very polite staff at the reception. My tv and safe were not working initially, and they had it fixed by the time I returned from my tour without a second reminder. -Housekeeping services were commendable -great breakfast, no compalints here too. -There is a One Euro shop on the road behind the hotel, just beside the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial with some good buys, I got a couple of red and white italian wines for just a Euro ! A very good Chinese takeway too nearby with a large portion of chicken fried rice or noodles for Eur 2.50 each. Not in favour.... -the very slow moving lift, and a tiny one at that -very soft pillows... but except for the minor hickups, I think this is a great value hotel in a superb location !!!!!! An oh, Berlin is a fabulous city. The best amongst all of those I visited - Frankfurt, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Bonn and Munich.... I fel 3 days just wasnt enough to see the sights...", "Date": "November 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbria, England", "Title": "\u201cBoulevard Hotel - you're welcome\u201d", "Author": "ICEll", "ReviewID": "UR19786092", "Content": "We recently stayed in the Hotel Boulevard, Berlin for 1 week. The location is brilliant. For transport, it is near to the Zoo train station, bus stops, and underground. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. They arranged transport for us and even set out a special breakfast table when it was my wifes birthday. The reception, breakfast room, and bar are situated on the 6th floor. They offer an excellent buffet breakfast which sets you up for the day. When you return from your day out, you can sit out on the rooftop terrace and have a pleasant drink and look down over the square at Kaiser Willhelm church. Our room was on the 2nd floor at the front of the hotel. The room was very spacious and was kept very clean by the hotel. The beds were very comfortable. There was a stocked minibar and security safe in the room. When we return to Berlin (because you cannot see it all in 1 week) we will definitely stay at this hotel again.
