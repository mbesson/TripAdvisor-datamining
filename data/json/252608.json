Upon arrival at the bus station in Mexico City we were informed that there was no access by car or taxi to the central historical district, where we had initially planned to stay because of a large demonstration (tortilla price increases) in the Zocalo. After trying to get close to the center we ended up back near the bus station at this hotel recommended in the Moon Guidebook. It was very reasonable ($USD 30) for a King sized bed, a spacious room, with TV. No AC but it was cool enough to sleep. Beds were softer than most in Mexico. Although construction was relatively cheap, the facility was modern and more than adequate. The hotel staff were extremely helpfull. We could walk to the Coyacan District, known for its colonial architecture, plazas, and Freida Kahlo's family home and museum.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cLess than Perfect\u201d", "Author": "Stepwise", "ReviewID": "UR5026605", "Content": "Problems included the fact that there was a constant leak on the bathroom floor from the toilet. The shower head functioned, but really needed to be replaced as water dispersement was uneven. The soap the hotel provides is so small you only get one use. No wash clothes were provided. The towells were coarse. The hotel staff were reasonably polite, the room was quite, and I did get a timely wake up call. The room was clean, but the bed was less than comfortable. A single bottle of water that is provided does not taste very good, and it is in a bottle that makes you wonder if it isn't reused. Though close to the metro, you have to take a taxi as pedestrian access was not possible at this time. The cost was $300 pesos per night. Okay for a short stay, but you might want to look somewhere else for something longer than a couple of days.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "belgium", "Title": "\u201cfinisterre\u201d", "Author": "elrey", "ReviewID": "UR3353063", "Content": "I did stay 2 times in Mexico DF and always did hava the same hotel.Hotel Finisterre is for me one of the good ones about price,accomodation and situation", "Date": "April 12, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Finisterre", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d252608-Reviews-Hotel_Finisterre-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calzada de Tlalpan, 2043</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Colonia Parque de San Andr&eacute;s</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Mexico City</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">04040</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "252608", "ImgURL": ""}}
