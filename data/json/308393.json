I paid $200 a night but stayed 4 nights for the price of three. Pros: -most of the staff were very friendly (except for one tour booking person who was really quite rude and one bellman who couldn't care less) -most bell staff and desk personnel were very efficient -they let me check in very early after an early am arrival...with no extra charge -there is a shower and change room you can use free if you have a late flight -there is a mall within ten minutes' walking distance Cons: -The 'deluxe' rooms are definitely not four-star, as the Miramar bills itself (although I understand the 'premium' rooms are a bit better)-the rooms are worn around the edges and in need of some renovations -the housekeeping was so-so (note to staff--you need to clean under the rim of the toilet bowl too...eww) -despite what some others have said, this place is not that central...it is not that close to any major points of interest. It is a hike to get anywhere on foot, and there is no MRT station nearby. There is a bus station outside the door of the hotel, but if you don't already know your way around it is a bit of a chore to figure out. -i asked for a late check out as I was going on a tour all morning, and they said the best they could do was one extra hour...for a charge. All up, although the Miramar definitely has its drawbacks, there is a pretty good vibe here and some of the staff were outstanding. If it had some upgrading and the prices were just a bit lower, I would stay here again. Now that I know the lay of the land though, I will probably be looking for a more modern, more central hotel the next time I come to Singapore.

We arrived at about 9 am after a 12 hour flight from the UK. The reception staff were most helpful and told us we would have our room as soon as possible. This was at about 10.30am. We were delighted at the short wait and were able to shower, change and get out to explore the city well before lunchtime. Our twin room was spacious, looking out onto the main road but as we were 13 storeys high the busy traffic did not bother us. The bathroom was spotless, with new towels each day. Off the lobby there is a restaurant where we had a buffet breakfast each morning. An amazing variety of food to choose from, more than enough to keep you going all day. One tip --- if you like tea for breakfast take a t-bag with you as the tea in the pots is quite weak and English breakfast tea bags are not readily available. Twice we had a snack there in the middle of the day, the toasted sanwiches were good! Immediately outside the hotel there is a bus stop where you can catch the city tour buses. There are plenty of taxis which the concierge will call for you. They are very reasonable. Close by, to the right as you exit the front of the hotel, is a petrol station with a small shop for things like extra water. We booked 2 evening trips via the concierge...the night safari at the zoo... great, and the night tour of the city to include a visit to Raffles. We enjoyed the second but wished there had been time to look at the city at night as the lights were fabulous. Unfortunately the coach kept moving from one stop to the next and this wasn't possible. Photos taken trough the window of a moving coach at night do not come out very well! Our flight leaving Singapore was not until the evening. We asked at reception if we could keep our room until 3pm. We were prepared to pay but they allowed us to stay until 2.30pm free of charge. This allowed us to visit the Botanic Gardens in the morning and have a shower before waiting for our airport pick up.

The bar offered live music in each evening and also has a small outside seating area. Reception and hotel lobby staff were all pleasant and efficient.

We choose to alight, after the boat toured downriver and around the harbour, to enable us to walk around the old colonial part of town and partake of a gin-sling in Raffles. Of course ! Then we enjoyed a lovely walk around the Botanical gardens, which concluded our day and a half in Singapore. One tip on travelling around the city. We found the taxis good value but one event soured the experience. We took one of cycle rickshaws from outside Raffles. Unfortunately ours was a rip-off merchant, and despite checking the price before we started, the price 'went up' twice before we were dropped off only half way to the Botanical Gardens. We didn't even have enough Singapore dollars to pay the price he now demanded which had increased by some 50 dollars, so we argued the toss and paid less. Not a pleasant encounter at all.

We were in Singapore 10 years ago, and really noticed when we went to book for 3 nights, the prices of hotels had skyrocketed. We got a fabulous deal from a booking site for the Miramar for 3 nights, and although a little apprehensive after what we paid, we were in for a very pleasant surprise. Found this hotel to be clean, and had everything we wanted. Had asked for a higher floor, knowing it was on a busy road, and we were given a spacious corner room on the 14th floor. The air conditioning was very quiet (unlike some hotels) and extremely efficient. The room was spacious and although people have mentioned \"old fashioned and dated\", I would actually call it homely. I felt very comfortable there, and we had fantastic views out of our large window. We may have unknowingly been upgraded to a better room than we booked, as it was larger than expected. Bed and pillows were very comfortable, and the bathroom had plenty of shelf space which is nice to have. Probably you could say the bathroom was a little dated, but had a huge tub and shower and good accessories. We found the staff, particularly the door staff very friendly and helpful and reception booking in was fine. Booking out we struck a rather ordinary person, but have already received a letter from Miramar apologising to us, which wasn't expected. This hotel was not right in the thick of it as, say the Excelsior, but we thought it was in a great spot, right next to the river, and very close to many restaurants just across the bridge. Also walked to Clark Quay and Boat Quay, but if it's too hot, just get a taxi as they are so cheap and easy. Also the bus stops out front, and as been said, a great convenience store next door (and also one across the bridge). We heard no traffic noise at all, but loved our views. Should we return to Singapore, it would probably be for a stop-over, but I would not hesitate to stay at the Miramar again if we obtained a good price. Their on-site cafe/restaurant also looked like it had some nice food and ambience, but admit we did eat outside for the experience. A must-do is the water taxi by night - amazing to see it all lit up.

The hotel was clean and tidy - very polite and hard working cleaning staff. We went for a swim every morning and our room was usually serviced while we were at the pool. We were on the 15th floor and had a great view over the river. The bed was hard - if you like a softer mattress you're in trouble. The staff in general were very polite, but concierge were only interested in booking us on tours. Besides the tours, they weren't very knowledgable, for example I asked if there were any tours to Bintan Island and all they said was \"No\" - no suggestions on how we could get there or alternative options. It was a local taxi driver that showed us the real Singapore (look out for Roger who drives a peach coloured toyota hybrid taxi). One man at concierge was very friendly and helpful when we booked our zoo tour, but the others were quite rude and we wouldn't have booked a tour with them on principle. The facilities at the hotel are ok. The pool is quite small and always busy during the day (a couple of times they ran out of towels). The hotel has 3 restaurants and a bar, but we didn't go to any of them because of the ridiculously expensive prices. The gym is good, but again it's quite small with limited equipment. We were dissapointed with the price to use the internet - $10 per hour is really expensive considering wireless is available for free elsewhere in the city. The location of the hotel is ok. Across the river are a number restaurants and bars with a range of cuisine. The hotel isn't close to any key attractions though, or a MRT station. However, a free shuttle takes you to Orchard Road and Chinatown, there's a bus stop directly in front of the hotel and I noticed the Singapore Stopover hop-on hop-off bus stop outside. Taxis are cheap so we used them mostly and walked where possible. It cost us $18 each way to the airport in a cab, which I thought was really cheap. Overall, the hotel was ok. I wouldn't have been impressed with anything less. Based on the number of options available in Singapore and what we experienced at Mirarmar, I would probably try a different hotel next time that is closer to an MRT station and other attractions and has a bigger pool area.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Isle of Man, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBathrobes and slippers, a nice little touch!\u201d", "Author": "Enigma_IoM", "ReviewID": "UR103669850", "Content": "Stayed here three nights en route to Australia.

Arriving latish on the 1st it was nice to see our room had been prepareda and we had gotten a river view and a king size bed just as i asked in my email to the hotel. Despite what some reviewers say, there is a whole nest of restaurants over the road in Roberston Quay. I got lost going there the first night, but from our room could see the steps down from the road. We had dinner at a very busy restuarant, and the food was very good. only sting was that they charge per 100g of seafood and my husband asking for a small serving of snapper was stung $63 Singapore dollars for his 700g fish. we also had breakfast at a close by restaurant on our last morning with more success. our room was lovely and the curtains hid all light until you pulled them in the morning. we used the robes and i wore mine to the pool which is lovely and in a garden setting. The breakfast at the hotel is too expensive in my opinion esp considering they dont really cater for you having anything other than the buffet, because they overcharge for every other component of breakfast. So we used the convenience store next door and bought curry puffs on two mornings. only cost a couple of dollars and saw us happy until we reached a food court or something. Having the bus stop right outside the door and also having the night safari bus stop at our hotel is a real bonus. we used the Singapore airlines HOHO bus for two days, who could go past it for a total of $12 for 2 days and if on an official SA stopover visit it is free. We took two stops and went to the gardens where we had breakfast once and then explored the gardens inc the Orchid Garden. how spectacular. I loved the room adn teh staff esp the tour guide adn the bell hops were wonderful. the information staff did lack a bit of information, but perhaps it is hard to know everything tourists ask. the Research I did on TA before our trip came in very handy. My husband was agog at how well i had resarched and prepared what we were doing and where.

Location - We found the position good. Well, what we didn't realise is that in Singapore, everything is close anyway. It was only a 5 minute walk to Chinatown, which we ventured to our 1st evening. We'd walked it from the hotel up to Orchard Road, and 1 pleasant evening we walked along the river (which is just over the main road from the Miramar) to Clarke Quay. One evening we caught a taxi after the obligatory drink or 2 in Raffles back to the hotel which only cost S$7 (about \u00a33.50) Please bear in mid we were told that after midnight taxi fares increase by 50% Food - We only ate breakfast at the hotel. I honestly could not fault the food. They catered for a wide variety of nationalities. Fruit, cereals, full cooked American type breakfast, fish and more Asian orintated breakfasts. Food was always of a good standard, we found. Room - We were upgraded to the next type up fromt he basic and it had everything we could need in a bedroom. A comfortable bed; a good bathroom; even a mini bar (which the fridge came in handy for our own bottled water). We overlooked the pool from the 15th floor. Not exactly a view, but we were there to explore the city, not look out of a window. The Brass Bar - we had a few drinks in the bar. Usually a quick drink afer being out in the day before heading up to get changed for the evening out. Staff were friendly, but as usual - drinkis in hotels are quite expensive. We did stumble on happy hour from about 3pm where selected drinks were BOGOF. One afternoon we heard a rather talented young man rehearsing with his keyboard and singing a bit. On our last night we vetured in for our last cocktail in Singapore. It was an experience all of its own.

The hotel provides a free shuttle bus to the shopping district and China town and it is possible to catch the bus for a return trip as long as you meet the bus at the same stop. We enjoyed our time in this hotel. We found the reception staff very helpful. The room was large, with nice amenities, such as an in-room safe, coffee and tea service and hair dryer. The room was very clean with complete bathroom amenities. The hotel was quiet even though it was very busy. On our last morning we needed to leave very early. Breakfast was available to us (all except the eggs) at 5 a.m. This was a nice surprise since we thought we would be given a box breakfast. Most of the buffet was available even though it was before usual opening time. This service was greatly appreciated.

The Singapore Airlines hop-on/hop off bus stopped right outside the hotel, (make sure you keep your airline baggage check ticket in order to get an all day ticket for 3 dollars rather than the normal 12 dollars), and the hotel also has a free bus into the main area of town going about three times per day - so transport couldn't be easier. Taxis are also incredibly cheap. The cafeteria was good value for money especially at breakfast but evening meals were the same choice every day so it tended to get a bit boring. Drinks in the bar tended to be on the expensive side. Do not miss the Botanic Gardens (free) (and the free bus stops outside) and do go to Sentosa Island and also visit Chinatown. We booked our first stay at the hotel through a travel agent in UK but decided not to book the second stay until we had been and tried it. We obviously liked it and tried to book our second stay just before we left. We were amazed that the price quoted by the hotel was almost twice the amount we had paid through the travel agent in UK. The hotel actually advised us to ring UK and book again through our travel agent, which we did and even got it slightly cheaper than our first stay!!

It wasn't so easy to find the stops along Orchard Rd though and we ended up getting a taxi back to the hotel. The taxis were so cheap though that I used them a few times after that. It was better than waiting for a bus in the heat when we were tired. We checked out the following morning, having enjoyed the pool, and left our luggage stored for the day.

A/C does't work well: I had to set the A/C down to 15\u00b0C to get a convenient temperature! Carpet is old and used. And the room smells, I think its comes from the used carpet.
