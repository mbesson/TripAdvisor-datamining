{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Needs Help This hotel has the potential to be a 4 Star Hotel but, you have to ask for things that should be furnished, ie:soap, shampoo, body lotion, body soap, face cloth. etc. on a daily basis.They have a fairly good breakfast arrangement, but only five days a week. There is no resraurant or room service in the hotel so be prepared to walk a couple of blocks every time your stomach growls. Sometimes it seems like there are only two employees in the hotel. All the tours pick this hotel up seperately so it must be off the beaten path. I am not normally one who complains, but sometimes these things have to be brought out into the open so that management can work on them.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR630452844", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Packer250"}, {"Content": "Ganz okay   showReview(11668427, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR462488568", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d655598-r8710692-Regency_House-Singapore.html", "HotelID": "655598", "Price": "$435"}}
