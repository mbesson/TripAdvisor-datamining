I noticed a few things that were not quite right, firstly the only light switch was by the door, so once in bed there was no way of turning the light off without getting out of bed as there was no bedside lighting provided, also the room was for four people yet there were only three towels, three cups & three drinking glasses! We had booked the room so we could stay over for the night whilst we made a first time visit to watch West Ham, upton park is approximately a 20 minute walk away, after watching the football we found it near impossible to find an eatery where we felt comforable with the children, we walked in every direction to locate something other than a fast food establishment, not even a pizza hut or weatherspoons in sight! so we had to eat in the local KFC. I tried to have a shower in the morning after an uncomfortable nights sleep, the room was very noisy with police sirens going all night (Police station is located opposite the Hotel), the shower was impressive to look at, but was a nightmare to get right! the water was a mere trickle and very hot or very cold, it was extremely difficult to find a medium setting! We left after breakfast as planned, no problems with the food, plenty of toast, eggs, bacon, mushrooms, sausages etc etc. (Cold Coffee though) Since arriving home my son & I have both discovered that we have been bitten badly by bed bugs or fleas, I am now constantly itching & scratching...... my original thoughts was that the hotel was ok for the cost, however, given the poor facilities & the persistent scratching I would not use this hotel again, I would happily pay an extra \u00a320-\u00a330 to stay somewhere a bit better than this flea-pit!", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot brilliant but ok\u201d", "Author": "Darryl E", "ReviewID": "UR119732575", "Content": "I booked into this hotel at short notice as my regular one let me down. It's not in a great area, there isn't much around other than fast food places and you'll struggle to find decent pubs or places to eat there. Many people would find the inner city area foreboding. The hotel is dark grey and unfriendly looking as in the reviewer picture, not the pink friendly looking one in the main picture. I stayed in the 'council flat' type building next to it, on the ground floor. My stay didn't start very promisingly as when I first arrived a guest was complaining to the receptionist about his room. However the receptionist was polite and tried his best to help but the guest decided to cancel his booking. My room faced the very busy Romford Road. However traffic noise was muted in the room by the double glazing and I never noticed it. Room was clean and tidy, including the bedding (which I thoroughly checked after some of the previous reviews here), scuff marks on some of the furniture but I wasn't expecting Regency Period antiques for the price. WC/Shower clean and functional. Bed comfy and I had a good night's sleep although I did wake up a few times as I found the room slightly warmer than I prefer. Can't comment on the breakfasts as I never ate there. Slight disappointments were a) the tea / coffee facilities - 2 coffee sachets, 1 tea bag, 2 milk & no spoon! b) Only 1 bath towel. I'm not a big guy but most hotels allow you two. A bit of penny pinching here by the hotel perhaps? I'm sure if I'd have asked for more they would have let me have some. On my second day I did get another towel from the maid. All things considered it was alright.

I've read the other reviews, so I expected worse, but it was not bad at all. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised. Better than 2 other London hotels I had seen (years earlier). They were more expensive and more... euh... crap*. Availability: I made a booking a week prior to the trip, around Christmas time. That means that most hotels are fully booked, or really expensive. Considering we were only in the UK for less than 24 hours (visiting a concert in the O2 venue) room rate was most important. Rates are high in London, no doubt, this was one of the cheapest options, no actually, the cheapest. The hotel itself: It's on a busy road, extending backwards. Hotel is typically red plush with overly decorated wall to wall carpet. Very British :) Not luxurious, but to me perfect. Staff was friendly and helpful, and did give a quiet room as requested. The hotel has small corridors, tricky corners and stairs, but all okay. I felt welcome and it had a pleasant feeling. The room: Good! Middle sized, a twin room, with tea and coffee facilities(?) and a small fridge, good mirror, good beds, matrasses, clean sheets, warm blanket (duvet?*) and proper sized closet, and a small tv. (Did not check that) Also the opened windows gave the room a crisp feeling. Nice. The bathroom is not big but convenient. Absolutely spotless sink, mirror and toilet. The shower was a bit troublesome. Getting a constant temperature took some getting used to, and there was some mould at the corners. (But I've seen that in before, even in more luxurios hotels) Does not look attractive, but I didn't care that much. Maybe because everything else was good! Also... we did not smell any cigarette odour, but maybe it was luck? We left very early so we skipped breakfast. Can't help you out with that one. Public Transport, to and from: With the O2 in mind, in fact connectivity to the center also, connections are very okay. 300ft(*)/100mtr from the hotel there are busstops (25 en 86) going to and from Stratford Underground Station. I think every 5 min during the day, and 24 hours a day (every 10 min or so). From Stratford on it's easy. I was weary about the busses thinking that only the underground is easy, but busses are very handy! Just step off the bus when you see the McDonalds ;-) In short: Good value for money, I would recommend for weekend breaks, but do not expect the world. Then you have to shell out more.... and a lot more I think.

Two empty beer bottles had been left on top of the wardrobe, wardrobe door hanging off, TV did not work (no aerial), we reported this to reception as we had to get out of the room for air, 2 hours later we came back to find that nothing had been done and the chap had gone home. Other chap went to get an aerial from another room, only get 4 channels and picture very poor. The bathroom was absolutely disgusting and not fit for use. Shower didnt work very well, the shower tray was cracked, water was tepid, there was damp and grime all up the walls and within the shower cubicle, the overall cleanliness of the bathroom was grimy, unclean and not fit for guest or any use. The outside pain of our window was partly smashed, and as it was so hot and stuffy the window had to remain open, which didn't help with the fact that a huge metal cylinder (boiler) attached to the wall outside of the window kept us awake all night with it's noise. Breakfast was awful she didn't even bother to offer/give us tea/coffee (we didn't bother next morning)and staff unfriendly. We were also advised not to go out after dark in this area. We wasted \u00a352 per night for this.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Newham Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d483409-Reviews-Newham_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$60 - $150*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">349 Romford Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Forest Gate</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">E7 8AA</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514289", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/07/8d/078dec1825202c22b14fc69bc33b44d35large.jpg"}}
