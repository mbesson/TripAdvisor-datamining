I came away with very mixed feelings, so am only rating it average. Perhaps the best way of describing our stay was inconsistent. Reading some of the reviews on here and talking to a couple of others who have stayed here, there seems to be a number of different rates and options available when booking, and from conversations overhead when we were checking in, it doesn't seem that the front desk staff was aware of the options. Some rates apparently include valet parking while others don't. Some come with free internet, and others don't. We had booked a rate that included valet parking, but obviously not free internet. Since we were only there for one night I just hot spotted my phone and used that as it was definitely cheaper than the hotel internet. Hotel is in a good location, and was very clean, but when we both left we agreed that it had not rated very high on our special memories list. Pros: -Good location, close to Canada Place, and safe to walk even at night -Smaller hotel, so you don't have to walk far from elevator to room or through the lobby -Staff were polite and checkin and check out were fairly smooth - Krueg coffee maker and unique snacks Cons or Negative Impressions -Staff, while polite, were not operating at a level that we have found at say the Fairmont Pac Rim. Staff more like what you would find at a Hampton Inn. - Rooms are very small and layout is very different. Boutique/European is marketing term for \"expect small\". - lack of view, We had a corner room that also had a balcony, but it looked over the rear lane. View was of the restaurant behind the hotel. Bedroom window looked out into a concrete shaft with minimal light. - Room was very humid and this was April and no rain. A/C unit was very noisy when kicking in and trust me it was going on and off all night. - Not a big deal, but compared to other luxury hotels there were a few things missing - bath mat, soap for the bath/shower (only one small bar of soap was provided for both sink and shower), hair dryer - we had a king size bed and there were only two pillows provided, and both have seen better days in terms of thickness (even Hampton Inn or Best Westerns in small towns provide more pillows for a king size bed). - decorating was not our style, overdone with the sun theme, but didn't really detract from our stay Overall, Hotel Le Soleil brands itself as a luxury boutique hotel with outstanding service. I will give them one out of three - boutique. Our visit fell short on the luxury and outstanding service. The lack of view was a big detriment - I felt like we were trapped in between two buildings. If you want to relax in your room and see something other than the concrete walls of the adjacent building I would suggest either Fairmonts or the Pan Pacific at Canada Place.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA charming place - Great value and location\u201d", "Author": "Corey Q", "ReviewID": "UR128088595", "Content": "We had a great stay at Hotel Le Soleil.

On a surface level, the staff is friendly. They upgraded us to a corner suite (which is slightly bigger and quieter). However, the room had one window which opened to an air shaft (e.g. the middle of the building and no light). The other window open to a notch in the building that was roughly 20 feet deep (in other words, no external light from here, either). The Living Social special came with a $25 voucher for \"food and beverage.\" Once we arrived at the hotel we received the voucher, complete with all the fine print. The voucher was for dinner only and was not to be used on alcohol. We didn't see the fine print until we went to use the voucher for breakfast. I had to leave the restaurant to go to the front desk to get the issue cleared up, as it was a bait and switch situation. This took about 15 minutes, as the front desk clerk had to call his sales manager. Finally, I was told I could use the voucher for breakfast. Thank you, but it was a stress that should not have occurred if this information had actually been included in the Living Social offer. Free internet was included with the package. I guess that's good, as I've NEVER stayed at a hotel that actually charged for internet access. Many times the internet speed was so slow that it dropped. At one point I clocked the speed at well under 1 Mbps. That's fine for free, but I would have been quite disappointed if I was forced to pay for service that slow. Finally, we get to the valet parking and this is why I've giving such a low overall rating. As our car was brought out the second morning of our stay as we were preparing to leave, we found a three inch long scratch on the mirror and a chip in the door. Seriously? This car is my husband's pride and joy. He hand washes it every week and knows every inch of that car. When he dropped it off for the valet, he walked around it to check it out and when he picked it up from the valet, he walked around it and checked it out. At some point from the time we dropped it off at the valet and picked it up, it was damaged. After speaking with the front desk clerk and the valet attendant at length and showing them the damage, we were giving the hotel manager's business card. After multiple emails back and forth with the hotel over the past two weeks, we were told they \u201cconsidered the issue closed.\u201d They told us the area they park the cars in is fully secure and they stated the car must have been \u201cvandalized.\u201d Hmmmm\u2026. If the parking garage is fully secure and the car is vandalized during that time, then the damage was done by an employee. I don\u2019t believe it was vandalized, but I do know that one of the valets was very careless to cause this damage. The $300-500 it will cost us to repair the damage Hotel Le Soleil caused (along with the stress of dealing with their bait and switch tactics) was definitely NOT worth what we saved with our Living Social deal.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mackay, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel with old world charm\u201d", "Author": "Ren95", "ReviewID": "UR127221608", "Content": "This hotel was an absolute pleasure to stay in.

There are plenty of shopping centers, small shops and places to eat around the hotel. We were traveller with our 2.5 year old son and we did find it a bit hard to find family orrientated places close to the hotel but there were some really nice restaurants that we passed. Also there is a skytrain station not far from the hotel (ask for a map and directions, the staff were really good at this!) which can take you places quickly and very easily.

When you arrive at a new \"good\" hotel you want (expect) to be greeted by some sort of smile and verbal welcome. You expect an explanation of the valet parking service, and on departure you expect fairly speedy return of your car or at least a quick apology and explanation as to why you have to wait. You expect a \"thank you and hope you have enjoyed your stay with us\" or something similar to encourage the feelings of a developing relationship with the hotel.

It has lots of the plush amenities of a luxury hotel yet small and tucked away to one side of downtown so as to be a quiet getaway from downtown away from the crazies and the traffic. We like to call it our little boutique hotel getaway. My wife has back issues so we are picky about our hotel and the beds. My wife needs the bed to be on the firmer side yet I love the soft pillow top. Love their soft linen. And the separate temperature control for the bedroom and the living room area. The rooms comes with everything you'd need, and more (for a price of course for the \"more\"). The \"more\" includes everything from snacks to wine to thoughtful little items like sewing kit in case you lose a button. Love the Aveda products for the bath. And the sliding doors so as to not have to waste room for the swing of a normal door (for both the bath and bedroom) We have a child so we love being able to put our baby to sleep in the bedroom while we watch TV on the sofa. Even the heating and cooling is super quiet (we have had issues in other hotels with noisy units which gave us restless nights) Everything is always so cozy and comfortable from the bath towels to the sofa for TV viewing. Decor is fabulous and everything feels luxurious. It's a smallish boutique hotel so not too many rooms per floor. Which also means a very quiet hotel and guaranteed restful night sleep. Of all the times we've stayed here, we have never heard our neighbors. Not from above nor from the sides. And the elevators are always readily available. Service is top notch and I tip them accordingly. Super friendly and informative even though I know my way around Vancouver by now. Never had an issue with the valet or my car. Because it's smallish, I get super fast response. And I often call down for my car before heading down, so the valet would already have my car pulled around by the time I arrive. I also love the location too since it's \"downtown\" but it's really on the northern edge, off to one side. Which means Robson is only a walk away, and we've walked to the Vancouver Christmas Market 2 years in a row now. Perfect for getting your buzz on for a good time yet won't need to drive back to the hotel. A Skytrain station is a block away so you could get to most parts of Greater Vancouver and beyond without even getting your car. There is a Starbucks across the street for our morning Mocha and a couple of drugstores 2-3 blocks away for any misc items you need. Plenty of restaurants around too. But I love that it's a block away from Pender St. I can drive in and out of downtown without having to deal with downtown traffic. And Pender is a direct drive to Stanley Park or Chinatown going the other way. And actually through Chinatown is the route we often took to get out of downtown in a jiffy since we have to have our dim sum for our daily brunch since Vancouver is famous for chinese food right? The only thing negative is that it is a luxury hotel so it is pricey compared to other non-luxury hotel. But you get what you pay for. Le Soleil is cheaper than other luxury downtown hotels and well worth it too. That and I always wait for deal online then go with one of the hotel packages since I'm on their mailing list.

The soaker tub was great, it's so nice to have your entire torso covered with water! The Aveda soaps, body wash and shampoo were also appreciated.

We couldn't decide if we were in the mood for French toast or eggs benedict so we ordered one of each and split them. The food was served promptly, hot and it was DELICIOUS. The french toast was actual baguette bread, cinnamony and just so yummy and the eggs were cooked perfectly for the bennies and the hollandaise sauce was the best, with just a bit of a cayenne bite! The room also included free wi-fi and valet parking. We didn't use the internet but the parking was much appreciated.

Many places offer free internet access with your stay so I'm unused to paying a daily fee. So it really cheeses my biscuits when I pay a fee AND then receive popup advertising in my browser. Every time I access a web page, a portion of my page is filled with an advertisement by R66T who was chosen by Le Soleil to supply their internet service. Either give me free access with ads or charge me $8 and stay off my browser. But you came here for a review of the hotel, right? Here we go: As a boutique hotel, Le Soleil is lovely. Glamourous fabrics on the furniture and draped across the windows. The marble bathroom, gold striped wall paper and the carved sun on my door - all of it is so pretty. Even the bathroom towels have their logo stamped into them. My room is quiet despite having neighbours on both sides, which means I must have nice thick walls. I get a good sleep. The windows are not quite as thick. I face north and two or three times each evening (and once in the morning) I get to hear some sort of street noise that reminds me of bags of glass bottles being poured into a metal dumpster. Clean, clean, clean. No dirty carpet, no dust on a forgotten ledge, no smudges on the walls. I never see the cleaning staff yet my room is spotless when I return at 5 pm. My room is 8 steps from the elevator yet I hear no comings & goings. I have a bathrobe, decent closet space with two fabric-covered hangers, an in-room safe, a coffee machine by Keurig, toiletries by Aveda and a mini bar filled to the brim with beverages. I can dip into the convenience tray in my room and be billed for a jar of cashews, a canister of oxygen (I kid you not) or a box of prophylactics at my whim. When I book a wake up call the person at the front desk is friendly and prompt. I get a smile from them when I walk past the front desk and out the door. I'm four blocks from the harbour, three blocks from the Skytrain, two blocks from a pharmacy/postal outlet and there's a fitness building (akin to a YMCA) right next door. So although the incursion of advertising on my browser infuriates me there's no way I can give this hotel a bad review.

We were driving distance from major tourist destinations like Granville Island, Stanley Park, and China town. It was a mix of reviews on the service. Initially, I felt like the front desk people were amazing, they gave us maps, drew out our route for our dinner plans, and even offered to call a cab service. Another young valet helped us find shops around the area, and suggested a great itinerary. However, throughout our stay I felt somewhat confused by some of the staff since the information they were giving us didn\u2019t correlate from what was on the hotel site and our own research. Sometimes I felt like different people had different rules. For example, we wanted to go to the gym (which is actually the YWCA) next to the hotel. The pictures from the hotel site make it seem like it\u2019s on-site. We were given 2 \"complimentary\" passes) Saturday night. When we checked out we found out they charged $25 per pass! I was so upset because we were told they were free. Just a warning-Please just verify prices before you accept anything from this hotel. Also parking is quit a pain. You can pay $25 a day for valet (we did this the first night), or park across the street for around $10 (the second night). We did both. Also waiting around for the valet takes so much time, and during the wait time we heard several staff loudly complaining about how they wish they weren't there, and wanted the shift to end.

Offer a self park option for a slightly lower rate (or discount with the large parking garage just down the street). -Internet was touchy. It basically worked when it wanted to work, which is always really annoying when you're trying to find out local information and not wanting to bother with using concierge. -Customer Service was lacking in the friendly sense...which was a huge disappointment. Perhaps its common across all 'boutique' hotels, but not having a valet smile when you hand over your keys, or a front desk agent all but ignore you when checking you out of the hotel is annoying.

It was mine & my husband's first time in Vancouver as part of a BC tour and I'm so glad we picked this as our first stop. When we arrived after a very long flight from the UK and a run on the 'Sky train' from the airport, the hotel staff were extremely polite and helpful (I even managed to have a chuckle with one member of staff from Germany about the world cup as they'd just beaten the UK 4-2!) We were informed that we'd been upgraded from a double room to a one bedroom suite at no extra charge which was a lovely start to our holiday. We stayed in a corner suite, number 1002. Our suite was gorgeous. Very clean, very well laid out, beautiful furniture and decor. There was a big TV in the main area and also one in the bedroom, not that we used them much but handy for the weather channel! Big variety of drinks from tea, coffee, water, soft drinks, beer, wine and also lots of different nibbles to choose from (obviously at a cost) Nice roomy bathroom with a shower over the bath. I'm pretty sure the previous reviewer didn't pick up their 'bugs' at the Soleil because my husband I were bitten half to death throughout our three weeks in Canada no matter where we stayed (and we stayed in 8 different hotels!) or what activities we took part in so for other potential customers reading that review, I'd take it with a pinch of salt. The concierge were very helfpul, answering all of our questions and drawing on a map some of the best places to visit and eat. Just what we needed for our first day! I can't comment on the restaurant as we didn't eat there (such erratic hours we kept, lol) but I will give the hotel 10/10 for everything else.

All staff was very pleasant and attentive. We found the location to be very convenient for our purposes. Three blocks downhill to Canada Place, which makes it great for cruisers. There's a variety of shop and restaurants around the block, anything you needed was well within walking distance. You'll find the Pacific Mall a few blocks away. The hotel has a lovely little restaurant connected to the lobby that serves a nice breakfast. On the corner is The Keg. We enjoyed surf and turf there for dinner. Again, staff was very attentive and kind. The hotel in room wifi, can be a bit confusing - you have to call down to the front desk to get a code. Rooms are small by US standards but comfortable. Decor, well, everyone has their own taste and the pictures are dead on accurate as of this date. A bit too much gold for me but again, it was very comfortable. And best of all, it was quiet! Not a sound from the hallway or from any walls or ceiling. Just like you were the only ones in the place! Compared to subsequent hotel stays on this trip, this turned out to be the quietest hotel we experienced- a quality that can be lost on you until you have a few sleepless nights due to an evening filled with clearly experiencing hall conversation of strangers and repeated loud door slamming!

I had originally booked the Marriott Pinnacle but with the exchange rates not in our favour at all the week before I took a look on expedia & booked this hotel at a saving of \u00a3200 compared to Marriott & looking at tripadvisor this was far better quality. When we arrived on a very rainy night in may after our 10 hour flight we had a very warm welcome from the front of house staff, however there were plenty of times when the welcome wasn\u2019t so warm as our 1st (staff our a bit hit 7 miss). Our room on the 9th floor was very nice, you walked in to the seating area with TV & sofa (to be honest we never used this area at all) then through to the bedroom. I have mixed feeling on the d\u00e9cor, its fine in a hotel but it is bordering on citshe. Apart from the plush themes of the room there isn\u2019t really anything to rave about in compassion to any other hotel room. We did have a nice view from the side window down to Canada Place. Despite being advertised with free wifi it doesn\u2019t have (I think previous guests have mentioned this) you have to pay $8.95 (I think) per 24 hours, however the concierge did tell us there our 2 computers on the 3rd floor we could use for free but I couldn\u2019t find them. The hotel does I\u2019ll be honest seem to want to charge for everything on top, I asked if I could get milk on arrival to make tea in my room & I was told there may be a charge!! The hotel didn\u2019t include breakfast in the price but we didn\u2019t really want to venture far 1st thing in the morning for food so ate in the hotel restaurant anyway for breakfast, food is great, filled us up for the whole day but be warned expensive! About $40 for 2 hot breakfasts, 1 orange juice & 1 tea, oh and if you don\u2019t like the combinations of sausages, eggs etc and request to swap something you have to pay a substitution charge! Little things like this put me off this hotel somewhat. The best thing about the Le Soleil is the location, its so easy to get everywhere from the hotel.

The location is very central - right in the heart of the commercial area of downtown Vancouver. It is a business area and there aren't many places nearby for a snack or a cheap meal on the weekend... you'll have to walk a few blocks for anything during non-business hours, but things are still that far. It is 2 blocks to the SkyTrain. It can be a bit noisy late at night from a few nearby bars...but this may be unavoidable in downtown Vancouver. This hotel advertises itself as a 4 star hotel...it comes close, but it's better described as a theme hotel. The hotel has a Louis XIV(French Sun King) motif that is a bit over the top - with golden sun logos everywhere and a phony ornateness on a level that can make one feel out of place at first. If the rooms were in the layout of a conventional hotel room, they would be quite large, spacious and comfortable. They're not though... the bathroom/closet/bar area is in the centre of your living space - dividing it in two, leaving you with a small living room area and a separate very small bedroom area. If you like a large hotel room, this would not be a good choice. The bedroom area is barely large enough for two single beds or one queen sized bed. This works well if you're there by yourself or a close couple, but not so well otherwise. Both tiny rooms feature 42 inch flat screen TVs...which sounds great, but both rooms are also too small for such large displays - especially when they don't have HDTV, making the picture quality look pretty horrible. The bathroom was elegantly decorated, though it only had a shower - no bath tub. I find it odd that a 4 star hotel would only have a shower. The bar area had a kettle in addition to a coffee maker...as well as hot chocolate, which non-coffee drinkers will appreciate! You can also use the mini-bar fridge to keep your own drinks cold. For all of the quirks, everything was in good condition and very clean. Free wireless internet is a huge plus as well - though I didn't try it. The service from the front desk and the maids was good - we were up to our room very quickly on check in, and all of the other workers always greet you with a smile and a hello...makes you feel welcome.

We checked in late and Cory courteously moved our room to a higher floor at my request. The beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in at any hotel. The room was spotless and houskeeping did an excellent job every day in keeping it that way. The rooms are all suites with two rooms. The furnishings are very comfortable and both the bedroom and the living area are equipped with a 42\" LCD flat screen television. The hotel provides free wireless internet and a refrigerator in the room. Parking was only $22 per day. Compared to the other high end hotels in the area this is excellent. The hotel does not have workout facilities or a pool. This is not an issue for me because I don't go on vacation to workout in a gym. Walking around is my exercise when on vacation. There is a very nice YMCA next door. I saw an olympic sized pool when walking by the Y. The service was awesome. Every person in the hotel was extremely friendly. The staff went out of their way to assist in any way to make our stay more pleasant. Brett, the concierge suggested some excellent restaurants based on our dining preferences. Adam, Chris and Patrick were also very corteous. They would ask what time I wanted them to have my car ready, suggested which place to buy a cuban cigar, which lounge to go to and they provided excellent driving instructions. I never got the feeling that the staff was fishing for or expecting a tip. The guys were extremely professional. The front desk people were also extremely courteous and helpful. The hotel provides free bottled water and apples as a courtesy. Nice touch. We received great value for the money. I booked when they were having a special and received a very favorable rate. This is a solid 4 star hotel. The only negatives are the rooms are a bit small. We tend to live out of our suitcases when we travel and only one would fit in the bedroom. The other was on the floor in the living area. There is a large closet in the hall between the living area and bedroom. So if you unpack your bags there is enough room to store your suitcase in the closet. If it matters to you the lack of a free workout facility and a lounge with entertainment are the other negatives. There are other lounges that provide jazz or piano entertainers within a few blocks of the hotel. There isn't a great view from the rooms since it is only 14 or 15 floors. My room looked at the Hyatt and a TD Bank building but ince again I do not go on vacation to look at the view from my hotel room. The location of the hotel was perfect for us. The hotel is not smack in the middle of the shopping district (Robson and Burrard) but only a couple of short blocks away. So the hotel provided us with quiet enjoyment with the action only three blocks away. I would suggest using the hop on hop off bus tour. It takes you to various parts of interest in the town and you can get on and off for one 2 day fee. There is a great little breakfast place on Howe Street (one block over) next to Marios Coffee. Make a right out of the hotel, cross the street toward Howe. At Howe make a left down the street nad the breakfast place is on the left. It looks like a hole in the wall from outside but the place is clean and breakfast is very good for a reasonable price (Less than $20 including tip for 2). Catch a sunset at Prospect point in Stanley Park. Have a meal at the fish house in Stanley Park. The Salmon is awesome anywhere you eat in Vancouver and I am not a huge salmon fan. Check out Gas Town and the Sun-Yet Sen Garden. Both places are very worth seeing.

My son and I spent four nights here and we encountered friendly staff, excellent service, an immaculate room and good food all for just over one hundred dollars per night. How can I complain about the 20 dollars/night charge for the valet parking for the rental car! This was an unbelievable value. We pulled up to the hotel and were greeted by a friendly valet who assisted us with our bags and parked our car. The front desk clerk was pleasant and check-in was quick. As mentioned in previous reviews, this a small boutique hotel and the staff is minimal. Yet we never encountered any problems and just once did we have to wait for the vehicle to be parked, even then only for a minute or so. The suite is not the largest I have encountered but it was comfortable and certainly more than adequate. It was also spotless and the housekeeping staff did an excellent cleaning job each day. The entry from the hall is to the small sitting room, with 2 chairs and a small sofa. There are two 42 inch LG flat screen TV's, one in this room and one in the bedroom. The bathroom on one side of the hall and the closet on the other separate the sitting room from the bedroom. There is a safe large enough to hold a laptop computer in the closet. Bathrobes and an iron are also found in the closet. The bathroom has a marble counter and shower area. The counter space is not large but adequate. The shower is large and hot water is quick and abundant. My son took an extended shower after a day on the slopes and hot water was never an issue. The usual toiletries are supplied. The only complaint I can muster is the minimal lighting in the bathroom. It is not an issue for two guys but had my wife been with us and needed to apply makeup, I know it would have been an issue. The bedroom has a work desk: there is a phone on the desk and there is another potable handset next to the bed. While it cannot be considered a complaint, the decor is not to my liking. What is important after long days is the comfort of the beds and they were very comfortable. The property location is excellent. It is three blocks from the waterfront/Canada Place and there are many retail stores, hotels and restaurants within walking distance. There is no view to speak of as the hotel is surrounded by commercial properties but the view was not a consideration for us. Other hotels such as the Pan Pacific serve this purpose and charge accordingly. We ate room service the night of our arrival and the food was excellent and well priced. It was delivered quickly. The free internet did go down one morning and might have been an issue had this been a business trip. Otherwise the internet worked well and the speeds were acceptable.

The hotel was beautifully decorated for the holidays and it made my stay that much more enjoyable. The hotel restaurant offered a Christmas Dinner buffet and it was fantastic.

Aveda shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, mouthwash, cotton balls, sewing kit, Qtips, soaps...I forget what else but there was loads! We asked for an extra shampoo and showergel and housekeeping left us 3 of everything the next day! Now thats service!

In addition, hotel staff here leave something to be desired with most being rude and indifferent to hotel guests which I suspect is also due in part to the fact a separate operation called the Hornby Hotel operates in the same building. Neither Le Soleil or the Hornby Hotel seems to have reconciled their operations to the point where a guest who needed to use the baggage cart to remove quantities of luggage from their room couldn't do so because they weren't guests of Le Soleil. The result, the person had to haul nearly 6 pieces of luggage out of the place without the help of any of the hotel staff!

The bed is soooo comfortable and the linens sparkling clean, with fluffy white duvet. We didn't want to get out of bed!

I had just spent three nights at the Fairmont in Whistler, so it was going to take a lot to impress me after that. Well, this place certainly did. I found that the staff at this hotel, the front desk, room service, and cleaning staff to be extremely good. The hotel is very centrally located in downtown so you can basically do your shopping and walk along the boardwalk by the ocean very easily. We had a junior suite, which was actually a pretty good size. I believe true to it's French roots, the room is almost European style. So that means that it's large by European standards, but maybe a little small by North American standards. However, it was definitely large enough for me and my wife and it was designed very well. Room service was very prompt and breakfast was very good, too, which was brought to us by two very professional and very sweet Asian gentlemen. What I found very impressive with the room service staff was that when they would give me the invoice to sign for the service, they walked to the front door and waited for me there. They weren't looking at me while I was trying to figure out how much of a tip I should leave, which I'm not very good at math so when someone is staring at me while I'm figuring out things, it's a little nerve-wracking. Anyway, that's the first time I've ever seen that done and I applaud whoever trained the staff to do that because it shows me that they think about little things like that. That just shows you that this small hotel tries to do the little things right, which is very important when competing with larger hotels in a similar category. Anyway, you cannot go wrong with this hotel, it's very French, of course, so linens and soaps and colors of the rooms are all very nicely decorated. Also, Vancouver is an expensive city, so I felt that the rates at this hotel were very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this fine boutique hotel!", "Date": "June 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Scotland", "Title": "\u201cSimply special.\u201d", "Author": "Milvert", "ReviewID": "UR7704090", "Content": "Just back from 3 weeks in Canada.

Yes that's true, the \"suites\" (really only a large room with a partition to turn it into a suite) are on the small side. But the very nice decoration compensates. The view from our room was not great: on the YMCA on one side and office buildings on the other. The \"suite\" was clean and the bathroom well appointed. Alas! The promising start only lasted for 2 days (out of 5) since, to my unpleasant surprise, my nightware had disappeared when I got back on the evening of the 3rd day. I immediately called housekeeping; they weren't there so was told by front desk staff (very rude) that they would get back to me. They did not on that day, nor even on the following morning. I had to call them again. I was then told that what might have happened was that the cleaning person might have accidentally taken my nightware away with the bedding for cleaning. I was literrally then told that this sometimes happened!! They assured me, after I had had several phone calls with the housekeeping manager, that they would look for it. They got back to me (it was then about a week and a half after the item had disappeared) to tell me they could not find it and see how to compensate. Fair enough they did say they would refund the equivalent of one night (I am still waiting to see it on my statement though). I am a \"heavy\" traveler, going both to industrialized and third world countries. This has NEVER EVER happened to me before. I don't think any hotel can pretend to luxury rating (as does Le Soleil) with such a poor housekeeping and front desk. First class service is not only about maintaining a room clean but also about making sure that this sort of things do not happen. Hotel Le Soleil has definitely still a long way to go to reach the higher end!

The reception area is small and feels familiar, rather than large and impersonal. Staff were very helpful and check-in swift. We had a basic twin suite, which consisted of a bedroom with twin beds, large tv, and a fair bit of drawer storage, a hallway with a good sized closet, and a sitting room with sofa, armchair, table and another large tv. The bathroom had a doublesized shower with a seat. I've noticed one complaint has been the room is \"small\" - neither the bed area nor the seating area are huge by any means, but there is plenty enough to store luggage away and move around - and for us that included a large snowboard bag! The room was lovely and we could not fault the location - everything was a 5 minute walk, from Gastown to Robson Street, Stanley Park was 15 minutes.

So we went to Starbucks when we returned 10 minutes later I asked her if she spoke to the cleaning people like she said and she said no. That's all she said. She just looked at me and said no she had not. Thanks for the specifics. The lobby is very charming. We went to our room a \"suite\" The rooms are so Tiny, I would guess 6 feet wide. The couch in the \"Living Room\" was like sitting on rocks. The carpet was filthy. The bathroom was the best room until I looked p and noticed the Mold all over the ceiling. The bed in the \"bedroom\" was practically wall to wall and the bed was so uncomfortable. I have stayed in hotels from budget to luxury and cleanliness was the biggest problem for me here. The room was so stuffy. It seems like it was nice at some point but even the wallpaper was dirty. I would rather stay in one decent sized room than two teeny tiny rooms seperated by a bathroom that you can't even stretch your arms out. Upon check out the same women didn't even speak. She charged us for parking $22.00 p/day which was included. After I reviewed the receipt I told her about the error. She just took the paper out of my hand and didn't say anything, she corrected it and just gave me a new receipt not saying anything. Her apologies for trying to rip me off would have been nice. The restaurant that is connected had a great dinner, so the morning we left we stopped in for breakfast. It was like a different place. The prices for 2 eggs was the same as a delicious Halibut entree. Oh yeah and the eggs were cold and the potato's were hard. My boyfriend took one bite of his French toast and decided to avoid it. They were nice enough to just take it off the bill because they noticed he didn't touch it. Next time I am sticking the the Marriott. This place couldn't get me back for $50.00 CAD.

We arrived early for check-in as we landed in Vancouver at 10am, but were told we could check in within another half an hour, which was a nice gesture as we had been up early for the flight from JFK. Staff are very friendly here I found and extremely pleasant. Always a greeting whenever we passed reception and even staff passing in corridors exchanged a friendly smile and a good morning/evening. The location of the hotel is good too. A five minute walk from Canada Place and a 10 minute walk from Gastown. It\u2019s also close to Robson street with the shops, caf\u00e9\u2019s etc. We took a trip to Grouse Mountain whilst there which was pleasant and the girl on reception was very helpful and knowledgeable in assisting us. The value I found to be excellent for a hotel of this quality. A lot of people appear to think it is not good value but to British people it certainly is (we paid CA$ 109 per night \u2013 I am not sure what the going rate is for hotels in Canada but this is very inexpensive I think). The rooms were small but you have the added benefit of a separate living area with sofa, table and TV which you can partition off from the bedroom area. There was also ample storage space and the rooms equipped with everything one should require (iron/ironing board, laundry service, coffee maker, kettle, safe, cordless phone even!) The bathroom was great \u2013 large double shower and marbled walls with excellent lighting and huge mirror. Aveda products a nice touch also, as were the bathrobes and coffee maker. Beds I found to be comfortable \u2013 I notice a few people had problems from some of the reviews, but to me no different than other beds I have slept on. Sheets changed daily too. I found the hotel to be clean \u2013 apart from a bit of dust I noticed on the TV cabinet \u2013 but in general cleaner than some western hotel chains I have stayed in and the room was serviced efficiently. We were on the 8th floor and had no trouble with noise whatsoever. The prices for the mini bar are high but I have yet to stay at a hotel with a reasonably priced mini bar and would like to hear from anyone who has! The \u201ckarma sutra\u201d kit in the room was also nice touch if you\u2019re planning that sort of weekend!! We didn\u2019t eat at the adjoining restaurant but we did have breakfast on our last day, delivered to the room, which was good and delivered on time. No complaints there. In all I would say this is a lovely hotel and they go that little bit further with the extra touches that you would normally expect from hotels at triple the price. I would stay at this hotel again for sure if I were to return to Vancouver and Canadians appear to be a very warm and friendly nation. The only downside is that Vancouver itself is not what I expected (a lot of homeless people) and is quite a quiet city, though that could just be me from being used to living in London.

The price was also very reasonable.", "Date": "January 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cNot worth a second trip\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4140575", "Content": "I've travelled to Vancouver many times. Usually stay at the Westin Bayshore, but chose Le Soleil this time. They said it used to be run or owned by Sheraton and all the positive reviews made me want to check it out. The reservationist was very nice and helpful. They said they would e-mail me confirmation of my reservation but after a week and two additional telephone requests (with long waits on hold) later, still no e-mail. The decor was nice. The corner suite was small. The queen sized mattress was rock hard and my back was sore the whole next day. While the location was OK, other hotels are just as close or closer to Robson street. The restaurant next door did not have a Sunday brunch buffet like we had hoped (like some of the other hotels). Yes, you could use the YWCA next door, but for a high fee - also it closes at 5:00 p.m. on the weekends so a relaxing end of day swim or sauna is out. I'll try a different hotel next time.", "Date": "November 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge England", "Title": "\u201cWonderful boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "bridgemagoo2", "ReviewID": "UR3932365", "Content": "We loved everything about this hotel. Staff were so friendly nothing was too much trouble and lots of thoughtful touches such as complimentary small bottles of water at reception for thirsty travellers arriving. The room was great and although we were initially advised that only twin beds were available (it did say this when we booked) they kindly found us one with a king sized bed - you may want to check availability of this in advance. Well placed for Canada Place and Robson Street.

The staff was professional but not overly kind or helpful. Our room was very small with a view of the childrens roof top play ground next door. The bed was very comfortable. Other than sleeping the room was just not comfortable to come back and relax in. We were handed a flyer on the street hyping up free appetizers at the a joining resturant and we thought we would check it out. After having to ask for them and squeezing into some stools at the tiny bar, we were served 4 chicken wings. It was a waste of time.
