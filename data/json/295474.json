The hotel is in a commercial area (many clothing stores around), but also industry. However if you are interested in Warner park is a suitable location: 10 minutes by car to the park Otherwise, quite poor services: - the rooms smelled very bad, even the non-smoking ones: probably because the window opens only 10 cm. The air was not fresh at all. - we had to insist very much to obtain a non-smoking room, even if we were not asked and on the reservation site we did not have the option to choose between smoking and non-smoking. - poor breakfast - no fridge or safe box in the room - the TV did not work - they should offer some fast entry for the Warner park", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice for overnight stay.\u201d", "Author": "KLMAN333", "ReviewID": "UR121051280", "Content": "Stayed for one night whilst travelling through Spain. Hotel is well situated only a few minutes drive from the M50 motorway/ Albecete motorway access, and provides free parking for guests.

The shopping centre is only 5 minutes walk from the hotel and provides numerous retail outlets and a large supermarket. Likewise, McDonalds is just 2 minutes walk away. The hotel itself is in quiet location despite the nearby businesses and shopping centre. There is evidence of some minor traffic noise from the nearby Madrid to Albacete motorway but this was not excessive from inside the hotel room we occupied, on the front of the building. A nice touch by the hotel is the production of a compimentary printed daily newspaper summary in English.

Soon we realised that there weren't too many hotels were we can choose by... Therefore, we have chosen this one.. In my opinion, the hotel is nice.. guests have an ice machine, so we can prepare drinks in our rooms, no fridge or safe in the room. Rooms have nice accomodation and everything was cleaned every day... sheets, pilows, etc.. Breakfast is nice and simple.. there aren't too much were we can choose from, The main issue i found during the breakfast, was the existence of the machines in one single side, so, there was a long line to use them.. (waste of time)... The hotel is located in a quiet place, were we can find restaurantes nearby, even a mcdonals and a mall. Tbe Parque Warner, is located about 15 kms.. too easy to reach..

That hotel reeked of smoke and the rooms were dingy. Ended up staying here and was pleasantly surprised. The place is very clean--the cleaning staff works until 2000 every day. The rooms are modern, you don't have to pay for tv, there's free breakfast, the staff is amazingly helpful, and there's a nice bar. For dinner, there are no nearby restaurants save a steakhouse. The steakhouse is good, not great. The portions are small and the prices hefty. If you need to eat, order from the Chinese take-out place; wholly moley, it was surprisingly good. For transportation, you can walk to the bus stop and take a bus to Avenue of the Americas and then catch the metro from there to see all of Madrid. A taxi to the airport varies since the cab drivers seem to have a button they push that suddenly adds additional costs onto any ride. We went to the airport several times and noticed the best fares were subjectively applied when we talked nicely to the driver. We were stuck in Marid after the volcano and enjoyed our time at HI Express; if you really want to be closer to the cultural sites, this is not the place to stay.", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "1", "Service": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cLoved Madrid!!\u201d", "Author": "CocoLoco69", "ReviewID": "UR35020881", "Content": "This was our first visit to Madrid, we stayed 2 days.
