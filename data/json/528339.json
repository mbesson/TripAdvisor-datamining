I was well aware of the loud trains but since we were out most of the day, it wasn't a big deal. It does get quite loud though, so if you are a light sleeper, don't stay here. The rooms are small, especially the bathroom (not enough room for 2 ppl at once), but they are clean and well decorated. The hotel stay includes a typical Turkish breakfast. Decent spread that left us satisfied. Overall, the hotel itself was fine. The customer service is a different story and is the reason for my poor rating. Upon booking the hotel, I requested a room as far from the train as possible and got a response that they would accomodate. When we got there, only two rooms were available: street level right next to the train, or basement level with only a teeny tiny window (think dungeon) also next to the train. Obviously my request was NOT considered. The other options were the family sized rooms costing more that twice what I paid for the standard room. So, we chose the street level. Ok, fine, we can live with it. Upon arrival, the manager (owner?), gave us a very friendly (fake) greeting. After getting settled in he offered us tea and explained in depth all the excursions (very expensive) we could book through the hotel. For example, Bosphorus cruise: do it yourself using the public ferry at 25TL/person, or go through the hotel for 80EU/person. The difference? Large ferry, lunch on your own vs. more private charter, lunch provided. All other excursions were equally overpriced, especially for budget travellers like us. We were interested in a day trip to Ephesus. We calculated that we could book a private tour ourselves for much less than the group tour arranged by the hotel, so we did. We arranged the airport transfers through the hotel, also expensive but we just went with it for convenience sake. All was fine until I noticed the driver was going to the wrong airport. When I alerted the driver, he said he was told the wrong airport by the hotel receptionist. The driver felt genuinely terrible and did what he could to get us to the corrrect airport on time. He was an awesome driver. Luckily we made it to the airport, but we came very close to missing our flight. When we returned to the hotel that evening, we did not get a single apology, or even an acknowledgement fromt the hotel staff regarding their error. When I told the manager about it the next day, he blew me off and responded with a \"yes, yes, I already heard the whole story.\" Again, NO apology and I was made to feel like an inconvenience. Horrible customer service. Bottom line, once the manager realized he wasn't going to make any more money off of us through the excursions, there was a complete attitude shift. I will say that the bell hops and cleaning lady were all very nice. It's the management that stinks. We overheard other guests thank the manager for a fruit basket gift.

When my friend arrived we agreed that this was a bit steep and decided that we wouldn't continue with the arrangement but that I would stay alone. The hotel still charged me for one night despite the fact that my friend didn't stay or have breakfast and only spent about 2 hours with me in the room before heading out for dinner, no luggage was even brought over. They insisted that since the person had entered the room I would be charged, even though there was no check -in and no key was given. I was surprised with their lack of understanding or flexibility. I would definitely give the hotel a miss for many reasons; including all of the above and the fact that it is right by the train track and despite being in one of the back streets it is a very noisy location.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWell rounded place to crash!\u201d", "Author": "DualFishy", "ReviewID": "UR107275493", "Content": "Lovely staff, good location.

Almina hotel attracted our attention due to its positive reviews and location-Sultanahmet-where Agia Sofia, Blue mosque and all sorts of traditional shops and restaurants can be found. The location of the hotel is indeed great, literally 15min from the main sights and in a relatively good position for taxis (crucial in moving around the city!). The staff are also exceptionally friendly, welcoming and keen to assist anyway they can. Thats however where the positive points end. The hotel, like almost all in that area, is an old house, transformed into a hotel. This means there is literally no soundproofing-from tv's to bathrooms all can be heard! Its greatest problem though is the external noise. The hotel is situated on top of train tracks (btw nowhere do they mention that), which means that everytime the train comes through, the entire building shakes but above all the noise can be defeaning. And the train does go through ALOT! To top it all, this tiny street (that is otherwise unknown to taxi drivers) seems to attract tones of cars and passer-by day and night-especially night!again, despite double windows, one can listen not just the cars coming through bumping along the thick rocks which make up the 'street' but the conversations of the tourists and locals at all times of day and night! In general we were not satisfied. So if someone is not bothered by noise, then go ahead and pick it, because it has the advantage of its staff and location. But if noise is an issue for you, as it was for us, be ready for sleepless nights...and look for alternative accomodation", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brea, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great staff, great place to stay in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Jleon3", "ReviewID": "UR103647142", "Content": "I had a wonderful experience at The Almina hotel!!!

We were a bit apprehensive at first \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though the hotel looked good on its website, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too sure (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve travelled enough to know that sometimes what is depicted may not necessarily be what really is). But we took some comfort in the positive reviews found on Tripadvisor. My mom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction as we approached the hotel (having navigated through small roads and back lanes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on this, I must really applaud the skills of Turkish drivers!) was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not staying here, are we?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, her apprehension was doused as we stepped into the lobby of the hotel. It was tastefully decorated, clean and orderly and the gentleman manning the front-desk, Cemil Sahin, was very professional yet friendly and welcoming. Checking-in was a breeze. Our double room was on the same level as the lobby and over looked the street. Although it was small, it had all the mod-con you need, including 24hrs free wi-fi. Furnishing was smart/practical, simple with clean lines, without unnecessary flares & flounces that would make a small room feel even more compact. Bathroom was modern and again a bit on the small side. Notwithstanding, the room met our basic needs as this was not the type of holiday where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be lounging around the hotel. The most important point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the room was very clean, tidy & well maintained. And the bed, is very, very comfortable. Breakfast was a buffet of bread, cereals, cold cuts, cheese, fruits, a variety of compotes, cookies, cakes and eggs in 2 styles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c boiled and scrambled. They provide an array of choices for tea and juices. In short, a nice satisfying tuck in the morning. You can even have your breakfast up on the roof terrace, with views of the water and the beautiful Sultan Ahmet Mosque. The terrace is also nice in the evenings to chill and relax under the open sky, after a full day of touring the beautiful, amazing city that is Istanbul.

Buy similiar bread from a bakery off the tourist track and you'll discover just how good it should taste. Next issue, inadequate problem resolution.

Blue mosque is around the corner to the hotel. We were treated like family by the hotel staff, I would like to say a big thank you to the following staff members of the Almina hotel whom we have become very good friends with: Nesrin, Aziz, Zeynep and last but not least Cemil for providing us with excellent service and making our stay in Istanbul a really enjoyable one.

We were always greeted with smiles. The rooms are tidy and well furnished with modern bathrooms and the common areas of the hotel are also comfortable, updated and clean. The free wifi is a nice touch. Good tasty breakfast, plenty of variety. The location could simply not be any better - close walking distance to mostly everything on the European side. Yes, the trains do run very close to that area, but they seem to stop at night and start again in the morning so we were not bothered by them at all and didn't lose a minute of sleep from them. I've never written a review for anywhere we've stayed before, but the Almina is special and deserves the praise. Hope to go back to Istanbul someday and will definitely stay at the Almina again.

The rooms are fresh, clean and modern and breakfast is a good standard, albeit the only hot food on offer was eggs. The hotel is situated only a five minute stroll from the blue mosque.

But, our experience at Almina Hotel led us to a rocky start. I arranged an airport transfer iwth the hotel weeks in advance, and re-confirmed 2 days before. But, they did not show up. Then, we arrived to be escorted to a room in the basement with no windows with two single beds. I had booked a double. They then moved us to a double - also in the basement. It was the smallest room I'd ever been in. No walking space on either side of the bed. No place for our (small) bags. And, it smelled like mold. My allergies are hardly ever a problem, but they kept me up that night - couldn't breathe because of the mold. We called lots of hotels and finally found one with space - so we transferred the next day. But, Almina made us pay for another night because we were cancelling 3 of our 4 nights. They offered to move us to a room upstairs, but by then we were just ready to go. My suggestion - if you stay here, specify \"no basement room\".
