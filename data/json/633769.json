The location of the hotel is the main advantage. It\u2019s 100 m to supermarket, 500 m to metro \"Republica\". Good restaurant is next door. All main POI are within 30 min of walking. Very close to Via Nazionale, but quiet. I\u2019d recommend to all who's looking for a big room with the kitchen in the center of Rome.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "belgium", "Title": "\u201chotel in rome\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR127846511", "Content": "Our room includes airconditioning but we got only a fan.

And it was 70 euro per night. However, it was hard to find help when we needed something because the desk hour is from 2pm to 9 pm even though it says the service is available from 10 am, but the cleaning lady doesn't speak English. However, we left our bag pack at the hotel when we checked out 6 am in the morning, took us a while to reached someone on the phone to get help, but eventually we got it back. Highly recommend if you think service is not a big issue for your stay.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Soggiorno Europa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d633769-Reviews-Soggiorno_Europa-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$92 - $223*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Genova 24</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00184</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "633769", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7a/00/7a00af366050eef0ed28e35ea8d10fc49large.jpg"}}
