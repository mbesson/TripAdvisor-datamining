I have to say that the staff, when available, were kind, helpful and respectful. The Breakfast was very nice and included in the price. It is not great, but not terrible either.

Also the ormesini appartment was the only one with a breakfast room which was overlooking the canal. These were the only pluses of this appartment. The trouble started when one night we stayed in our room and after switching on the cooker and the heater the lights went out and in the middle of the night i had to go out of the room and go down a long very dark (pitch black) corridor to check the main switch. After coming back to the room an other 10 minutes passed and light went out again and i had to do the same procedure over again. Basically, this problem persisted for an other couple of times each time going out with a torch to check the main switch. To make things worse this corridor was open to the road outside. Also room wasn't very clean to start with, such as the pillows cases had stains on them. The hotel/appartment offer gifts to guests who spend their birthday,anniversary with them but because i booked with booking.com the hotel staff said that I couldn't avail myself from this. Also we paid a lot for this appartment but because it is an \"appartment\" we were treated with less respect i.e. no-one offered any help with anything during our stay.

From \"Piazzale Roma\" where the Ryanair bus stop is located, the hotel is in a walking distance and you don't need to take one of the steamers. In a little alley close to the estuary of the canal the hotel is located in a quiet area. Due to a late check and misunderstanding at the first day we stayed in the \"suite\" on the second floor which also has a small kitchen and a wooden balcony. It was a brilliant atmosphere and you didn't hear anyone else. For the next 3 nights we stayed in the room we originally booked. It was located right next to the room were breakfast was served but still very big. As the walls are thin you could hear noises from the breakfast room starting around 07.30 - which was not a problem for us at all since we came to Venice to see the city. People who want to sleep in, better stay in one of the rooms on the first/second floor. Breakfast was good (rolls, cereals, yoghurts, different croissants, jam, honey, nutella, ....) and absolutely satisfactory for the size of the hotel. Overall the staff was really friendly and helpful (e.g. for trips to Burano/Murano) and the area is really good as both Rialto and San Marco are in a walking distance (30min max). Right around the corner of the hotel was a small construction site - but again, we never heard the builders so it wasn't a problem either. The only negative aspect was the shower in the bathroom. As it is right under a skewness/slant, tall people might have some problems while showering.

Before I decided on this B&B, I read all of the reviews, and looked at all of the pictures taken. I saw someone's picture of a \"triple\" room that looked really spacious and had a nice white sofa in it. This looked like the perfect place for our first time in Venice, so I began emailing Beatrice. I asked for the triple room, and confirmed that it was indeed the room with the white couch and little kitchenette. She assured me that they were one and the same, so I proceeded to book the room. Upon arrival, we were shown to our room, which was on the top floor---which turned out to be the equivalent of an attic. I asked if this was the triple room, and she said that it was. I was extremely tired from our 15 hour flight, and had just caught a cold, so at that point I just settled for the room that was given us. But this definitely was NOT like the pictures I had seen online. (Please check out my photos). This room has a tiny balcony that you can climb up to, a small kitchenette, and a very small bathroom. The bed was king sized and comfortable. It also has a small TV (which is only viewable from the bed). The main drawback to this room was the height of the ceiling--I am very short, and I hit my head on the overhead beams many times, as did my husband. The room seemed dark and made me feel claustrophobic. There are only a small handful of rooms, and some of the stairs sound hollow, so we were able to hear everyone who came and went. I am not writing this review to bash the B&B-- I only want people to have a fair representation of the facts, since I have not seen another review on this particular room.

The hotel, however, does not deliver on a number of items. The innkeepers are not on site as described, the reception desk is only open from 8:30-noon, and the breakfast is basic.

The mattress was not nice. Second, breakfast was also dreadful (the coffee machine does not produce anything that tastes like coffee, albeit it claims to be able to do so).

We arrived on train and walked from the train station to the hotel around 5:30pm. It was about a 15 minutes walk and was manageable. Upon arrival we found the entrance to the building locked. There was a note on the door saying we could contact Mr. Wang in the next building, but no one answered at either place. We waited around for 15 minutes until someone finally buzzed us in. On the front desk there was a letter waiting for us with 2 keys, one to get into the building (!), the other is the room key. The letter said we could check-in and pay for our stay at breakfast the next morning. It also gave some general information about transportation around the area. Our room was on the first floor (one floor above the lobby). I had trouble with the key to get into the room but luckily my son got it to work. The room was very clean and cozy, nice hardwood floor. We had no complaints whatsoever, there is nothing fancy but it had everything we needed. Venice hotels are expensive, but this little place is a rare gem at such reasonable price. This hotel is in a very quiet neighborhood away from the tourist area, nice and comfortable. The next morning when we went down for breakfast, we met Beatrice and paid for our hotel stay in cash. We also found out we could have wi-fi for the entire stay for 5 euros. We got the ID and password from her, and were able to connect without much problem. Beatrice the nice young lady at the front desk only works during the day. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what time her shift ends but after she leaves there would be no one there until the next morning. So make sure you have a detail map and directions on how to get to the hotel if you arrive in the afternoon or evening, because no one will be there to answer the phone or to help you. Also if you want wi-fi, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the ID and password until you see Beatrice the next day. You would love this place if you are independent enough and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need any help or anything from the hotel staff. They do have many guidebooks in English on the bookshelves in the lobby in case you need info. We checked out the hotel on a Saturday morning after 2 nights stay, and the nice gentleman there that morning (found out he is the hotel owner, Beatrice is his daughter-in-law) doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak any English. Luckily the housekeeper Mr. Wang was around and he translated for us. They were fine with us leaving our luggage in the lobby until that afternoon, and allowed us to keep the key to the building for that reason. We returned to retrieve our luggage at 3pm and there was no one there. We took the private water bus line Alilaguna A from the Ponte delle Guglie stop nearby directly to the airport for 13 euro per person. The 12/24/36 hour transportation pass in Venice could not be used for this line but this really is the easiest and fastest way to go to airport from the hotel.
