The location can't be beat--right in the heart of the city so you can walk or catch public transit anywhere you'd like to go. The rooms are clean and nice, beds very comfy (though only double or king-sized beds are available, no queens), and my daughter took full advantage of the nice 24-hour fitness center. We loved the fact that the windows opened so we could get fresh air! Our 16th floor room was quiet and the staff was friendly and helpful. We also loved having Von's RoastHouse restaurant and bar available on site. You can pop in for a good $3.50 house martini after a long day of sight-seeing, and the 5-6 pm happy hour is an incredible bargain. You can order off a limited food menu for half the usual price--dishes like salmon and chips for $3.25!--so a nice dinner for two with a couple of drinks can be had for under $30 between 5 and 6 p.m., allowing you to save your money for a more extravagant lunch at Elliott's Oyster House or the Blue Acre or any of the other terrific restaurants nearby.

This one can learn a lot from them. One thing this hotel has is Von- the restaurant. Great food, service, and nice portions. This is the only reason why this hotel gets a \"3\" from me.

Pretty much the same as one of the hotels stay and dine packages I think. I was pretty excited after seeing the great reviews on here. The Roosevelt delivered. First of all this place has the best location out of any of the Seattle Hotels I have stayed at. We did quite a bit and everything was within 2 blocks. It was great! We used the Valet with no issues. I will note most valets at least offer to help with bags and such which these ones didn\u2019t. Not an issue for me, as I usually just get my own anyway. Check in was very friendly. We arrived prior to check in but was glad that a room was available. The check in staff even gave me a choice of several floors which I thought was a nice touch. We took the highest floor available. We had a deluxe King Junior suite. Not a great view, but we were up high so that was nice. Overall, I was very impressed with the room. Large living area with sofa and desk, bed was comfortable, and a flat screen TV that rotates towards living area or the bed. The only downside to this hotel and their rooms are the bathrooms. Although I don\u2019t book a room based on bathroom, I\u2019m not going to lie, I was not impressed. Very small, the shower had a hard wide spray (not adjustable). I\u2019m a tall guy so I am used to not having a spacious shower. Don\u2019t look up at the vent above the shower, could be dust and stuff there from the 1980\u2019s. It was gross looking. Anyway, as I stated, I don\u2019t book on the bathroom, but for you picky travelers, I just wanted to note it. I am guessing had we upgraded to a Jacuzzi suite it would have been bigger. The room also had a small coffee pot and coffee and a separate sink area which is nice. This room is great, especially if you are going to spend any time in there. Many Seattle hotel rooms, you would get cabin fever due to small rooms, well, not the case here. We had lunch at the attached Bar & restaurant called Vons. It was incredible. They had great food and a great beer and liquor selection. I was impressed and Vons is a must do in Seattle now. We used the dining credit for Il Fornaio which is right across the street in the mall. It was good and I will write separate reviews on the dining. Checkout was easy and quick and didn\u2019t have to wait too long to pick up the car. As a side note, I did not experience slow elevators as other stated. Keep in mind, this is an old historic hotel and there are only two elevators, so not much can be done about that. Get a low floor if you are that picky about it. I was really impressed overall and the Roosevelt is one of our new favorite Seattle Hotels. It has great location, spacious room, friendly staff, and worked out great for us. I do a decent amount of traveling and also do some travel blogging. I can\u2019t wait to share our experience with everyone. I hope they keep up with some of the specials such as Groupon and the Stay and Dine. Great opportunity for new fans like us! One side note: hey Brandon, I would love to see the Roosevelt on Facebook and Twitter. I didn\u2019t see anything except West coast hotels on Facebook. I also really like the emails you get ahead of time. No need to confirm when they remind you of the upcoming stay as well as a thank you email after you leave.

When we arrived, we were quite surprised at the room. It had obviously been re-done recently. It was a mini-suite of sorts, with a sitting area with a sofa, chair, table & also a desk.The large flat screen television was set up to swivel towards either the sitting or sleeping rooms. Internet was free, and was easy to access. We had a king size bed, even though we had only booked a queen. The bathroom was well stocked with all essentials, although it was a bit small. One of the best things about this hotel is where it is located. It is just across & down 1/2 a block from the convention center. It is within easy walking distance from shopping, dining & the always entertaining Pike Place Market. Parking is a little on the steep side, but that is the case in every parking lot in the city.

The room was very quiet even though we were only steps from the elevator, and there was no street noise at all. Slight niggles: some nooks and crannies suggested that cleaning hadn't been quite as thorough as one might hope - dust on top of a few less commonly seen horizontal surfaces. The tea/coffee service was incomplete with several choices of sugar and sweetener but no creamer.

My husband and I recently enjoyed our couple getaway at this stately hotel, as part of the Ultimate Shopping Package. First off, the location is amazing. The Roosevelt is located on the corner of 7th and Pine. It\u2019s across the street from the Convention Center and Pacific Place. It\u2019s also near Nordstrom, City Centre, and Macy\u2019s. It\u2019s easy walking distance to Westlake Center. The Roosevelt is surrounded by restaurants and shops of every variety. True to Seattle, it is within one mile of at least 8 Starbucks. It really is in the heart of Downtown Seattle. One thing I love about older hotels is they aren\u2019t all exactly the same. Each room is unique. During our stay, we had a deluxe king room, #1103. I am almost sure other rooms in this same category have different layouts. Ours was nearly a suite\u2026suite-ette? Yeah, I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ll call it. Upon entering, you\u2019ll notice a wet bar to the right. It has a small sink with only cold water, a counter top and the coffee amenities. To the right of that is the living area. There was a sofa that folded out to a sleeper, complete with sheets and blankets. There was a coffee table, a small writing desk with chair, an end table and an armchair. When the bed was folded out, it was a bit cramped, but when it was folded up, there was plenty of room.

It is a lovely older property that is run by Coast Hotels and it is in a perfect location. We were assigned a corner room on the 11th floor overlooking the city and Pine Street. My wife could see the department stores, malls and great shopping from our window, so the location was very convenient for her to just step outside and go shopping. There were many nice places to eat and Von's which has an entrance inside the hotel was a nice place to get drinks and a small meal for a reasonable price on our first night there. Just across the road was a Mall that had a variety of stores and a whole floor of restaurants. The Market and the monorail stop are down and I mean down the road. You can walk to most of the Seattle attractions and the monorail ($2.00 one way) takes you to the Space Needle and park about a mile away. The \u201cDuck Boat\u201d Tours has a stop right outside the monorail stop and it is a great way to see the city and get on the water.

I'm sure there are plenty of less poorly ran places to stay without money hungry owners in Seattle. Great location and boy do they know it. This weekend Manchester United were in town playing the Seattle Sounders, it broke a record at Quest Field (seats 67,000 and the attendance was 67,052) at least Quest Field could squeeze in 52 more. \"The Roosevelt\" or as i like to call it \"the George Bush Jr. Administration, or The Obama Administration for that matter, decided to not make one attempt to call, email, and we flew.... instead decided, in a dwindling economy, to take advantage of that super busy weekend and told us, \"Sorry some people decided to stay over in your room\" Seriously.?? Well when Quest field sells out and there is nowhere to stay perhaps $400 a night is enough to let people \"stay over\" in our booked room, this is the only time ever i've had a hotel do this and i've stayed in hotels all over California, Vegas, England wherever. The manager had some poor kid behind the desk who was shaking as he told us. What class to not even be able to face people in your own establishment and let some college kid take the heat, well done. I told them i'd rather stay with Courtney Love than this place and i was serious......steer clear unless you want them to relocate you as they did us in a dump hotel 10 miles back out towards the airport. Oh it's all good tho we got a \"free limo ride\" to this place and a courtesy shuttle bus to take us 10 miles into and back out of Seattle each time tipping the driver who was a nice guy but was not on time as in an hour late to pick us up at 11pm after the game, after walking 3 miles to our shuttle bus pickup at Krispy Kreme donuts. These people screwed us over royally and the owner should learn a lesson or eventually one will be taught P.S. class stuff to take down all of your reviews that directly connect to the official.com website your hotel in Seattle is linked to. Since there are Roosevelt hotels all the way to the east coast im sure my family and i were just a bug in your windshield, and thanks for the positive memories i'll bring back from our totally gratifying experience.

The rooms were good sized, we even had a pullout in one though we had not requested it. One complaint is the beds are higher in the middle, so you find yourself fighting to not roll toward the edge all night. Otherwise rooms were clean (sure there's a bit of mildew in corners of bathroom, just don't touch it) and adequate. We stayed on 16th floor first go round and had good views, but 6th floor on return was of a building, but we did not care since we were in/out in a day. The front desk was always professional and pleasant. The check in gal did make a point of saying when we checking in \"ah, I see you have booked through XXXX\" and even though she did eventually honor our request to check in early (while other guests were going up to their rooms already at 11 am) we had to wait until after 1. Maybe they do those rooms last, but whatever, she did not make us wait til 4 and we thanked her for that. They were great about keeping our bags while we toured Seattle on our return from cruise at 10 am and they did put us all on the same floor. They also arranged for reasonable/dependable transport to airport. The hotel is very elegant and warm, the Van's restaurant is very close seating (always getting bumped in the back) with small chairs and is very loud at times. Food was so so. The continental breakfast is adequate and is value priced at $9.95, we balked at first but came back when we realized it was a bargain considering the other local choices and it does include bacon, eggs, sausages etc. which we did not realize at first either. We would go back and do recommend it as an affordable hotel in Seattle, hint: we booked months ahead through discounter and the price never went down to that again even days before. Also, they evidently were overbooked since I did overhear the desk clerk stating that she had just received a booking through another discounter that they would have to \"walk\" since they had to rooms for those dates. She voiced that a \"manager had not locked out the system properly\" and that was the reason for the error. So those folks would arrive and be told there's no room at the inn. I think the lesson here is to book early through discounters, and be prepared to relocate if you book late--oh and always confirm even though the discounter will say it is not necessary, I am glad I did, we had no problems.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richland, Washington", "Title": "\u201cVery noisy, tiny bathroom, no alternate room offered.\u201d", "Author": "mystydawnwaters", "ReviewID": "UR115343575", "Content": "Fairly old hotel with some aspects renewed, but some important ones not.

She told us to our face that we booked the two queens when we booked the one king bed. I asked her for proof, a print screen, anything that supported her statement that us, a couple, would book two queen beds and instead she told us to call priceline ourselves. She is the worst hotel \"manager\" I've ever encountered. Her young minion that looked like he was 12 was similar.

Also, the express bus to the airport stops right across the street, in front of the Hyatt -- doesn't get easier than this; costs $10.25. The location is excellent -- a short walk to the monorail to the Space Needle, an even shorter walk to the Convention Center, tons of shopping, and great restaurants. BE SURE to eat at Von's, which is attached to the hotel. They fruitwood roast their own meats and make homemade vanilla ice cream. The bacon in the morning is baked with brown sugar and tastes amazing. Also hit the Cheesecake Factory, yes it's a chain and it's jammed, but the fish especially is really outstanding. The cheesecake is the fluffy kind and comes in dozens of flavors.", "Date": "April 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellevue, Washington", "Title": "\u201cStill like it\u201d", "Author": "travelling_rocks", "ReviewID": "UR7303227", "Content": "I have stayed at the Roosevelt a few times and it is a hotel I like to recommend to people. Location is great and the price is usually a little lower than other hotels in the neighbourhood. HOWEVER, there is a bit of a catch. The hotel is dated, but clean and does not have that sad shabby feeling. Rooms are relatively small. This time I had a room smaller than I have ever seen in the US, it was a size of a London hotel room. Bathroom was a size of a closet. Anybody approaching 6 ft would have had major issues trying to get clean. But I did have a Sound view and with a location like that I was not planning to spend much time in my room. Most likely I will be back.

So it was that we were given a room next to the elevator (not noisy, as it turned out, but still) and overlooking the inner roof and vents. No view to speak of. It was a dark room, and oddly laid out. The bathroom was an unremarkable size, but had very little counter space for two men to set out shaving gear. The decor and furbishings were too dark for how little light came into the room, and they were not all that stylish. The beds were overly soft. I found myself slipping down to one side of the mattress each night as well. I was also dismayed to have to pay for Internet connection in the room. Given the likely great number of conference attendees who stay, the hotel should provide connections at no charge. The location sells the hotel, but even then, many other hotels are not much farther for walking to the conference center.

It's literally one block from Washington State Convention & Trade Center, where I had a work related conference. I stayed 4 nights, 5 days. Plus it's directly across the street from the Gray Line Seattle Downtown Airporter, only $17 round trip, to and from the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport main terminal. Believe me, when you are tired from running around all day, having a hotel you can practically crawl home to is a blessing. Plus it was close enough to take breaks back at the room during the day. The concierge/front desk was nice enough to hold onto my luggage the last day of the conference, even though I checked out that morning, so I didn't have to haul it around with me all day. The room was unexpectedly tiny, but sufficient if you just want a place to crash at night. The bathroom was so small, you had to close the bathroom door before using the toilet. Maybe not a big deal for men, but women may find themselves not being able to reach the toilet paper after sitting down if they left the door open. The shower was so small, there was no room to bend over inside the shower space. I'm 5'6\" and I had to lean out the door to wash my feet and legs. No tub, just the small shower stall. The good thing is that the shower set-up encourages you to save water. You have to turn the water off to soap up since there is no place to get out of the shower stream while in the stall. I had a room on the back-side, away from the city street. The good things are that it was quiet and private (only a brick wall straight across from the window). The bad thing was that it was directly over the vent to one of the greasy food restaurants. So, you had a choice. Either have the window open and smell old grease, or have the window closed and have a nice, white noise background sound from all the fans and vents that were in the area. The food situation was challenging. There was no supermarket, mini-mart or drugstore close to stock up on munchies and water. There was a Starbucks (surprise) directly across the street, so I got a big plastic cup I used the whole visit as well as paying too much for juice and water. There is a Bartell Drugs on 5th & Olive, but it was out of the way. I did pick up a few things on the 3rd day. Luckily, the conference provided food in the evening of most days, but I was on my own a couple days. Since I had eaten at the San Francisco one, I ate at Ruth's Chris Steak House, about one block away. Von's Grand City Cafe is off the hotel lobby and it reminded me of a TGIF or Applebee's. Service was terrible, but it was close. Other alternatives I noticed within one block, I didn't check out: GameWorks (bar/junk food), Cheesecake Factory, Fox Sports Grill (down stairs), Dragonfish Asian Cafe. Overall, the concierge and front desk were very helpful. Two small annoyances. When I arrived, the front desk clerk was chatting on the phone and trying to check me in at the same time. I didn't know whether he was talking to me or the person on the phone. Second, I had a package of extra stuff I had bought such as books I wanted shipped back home. Even though I made all arrangements to have it go out on Tuesday, the package was still sitting at the hotel as of Thursday. It only went out then because I called to ask about it.", "Date": "October 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel,\u201d", "Author": "nelsonw152", "ReviewID": "UR5724325", "Content": "We spent one night at the Roosevelt Hotel in early August.

Our mid July stay was everything one could have hoped for. The room was good size and fairly priced with a nice few of the Pacific Place mall. The bed was big and comfy and had lots of pillows. Situated downtown in the shopping area made it a great location. The girlfrien loved being so close to all her favorite stores; Banana Republic, J. Crew, Abercrombie & Fitch, Ann Taylor, etc. And since everything was within reasonable walking distance was a huge plus that allowed us to ditch the rental car once we got into the city. Pike Place market was a nice walk right down the hill allowing us to make daily visits. The only things not necessarily within walking distance for some would have been Pioneer Square, the International District and Seattle Center. We still walked to most of these as it was not all that far from the hotel and provided a better up close look at everything in between. Free buses in the downtown area was nice and we utilized them to get a little closer to Seattle Center on the way to. The staff were all friendly and receptive throughout our stay. And the concierge was especially helpful as was the valet attendant on our arrival date. He actually went down in the garage, to the 4th level, to retrieve our rental while we were checking in and putting our luggage in the room. Our last day the concierge set up a towncar to get us to the airport, but it was 20 minutes late which of course is no fault of him or the hotel. The front desk allowed us to check in early, really like 4 hours early. And housekeeping made the room everyday with fresh linens and towels keeping the room clean and tidy throught the stay. The one weird thing was the bathroom light switch was outside the bathroom and the windows in the room would not stay open; the would just slide back down and close. Frustrating but not a big deal.
