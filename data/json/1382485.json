The cab ride to Ataturk Airport is short and Ye\u00c5\u0178ilk\u00c3\u00b6y is a calm, relaxing place after the hectic pace of Istanbul. While I love Istanbul as a city, sometimes I need a break from its frantic pace. As the name suggests, the hotel is situated directly across the road from the Ye\u00c5\u0178ilk\u00c3\u00b6y Marina, which provides pleasant views. For the small price difference, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suggest a sea view room. Ye\u00c5\u0178ilk\u00c3\u00b6y itself has lots of green space along the waterside and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to get a lot of western tourists. Consequently, prices are lower than in Istanbul proper and strolling along through the parks provides a pleasant diversion. The hotel is not fancy, but we found it to be a clean, comfortable mid-range establishment, with a number of good fish restaurants in the immediate vicinity. The main street of the area, Istasyon Caddesi, is 10 minutes away. Should you wish to take a train into Istanbul, the journey from Ye\u00c5\u0178ilk\u00c3\u00b6y to Sirkeci station takes about 40 minutes. Our rooms were a good size (especially by European standards) and the en-suite showers had lots of water pressure. Windows can be opened to catch the breeze off the ocean and we found the area to be very quiet at night. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m told that the hotel provides a pick-up service from Ataturk airport, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a chance to use it, owing to our having confused this hotel with the Airport Inn Boutique Hotel, where we went initially. Fortunately the two hotels are within walking distance of each other. One caution \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel has no lift; something to consider if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a higher floor.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "istanbul", "Title": "\u201cPlease beware\u201d", "Author": "877toad", "ReviewID": "UR120316290", "Content": "I had to stay on a business trip for two weeks, and in the end insisted that I was moved.

I wonder if they meant to book us into the Airport Hotel. The Airport Inn Hotel is a completely different type of hotel and not the same quality as the other hotels on our trip. The two hotels have similar names but are completely different. The Airport Inn Hotel was not as near the airport as I expected. They placed my children in a room on another floor across the hotel from our room even though the hotel had many empty rooms. The carpets looked like someone had glued old blankets on the floor. There was an open electrical socket with wires jutting out in contact with one of my children's beds. The bathrooms had calk falling out and did not appear clean. We did not try to use the TV, but it appeared to be from several decades ago. It had those old-fashioned dials on it. I went back and forth from my children's room to our room several times and noticed several odd things. The doors of many of the rooms were standing open. Most of the open rooms appeared unoccupied, but one was standing open lights off and with clothing, and open suitcases on the beds. The place did not smell good. I did not feel safe there so I stayed awake all night and checked on my kids several times. I moved my son's bed away from the outlet with the wires sticking out. The people who drove us to and from the hotel appeared to work for the hotel. They said that they were going to charge us for the trip to the airport but when I insisted on looking at their booking and asked to call the booking agency, they agreed that they were not supposed to charge us for the trip.

Lots of posh Turkish restaurants nearby with a view of the sea. Great place to walk and spend the last night of your trip if you have an early plane to catch and you want to leave the city! 2) You can make it to Istanbul's Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk Airport with taxi in less than 15 minutes and that will cost you exactly 12 TL with the taximeter on. Ask the driver specifically to turn the taximeter on otherwise he will ask for 15 TL! 3) The staffs are OK and polite. The Internet is Free but slow. The Phone and the TV sets are very old and maybe from the Second World War! Room was clean but basic, and I was not satisfied with the bathroom which is small. 4) One night is going to cost you 55 Euro include the breakfast. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to try their breakfast but I would not expect anything especial anyway. 5) I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it for more than one night.

We liked the location so much (in a posh suburb with lots of cafes, and a promenade along the marina) that we didn't even venture into the center of Istanbul. We were quite pleased with the place--until we tried to go to sleep, and smelled the heavy cigarette smoke from a nearby room, which seemed to be coming directly through the walls. The other problems came as we checked out in the morning. Before arrival, I had confirmed via email that the van transfer back to the airport was 15TL. The young man at reception confirmed this when we arrived at the hotel. But when we were preparing to leave the next day, suddenly the price became 20TL! The hotel employee (who was also the van driver) said that 15TL was the price for a regular taxi, not the hotel van, which, if true, had not been made clear at all. He also charged me for a local phone call that his colleague, a very nice young woman, had told me the evening before was free of charge.
