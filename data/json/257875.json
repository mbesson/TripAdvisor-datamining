Because it is in Surrey Hills with loads of good restaurants; because I get a washing machine to wash my clothes on a long trip; because I can buy local produce and make myself a meal. So what is my grouse? The place feels grubby and tired; the bathroom floor has not been washed; my feet get black if I walk barefoot on the carpet. The frequency of replacement of household items is inconsistent: one face flannel (for 2 guests) one day, none the next. Dishwasher powder one day, none the next. Broadband (for which I pay) Day 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c none, Day 2 it works fine, Day 3 none. No spare toilet roll so we run out, and so on. There are never any plugs for the basins, neither in the bathroom nor the kitchen. There are no lamps in the sitting room so we are bathed in a cold overhead light reflecting off the mushroom coloured walls. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153art\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd consists of a massive photo of the grubby end of a glacier; cold, slushy, like snow at the beginning of spring. The broken light fitting dangles from the cable out of the bathroom ceiling; the shower diverter sends 2/3rds of the water into the bath; the basin tap is broken. There are archaeological remains screwed into the bathroom and bedroom walls from long vanished fitments. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a check out time later than 11.00 unless you pay A$60 per hour. The baggage storage is in the corner of the office so not particularly secure. The Adina is on busy Crown Street, so the traffic noise is significant unless you pay a premium for a courtyard room. So why do I stay here? 1 Washing machine & tumble dryer. 2 My own kitchen dining space. 3 close to decent restaurants and food shops and walking distance from my office. I will come back but please spend some money on the place soon. I reported all the faults shown here so hopefully they will be fixed by the time the next guest arrives.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect in all ways\u201d", "Author": "NaiNai38", "ReviewID": "UR126722980", "Content": "I booked the Adina on line for two reasons: location and price.

The apartment was excellent value at the price of a hotel room closer to the city. Once we figured out how to walk to the central station (about 10 minutes walk) we could explore Sydney easily. The Sydney daily transport passes was great value for the family at $20/adult, $10/child with the other child traveling for free. The kitchen crockery and cutlery was limited and I certainly wouldn't try and cooking anything more complicated than pancakes (which we did on 2 occasions). I am sure the staff would have reacted well to any request for additional kitchen utensils if needed. When we needed to have the hair dryer replaced (after it started smoking!) the staff reacted very positively and promptly to our request. Surry Hills (particularly along Oxford Street) had a redlight district feel which I hadn't expected and I felt uncomfortable, yet safe, when we took the family down along Oxford Street on our first evening. After that we avoided the area by using the Central Station. If I had one complaint it was that the Internet was a rip-off at $25/day.

A 5 min down the road will lead to the retail oasis that is Oxford St. The rooms at this place are stunning.

These places are gorgeous! 2 double bedrooms both with LCD ands a chic kitchen and lounge room which sprawls out onto a massive patio. I felt like calling all my friends for a party! However, the other times we have stayed there we have stayed in a 1 bedroom, a couple of times were havent had a patio/deck as some of the apartments as designed differently to others. Some are very open planed with a large deck/patio and some are very narrow with no deck at all.
