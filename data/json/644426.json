We got the room for barely \u20ac100 for a night combined - not bad for a 4-star hotel in Rome at the end of peak season! As I arrived before my friend, I had some time to take in the surrounding area. From the centre of Rome or from Termini, this hotel requires a metro then a bus, or a short train ride but it is situated a few hundred metres from the FS station if you decide to take the train direct from Termini. The metro/bus is probably the better option especially if you have luggage. The area is quite quiet as it is about 13km from downtown Rome. Predominantly local families who, while maybe not overly friendly, are keen to help out should you become lost (as I did, rather embarrassingly at the back of what turned out to be the hotel itself!) The room was lavishly equipped and the bathroom equally so. Air-con worked fantastically and provided a good night's sleep - ideal as we had both been travelling the whole day! Although I feared the beds were joined together they were in fact singles which could be pushed apart. A good night's sleep therefore ensued. Breakfast was included in the fare and was decent enough. Maybe not as good as other hotels of a similar calibre but let's not forget the price tag. The only real gripe I have with this hotel is its shuttle bus. Merely a Mercedes Sprinter with panoramic windows, it did not show at its appointed time in the morning to take us to the Metro station. Clearly running on Italian Summer time i.e do a no-show! For us this wasn't a massive issue as we had prepaid public transport tickets for the duration of our stay in Rome, but many others were left very frustrated at having to travel on (and no doubt pay for) a public bus. The main road was about 300 metres from the hotel, thankfully slightly downhill. The bus service into Rome and towards the Metro station is fast and frequent. For the money I would definitely stay at the Capanelle again. The price resembled that of 4-star hotels a few years ago, whilst maintaining that good old fashioned charm of a well-kept privately owned hotel. I can also see it being an ideal hotel for those who come to Rome by car but who don't want to drive within Rome. If I couldn't match the price again I would search alternative hotels but at the time of booking the Capanelle, I had seen 2-and 3-star hotels nowhere near as cheap. Bravo Hotel Capanelle, you have one very satisfied customer here!

The distance from the Fiumicino airport and the hotel is quite far about 30-40 mins and will cost 55 euros in a taxi. Make sure you agree a price cause they will rip you off. And beware that they drive like nutters. Just close ya eyes. The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are big with all you need but the room I had the shower was a nightmare and the toilet was a bit dodgy. But all in all a nice hotel. One thing that did annoy me is that if you get a room with a balcony you can\u2019t open it. You have to phone reception and ask them to open it and then ring them again to ask them to close it as they won\u2019t give you a handle. On average it took about 4 rings to get them to open and close it. Not very good at all. Staff were friendly enough but not that helpful when it came to information about getting into town. So the easiest way was to get the bus to the metro line. The bus stop is out the hotel and turn left then next right and you can see the main road. Then it\u2019s the first bus stop you see its yellow. Bus will come from the left. Get on the bus and stamp your ticket. Then you have 75 mins to get to where you want to go. Plenty of time really. The 664 and the 663 are the buses to get. The 664 is the easiest as the 663 goes all round the houses and you have no idea when to get off the bus to get to the hotel. So I would recommend the 664 to the Arco di travertine metro stop. You can also get off at the Colli Albani which is the next stop along on the bus. The metro is really easy to use as there is only 2 lines to go on. For tickets the hotel sometimes has tickets so buy then when you can but the ticket machines at the stations are easy enough to use. These cost 1 euro for a 75 mins trip on either bus or metro so get it all in in one hit and its quite a bargin really. There is a shuttle bus that goes from the hotel to Cinecitta but the times are not very good and I would just hop on the 664 bus and go in that way. The only problem you might have that I did was knowing which stop to get off at on the way home. The area is quite open and so when the bus goes from being surrounded by shops and houses and is built up to looking open and green. Then get off you can also see the ruins which gives you an indication where to get off the bus. The stop is just after a hotel which has a big green sign. The food in the hotel I found not very good at all. I did eat there a few times and wasn\u2019t really impressed. The breakfast was very good though with a lot of choice but can get really busy at the weekends when you have to queue to get in the door. Also if your on your own like I was be careful they will clear your table away when you are up getting a glass of orange juice. There is a happy hour between 5-7 when the drinks are half price. So a beer is 2 euros which is much better. There are local ruins that you can go and see but its 6 euros to get in them but they are just across the road called Villa Quintilli. There is a local supermarket just up the road. Take a left out the hotel and walk to the end of the road which is about 2 mins away. The staff are friendly and the shop itself is well stocked. The water is much cheaper than the hotel. Hotel will charge about 90 cents for water which isn\u2019t too bad but the shop is about 15 cents for a bottle. If you are buying wine then the staff are more than happy for you to open it there so you don\u2019t have to worry about it back at the hotel. But I did find the hotel were happy enough to open it for you aswell. A good bottle of wine was about 2 euros. Bargin. Also I did find Limoncello for 3.60 euros. Which was too hard to resist. The trip into Rome itself from the hotel is a bit of a trek but its easy enough and as the hotel was cheaper what do you expect. It will take about 40 min if things turn up at the right times. I was there on business so we had a course in the hotel all week and then we did manage to get out in the evenings to have a look round. I would say the conference part was ok but they moved us after 2 days of being in a certain room and things kept going missing like pens and drawing boards and the projector was changed. Which did drive out course speaker a little mad. The rooms were not well air conditioned either. And when we had coffee breaks and lunch at the hotel they were never ready for us. Which when you are only given 30 mins for lunch and things arent ready makes lunch really rushed. If you need help with transport I found this site really helpful http://www.atac.roma.it/ just plug in 664 and it will give you the route and times. BIT \u2013 biglietto integrato a tempo \u2013 bus and any metro line 1 euro BIG \u2013 biglietto integrato giornaliero \u2013 daily ticket 4euro BTI \u2013 biglietto turistico integrato \u2013 3 day travel ticket As long as you leave an hour each way to get in and out of the city its fine for public transport. But you can get the bus in and then if you want to stay out late get a taxi home. Should be about 15-20 Euros for the trip. I hope that this has been helpful for you. Enjoy Rome is a lovely place.

It is very clean and very friendly. I travelled with my Boyfriend and we stayed for 12 days. I acknowledge the \"Bad Location\" reviews but frankly people should do their research before and not leave a stinking review. The beauty of Capanelle is that it is not too far out, but you are in real Rome surrounded by real Italian residents and you are able to enjoy the Italian culture much more than if you were in a very touristy part of Rome for the whole of your stay. Furthermore, the Free Shuttle Bus Service and the extremely cheap metro service Rome offers it is hard to understand why people are moaning!! The value for money and easy access to central Rome allows you to be standing by the Colosseum within 30 minutes. The Shuttle Bus runs all day and as long as you have a timetable (an example of which I have attached) you will be more than fine. It is fantastic value for money. When you first walk into the hotel there is a huge reception (which I have pictured). The breakfast has an endless list of food available: Croissants, Eggs bacon, Cake, Coffee, Tea, Juice the list goes on and it is all tasty and fresh... much more than we expected! The swimming pool is a smaller area but never too and for 3 euro\u2019s you get a clean fresh towel everyday (and you are allowed to use your own) All of Capanelle's employees were friendly, hardworking and all \"go the extra mile\".

Nurses behaved like prison officers towards patients and their family members. They got angry at them every time someone asked how long before they were able to see a doctor.

The shuttle bus to the nearest town - Colli Albani ( I may have spelt that wrong sorry!) in on time and efficient getting you there in about 10-15 minutes. Its only a short 10 minute metro to Rome itself. Now the down side. The food is rubbish. I spoke to other guests to see what they thought (we are both vegetarians and have got used to average food) they confirmed our view from a meat eaters point of view and agreed that the food was bland and expensive. Same goes for the breakfast except for one more thing, its cold. I like runny scrambled eggs but it was just too runny for me, plus when we got the lukewarm food to the table it was cold. Also the coffee and juice machines broke down or ran out of coffee. Not good. The rooms: These were a good size, clean, with a good air con and trhe bathroom was adequate. Rooms were serviced daily and restocked with the essentials. The bad points of the rooms? Well if you wanted to stand on the balcony (there were no chairs) you had to call reception, who then sent someone up to open the door - which turned off the air con - and when you wanted the door close to had to call reception to get someone to come up and close it! Weird! In conclusion I can say this is a clean, well run hotel with professional and friendly staff. However I think this hotel is more geared toward the professional / business traveller and is not suited to tourists.

When we checked-in we found out that the shuttle stop had been moved to the Colli Albani metro station (1 stop before Arco di Travertino) due to roadwork or some kind of problem near the other 2 stations. You can also take bus 663/664 from the Colli Albani metro to the hotel. The only disappointment was the lack of updated information about the hotel shuttle.

We actually ended up using this more than the hotel bus as it meant we weren't tied to the hotel schedule. We bought a 7 day metro and bus pass for 16 Euros and it was well worth it, extremely good value. We found the staff at the hotel extremely helpful, although we did have to ask twice for extra pillows, but this was our only issue. The staff at breakfast were pleasant and welcoming, in particular a Nigerian girl called Lovely, who really did live up to her name and made breakfast an extremely enjoyable experience! The hot food at the breakfast wasn't as hot as it could have been, but everything else was very good. The rooms were comfortable, clean and spacious. We had a regular double room and it was perfect. Every day when we returned the room was clean with fresh sheets and towels. There was plenty of wardrobe and drawer space and a nice sized bathroom with shower over bath. Although we didn't eat in the hotel restaurant during our stay, we went for a drink in the bar a few times and very much enjoy it. There were complimentary bar snacks and sweet biscuits on the bar, and a lovely outside terrace. The bar staff were all extremely friendly and attentive, particularly Vincenzo who was always chatty and smiling. The price of the hotel was fantastic for a stay in Rome and we would definitely go back here and recommend it. The distance from the centre meant it was quiet and peaceful, but not too far away from the city. We also went to a nearby steakhouse (La Taverna Del Parco Bisteccheria) which is about 20 minutes walk from the hotel, and was superb - our best meal of the holiday, and so good we went back on our last night.

Small pool but it was perfect for cooling off in ,after a day in rome sightseeing. The breakfast was excellant, providing bacon, eggs, as well as the usual continental breakfast , cereal and fruit.

The metro costs one euro, and at each stop there are plenty of sights to see. Just up at the top of the road is a supermarket, and to the right are a couple of eating places which are basic but far cheaper than the meals in the hotel which are expensive. Water from the supermarket costs around 20p and in the hotel its about \u00a32.00!! Dinner for two with wine costs about 70 Euros. Its a shame that they dont provide a cheaper menu, as most guests we met went out looking for somewhere else to eat. We only ate there once in the week due to the cost. Before ordering from a menu in rome itself CHECK the price first. We heard of many couples who did not and found they had paid the equivalent of \u00a330.00 for two drinks and icecream!! We found most of the hotel staff were not that friendly. They have happy hour from 5 til 7, when all drinks are half price, so order a bottle of wine before 7, and have it with dinner, or buy it from the supermarket for 3 instead of 18 euros!

The bed was a little hard, but the room was spacious. there is free 24 hour wifi so for my partner needing to use his laptop was perfect. We had looked at other hotels and some were charging for wifi use 15 euros per day. The 664 and 663 buses run directly back to the hotel from the metro stop Colli albani, should you miss the shuttle bus. Make sure that you wait for the shuttle bus at least 10mins before it leaves, as once all seats are full no one else is permitted on the bus. It runs to the airport early in the morning and the evening. Taxis are very expensive, but as public transport is easily available and very cheap there should be no reason to take one.

Coming back we were invariably tired and instead took a taxi from the City Centre (approximately \u20ac25). Just a quick word of warning, be careful with the Rome taxi drivers they will almost always offer a fixed price for your trip (i.e. not on the meter). If you do not want to pay double the correct price (at least) politely refuse and tell them you want the journey on the meter! Some will refuse in which case find another taxi - there is no shortage! The Rooms were exceptionally clean and very comfortable. The first night we had a problem with a strange intermitent bussing noise. Had we not have been completely knackered from driving 400km it would certainly have kept us awake. Next morning I was wondering how I could explain this strange noise to the receptionist, but when I started my description he immediately knew what I meant. In fact it was very clear that this is not the first time this fault had been reported in this Room. This really annoyed me - why did they allocate the Room when they knew of the problem? But anyway, we were allocated a new room and the rest of the stay was uneventful, in fact very pleasant. There is a limited choice of dinning in the local area.

The bathroom is amazing and the location of this hotel its very quite.

The shuttle bus collects from the airport or takes you to the station (we didn't use it preferring a local taxi) but saw many people travelling that method. There was a pool but it was closed though no signs to say that, we saw one couple being told to get out which didn't thril them.. I'm not sure why but the security guard was pacing back and forth staring at people, at one point my husband picked up a leaflet and perched on the arm of the very substantial leather settee to show me it, within 5 seconds the guard was there and in an unfriendly manner told him to get off the arm at once and sit properly! We were so shocked neither of us said a thing, but really, it was no way to treat customers...

What a lovely city, if expensive. We decided to stretch our finances by staying at the Capannelle. Well first off the hotel offer a free bus from Ciampiano airport to the hotel. Please email before and request a timetable to ensure your flight landing time fits this. The only true alternative is a taxi, which is a flat 30 Euro fee. Unfortunately I learnt this lesson the hard way. The shuttle bus becomes a Godsend. It also drops you and collects you from two of the Metro stations (Arco di Travertino and Cinecitt\u00e0). Beware the metro does close Sunday to Friday at 9pm. So again taxi's after that. Once at the hotel, which isn't in the most attractive of places, having said that it's not that bad, the hotel it's self is lovely. It's mainly a very clean, Marble palace. The receptionists are extremely friendly and helpful and there are usually a bellhop around if you need. it. Rooms are not available until 2pm, we arrived early, but they have a secure locked room to leave your cases. The rooms are clean, with extremely large (I'd say super king) sized beds. They are a bit hard for my liking, but everyone's different. The room had a lovely shower/bath all clad in marble, a mini bar, wardrobe, tub chair and dressing table with a flat screen TV showing different language satellite TV channels, along with the usual pay per view movies and adult entertainment and films. They are a bit steep at 10 Euro a viewing so beware. The English channels are quite poor especially as both Eurosport and MTV are meant to be English but were not. There is a restaurant with an executive chef, but we did not use this so cannot comment. We did however use the complimentary breakfast. It's down a level (level -1 in the lift). It's the usual continental meats, cheese and rolls. Toast, cereals, fruit and Yoghurt's. Also streaky bacon and smoked sausages. Also a large selection of home-made cakes and doughnuts. There is endless tea/coffee/cappuccinos/water/fruit juices. Overall it filled a gap and was definitely plentiful. It's nothing to write home about.

We asked a few of the friendly, young, Italian, behoodied tour-operator/guide types hanging around various bus shelters there where it would pick us up. We were pointed towards shelter 3, but none of them seemed to know exactly when. We waited for about half an hour in the draining afternoon sunshine before deciding to take a taxi. We paid 36 Euros for the privilege, but we later learned that we would have had to wait till around 6.50pm for the next free shuttle bus. So unless you happen to find yourself at the bus stop at 7am, 9am, 11am or 6.50pm (Mon-Fri) or 7.10am, 8.10am, 9.10am, 12.50pm or 7.50pm (Sat-Sun-Bank Holidays) a taxi is your best bet. These are the current bus times in April 2011, but of course you should check out the latest times when you travel. We also found the shuttle bus to be incredibly useful (and money-saving!) on each day of our short trip to get into central Rome for all the sites. The bus would leave at various times during the day from the hotel and, in less than 15minutes usually, drop us off at either Cinecitta or Arco di Travertino Metro station. From there, it was a quick and easy and hassle-free ride to wherever we fancied in Rome. At the end of our sightseeing day, we would head back to one of the aforementioned Metro stations at one of the designated times and be taken back to Hotel Capannelle. The system is a good one. Essential, in fact, considering how far the hotel is from all the major tourist attractions! The alternative would have been spending nigh-on 90-100 Euros a day just for taxis! We did find a few glitches with the system, however. For a start, it is essential that you arrive at least 20 mins before the designated time as the bus drivers have a habit of arriving a few minutes early at the stop, hovering up any waiting hotel guests and immediately leaving for the hotel! Anyone arriving on time is liable to see the back end of the bus trundling off into the distance! The other thing to consider is that that although the bus service continues through the night until 12.15am, the entire Metro system is currently shutting down at 9pm owing to some building works. I understand that there are replacement bus services available after 9pm, but journey times are bound to be much longer and more difficult than the Metro itself. We were happy to return to Capannelle on the 6.30pm bus from Cinecitta or, at the latest, on the 8.30pm bus from Arco di Travertino after long hours traipsing around Rome. But we never got to see Rome by night or enjoy any of Rome\u2019s night-time entertainments. If you don\u2019t come truly alive until darkness falls, Capannelle is probably not best placed for your needs. But for those wanting a comfortable (if not exactly swanky) four-star hotel in an incredibly quiet and safe upmarket residential neighbourhood, Capannelle is ideal. We heard absolutely no noise from outside and practically zero noise from within the hotel. That, coupled with an extremely comfortable (ie. comfortably hard and sturdy and spacious) bed meant that we slept better at Capannelle than we have in practically every other hotel room we\u2019ve ever been in! The room itself was very clean, with tasteful, if not exactly opulent, d\u00e9cor and was a very decent size indeed. (Think just slightly smaller than the biggest family rooms available at Premier Inns in the UK.) On the other hand, we weren\u2019t exactly impressed with the bathroom. The plughole was almost blocked for the first night, the toilet was idiotically positioned too close to the counter area which meant that anyone with shoulders wider than Olive Oyl had an uncomfortable time on the throne and the water pressure in the shower was merely satisfactory at best. Oh, and because the shower-screen was one of those that only covers a third of the length of the bath, unless we positioned the shower head almost directly over the plughole, the rest of the bathroom got intolerably wet every time anyone had a shower! Attention to detail was definitely lacking in Capannelle overall. The breakfast was decent, if typical, European fare \u2013 scrambled eggs, roast potatoes, cheeses, cold cuts, yoghurts, juices, hot drinks from a machine, cereals, fruits, toast, a good selection of cakes and croissants and pastries and a mutant-sized jar of Nutella! Certainly enough to fuel you up for the day ahead. The service at the front desk was variable. (Varying from bordering-on-the-impatient to the genuinely warm and helpful. Ileniya \u2013 apologies if I misspelled her name \u2013 was particularly accommodating and friendly.) One of the attractions of Capannelle for me was the presence of an outdoor swimming pool. And it is certainly set in a lovely little outdoor area. Unfortunately, the pool was closed during our stay. But I can imagine it being just splendid in the height of summer. It being a residential area, there is absolutely zilch to see and do within walking distance of the hotel. There is a sub-prime supermarket (Todis) down the road (which out-Lidls Lidl!!) which is pleasingly cheap and perfect for water and snacks and fruit and toiletries and etc. There is a beautiful-looking restaurant a short walk beyond Todis (adjacent to the busy Via Appio Nova) called Gira Solo. The food was quite acceptable for us (we\u2019re vegetarian) and was a good default option on the days when we didn\u2019t have time to eat in central Rome without missing our last bus back to the hotel. Also, the staff were very welcoming and at least two of them spoke excellent English. (And the other lady who didn\u2019t speak English very well understood my incompetent Italian sufficiently!) To summarize, I\u2019d say that if peace and a good night\u2019s rest in a safe area are high priorities for you, Hotel Capannelle is perfect. If true luxury, proximity to central Rome or a yearning to indulge in Rome\u2019s nightlife are important to you, look elsewhere.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cOK, but wouldn't choose for a Rome holiday\u201d", "Author": "JBerkeley73", "ReviewID": "UR103205463", "Content": "The hotel is located in a residential area, located roughly between Ciampino airport (10 min) and Cinecitta metro station (10 min).

Set in a very quiet suburban area about 15 minutes away from Ciampino Aiport, the hotel is modern, bright, spacious and had a hint of luxury to it. The staff are very pleasant, smart and friendly. We stayed in a classic double room and to be honest, we didn't really need anything more than that. The room was bright with huge windows, beautifully decorated and the bed was massive.

With plenty of times running to two metro stations (Arco di Travertino and Cinecitta), we had no problems getting to and from the centre of Rome.The metro ride in to Termini took about 20 minutes and cost a euro and there we transferred across to the B line and got off at Colosseo. It literally took no more than 30 minutes to get from our room to the Colosseum. The only big disappointment was that we could not stay an extra night as the hotel was fully booked! We had only booked a one way ticket and alas! there were no returning flights on the Monday. Our options were to stay another night at the hotel or fly from Fiumicino Airport back to London Gatwick which would have meant a long journey back to Cardiff.

After searching and reviewing hotels across all areas of Rome, we decided on the Capanelle. The hotel seemed to have great reviews, good value for money and good facilities. After our visit I can agree with this totally. A few days before our trip I emailed the hotel regarding the free shuttle service they offer and was emailed back the very next day with the timetable and advised that the bus would be slightly to the left, outside the airport lounge on our arrival. This was exactly the case. The yellow hotel capanelle bus was there waiting for us. It is approximately a 20 minute drive from the airport to hotel and although when driving to the hotel it would appear that a lot of the buildings nearby are run down, after a short while in Rome you will realise that this is not so bad an area and that in actual fact, most of Rome does look run down! As we arrived at the hotel a couple of hours before check in time, our luggage was placed inside for us. Reception staff are polite and welcoming. We then walked up the road to the left of the hotel. Here there is a Todis supermarket. It is really cheap in there and I would recommend this for things such as water, fruit, any snacks and the lovely bakery counter in there. Also if you take a left from the hotel and then a left again, at the bottom of that road you will find a few more shops and a market there on a friday. When we were allowed into the room we found it to be spacious, clean, huge bed, safe inside wardrobe (free), fridge with mini bar, hair dryer in bathroom, nice big window, bathroom spotlessly clean. The only grumble I would have was that there was only one pillow each on the bed. There is a note on the fridge stating that you can not put your own food or drink in there and that if you do it will be removed. We frequently bought drinks and some food which we placed in there and this was never removed. The hotel pool was clean and quiet. Plenty of sun loungers. Soft music playing around outside. There are leather beanbags and tables outside. Really beautiful of a night also. Although we travelled there in October and were unsure whether to take swim suits, we found that that weather was glorious. We both got a little burnt from spending a much needed one day out of the five in Rome, lying next to the hotel pool. I really think I could not have coped in July/August time weather walking around so many sites for days. On the website it states there is a roof terrace but upon venturing up there we found nothing at all. No tables or chairs which was a shame as there are nice views. Breakfast in the hotel is 7-10am. I would say breakfast is good. Plenty of fruit juice, water, coffee, tea for drinks. Then to eat there are fruit, range of cereals, lots of sweet breads and croissants (which to me are not for breakfast time but the Italians seem to love it!), cheese, cold meats, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, sausage (hotdog style) and bacon (not like english bacon). Better than I expected really and no charge for fruit juice as some reviews state. Besides breakfast we never ate at the hotel. They do a lunch buffet salad for 8 euros which looked pretty pathetic but of an evening they do pasta specials for 10 euros which seemed quite nice. A large beer (heineken) was 5 euros and they have a selection of cocktails for approximately 7 euros. Hotel shuttle runs quite regularly. Romans drive like lunatics and this mixed with bumpy roads means you are likely to bounce around the bus quite a bit especially if sitting at the back. The hotel reception have timetables they will give you detailing drop off and pick up times. We found this really useful. I would warn you that there are not many seats on the shuttle and so get there promptly. We did see people being turned away as the shuttle was full, although as there seems to be tons of public buses around, I dont think this would be much of a problem if this was to happen. The shuttle will drop you off at Cinnecitta metro station. From here you can get a pass for 1, 3 or 7 days that will allow you to travel on any public transport in Rome (Metro, Tram, Bus). As we were there 5 days we opted for the 7 day pass and this cost 16 euros each. I cant emphasise how great value for money this was. Probably the best bargain of our whole trip. Each time you enter a Metro station you will need to enter the ticket into a machine to gain entry. The Metro consists of 2 lines (A&B) which although guide books will tell you is not very useful, we found to be great. We found most major sites such as the Vatican, Colloseum, Forum, Trevi Fountain to be a few minutes (if that) away from metro stops. The metro gets really busy, especially early morning or late at night. You will have people squashed up against you and often find an arm pit in your face! Just be careful with your handbag. Do like the roman ladies do and wear your bag across your chest! Last Metro is at 11.30pm from the Termini and this will get you back to Cinnecitta station in plenty of time for the last hotel shuttle pick up at 12.15. I would say that the Capannelle is a great base camp which is great value for money. The hotel is pleasant, bright and clean. Staff are friendly and helpful. Obviously you could stay closer to the City Centre and attractions but this would be at least double the cost and besides this, City Centre hotels would not of had the facilities such as the lovely outdoor pool which if you are there for a few days, is nice to just relax by after a hard days walking. If you dont mind the idea of 10 mins hotel shuttle travel and then travelling on the Metro for approximately 25 mins to Termini each time you want to get into or out of the City of Rome, then I would say that this is a great hotel.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "kingston, london", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing!!\u201d", "Author": "steph2shoes", "ReviewID": "UR81152098", "Content": "Having read reviews on TA we decided to stay at the hotel for our 3 night break in \"Rome\".... we were disappointed!!

To anyone considering staying at the Capannelle, please be aware it is located quite some distance from the centre of Rome. Unlike some TA reviewers, we found the commute into Rome and back to the hotel more hassle and more stressful than we imagined it would be. For instance, standing on a jam packed train for up to 45 minutes is not pleasant and can be very tiring. Particularly after a long day sight-seeing in Rome. The shuttle bus service operated by hotel, which takes you to a couple of local metro stations was usually very punctual. However, for some reason there's a big gap in the afternoon service of 3 hours when the bus isn't available, either from hotel or as pick-up from metro. Also there's only one early evening bus, at 18:15, with the next leaving at 20:15. Apart from that, overall the hotel was fine. However, we did have some niggles with the plumbing and air-conditioning. The water pressure from the shower was pretty poor, particularly first thing in morning when everyone else in the hotel seemed to be taking a shower at the same time. Then the water barely trickled out of the shower head. Also we just could not get the aircon to work properly, we either froze or baked during the night, which made for a pretty uncomfortable nights sleep!!

It was booked via Expedia, and with a bus transfer to and from the airport it cost around \u00a3325 for a week, bed and breakfast. We decided early on that our holiday was going to be split around 50-50, exploring Rome and relaxing by the pool. This worked out well, we saw a lot of Rome on our days out. However, after a days walking, in often 35+ degrees heat, you need a day off. As I mentioned in the title, this place is the perfect base to get into Rome. Its so easy, just speak to the hotel staff, they will tell the exact numbers of buses and trains to get. It only took aprox. 30 mins to get into central Rome. The hotel itself. Hopefully you won't be spending too much time here because Rome is out there, and there is a lot to see. But what time is spent here is very peaceful and tranquil, especially if you can fluke a sun bed by the pool. Yes the pool is small, but lets be honest, your wasting your time and money if you come here to lie by a pool all day. The hotel breakfast is good, just what you need for a hot day ahead of you. As for lunch and evening meals, I can't tell you. It looked expensive, always is. For food, lunch in particular, there is a supermarket just down the road called 'Todis'. Get a roll, some ham, tomato, parmesan, and save 10 euros a day. Which, as my partner and I were only 19 at the time suited us down to the ground on our budget. For dinner, I would recommend 'Lou's Place'. This tiny restaurant, situated on the main road, heading left from the exit of the hotel, is by far the best. You will pass a number of fancy restaurants on the main road, expensive, and poor. This family run, authentic Italian is what you need. It may not look the prettiest but it is by far the cheapest and most delicious. In Rome though, one place I can recommend to eat is called 'Antica Birreria Peroni'. Families, teenagers, couples, handsome business men. Everyone came to this place to enjoy a traditional, cosmopolitan Italian supper. Know one speaks English, everyone has a great time and a real laugh. Probably the best restaurant experience I have EVER had. Bottom line is, this hotel is affordable, classy, spacious and has the largest most comfortable bed which is essential after a straining day in the sun. Don't pay truck loads for anything else.

Do not be worried about spending time travelling. even in rush hour its 15 mins on the hotel shuttle (one leaves at the convineient time of 945am to Arco di travertino) and then around 12 mins to termini on metro line A. If you can tolerate this minor travel then you will be rewarded with a huge hotel, huge bedrooms (twice the size of ibis rooms). The breakfast was above average serving scrambled eggs, potatoes home made cakes, pastries, bread and cereal. breakfast is served till 10am which is excellent if you arrive late at the hotel, the last shuttle was just after midnight. The hotel is huge and the resturant served wonderful food, around 10-15\u20ac for a main and around 8\u20ac for a sweet. The prices are similar to those restuarants in centro storico etc so i wouldnt say the restaurant was overpriced in comparison to its competition. The bus 654 leaves from around the corner from the hotel and makes around 5 departures per day. We used this bus to travel from cincecitta metro to the hotel. The hotel is located in a quiet suberb with a supermarket and a cuban restaurant around 2 minutes walk. I was angered by some of the comments regarding the location of the hotel. It makes me question do people research a hotel before booking it?? granted the hotel does not have central location but it does not claim to. it was nice to come to a peacefull location after a busy day and 30 minutes to get to central rome is well worth it. if this hotel was in central rome it would cost at least \u00a3300 per night and was easily the nicest place i have stayed in.

Never been to Rome before but booked by wifey as we've always wanted to go. Hotel was great, very clean. We upgraded on the room so don't know what standard room was like, but there was marble and wood everywhere. Things I would've liked was tea/coffee facilities in room, which they don't do, a shower with more power and only the bathroom had the mirror. There's also no iron/board provided to guests so you'd have to pay for clothes to be ironed if needed. I read on another review that you have to pay for TV - you do but there are 3 news channels to watch for free. But you'll spend all day out so we didn't care. It's like a 4-5* when you get in, but just misses a few things. Staff were very good, friendly and helpful. We checked in at 12 instead of quoted 2pm time without any probs. Breakfast comprised of bacon, sausages and scrambled eggs only for cooked. Didn't go near the bacon or sausages, eggs were okish. Also cereals, breads, cakes, yogurts, fruits as well as coffees and juices. Wasn't great but I'm quite fussy on food so others may think it's very good. Not complaining though because we filled ourselves up for the morning! Domina has a free shuttle bus which goes to 2 different Metro stations (tube). Timetables are available from front desk and over the 5 days there, didn't have one which was late. Saturday & Sunday times are limited but still run from morning till early hrs. For those who haven't been to Rome before & book this hotel: If you land at Fiumiccino Airport, you'll see loads of taxis trying to get business, however you'll get charged loads for the trip because Domina is just outside the city. My advice is call the hotel and get pick up times from Travertino Metro and Cinecitta Metro, these are the 2 they drive to. Airport is linked to national rail, get ticket going to Termini Station (14 euros). At Termini (a line also on Metro) go to automated machine and press bottom left button on screen for English. Select timed travel up to 75 mins, put in a Euro for each person and get ticket. Get on your train to selected Metro station and then walk up to street like we do on UK Tubes. Then look out for silver small bus with Domina written all over it which will park near to exits. Jump on bus and it'll take you to hotel! We never got a day travel pass (4 euros each) because the Metro is only 1 Euro which lasts for 75 mins from time of purchase. Once in Rome you can actually walk to most attractions, unless you don't like walking. A little tip; When visiting Colosseum or Vatican, you will be hounded by tour operators trying to get your money. We did Colosseum because it wasn't too much of a difference and you get a decent tour of Palatines included which is opposite. The operators at Vatican start on you as soon as you get off Metro. They lie!! We had already decided not to get a tour, but were told by one set that normal ticket price into Museum is eu20 and they charge eu45 for tour, plus you get in and a tour of St Peter's included. They take you to the front of the queue which is a 2 hr wait. I heard the next person tell a family of four it would cost them eu35 each to get in and a 2 hr wait for the queue, so why not spend an extra eu10. The normal ticket price is Eu15 each. You can walk into St Peter's for free anyway. The tour may be helpful to some, but you can learn everything from the 'net. Is it worth an extra Eu30 each?! And the 2 hr wait they talk about, I timed it at 41 mins to entering through the front doors. There are so many restaurants everywhere, you'll get good deals so don't just walk into first one which says so. You don't need to keep buying bottled water, keep an empty one with you. There are fountains all over the place on the streets putting out water all the time. This is natural spring water! Hope this helps, you'll love it! The hotel is great and is only 10 mins on the shuttle bus, so book it!", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cDo not read the bad reviews\u201d", "Author": "redlac73", "ReviewID": "UR66662048", "Content": "If you do your research before you go you can not fault this hotel For the people who said it is to far out of the City centre..........pay extra and stay in the city For people who complained about the staff....................People will speak to you the way you speak them.

I stayed there with my brother back in April and as we arrived at 9.30 pm, we were relying on the shuttle bus being there to take us from Ciampino to the hotel. We waited until 11pm (it was due at 10pm) before calling the hotel as the bus was a no-show. The hotel staff refused to help - all they said they'd do is give us a phone number for a taxi company - when we tried them, they kept hanging up on us or sticking us on hold! The taxi cost us about 40 euros, and it was only a 5 min taxi ride! The second day - the bus that was supposed to pick us up from Cinecitta on the way back from Rome never showed up either, so we tried to walk back - big mistake, as we got completely lost. Wandering round some ghetto, we eventually found a deserted restaurant and the kind waiter managed to call us a taxi (it was a conversation of gestures, really). The taxi arrived and already had 8 euros on the meter before we even started the drive! Turns out we were 5 mins away but again, that was another 20 euros or so down the drain due to the shuttle bus being unpredictable. My biggest gripe about the shuttle bus is that you never know where you're supposed to be to get picked up - the airport staff said \"terminal 3\" but it never showed up there - we suspect it was up by the taxis, but we have no way of knowing. At Cinecitta, if you are taking the shuttle bus, wait outside the main entrance to the large pink building - do NOT cross the road (even though logically this is the route the bus should take!). Anyway, back at the hotel and we decided that enough was enough, we would buy 24 hours of internet access and check reviews of other hotels, with the idea of moving somewhere more central. The internet service (the one through the television) was just awful. The keyboard makes this maddening click every time you use the trackpad to move the mouse, very few websites actually worked (our idea of watching some twilight zone episodes on youtube was scuppered), facebook was messed up, hotmail wouldn't load etc. It took a bit of arguing but reception eventually took this off the final bill. They still charged us an extra day as we were leaving early... We ate in the restaurant one night. I think I had the same pasta as mentioned elsewhere on these reviews - very plain, it was simply chopped tomatoes, an onion and some pasta. Must have cost about 80p to make, but they charged about 8 euros Eventually we ended up moving to Hotel Windrose - the room was smaller, but in all honesty it was the best decision we made - much closer to rome and no more worry about commuting between Domina and Rome. The only reason I'd stay at Domina is if there was a conference or something at that hotel - otherwise, stay away!", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cTerrible for American travelers!!\u201d", "Author": "RevfromCA", "ReviewID": "UR64151785", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel twice, first with my wife on 4/14-17/2010 and then again by myself on 4/28-5/1/2010.

I go tthe definite impression this hotel caters more to Italian business travelers. Even though we got all our nights here for free using credit card points, we would never stay here again.

The hotel told us to catch the 664 bus which was a 10 minute ride to the nearest metro station,at the metro a ticket costing 4 euros got you an all day pass on the buses and the metro unlimited amount of journeys,The metro was really simple to use an idiot could do it,the furthest we travelled on the metro was to the vatican which took no more than 20 mins,we found more sights and shops from getting off at a stop called republicca and walking this is when you need the map from the hotel,we carried it every day each street was on it. Side street restaurants where much cheaper than ones beside the the tourist sights.lots of clothes shops to visit, Beware of the ques if you want to go inside the vatigan and the colisiam they are huge overall we really enjoyed our stay,the hotel isnt within walking distance from the centre of rome but rome is so busy it is great to sit in a quiet hotel.

We should have been tipped off when we had great difficulty communicating with the hotel when we tried calling one evening to confirm our reservations. (Tip: don't email them - they won't respond. Ever.) We were told we could arrange a hotel shuttle to pick us up from Fiumicino for 15 euro, so we did that. Upon arrival at the airport, there was no shuttle to be found. After wandering the airport and going desk to desk, we found a woman who seemed to know what she was talking about. She told us to wait at a certain area of the airport, and an hour later, nobody had shown. By luck we happened to run into the driver and the same woman told us to go with him. Now, don't set up this hotel shuttle. It took 2 hours to get to the hotel because get this - it took other people to other hotels too! It wasn't a private shuttle. And then, come to find out, it wasn't 15 euro, they mysteriously upped the rate to 18 once we arrived. The concierge staff wasn't exactly polite or welcoming by any means. I felt very put off by them, especially the men. Maybe it's because we're young American women. They didn't really care to answer our questions politely or in a timely manner. They did, however, feel it necessary to point out their restaurant downstairs many, many times, and not mention the local bus (more reliable than the shuttle at times) unless I specifically asked about it. I only knew about it from other reviews! They acted as though their hotel shuttle was the only means of transportation to the city. And then when I asked for information about the buses, they told me the wrong route back - DO NOT take the 664 back, unless you want to wander around residential, graffiti-covered Rome, lost, at night, with no map that even has this area of town and no telephone like I did. The room was fine, although we did request two twin sized beds and they kept shoving them together to make one big bed, even though every night we would separate them to make the point that no, we are NOT together, but every day we'd come back to them shoved back together. The shower is tiny - sprayed water all over the floor as there is only about a 15-inch glass divider, and had the faucet stabbing me in the thigh the entire time. I'm five feet tall and the showerhead was just above my head, I don't know how anyone any bigger or taller than me would be able to shower. My major gripes with the room are this: when you get to the room, your TV is basically the big flatscreen computer monitor. It has a cord that can be hooked into your laptop, but come to find out it's 10 euro for 1 hour of internet, 12 euro for 24 hours, and tv plus internet is some exorbitant amount that I don't remember. However, get this - if you go request wi-fi, it's only 5 euro for 3 hours if you use it wirelessly! Why in the world would someone pay 10 euro for 1 hour and a cord if they can get 3 hours without?! Silly. They don't tell you about the wi-fi unless you ask. My other major qualm - the maid. She rifled through our belongings almost every other day - we found our things in our suitcases rearranged, our stuff in the bathroom (toothbrushes and makeup and things) completely rearranged and almost put away, clothing put away, etc. This really bothered me. Make the bed, give me some clean towels, leave. Do not touch my things. Made me feel really insecure about my belongings. To turn the lights on, you have to have your key card in this little slot by the door. If one of you needs to go downstairs for something, and you take the card out and leave, all the lights shut off on your roommate. Neat. It also controls the AC, so when you come back from a long day in hot, sunny Rome, it's also hot in your room. Penny pinchers much? For what they're charging, you should at least be able to come back to a good climate (and your things where you left them!) Breakfast was alright. The same thing every day - cereal, breads and pastries, coffee, not nearly enough orange juice left out for everyone (and it's room temp and no ice to be found in the entire place, but it doesn't matter since it's either usually empty or there's no glasses around) and the worst - eggs that are basically a drink. I mean, really, Domina, are you that cheap that you can't even cook your eggs thoroughly? That qualifies as egg soup. It's basically a gelatinous mess in a pan. Leaving, we thought maybe we could arrange a similar shuttle back that we took in. We laughed when we heard the price. Remember that 15 euro that turned into 18 euro? Trips back are now 50 euro. Haha. Take the bus/subway/Leonardo Da Vinci Express train from the Termini for 15. It's worth it.

The hotel does run a shuttle to the nearby metro stations, but it runs far too infrequently to be convenient.

There are also no mirrors outside the bathroom. We arranged a shuttle through the hotel to pick us up from FCO for what we thought was 15 euro. They outsource this to another company. The shuttle was full of other people needing to go to other hotels. We drove around for over 2 hours while the shuttle dropped other people off at their respective hotels. We were last since our hotel was so far out. It was a horrible end to a really long day of traveling. When we got the bill it actually cost 18 euro a person.

Make sure you have the espresso and cappucino - even it's from a machine inside the breakfast restaurant but it's good coffee my friend. We had full stomach every morning before hopping on a metro bus which take us to the nearby metro station less than 20 minutes. AND the bus is hardly full! To us we can experience how the local is doing - taking bus and metro - meeting people and that's the idea of traveling aboard. If you are so selective and insist of comparing what you have in your home country then why bother traveling - just stay at home. Having said that -the route 654 bus (bus station is just less than a minute walk from the hotel entrance) will take you to the second last station of the \"A\" line metro and the 663 bus will take you to the 8th station which both will take you to the tourist points in less than 20 minutes.

Around the hotel there is a small-size supermarket called Todis and you can get your bottle water ($0.18 euro for 1.5 liter), drinks (like an OK bottle of wine only $2 Euro) and munchies. A cuban restaurant along the same road lead you to the supermarket and it opens from 8pm to midnight for very good food with good price.

Mother alone with teenage daughter (that in itself was a little daunting!) staying 4 nights on a budget! I found this hotel on a 'special offers site' about 6 months ago and only paid \u00a327 pppn including an upgrade to a superior room/full breakfast as it was a surprise birthday present for my daughter. I do not believe our room was 'superior' or that our breakfast was any different to anyone elses! Room was clean and comfortable and served its purpose. There is absolutely nothing to do at this hotel. NO TV! unless you pay 20 euros for TV/internet for 24 hours. No tea/coffee facilities in room - take your travel kettle. No mirror in bedroom - ladies if your taking straighters/hairdryer then pack an extension lead so you can view yourself in bathroom mirror! The Reception staff/Porters were friendly/helpful,although at times I believe they only understood what they wanted to understand. The Restaurant staff were extremely rude, unhelpful, ignorant and would turn there back on you. As we arrived early eve in the pouring rain, tired and not wanting to venture out in the dark we asked if we could have some sandwiches - the kitchen said \"No!\" I was not prepared to pay the average cost of 20 euros per person for a main meal from a poor menu (8 euros for 2 cokes) - so for the first time in all my years we went to bed hungry. But it was not our plan to spend much time in the hotel so things could only get better .... AND THEY DID! Woke to sunshine, filled our tummies with breakfast (a fair choice but nothing like shown on website!) and ventured out. Get map from hotel lobby - has every street name on it and was a godsend (even though we had brought our own - it was this one we used all the time) Firstly we took the hotel mini-bus, this drops you at a Metro and away you go! These hotel buses are free and drop-off/pick-up at various Metros at various times of day. They only hold 25 persons, so the sooner you find your own way using local buses, the better as 50 people queueing for same bus does not work, especially in the evening when tired and just want to get back! At the Metro you can buy your ticket(s). We bought a 3 day ticket allowing us unlimited use of tube/buses for 11 euros each. TRANSPORT: We found the local buses from near hotel brilliant; easy, convenient and hassle free and ran every 10 mins to and from Metro stops. Note: if your using these at peak times the traffic is mad and will add a little time to your journey (daughter thought this added to the whole adventure ha!) If you would like more info on this - please contact me. I don't know which buses a previous reviewer used we could be at a metro stop in 15 mins max!! TRIPS: If you have children over 12 then SEGWAY tour is a must - definately a highlight of the holiday and the guides are great. If your planning on going to VATICAN then please purchase a queue jumping ticket - even at 8.45am Alton Towers peak season is nothing compared to this!! Both trips were purchased via www.viator.com FOOD: Wherever you are, go off down a side street where its cheaper. They do not have any problem with 2 people sharing one meal i.e. daughter and I often shared a pizza (as they are huge), which is ideal if you have children with you with smaller appetites as 'kids meals' are unheard off! Our meals averaged 20 -30 euros for two people inc. main meal, soft drink and an ice-cream or crepe. DO NOT EAT AT THE CAFE OUTSIDE COLOSSEUM METRO - RIP OFF. 17 euros for 1 x coke and 1 x French Fries. Unfortunately this was the one and only time I didn't ask for the bill - I didn't make same mistake twice! ALWAYS ask for bill and check it - they really do try it on! But being a single female with no male partner in tow I did feel unable to argue back - these people can be quite aggressive! TAXI: Do not take a taxi from outside Airport - extortionate anything from upto 80 euros quoted for a 10 minute journey. You should be paying no more that 20 euros (for 2 people) from Ciampino Airport to Hotel and make sure you have hotel address as no-one has ever heard of this hotel! We did pay 40 euros but I had previously arranged this online - a private car with the man coming into airport and holding up a sign with our name on. Taxi's tend to add 10 euros for each additional person! The hotel can arrange a taxi for you but make sure its a taxi and not a private car, although they do run a FREE shuttle bus but not regularly and unfortunately didn't co-inside with our flights. All in all we had a fab time and would definately go again and to same hotel now that we have learn't from our mistakes; found our way around and just used the hotel for its purpose - somewhere to lay our heads at night! Definately a business hotel NOT a leisure hotel. Just one more thing: I HAVE NEVER MET SUCH RUDE, IGNORANT PEOPLE AS THE ITALIANS.

I did not have much interaction with the hotel staff..so ca not comment on that aspect.Its bit far from the the city, but since we had the tour coach/bus, did not have to worry about the travel.

Allow yourself 1/3 of each day just to get to and from downtown Rome. our group of 8 (from the USA) spent at least 3 hours of each day waiting for buses, the Metro (train), and walking from bus stops where no bus ever showed up, admiring the grafitti art on EVERY building in the area, dodging dog fecis on the sidewalks, then getting to hotel and told that the restaurant was closed (even though the Italian diplomats guests were feasting on pasta and veal), trying to get served in the lobby bar is a joke, couldn't get a cold beer, or ice (dont you dare ask for a bucket of ice!! if so, you will get a saucer filled with 6 cubes), being scolded for taking 2 crackers from the \"snack table\" If you dont arrive in time to eat at the restaurant, be prepared to starve. there are no nearby restaurants for late night dinning, heck, you dont want to walk around the grounds at night anyway. The lobby bar closes early and it is forbidden to raise your voice and have a good time. we were told on numerous occasions the keep our voices down, at one point the bar was packed with 50+ thirsty guests that were willing to pay the $8 USD prices for a beer, but the servers could not care less if they ever sold one drink, we even tipped generously and had the Euros pushed back at us, and bartenders backs turned to us. basically the staff is racist against Americans, nobody smiles, or greets you with any enthusiasm (maybe that is just how Europeans are) shuttle bus drivers dont even try to talk to you, front desk staff was better, but always combative with a \"you can't do this, don't do that\" attitude. be prepared for mis information at every turn, i dont think the staff intentionally lies to you, its just that nobody is on the same page and doesnt know simple things like how to work the in-room safe, what time do the shuttles arrive and depart, how to charge a meal to your room, etc. the luxaries of the USA dont exist in this hotel and for the most part anywhere in Rome (i will say that there were clean and private restrooms everywhere in Rome even in the dumpiest pizzarias and at the sites, i was surprised) TV and showers were a joke. Ever showered without a shower curtain or shower door and flooded the bathroom floor? well, be prepared for that too. dont loose your room key or the lights in the room wont work, so you better have good aim in the middle of the night for a bathroom break. once you finally get into the city, all is good. great history, sites and action. cabs are a rip off, take the train and bus if you must. but the key is to stay in the city and not in the suburbs, traffic and driving tactics are very stressful, you cannot come and go anywhere with ease, be prepared for long days, lots of walking, and most importantly, when you want to come back the Domina after a long day and want sip on your favorite drink and eat an authentic Italian meal at the hotel, it aint happening. this hotel is for the local Italians, not tourists. it was very evident that they do not cater to non-Italians, they dont want our money or tips, there is no sense of urgency at this hotel. its socialism at its best.

First, the hotel is situated about 10 miles out of the central city. The location seems calm, local and residential. A few restaurants (a Cuban, a Pizzeria, and an italian) are nearby. Definitely worth the short walk. There's really no need for renting a car as the Hotel offers a shuttle at 50 cents (euro) to several transportation centers, including the subway. Also, a block away is a bus stop and its very easy to navigate in them buses. A bus pass is only 1 euro (for 75 minutes) and also covers the subway. The staff speaks English and are extremely helpful. They can connect you to any type of tour or service. The rooms are good. They are clean and comfy, yet small. The beds are small and very close to one another but they are comforntable. Each room offers a flat screen tv, but very few channels and the only American channel is CNN, which can be boring after 5 minutes. Also, the internet isn't too good to use, but if you're desperate, try it at 7 euro for 24 hours. The restroom is fine in space, however, the shower has no shower curtain and you depend on a glass than only covers 1/4 of the shower space, so make sure you place lots of towels on the floor because you'll splash lots of water during showers. The biggest flaw at this hotel is the food. We ordered room service once from the hotel restaurant and the food was terrible. However, the hotel offers free breakfast every morning and that at least taste good. Well if you do want to visit Rome and would like to see what people in Rome are all about and save money while you're at it, then stay here. The place is nice and away from the fast-pace central part of Rome. Just understand that it takes at least 20 minutes to get to the inner city from the hotel using the various transportation methods. Take advantage of the city tours offered. They are usually 19-20 euro for 24 hours... pay 5 euro more and get 48 hours. They are hop-on-hop-off, so they are very convenient and they cover areas not reachable by subway. The buses come around every 20-30 minutes, so they give you plenty of time to visit every destination and in Rome there are many, many spots to visit and take a ton of pictures.

I arrived on March 18 and left on Easter Sunday. There was definitely both good and bad about this hotel. First, the good: Communications via email directly with the hotel prior to my arrival were wonderful. They were prompt with answers to all of my questions and were quite polite and accommodating. I asked about transfers from FCO and they arranged for Rocco Lavarone to pick me up and then return me to the airport. I don't recall the price, but I was traveling on a budget, so it must have been reasonable. I have to say that it was wonderful to have Rocco waiting with the Hotel Sign for me as I got off a long and uncomfortable flight, which arrived a little early. He was very personable, spoke English very well, and was full of information on what we were passing, what to do, etc. I HIGHLY recommend Rocco! His business card says \"ryderrome.com\", but I haven't looked at his website. Upon check in, things went smoothly. There was no problem with my early arrival and the room was waiting for me, but they were aware I'd be there well before formal check in time. The hotel NEVER seemed crowded to me during this popular week, but maybe I was coming and going at \"off hours\". The staff, however, was not \"thrilled\" with my arrival nearly as much as I was! There was a definite \"distance\" with them. I decided to celebrate my finally getting to Roma by ordering a drink at the bar off the lobby to take to my room while I settled in. I asked for Rum and \"Coke Light\". I have never seen such inefficiency in my life for such a simple thing. The bartender couldn't figure out how to pour the rum! It wouldn't come out of the bottle, so I suggested taking the pourer off assuming the cap hadn't been removed, which she couldn't manage. I ended up with 8 ounces of Coke Light for 4 Euro. At the time, exchange was a whopping USD $1.60, so this was a very expensive little non-drink! The toilet took some figuring out.. you have to push BOTH buttons on the wall for a flush. Make that a TURBO FLUSH. Water pressure was very good! Otherwise, the room was exactly as shown on the website. Spotlessly immaculate, cleaned every day (my diary indicates one day the room wasn't made up by 2:30PM, however), and spacious by any standards. The furnishings and all amenities were of very contemporary and thoughtful design as well as of high standards and quality. I knew ahead of time about the door to the balcony and asked for a handle, which they gave to me for my entire 6 night stay. I didn't have to call each time I wanted to open the door. Do this at check in and you won't have a problem at all. Balconies are all just one long veranda with just a waist high metal pole diving each room's space. NOT private by any means, but every time I stepped out, I was completely alone... not much balcony action in March. If it were summer, though, I wouldn't be thrilled with the communal balcony. The roof terrace would be wonderful in the summer, but again, I was there in March, took in the vista, and went back to the room. The pool seemed like it would be very nice in the summer as well. I had a ticket to see the Necropolis at the Vatican the day I arrived, which I made in very good time via the shuttle to the Metro. The shuttle ran about hourly in the morning, with only 2 returns in the afternoon before switching to the downtown schedule for the evenings. I was always one of maybe 4 or 5 other guests, so the shuttle was fine. HOWEVER, do NOT be even one minute late for the shuttle either way! The driver is VERY punctual and waits for no one! I missed the time by only 3 minutes and had to sit on the curb at the Metro until the next one one day. They should put some benches around the Metro station! The day I had a ticket to the actual Vatican, I missed it by less than 5 minutes and had to figure out the bus situation on spur of the moment to make my tour. VERY unpleasant. The driver is not an extraordinarily pleasant man, but he got me where I had to go. That first night, I was exhausted having arrived, getting to the Vatican, taking a tour, and then making my way back to the hotel, so I took a look at the room service menu. OUCH! An easily finished steak (I'm a woman, so not the appetite of a linebacker), a small \"garnish\" of rocket salad and some cold breads (no butter) was 25 Euro. At the exchange of $1.60, I vowed this would be the only room service item. The mini bar was ridiculously expensive (I think it was 6 Euro for an airline sized spirit) as well, so I stayed out of that and opted for Vino from the market down the road... Only 1.70 Euro for a nice bottle of Merlot! WATER was more expensive! The complimentary breakfast was adequate, but the same every day... Scrambled Eggs, bacon, sausage, fruits, breads/rolls/pastries, juices, cold cuts and cheeses. Several times, the hot foods were only luke warm/bordering on cold at best. Quantity didn't seem a problem, but I'm an early riser and was always there at the start of service. My internet service didn't work (7 Euro/24 hours) even after having \"The Guy\" take a look at it. They were kind of rude, implying that I was doing something wrong and were \"put out\" by having to come take a look. Turned out \"The Guy\" couldn't make it work, either. After a few days, they suggested I change rooms, so I packed everything up and waited. And waited. Then, \"The Guy\" came back and miraculously, the Internet worked. I think they gave me 24 hours free for the inconvenience. It was VERY unpleasant to not be able to check in at home when I wanted to, but Massimo offered his office computer to do so. Since it wasn't truly urgent, I didn't want to put him out of his office and declined. The movie \"Grease\" was playing on Pay Per View. For TEN Euros! Is that crazy or what? That was over USD $15 for a decades old movie that most have seen a zillion times already! TV was a disappointment. I think only 2 English (news) stations (CNN and Europe MSNBC). Once you watch the news cycle, though, the repetition will drive you mad. I was forced \"in\" on my last day due to rain, and was glad I had The DaVinci Code to finish. Watching the Italian soap operas was funny, though. You don't need to know what they are saying to find amusement in their overly dramatic theatrics. My bill (I prepaid the entire stay for a discount) with my \"extras\" on it was off by 59 Euros. It took quite a conversation with Reception to straighten it out. I was holding my receipt , folded up, and the Receptionist (Ana Maria) practically grabbed it away from me for \"proof\" of the charges. It really made me quite angry that she would just lunge for something in my hand while insinuating I was a liar. She left a very bad taste in my mouth with her attitude. If you can stand the confinement of the Shuttle schedule, this hotel is great for the price. However, a VERY accurate watch and the willingness to take a little time to get to the sites is mandatory if you are counting on the shuttle service. It wasn't horrible, but it was confining and uncomfortable at times if you had to wait at the Metro station for any length of time. The Metro (Line A), by the way, was very clean, dependable, and easy to use. If I can use it after a 10 hour flight on my first day in Roma, anyone can! Line B isn't as nice and new, but efficient nonetheless. I didn't see any sort of crime, petty or otherwise, during my many Metro rides. I NEVER used it alone after dark, however. Summarizing, VERY clean, very modern hotel, with adequate breakfast. Location in the neighborhood isn't convenient if you want to walk to dinner somewhere. I arrived after a 20 minute walk at the Sunflower restaraunt (recommended by front desk) at 7PM and they weren't even open yet. Front desk should have known and revealed such a thing as they watched me head out the door. Plus, it was dark at 7PM in March... kind of a creepy walk alone when it got to be much further than \"5 minutes\" from the hotel. I probably shouldn't have been so bold to walk alone after dark. Front Desk personnel (Ana Maria, specifically) and Shuttle Driver could use some etiquette lessons, charm school or something similar. TIP: There is a \"strip mall\" across the street from the pool. Go there in the morning to get some nice fresh fruit for the room. Also, there is a Pharmacia there for the basics. I liked that I could get an asthma inhaler without a prescription for only 4.50 Euro without having to shelp around trying to find one.

I tried getting there from the De Vinci airport by public transportation (a taxi is 70 Euro), which appeared to be a hard task for a non-Italian speaker... It took me about 3 hours to get there, from which at least one hour of hiking with all my luggage in hand... After the long hiking I arrived at the hotel; they couldn't find my booking for about 10 minutes, but eventually gave me a room. I planned to join guided tours in Rome with a company that works with the hotel (every reasonable hotel offers this kind of service). At the reception desk I got a booklet with the offered guided tours of the company that they work with, and the time table for the hotel's shuttle. But here is the problem - there is no correlation between the shuttle and the time tables of the guided tours, and the tours company picks their clients from their hotels, but not from this hotel as it is too far from the city. Example: the tour to the Vatican leaves from the center of Rome at 07:30, but the first shuttle leaves the hotel after 8am... The hotel\u2019s staff was kind enough to teach me about the public transportation (there is a bus stop right next to the hotel).

Finally we called up the hotel on which the receptionist told us to put the name of the main street as '37, Via Appio Claudino' instead of 'Via Siderno'. The new street name worked and we were able to reach the place where there were boards all over giving directions to Domina Hotel. Mind you that '37, Appio Claudino' is still not the correct address.

The only thing missing from the room was an electric kettle to prepare hot tea water.

We called up the hotel to accommodate us for one more night and they were prompt to take us back and gave us the same room all cleaned and tidied as usual. On the whole it was a pleasant experience.

The Domina Campanelle is very nice and modern, as well as the rooms, bathrooms, breakfast area, almost everything. The first issue, anyway, has to be about the location: it is very far from the city center, and even to the closest metro station (Cinecitt\u00e1), which is around 20 minutes by bus from the hotel. We were aware of that and only decided to book it anyway because the price was attractive and they offer a complimentary shuttle bus to this station. We believed the location issue could be overcome this way. The main problem is that there is only one small minibus, and no hotel policy to deal with the problem when it got filled. Once the guests understood that they don\u00b4t organize a line, each trip became a \u201crun for your life\u201d competition. Really unpleasant experience, and the only one who seemed to be enjoying was the bus driver, with his nazi look, telling the guests that there was no more room for anyone. That was when I finally understood why the hotel is named Conference... because that\u00b4s what they always started each time the bus was filled. Guests, manager, driver, arguing about what to do next as if it wasn\u00b4t obvious that the driver would have to come back to finish his job. It could even be funny if there wasn\u00b4t the cold, the rain, the bad mood of the driver, etc. Another big issue is about it\u00b4s time schedule. There are only two trips from the metro station back to the hotel in the afternoon: one at 14:30 and the other at 18:30. You can imagine how crazy it may get the battle for a seat in the bus. And obviously, the \u201cconference\u201d that started right after. But there are still other issues. For instance: the door from the room to the balcony doesn\u00b4t have a handle. You have to call the reception and ask them to send a guy to open or to close it, which may be annoying when they are busy and it takes like half an hour to open or close a simple door. The air conditioning digital control panel is impressive. Could be better if it worked properly, but we needed to call the reception everyday to ask them to reset the system, as they explained to be necessary. The minibar, the lobby bar, room service and the restaurant are incredibly expensive, but there aren\u00b4t many options in the neighborhood, so be prepared to get ripped off. Talking about rip off, the taxi fare to get you from the airport to the hotel is twice the fare we paid to fly from Barcelona to Rome. Obviously, this is not a hotel\u00b4s fault... but is worth mentioning. After all, the Domina Campanelle could be a magnificent hotel to stay, if they solved these problems which sound minor if compared to the investment they faced to build up that beautiful place.", "Date": "April 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Umbria", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "AliciaV", "ReviewID": "UR13802607", "Content": "A very impressive and beautifully equipped hotel.

My friend told them not to be so ridiculous - there *had* to be wine in a 4* hotel (he was very tired, hungry and fed up) but we were told that all the wine was locked in the kitchens and no one had the keys. There was a mini bar in the rooms, containing exhorbitantly-priced spirits and when our room service arrived, looking very grand on a trolley with white tablecloth etc., there was an even more exhorbitantly-priced bottle of mineral water in a wine cooler.

The cleaner always seemed to be around the lobby cleaning something and obviously taking pride in his work and the hotel. The rooms were modern and as you\u2019d expect from a 4 star hotel with comfortable beds and a clean bathroom. It is a shame you could not open the French doors which would lead out onto a balcony. Hotel service was great as was the bar itself. 15 euros for a bottle of Pino Grigio and all the olives, nuts and crisps that you can muster. Also they did bring out a selection of other snacks free of charge. The bar area was a pleasure to sit in to chill out and the outside area was again immaculate Breakfast was ok, sausage, bacon and scrambled egg, selection of fruit juices, yoghurts, breads, cheeses, ham etc. The hotel is a little out of town but we did not have a problem with that whatsoever. The free shuttle service was excellent, always on time and never full for us. It either takes you to the Metro station (10 mins) or into the City centre (40 mins) in the night time. The Metro then costs either 1 Euro for 75 mins use or 4 Euros for 24 hours use (both unlimited travel). The shuttle does always pick you up from the same place as it drops you off. Do not panic if when waiting at the Metro it drives around the corner \u2013 it will be back, it\u2019s just going round the block! Obviously a must is a visit to the Coliseum. If you take the Via San Giovanni in Laterano from San Giovanni Metro I would recommend Anfiteatro for lunch. It is right near the Coliseum so you can see it and it was very friendly, inexpensive, clean and tidy which some of the restaurants most certainly weren\u2019t! There are a couple of restaurants near the hotel itself. Girasole wasn\u2019t very good. My pizza arrived literally 5 minutes after I ordered it (too quick!) and then my wifes food arrived 5 minutes after that (too slow!).

It is just past the supermarket. Give it a try \u2013 I wish we had! Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Highly recommended for those who prefer a more modern hotel environment.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent UK", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, not so good location\u201d", "Author": "Neil&Sue", "ReviewID": "UR8473499", "Content": "We are an early 50s couple who stayed for a long weekend (first trip to Rome) which generally we thoroughly enjoyed. The Domina Roma is a good modern hotel with large comfortable rooms. The internal public spaces are bright, modern, perhaps a little clinical, but fine. The hotel is new, and the outside pool area still undergoing finessing. Sceening was taking place during our stay (Aug 17-20) which we thought was overdue. Some foliage in the outside space would help. The roof-top area is currently unoccupied wasted space. In reality though Rome, is not a place where many would plan spending much time at the hotel. The dining arrangements were OK, no better than that. Breakfast served its purpose, but wasn't memorable, and the one evening we dined in the restaurant was disappointing. In fairness, we did feel that the food we had throughout our stay in Rome was pretty average (tourist fayre) (apart from Ice-Cream cones which for non sweet eaters were fabulous, huge and cheap 2Euros). Our biggest disappointment was location. The hotel really was in an odd place. It seemed to be in the middle of a pretty desolate housing area with lots of shuttered businesses and residencies. We later discovered this perhaps related to timing, as our stay coincided with the Rome holiday when businesses close and people go on holiday. It did mean that there was absolutely nothing near to the hotel by way of a shop, bar or restaurant. Maybe other times the area is more vibrant. This meant the courtesy shuttle (or taxis) was even more critical. Public transport we found ideal once you got the hang of it. The shuttle made regular trips to the Metro (Traversini), and that took you into the City. A bus (No 664) could take you back to the hotel from the Metro if you arrived at a non shuttle time (your Metro ticket covered that journey too). Be warned, others have referred to the shuttle bus to and from the City in the evening. It only does 2 trips, one returns about 2100hrs which is pretty useless timing, the other at 2315hrs, when our experience was it got over full (no standing allowed). On our first night we were amongst a few left stranded and had to take a taxi for most of the journey as public transport was over for the area of the hotel. People in the same situation said it had happened most nights that week. We got back to the pick-up 25 minutes early the following night and only just got a seat. (The hotel needs to review this problem). Rome itself was stunning, every corner seemed to bring you to a standstill. Very touristy and interesting, expect to queue at the Vatican (a must even for agnostics), St Peters was hugely impressive, climbing the steps to the top was a challenge but worth it, even for the view regardless of the significance of the location. Remember to take sensible walking shoes, we didn't and our feet paid the price. Rome, so much to see, so much recognisable European history. Advice for travellers arriving at Ciampino. Take a taxi to the hotel. The public transport alternative via Anagnina we couldn't fathom on arrival or departure, and took a taxi from there, which cost much the same as to / from the Hotel (14 Euros) which would have been far easier.", "Date": "August 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, but not a great location!\u201d", "Author": "GeorgeyP", "ReviewID": "UR8110534", "Content": "Everything is brand new, hi-tech and very swish, as you\u2019d expect from a four star hotel! The revolving doors even know you\u2019re when you\u2019re approaching. Which is nice. The only problem is that its so far away from the city centre. Which I guess isn\u2019t a problem if you\u2019re arriving by taxi or limo (as any self-respecting four star hotel client should!), but if you\u2019re relying on public transport to get there, it\u2019s a big problem. There is a regular bus service from the nearest underground station, but it takes about 15 minutes. There is a free hotel minibus service to and from the underground station, but that only runs at certain times (a timetable is available at reception). The staff were very helpful though, so nothing was difficult to understand. The late-night pick-up from the city centre by minibus was also a life-saver. Trying to negotiate public transport late at night would have been a nightmare. Just a word of advice on that though \u2013 make sure you know where the bus is going from! I had a mad dash around trying to find it, and only just made it with two minutes to spare. The driver was prompt in departing (and rightly so). But if transport isn\u2019t a issue, I can thoroughly recommend the hotel in itself. The breakfast was very good too, with a large buffet of lovely stuff.

The hotel is in a quiet location although there are local restaurants/pizzerias and supermarkets if you just ask at reception they are very willing to help and give directions! There is nothing in the way of evening entertainment so I suggest you take a pack of cards and monopoly! However, take a bottle of wine up onto the roof garden (no seats up there but floor is nice) at sunset and look out over to Rome (this means you turn right out of the lifts and go through the doors) from there you can make out st peters and the vatican which's lit up once dark falls-a gorgeous view! Just a warning when you get to the airport if you want a taxi make sure it's a local taxi with the taxi sign on the roof (they are white) there are private taxis but they will overcharge to 200% and they will lie and tell you there are no other taxis available - from airport leonardo di vinci (Fliminco) it should cost you 25-30 euros.
