The receptionists and waitress were exceptional. Very welcoming and friendly (especially compared to most london...)

A short ride on the underground to get to Westfields, West End shops, theatres and attractions. Abbey Lodge has undergone redecoration and refurbishment since our previous visit.

Loving the addition of the small flatscreen freeview TVs ! It's basically an old victorian house converted so it has the foibles /quirks that go with it - the rooms seem to vary in size, so I've had the big rooms and the small ones but have to say, they are always clean and the beds are comfortable. The staff there are so friendly and helpful - happy to offer assistance with everythng from cabs to decent places to eat. A nice touch is the microwave in the breakfast room which meant I could bring my own meal in at night and heat it up - so the cost of eating out all the time was kept under control. I also found the free wi-fi useful too - unlike many of the bigger chains, there was no charge and it was reasonably stable. On the odd occasion it didn't connect, I just asked and they reset the router. It was also nice to see on this occasion the additions to the breakfast menu of yogurt and fresh fruit. I paid \u00a346 for my room including breakfast and adding in the free wi-fi, I just feel that this is really good value for London. I was there just after the riots but I never felt unsafe at all and the locals seemed to have rallied round to get the shops/cafes affected up and running as quickly as possible and get back to normal. It's a nice part of London - like a small town - with the added benefit of being only 30 minutes from the centre, with some lovely parks in the area.

We arrived around 2.30pm. When we rang the bell, a young lady came to the door and just looked at us (we announced ourselves) - no great welcome. We walked in and the carpet looked sticky and dirty. We were asked to pay upfront as we were only staying one night, but it was impossible to do a runner due to the amount of creaky floors. Toffees on the desk, a nice touch, but I was frightened to take one. The breakfast area was set for the next day and were covered in cloths - strange. We walked up 2 flights of well trodden stairs to our room. The skirting boards were dirty, there were cobwebs hanging off the ceiling and there was an area of water damage on the ceiling (worrying bluge), the top part of the net curtain was grimy black. The curtains were falling off the curtain rail, but just about kept the light out. The sheets smelt clean and the bathroom was clean enough, but I was worried I might get bites around my ankles. There is plenty of tea and coffee for use in the room. There is only anti bacterial handwash and showercaps in the bathroom. The worst thing, \"breakfast \"7am to 9am Mon - Fri\" (pointed out with an apologetic smile). We arrived at a few minutes to 9am, the clock showed that it had gone past 9am. When we did not agree, we were told that we had to EAT by 9am (which I have never before encountered in my life) and \"the problem is that all the food goes\". Luckily for us, a few fellow guests backed us up and we had words with the young lady in charge, who was not very pleasant and served us breakfast. The girl who tried to send us away was clearing up and we had to ask for milk and butter. We were given rock hard reheated bacon and almost black sausage, the tomato was lovely and squishy, fresh fried egg and squidgy white toast. I have just looked at the photos advertised by the hotel, but they must have been taken around 20 to 30 years ago in a very good light and angle. I don't mind budget, but I expect clean and courteous. \u00c2\u00a358 for a twin room is not that cheap.

The lady serving breakfast next morning redeemed the whole experience, she was so lovely and friendly.

There were hairs in the bed and creases which only bodies make - I don't want to go into it. I went and found a girl who was doing laundry and she gave me another room, which was similar to my first nights experience.

Parking is a premium, and there is really only two spaces for the whole place. Otherwise you may be parked in by residents who can park in front. Check in was ok if not a little but short. Then we went to the \"recently refurbished\" room, which was room 1. At the back of the hotel, so nice and quiet, overlooking the small garden which was pleasant. But its just not clean. The toilet has mess on the bowl from the previous tenant, and close look behind the seats revealed a disgusting yellow mess. The bathroom was floored with disgusting black temporary lino, the sink has cracks in it, and the shower has not been cleaned but rather has been grouted over the moudly mess they cannot be bothered to scrub off properly. The wallpaper was coming off in parts, and there was visible damp with some mould underneath the TV that doesnt really receive much in the way of TV (it has rabbit ears, no roof antenna here). The carpet was dirty, and there was dust on almost every surface. Just run your finger along it, staff, its not hard. No matress protectors either... disgusting. These are the easiest way to prevent contamination. Wifi worked fine, which was great for finding somewhere else for the next week. The breakfast staff were great, and the food was quickly prepared and nice. I couldnt help but laugh at their constant references to Fawlty Towers though! So if cleanliness is something you expect from a lodging, this is not the place for you.

The carpet was filthy--hadn't been vacuumed or hoovered in months. The floor of the ensuite bathroom was filthy black plastic industrial matting, nailed over rotting floorboards. The shower was mildewed, then someone had smeared caulking over the mildew with all the skill of a 3 year old in finger painting class--and then had mended the door track with duct tape. Repairs are being done by amateurs, not by skilled trades people. The toilet was cracked, the sink was dirty and so tiny it was hard to get both hands in it. The bed sheets looked clean, but had holes in them, but the pillow cases were not clean--someone's black hair was all over them (and neither of us had black hair!). And...the wardrobe was bashed in on one side. The television had rabbit ears and the wi-fi didn't work beyond the ground floor. The room was so tiny I couldn' believe it.

My room was clean (not sparkling, but ok) but a bit on the small side. However, it was ok for my needs. The hotel generally looked a little worn but not shabby. I suppose they must have spruced it up. The furniture in the room was a bit cheap and could do with some more updating, but this is a very minor point. Also, there was heating and it was very efficient. In fact I had to get them to turn it off, it was so hot. So that looks like its another problem fixed. I was very pleased with the service. The staff were very helpful and polite and even managed to get me a downstairs room when initially none were available. This was handy for me because my leg was in a cast at the time. Breakfast was quite good and when there was a small problem with an undercooked sausage they replaced it right away with no arguments. I'm sure there are problem in the best of places so the acid test as far as I am concerned is how the staff deal with any issues. I was very pleased. The internet access was a breeze to set up, worked straight away and was very fast. And it's free.
