The lobby also needs a spruce up. However, the staff were also polite and attentive. We called down for pillow and they arrived straight away - as did the missing kettle from our room. Anyway, our attitude was that we spend very little time in the room, so as long as it's clean, it's okay.

I agree with the other reviewers that the view from our room as well as from the restaurant were very nice. Views aside however, the hotel is old. Our room was outdated and in serious need of renovation. The AC switch was probably from the '70s. The walls in the shower had cracks and were sealed with some grey paste. All our pillow cases and towels had hair on them - disgusting. But the most annoying thing was the smell - the entire floor (including our room) smelled of cheap air freshner. It was so bad that, although we slept with the window open, we woke up with liver pains. The breakfast was expensive and equally disgusting.

It's well located in downtown Vancouver, the rooms are decent enough - though could probably do with an update - and the rates are very reasonable. It is a tall, thin building, so most rooms have a good view. There's also a revolving restaurant/bar at the top with stunning views over Vancouver & the surrounds - not sure it's part of the hotel but is worth a visit none the less. No issues with check in. We did have a problem with some pipe noise in the room on our final night. The night porter mentioned that he can hear the noise on the 14th floor every night when doing his rounds & there is no way to stop it. Reception dealt with it fairly well and we were promptly moved room in the middle of the night (3.30am!) and told our final night rate would be reduced. This sounded like a good way to deal with it. However on check out, the morning staff had no knowledge of the complaint, or that we'd had to change rooms, hence there was no apology or offer of a discount. Naturally raised the issue at this point, and was made to feel like perhaps we were making it up. The guy did agree a 20% reduction but was unable to do anything more 'without his managers approval', and as she wasn't there we were instead given her email address to pursue it further ourselves. I know its not a top hotel, but really this didn't impress me at all. I cant believe no note was made of this during the night, nor the fact that we checked out of a different room. First two nights this was a 4 out of 5 experience, but for the last night & morning we unfortunately give this overall 2. I haven't bothered to pursue this on email, as frankly if the hotel can't bring themselves to follow these things up with their guests, then I don't fancy my chances of getting anything out of it.

The receptionist offered us secure parking, but the only thing secure was that there was a gate, but it opened to anyone, not very secure. The walls were paper thin, we could hear the tv in room next to us, doors shutting etc. The room was worn and tired and not very well laid out. The desk had a clock and a lamp plugged in with no extra room to plug in the lap top, and the only other available plug was by the sink, which is where we had to plug in our phone. The coffee maker was a joke, it was tiny and took forever to fill. When we returned our key at the end of the stay, we were not asked how our stay was etc, it was like they didn't want to ask a question they didn't want the answer too.

A mezzanine level to the left of reception had a computer for Internet access and other facilities; however, the hotel charges by time for their use. Low lighting and dark walls made corridors a bit on the gloomy side. The large room we had was in good condition, but showed signs of wear (perhaps not surprising given the popularity of the hotel). It came with the usual personal toiletries and also had a kitchen alcove with a sink, microwave oven and bar refrigerator. A sliding door provided access to a narrow balcony which amusingly attracted a seagull expecting to be fed each time we went outside. The single glazing admitted some noises from outside; however, we faced a residential area so they did not bother us. The disadvantage we experienced was one common to most hotels: noise from the corridor entered the room.

Do not leave any valuables in the car, nothing visible and park on the very bottom level P2. During the summer there is an average of one car break-in per day, this is a city-wide problem and has little to do with the Landmark. Parking underground prevents break-ins--the thieves don't like feeling trapped underground. Parking is $10/night. -- flag down a bell-man immediately to help assist you with check-in, he will be your saviour while staying at the Landmark, be sure to tip him generously!! He will be your 'go-to man' for the entire trip. Don't try and save money by schlepping your own luggage, $5 will save you a weekends worth of headache. --If checking-in during business hours, ask to speak with Jock the front-desk clerk, if he is busy with another client, wait until he is available! He is your life-line while staying at the Landmark. Butter him up and you'll have anything you could wish for. --ask to have a room away from the elevators, preferably a room ending in 01, 02, 09, 10. Rooms 01 & 10 are the largest on each floor. This is important, you will hear the elevator traffic during the night if you don't make this request. Rooms 01-02-03-04-05 have views of Stanley Park and the Ocean. Rooms 06-07-08-09-10 have a city view. --if your room is not yet available, nevertheless, ask for a room to be assigned, receive your keys, tell the bell-man to take your bags to the room when it's available, and then go and explore the city until 4pm, when all rooms become available. --The front-desk might try and have you store your bags and then return to check-in during the afternoon, try and avoid this if at all possible! Don't place your bag in to storage, have the bell-man deliver them to your room. If you return, come back before 2pm. Any later during the summer, and you could face massive lines and total chaos. -- The elevators are notoriously slow and defective, especially between 7-11am & 4-7pm. These are the times when the tour-groups arrive and depart from the hotel. The Landmark is primarily a tour-hotel frequented by German and Japanese tourists. Outside of May-Sept, this isn't a concern. --Your room should smell smoke-free and be up to an acceptable level of cleanliness. If you feel that the room isn't to your satisfaction, ask the bell-man to use your room phone to call the front-desk (hopefully Jock) and to request a \"room change.\" --The bedding is often inadequate to guests. The duvets were changed to what the industry refers to as \"European style\" bedding which is a euphemism for a bed-cover the size of a toilet-paper square. Request to have more pillows, blankets, and another duvet sent to the room by housekeeping. Phone the Hotel Operator by pressing \"0\". She is another life-line in the hotel, make use of the \"0\" as much as you can! --Check to see if the air-conditioning/hear is functioning, if not, change rooms! Don't wait for Maintainance to come and \"take a look\", there is little they can do and the problem is quickly resolved by changing rooms. Some guests have changed rooms 4-5 times, this is perfectly fine. You must be 100% satisfied with your room. --There is a revolving restaurant on the 42nd floor, Cloud 9, open from 5-11/12pm. Go up at 5pm for a cocktail/drink and check out the fine view. Reservations for dining are recommended, you can dial \"0\" to speak with Cloud 9. Breakfast is served on level 42 starting at 6am. The breakfast is over-priced, under-served, often cold, and lacks variety. A better bet, speak with the bellmen about finding great breakfast options along Robson. -- During the night you will receive an 'express check-out\" slip under your door. if you paid by credit-card you can simply put your keys in the envelope and place it in the \"express check-out\" box in the lobby on the wall by the telephone desk. If you have no charges on the account then you don't have to wait in line in the morning! --Never, never, I repeat, never, make a phone-call from your hotel room until you ask what the rates are. It costs CDN$1.00 every time you make a local phone call, whether the call goes though or not! This can add up. If you have any problems with your phone charges, speak with Jock. It's better to use the pay-phones in the hotel lobby, or if phoning over-sea to Germany or Japan, purchase a phone-card from the 7/11 down the street. --If some staff are less than pleasant and polite, don't take it personally. It's not you, it's the hotel atmosphere. These employees are overworked, understaffed, and underpaid for putting up with the unprofessional and uncouth antics of the Front Office Manager. If you give a smile and have patience, you will get the service you're looking for. But, above all, be persistent, be firm, and be clear about what you expect. If all else fails, turn to Jock, the bellmen, or the hotel operator for help. --if planning to stay in Vancouver between October and April, the Landmark has the lowest rates in the city. You can often find a room for $89 sometimes with breakfast! If you live in Vancouver, never walk-in off the street, go to the Tourism Vancouver website or call their number at 1.877.826.1717 for special rates and packages. Even if you are already in the lobby as a walk-in, make the reservation on your cell phone or a pay-phone with Tourism Vancouver and save! :) I hope these tips help your stay at the Landmark go much smoother. Remember the customer is always right. Oh, yes, avoid the ill-placed staircase in the front entrance by using the ramp located to the right hand side of the sliding doors. Otherwise, watch your step!

There are steep steps at the entrance with no clear disabled access. Ground floor businesses appear to have closed down giving a street level appearance of deserted dilapidation. The rooms are relatively clean but the bathroom fittings are dilapidated. We got a non smoking room which had been a smoking room in the past. The toilet seat was pitted with cigarette burns covered over with white paint. The 42 floors taxed the 4 lifts(elevators) and the wait was often a bit protracted. The fitness suite was prehistoric and not air conditioned. It was on a floor undergoing heavy construction. Breakfast for $15 each was a gastronomic nightmare- cold, stale, tasteless food and service so disorganized it was amusing to watch. The rotating dining room could have done with a good scrub- the decor is tired and dirty- and the view would have improved with some window cleaning. You can do better for the price at Holiday Inn Express or Days Inn.

We were bombarded by large groups of people rushing into the elevator without letting us out first. I'm not kidding, very rude.

Overall, we have a neutral opinion of this hotel... The location is great, right in the middle of Robson street's bustling activity. Even though it looks like a modern high-rise tower, the building is probably a bit outdated per today's large hotel standards. The front desk staff was efficient, if not particularly friendly. The parking missed a ramp and decent entrance for people with luggage to get to the lobby and elevators. Our room was a bit small, but clean. What we found missing was a small fridge and microwave, which you normally find in hotels of this class. The bathroom was OK, but it is true that we could hear the plumbing noise from the other rooms (just hope your neighbour does not take a shower at 5:00 AM) Also, there were only a couple of ice and vending machines on the 22nd floor (servicing 45 floors); this is probably not enough for the number of rooms.

Then, the thermostat was not working right. When we turned on the heat, it would get so hot, it felt like Jamaica. When we turned it off, it felt like Alaska... so we always had to play with the thermostat throughout our stay. Then we asked for extra pillows... emphasized on the \"s\", plural... they gave us one. There was 3 of us. Then on our last night in town, the fire alarm went off at 2:17am!!!! We were on the 22nd floor of the hotel! After panicking and scrambling for our coats because it was approximately 28 degrees outside, (we went in November of 2004), the announcer came on and said that it was a false alarm. After about 1 sleepless hour, the fire alarm went off again... this went on for about 1.5 hours! We didn't get ANY sleep on our last night!!!
