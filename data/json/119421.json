The room was large by current standards. The long desk was very convenient. The LCD TV was mounted on one side while the other side was perfect for my laptop, with power connections and the free WIFI. The King bed was very comfortable, with a cushy but firm pillow top. The included breakfast buffet was very good. Lots of fresh fruit, scrambled eggs that were not dry from the warming pan and made to order omelets.

The pictures of the 1920's dudes flexing kept us amused when we were exploring every floor. Rooms were excellently decorated and very clean. We had a king bed and it was a very comfortable sleep. Good AC unit which I used, to my wife's displeasure, since they kept the rooms a little warm for my taste but I am from Canada :D We had our breakfasts included and that was a personal favorite. The omelet chef is a genius...best omelets ever. Full buffet with lots of healthy options including yogurt and fresh cut fruit, milk, juice, etc and the bacon, sausage, eggs, french toast staples as well. We never had dinner here so I can not speak to that. Great location since the Metro is just 2 blocks away and you are right in the Jewelery District. Pretty close to Macy's as well.

Once again it started turning on and off when I called the hotel staff and they gladly put me in another room 1/3 the size of my original room. Was the old room inhabited already? The hotel only told me that this place was a 1880 property and anything could be possible. Night 3, some serious rumbling and cutting noises in the walls. Called the front desk and they said someone was taking kickboxing classes and would pack up soon. Bedcovers removed to sleep..noticed it spread out on the used bed as is and the bed not even made up! Shocking!! This place is unacceptable. I must also mention the location. Not suitable for the faint of heart.

I come back because the rates are reasonable and the room, although quite small, is very stylish (if one exempts the old, cracked tile in the bath area). I'm increasingly frustrated with this hotel as it seems to go downhill every time I stay there. First, the public areas of the hotel are usually unkempt and dirty. It looks as if the carpet is only vacuumed once a day or maybe even less. The furniture is usually spread out without any order and the lobby generally looks like it gets the attention of a cheap residential hotel rather than having the attention of a fine hotel. Second, the Front Desk is a pig sty. When one stands there, there are papers, printers, shoes, boxes, magazines and the door to the office is usually open, allowing a view to the chaos behind. It's no wonder the staff is perfunctory if these are the standards that are expected by the management team. Third, the housekeeping is mediocre. In my last three stays, I've complained twice about the poor housekeeping (btw, each time I check in, I find hair in the bathroom. When I call, I've twice been told the tile is cracked and I should look again to make sure it's hair!). This time, I chose not to complain about the gum on the floor my socks kept sticking to, or the hair on the sink and in the tub, rather than deal with the surly response. I also didn't complain about the spinning sink faucets that had to be adjusted just so to stop the water flow. Fourth, the Front Desk staff could not sound less interested in you if they tried. Calls to the Front Desk are answered in a rude tone, the staff seems very eager to get you out from in front of them. They are unprofessional and lack polish. I'm sure they are kind people away from work, but their professional demeanor is sorely lacking. Finally, the rooms are showing dramatic wear. This time, my room had a very damaged desk, peeling wallpaper, scratched up walls, incredibly dusty surfaces. I had to move a table to plug something in and found old food under it where no one had cleaned. I also had two missing light bulbs (and, having learned my lesson, did not complain!). I'm a huge fan of little hotels and this hotel makes me sad. It is beautiful, but so disappointing if one is an experienced traveler. It has all the trappings of a great little boutique, but delivers so poorly that one is unsure if one should return. I just hate to see all the effort of restoring a landmark go to ruin so quickly. Frankly, it's a 3.5 star product with 1.5 star service. I'm really puzzled why one would spend millions on a renovation and not renovate the training level of the staff. I'm undecided if I will stay here again, but, if I do, it will be with great trepidation.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGood deal in downtown LA\u201d", "Author": "Dyova", "ReviewID": "UR116609704", "Content": "This hotel is incredible for fitness-focused travelers: guests have access to an outstanding range of exercise facilities in a very low-key but upscale environment.

The interior was pretty nice, but the room was very moldy and the air was 'heavy', which exacerbated my sinus problem. The breakfast was included, but they didn't allow me to carry out a banana which I was trying to save for an afternoon snack because it was 'against their policy' (as if the customers would know about this). This stinginess continued on with the room service. They didn't have toothpaste in the room so I called the front desk. The guy who answered told me that the toothpaste tube they had was too small and 'only good enough for one brushing' and then asked me whether I still wanted it or not. This made me feel that they didn't even want to give me that small amount of toothpaste. So I went out and bought a $1 tube from the pharmacy nearby. The maid service was another interesting thing. I saw that their carts didn't have many extra towels, which made me think that there weren't a lot of customers on my floor. But then I realized that they were recycling the old towels (the ones that I put on the floor after using). This was subtly done as they were folded and hung again as if new. I have no problem reusing old towels, but the hotel again seemed to have forgotten to inform me of this 'policy'. Had I known, I wouldn't have placed the towels on the floor after using them. And finally, they NEVER refilled the basic room amenities such as shampoo, conditioner and body soap for the entire 4 days I stayed there. By the last night, I had only 1/5 of the shampoo left in the 1.5 oz bottle, but I felt too tired to deal with these people by that point that I just added water to the bottle to make enough bubbles to lather my hair.

We wanted a nearby hotel for our guests and began our search with the Biltmore. The reservation agent I spoke with was rude, sounded bored, and refused to offer us a group rate without an assurance that \"at least a good amount\" of our guests would pay extra for suites-- something that was impossible to foresee and put us in the awkward position of badgering our guests to \"upgrade\" their rooms-- no, thank you. A quick Google search of other hotels in the immediate area led us to the Athletic Club. I have lived a few miles from downtown LA for twenty years. My partner and I are moving away soon, and one of the biggest regrets I have is not having discovered this incredible place sooner. From my very first email with Ms. Teri Onorato, their director of hotel sales, I was charmed. Teri is gracious, funny, detail-oriented and extremely hard-working. She offered us a fantastic and very competitive rate for our guests, she extended the rate through the whole weekend (prompting many members of our party to stay two and even three nights) and she was an asset to our event from start to finish. Before we had even SEEN the hotel I said to my partner, \"I almost don't care what it looks like as long as organizing it is this easy\". And the hotel--!!! The 3 floors of rooms were re-done in the past two or three years, and re-done perfectly. The combination of comfort, glamor, and history is just spot-on. This is not a generic \"luxe hotel\" experience, this is a deeply personal LA institution. Let's be clear: this is a unique place in every way. It's not Le Meridien; it's a vast old gym and clubhouse that's 130-plus years old and has an amazing hotel attached. One of our guests, delighted, said, \"It feels like we're staying in your very eccentric rich uncle's mansion, and he loves us\". That about covers it. This is Wes Anderson territory in the best way...our guests felt they'd been part of an adventure, which is just what we'd hoped for. We swam in the massive indoor pool, we used the excellent gym and sauna facilities, we walked around downtown and pretended we were tourists at the museums, bars and sights. Oh, and the hotel offers the best free breakfast-- eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, at least half a dozen kinds of fresh fruit, multiple granolas, yogurts and pastries-- excellent. At the Fairmont in San Francisco they charge thirty dollars a head for a breakfast that is only slightly bigger than this one.

Immediately upon entering my room, I was disturbed by the blaring of the neighbors tv. I phoned the front desk requesting a non adjoining room. I was assured no one was in the next door room. Yet, immediately after I got off the phone, I could hear the phone ringing next door. Why call if no one is there? I intercepted the worker who went into the room to turn off the tv, and he said my neighbor was 'out' and had left the tv on. I again requested of the front desk I would prefer a non-adjoining room. After a 15 minute wait, the staff member showed me to another room...only this one had a queen bed and btw, was still ADJOINING.

He waved me over and proceded to tell me their rooms were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmostly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 adjoining. I mentioned again that I would like a non-adjoining bed with a KING bed not queen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is what we had paid for... I was firm but polite. HE asked me if I had trouble sleeping or was a light sleeper? Actually, when I choose a hotel, I prefer NOT to hear the goings-on of my fellow hotel guests. I don't think I'm alone in this preference. He left me standing there for another 10 minutes without talking to me or telling me he was trying to accommodate me. After clearing my throat several times to get noticed, I finally managed to get his attention. He begrudgingly said he could put me in another room, but that it would need cleaning. And I would have to wait for another 35 minutes. Fine. I didn't care at this point. Just a clean room, with a king size bed where I can't hear my neighbors phone ring.

I would not pay to stay here again. The lobby and elevators were worn and dirty. The rooms themselves were clean, but in all three rooms I saw, mildew and mold were evident on the ceiling tiles in the bathrooms. I have also never seen a pool in more need of a re-grouting.

I didn't expect much, actually, but WOW this place is a treasure in downtown LA! What was great: The room was clean, didn't smell of disinfectant, was reasonably soundproof for an old building, was decorated nicely in a old-school elegance style. The bed was firm, the bathroom was functional and clean, and the air conditioning worked well. There was a coffee maker, microwave, and refrigerator, along with plenty of drawers, nice furniture, and a decent-sized closet. The lights were decent--not too bright, yet enough. A nice flat-screen TV and an ipod-docking clock radio rounded out the amenities (though we didn't find the time to watch any TV :^) A fruit and cheese plate was delivered in the evening, and housekeeping was nice and responsive. The best part of this place is that it's an athletic club first and a hotel second. This is the original health and fitness club in LA, the only place the elite went back in the day, before a health club was on every corner--and it shows. It's a beautiful facility with everything you could want. My wife and I spent several hours lifting, running, swimming laps in the 25-yard indoor pool, spending relaxing time in the sauna and steam room (men's and women's separate in the locker rooms, but really clean and well maintained). The equipment was top-drawer. The attendants and trainers were friendly and helpful. This is the best fitness center I've been to in a long time--it's nearly a high-end spa. Cons: Really, nothing at all, other than the fact that this is an early-20th century downtown LA building, and probably could suffer significant damage when the Big One hits.... Well worth a try if you need to stay downtown. It's on 7th near Olive, in the jewelery district, so it's reasonably close ($6 taxi) to the Music Center and Ahmanson.

We did not regret it at all. The room is reasonably sized with great modern yet classy decor. It is a dark wallpapered look so very different from your usual run of the mill hotel chain. Great lighting fixtures, albeit overall a bit dim. The room we stayed in (1212) was on the top floor and overlooked LA LIVE which was a litle distracting cos they had rotating search lights all night which shone over nearby Ritz (how those people staying there took it I wouldnt know). During our stay, the rooftop was closed for maintainence sadly. Whilst we did not know much about the history of the club itself (very illustrious indeed) it was clear that it was a proud heritage that the hotel took pride in keeping up. The room amenities were good and very suited for a business type hotel. From observing other guests, it was clear that many business travellers stayed here very regularly. The breakfast spread was adequate and in a very posh dining room with great attentive service. The downside was that the parking arrangement was slightly inconvenient. We arrived with alot of bags (at the end of a 3 week trip around California) so we pulled up into the carpark and there were no lots til 6th or 7th floor (with the entrance to the hotel itself on the 1st floor) so we had to turn around back down. The staff were incredibly friendly and directed us to park to the side of the entrance to the car park and unload (10 min). But what we didnt know was that there were lots of steps down to the front lobby of the hotel itself (the parking garage was to the back) . I would suggest, if you are checking in with your own car and lots of stuff, to pull up at the front and unload first and then park later. Similarly, car parking for guests per night was US$12 so they had to issue a car park slip separately which we had to then exchange and validate with the car park attendant each time we had to leave (so we could leave for free). A slight inconvenience which could have been dealt with better, but small issue. Because we had a car, location itself wasn't that important (we stayed at Hollywood and Venice on earlier days) so we wanted to try downtown. Definetely not touristy like the 2 previous locations but it worked for us as we wanted a quiet last 2 nights of our busy busy trip (mostly for packing). Bottom line, the hotel itself was absolutely great and met all expectations.

Built in 1912, the Club is an actual athletic facility with rooms on the 10th-12th floors. Since it's not a hotel, there are limited hours for the restaurants and athletic facilities, especially on weekends. So if you're counting on using the pool during your stay, then call ahead for the schedule. That being said...the King Deluxe room I had was just like the photo. It's nicely decorated with Restoration Hardware fixtures and fittings and Frette sheets and towels. The only thing I would note is that some may find the decor a bit dark: brown linen wall paper, brown carpets, etc. so you may want one of the other rooms that have a different decor scheme, but don't look as nice on the website (didn't see them personally). The common areas are well-decorated with California impressionist and other original paintings and portraits from the late 1900s through the 1940s (I think). The athletic facilities are stae of the art, and there's a rooftop sundeck, which I didn't personally see, but was used for a wedding one night (my room was so quiet, I heard no noise at all from the wedding). Loads of free channels on the flatscreen. You're given a nice bowl of fruit (nothing rare and exotic, but fresh) at check-in and the breakfast buffet in the morning is very filling: cereal, yogurt, fruit and french toast (weekdays there are omelet and waffle stations). The service in the restaurant is outstanding and very attentive, even though I had a voucher which stated that a tip at breakfast was unnecessary. The only other thing I had at the Club was an excellent tuna melt in the sports bar. The Club is close to publc transport-- a block away from the Santa Monica 10 express and near the 7th Street and Pershing Square Metro stations. It's also close to Bottega Louie, 7 Grand and other trendy nightspots as well as a Big Lots.

It didn't feel like a cookie-cutter hotel chain and the elegant furnishings, wonderful gym facilities and helpful staff really mad my stay enjoyable.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkeley, Ca.", "Title": "\u201cNot quite a hotel\u201d", "Author": "wanderer", "ReviewID": "UR26234774", "Content": "The Los Angeles Athletic Club is an odd duck as a hotel, which might be why there are so few reviews on Tripadvisor. Most of its 12 story Downtown LA building is taken up with seem to (non-athlete) me to be topflight athletic facilities. There's what I'm pretty sure is a full length, multi-lane swimming pool with a kiddie pool next to it. There's a basketball court that might be full length too. There are exercise machines, a sauna, even a billiard room. The hotel rooms only take up the top 3 floors and there didn't seem to be a whole lot of people staying there one Friday night. I thought they might be there more as a convenience for club members and their families than as a full-fledged hotel. The floor by floor dress code (I kid you not) explained on a paper in my room might fit that image. The rooms are extremely dowdy. The place's elegance has a faded a bit too much, at least in the guest rooms. They're so dowdy that the club plans to renovate them this summer into a richer, retro, yes clubby look. They had photosimulations of the rooms posted on the floor where I stayed. It might have been nice if they'd told us this on the website. For now, the rooms are just tired, the chairs, all the furnishings, the bed lines are all faded. There aren't enough light fixtures in the room, though mine got some eastern natural light, amidst the buildings of Downtown Los Angeles (I liked that part). The carpet was really stained all over the place, not something I normally notice. I don't think there was true dirt around and nothing bit me, but it did add up to a depressing feeling. I'd note parenthetically that I tend to discount complaints on Tripadvisor that something is, horrors, old. Some people seem offended that buildings--like, say, the Waldorf-Astoria--were built more than 10 years ago. But the LA Athletic Club is old in the bad sense. After the renovation it could be much better. I didn't feel a lot of warmth from the people working there. Most were OK, but at least one seemed to be mocking me, not a feeling I usually get in a hotel. Maybe by wearing a daypack backpack I was violating the dress code! It really didn't work well when I tried to check in (at normal time, with a reservation) and the front desk clerk called and called housekeeping to find an available room. Positives: Well located within Downtown LA, close to most Downtown locations and plenty of transit including numerous bus lines and Metrorail lines. They included a free, large, if mediocre breakfast in one of the many dining rooms. City views of a historic part of Downtown LA. A roof deck with nothing but some chairs on it, but even better city views. All those athletic facilities, which might be good with a kid.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fla", "Title": "\u201cNice gym equipment.. albeit rather quiet\u201d", "Author": "Son-of-Poochmas", "ReviewID": "UR17595404", "Content": "Stayed 06/08; friendly greeting; large room - clean although the building is a bit old (ie. rug).

A real gem.\u201d", "Author": "CarolSP", "ReviewID": "UR5894056", "Content": "I recently stayed here for three night on business. What a bargain! The pluses: It's conveniently close to the freeway, right in the jewelry district of LA, and very reasonably priced. Staff are fabulous: polite, helpful, and friendly. It's a beautiful old building, and the rooms, while small, are very nice. It's got an older, slightly funky charm. You can see signs of wear-and-tear on it, but I have to say the bed, while firmer than I like, was still reasonably comfortable, and everything was very clean. There are such nice little touches, too, like a basket of fruit and cheese delivered to your room before check-in, chocolate mints every day on your pillows, and you can order free morning coffee service delivered to your room. I've never before seen not just shampoo, conditioner, soaps and creams in the bathrooms, but also a fresh disposable razor, shaving cream, & a toothbrush and some toothpaste, as well. It also has a very good restaurant on site, which offers a free breakfast: no continental silliness here: this is a full breakfast, with eggs, potatoes, toast, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, yogurt (the real stuff, not just yoplait, though they have that as well) etc. On Fridays they have a cook there doing omelettes to order. The restaurant offers dinner and lunch as well, and, by LA standards, is reasonably priced and pretty good quality. You are free to use the athletic facilities, too: an indoor pool, weights, sauna, steam room, etc.) It IS an athletic club, after all. Over all, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, except possibly someone who was mobility impaired: while there are elevators, of course, I think there may be some areas (like the parking garage) which would be at least a hassle to get to for someone on crutches or a wheelchair, or just had trouble with stairs, if in fact it's possible to avoid the stairs from the lobby area to the elevators which go to the garage. Indoor parking is reasonably priced and seemed more than adequate for the size of the hotel.", "Date": "September 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta ga", "Title": "\u201cA sad spot\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4824319", "Content": "I attended a conference at this hotel, and was fore-warned not to book a room.
