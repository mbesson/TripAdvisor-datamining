It is a decent four star hotel but fails on a couple of pretty basic points. The hotel is situated near the main shopping area and you are never far away from a u-bahn (subway) station at any given time letting you explore the city easily and at your leisure. It cost about \u20ac45 to the hotel from the airport by taxi and check in was fast and efficient. Don\u2019t expect a view as the hotel is in the middle of a residential area which isn\u2019t really a problem as the area also hosts a couple of great restaurants within walking distance. The rooms are large with a large comfy bed and the large glass screen that separates the sleeping area from the shower and toilet area may be a nice touch for some while the lack of privacy may be an issue for others. The Hotel is quite dark with low lighting inside and was always warm whether in the bedroom or bar / reception areas. All in all I would have had no problems giving the Sana four stars but for the following issues that may or may not have any bearing on if you wish to stay there or not. First thing was that there was no complimentary bottled water on arrival. The tap water may be okay to drink but there is nothing in the room to clarify on this. In almost every hotel in the world I have travelled to and stayed in free complimentary bottled water is provided. There are two small bottles of water in the mini bar which we used until we found a local shop but at \u20ac3.oo each it feels like a bit of a fleece. You can also take up the option of breakfast at \u20ac12.50 each where bottles of water were provided to breakfast diner\u2019s foc. We took the breakfast option when we stayed but I would only qualify it as average fare and a bit over priced. He second issue I had was with the tv channels available, again some English speaking were advertised but only one was available and that was the Australasia version of CNN?? go figure. So if you want to keep up with current news back in the UK your options within the hotel are limited to say the least. Again not a deal breaker for everyone but as before I get more English language tv stations in almost any other hotel than the options at the Sana. Failing to have any tv to watch after a long day touring around you can always catch up on emails and the web. That is if your prepared to pay \u20ac12.oo a day or \u20ac60.oo for a week of wi-fi at the hotel. No thanks. Like I have said, the Sana is a good hotel but just lets itself down on some basic issues that if rectified I would have no problems giving it 4 stars instead of 3. Berlin is a fantastic place to visit and we\u2019ll be back as we\u2019d love to see the place in the summertime. Just don\u2019t know if we\u2019d stay at the Sana again?", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, with friendly staff on a nice spot.\u201d", "Author": "Erik1969", "ReviewID": "UR125670750", "Content": "Stayed for a 3 nights in this comfortable and very clean hotel.

The hotel was well located only a few blocks from the Kurfurstendamm shopping precinct and also 10 minutes walk in the opposite direction from the gay area of Motzsrasse/Fuggerstrasse, which other than the usual bars, contains a range of small boutique shops and restaurants. I strongly recommend a small restaurant called Sissi, although it would pay to book in advance. The hotel also contained a small pool, gym and sauna which was clean and modern, and a great way to relax after a busy day sightseeing.

Amazing bed with loads of pillows (6!) in different sizes from small to XL ! Found kinda strange that you have to pay for your room at checkin + 100 euros for the things you're gonna spend in the hotel (you get it back in cash if you dont spend it). Internet isnt free and can be quite pricey when you stay 10 days !!! (around 70 euros). We got offered breakfast for 12 euros instead of 17 at checkin but at checkout it was 24 because we had double rooms (but we were one per room!) so we had to discuss that with the manager. The room was looking clean and tidy but under the bed there was a lot of garbage (bottles and chocolate bar wrappings) from the previous person staying there. Had to call reception for them to come, check and collect it. I was working in the room when the room service came and i saw how the guy does the bed and put the pillows on the floor, didnt seem really hygienic to me ! Nice gym / pool but sauna and hammam have weird schedules (they're not hot all the time). Breakfast is nice but pricey is you pay 17 euros for it.

Totally ineffective air conditioning. During our stay, temp in Berlin was c.20c, but room was far too hot without having windows open all night. Corridor outside the room must have been close to 30c.

I don't much care for it, although the positive aspects of the hotel outweigh the strange concept. First game is to work out which of the wooden panels can be opened. There is a wardrobe, shelves and minibar in there when you find them. Next game is to find which of the light switches provide some useful light, eg the hidden strip light behind the bed. Grumbles over the airconditioning now works no problems there. Big modern rooms for a fair price. Quiet suburban locations, some noise but not enough to keep me awake.

There are a couple of flaws to this fairly new hotel, one major drawback is no air conditioning. The hotel is located on the corner of a busy intersection. The only way to ventilate the room. Was in was o open the window, cue noise, raised voices, sirens etc, get up and shut the window then the temperature rises quickly. Not a problem probably for most of the year but a big problem during spring / summer. I don't think the amount of LOw Voltage lighting helps as the heat losses from these lamps are immense, I swear there was a heat haze when you got out of the lift. The swimming pool and sauna were out if action during our stay and we were offered free wifi and a drink from the bar as compensation. I didn't mind that really as we were out and about most of the time. One last small but painful Flaw, beware, the beds are really low with the frame being oversized for the mattress as a result you WILL bang your shins on the sharp edges.

They even gave me an upgrade for the room I had booked. However, above the first floor, the environment becomes very hot because the A/C does not work. Inside the room the temperature is above 25 degrees centigrade and we must open the windows, wich becomes rather unconfortable and noisy. They put a duvet cover on the bed (as everywhere in Germany) but we could hardly sleep with the sheet only, due to the heat in the room. Another remark is on the food in the Restaurant: - Breakfast is good and very pleasant. However, for dinner, they say in the menu that the food is Portuguese and that is a complete deception, because it is misleading: - the food is French type, as a \"Nouveau Cuisine\", and although the names are Portuguese, the way of cooking and the typical aspects of the Portuguese food are very far from being found in there.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cConcept of excellence hotel ....\u201d", "Author": "120jenny", "ReviewID": "UR106513866", "Content": "The mission statement of the hotel \"concept of excellence\". One of the most efficient hotels i have stayed in. Good location just a few yards away from the underground Augsburger Strasse. It was easy to get into the centre of Berlin from the hotel, the transport system in Berlin is so efficient - everything is so simple and easy to do from buying the tickets to getting on the right train - London transport could learn a few lessons. Back to the hotel, the check-in was hassle free, the room was amazing - nice large comfy bed, fab bathroom with a glass wall to the bed room - though this was a bit odd to start with but it was nice as i didnt feel cut off from the bedroom when i was brushing my teeth I could still watch the tv! All double rooms offer the same - we got a good deal from Booking.com - the cost of the room directly from the hotel is some 480 euro per night, this is too expensive for what you get. The breakfast was excellent, choice of food good - there was something for everyone. The waiting staff were warm and friendly and again very efficient.

Everyone at the hotel is smiling and ready to help you with anything. Great bar, great restaurant, wonderful location, and clean and comfortable rooms. Great attention to detail both in facilities and service standards. I was able to stay at a well priced Jr. Suite, and I highly recommend these corner units. They are extremely large and feature a great master bathroom and extra half bath, plus a nice size living room space, although open to the bedroom. My only criticism is that the gym is almost non existent, and features a very small pool and shared sauna and steam room. I wish it was a bit bigger.

Though the locaction and rooms are rather good, still the personal is a disaster. They left a trainee on the reception so that she couldn't manage any issue properly. She charged incidentals from both me and my friend while usually that's done for a room. On check out they said the amount to be sent back onto the card the same day though on the receit it was written 30 days and!!!! that's a week already and still not 170 Euro back! On my request with a call to the reception to bring an iron their trainee promise dto call back. She called back in an hour mostly and said.... that all the irons taken by other guests... Next day when i asked for an rion again at the reception another guy told me that irons are not allowed in! Ok, i'm really ok with hotels' rules but i do want the personnel to be consistent in what they are doing or saying!!! By the way, they denied to provide me with the password for Internet and even when i explained that ready to pay whatever, still the trainee said that's impossible!!! Only in the public area! I showed to her on my iPhone that they have got wi-fi facilities but she obviously didn't undetsant what was that!!!! Still i cannot deny the fact the loaction is really good as well as the interior of the room seemed to be nice. But what i dislike about the hotels is a poor level of towels! I would never be able to understand why thet cannot spend one eurp more for REALLY GOOF towles!!! No slippers, no bathrobes though we were staying in a junior suite.
