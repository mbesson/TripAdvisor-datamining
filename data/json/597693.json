{"Reviews": [{"Content": "under construction This is a great location if you are here for business or a longer stay. It's convenient to a lot of stores, including a big Pueblo grocery store and a video rental place. There are also quite a few inexpensive restaurants next door or right across the street, such as a Church's Chicken and a McDonald's. My room was just renovated. It is small but very nice, with a beautiful granite and tile bathroom.The hotel is almost surrounded by construction right now, and will be until 2009. The pool and cabanas have all been ripped out to make room for a new building which will contain a casino and (I assume) a new pool. It's going to be really nice when they are done, but for now it's not much to look at. It's not noisy, however.The service is pretty minimal right now. There's often no one at the front desk, so it's hard to get extras like a wake-up call, an extra towel, etc. The housekeeping is excellent.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR286635041", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Molly053"}, {"Content": "Not if I can find better... I just walked in and booked a room for four nights. I used to live nearby and since I sold my home I need a place to stay while we finalized the arrangements. If you want some peace and quiet, there is only one area you can stay in the hotel which is away from the pool or the side of the hotel which is practically on top of a 24 Hour McDonalds drive thru. The cars will be driving by and/or shining lights right into your room day and night so forget about opening the window or curtains. The bar is loud and bads play till past midnight so its not where you want to be to relax. Yes the beaches are only a 15-20 minute drive for the closest ones., but you have to ask yourself WHY? for about 10-20 dollars more you can be closer to the beach and have a pool. I dont know how well traveled these other reviewrs are but I can tell you this place is not where I would take a vacation in this area.", "Date": "Jan 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR824048013", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "bantam6"}, {"Content": "Loved it!!!!!
