Upon getting checked in and heading to my room, I was once again pleased to find that the room was actually quite nice. I had reserved a king bed room, and the extra ammenities that came along with the room (which I believe are standard for all rooms) were very nice. The room had a fridge, microwave, computer desk with a lamp and all the other standard things. It seemed as though the room had been remodeled somewhat recently, with nice tiling in the desk/sink area, as well as in the bathroom. One thing I was completely blown away by, was the comfort of the bed! For seeming like such a midscale motel, the bed was extremely comforatable. The only one downside really that I would have to say would be the parking. The parking is somewhat limited and they do not have enough spaces for every room. But I was able to get a spot every night, so it wasn't much of a problem. The location of the motel is really nice as well. Close to the freeway, close to all the Hollywood attractions, etc. I've traveled all over the world and have stayed in all sorts of hotels, and I also work in the hotel industry, so I feel I have a pretty good knowledge of a decent hotel when I see one.
