We had an early check in and our room was not ready yet, they provided us with a twin room to have a rest, wash and change. We were able to view the double bed room before hand and when requested we were given a lake/pool view room. Staff very friendly and the surrounding area has full amenities with a small shopping area which includes a Costa, Mc Donalds (if that is what you fancy) and a chemist and a good supermarket. There are also local cafe's over the other side of the lake where you can have meals/snacks all day. The hotel shuttle bus for The Mall of the Emirates is great but taxis are not expensive (50 Aed) if shuttle bus not available or over subscribed and you can get a taxis from here into town or use the Metro, which is cheap and clean. If you are looking for somewhere quiet, out of town this is the place especially for business or couples, I would not recommend it for families younger children. Only complaint is the Rendezvous bar is very slow service. Lovely Italian restaurant with good food and service in the rotunda next to pool and lake.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value\u201d", "Author": "Blueworld3000", "ReviewID": "UR119947105", "Content": "This place provides excellent spacious accommodation with flexible check - in and out.

Stayed here with a group of around 40 colleagues. Food quality was acceptable and offered a good variety but was a little pricey. Breakfast, which was included in the room rate, met all needs. Location is a bit remote but is ideal for a short drive to Jebel Ali and so avoiding much of the traffic. If you want to visit the sights and shops in Downtown Dubai, you can take a taxi for DH 60 to 70 ($16 to $19) or take a taxi to Ibn Battuta Mall for DH 35 ($10) and then catch the ultra-modern and very efficient Metro. Take care with the bar as it is not a 'no smoking zone'. Alcohol prices are on the high side but big screen TVs offer an opportunity to see live sporting events and games. Staff are very attentive but room cleaning seems to happen later in the day and so you may find it isn't done, when you get back.

I don\u2019t expect to feel that I am in the middle of Chicago, but I do expect the basics. The Marriot Dubai Executive Apartments at the Green Community did not measure up to my expectations of what a Marriot should be. Non-Smoking Rooms It seems to me that the rest of the world lags behind the United States when it comes to smoking. I have stayed at hotels in the States in which there was no smoking allowed anywhere in the hotel. I am a Gold member and I had specifically asked for a NON-Smoking room. When I got into my room the first thing I noticed were ashtrays all over the place. That was fine; maybe they made a mistake, so I asked for a new room. I get to my new room and again, ashtrays all over. I was told that none of the rooms in this hotel are truly Non-Smoking and that most people just go out on the balcony to smoke, which was a ridiculous statement. I could smell the disgusting stale smoke in this room as well, but had no choice but to take it. It is unacceptable not to have designated non-smoking rooms, floors and areas of the hotel; in fact they should be the majority of the hotel. Also, if someone does smoke in a non-smoking room then they should be fined $1000 for the clean up as they would be in the United States. If this were not an American hotel, fine I understand the rest of the world wants to slowly kill themselves, but only 25% of Americans still smoke and are finding it hard to do even in public places. Food The food was the most disgusting I have ever eaten at a Marriot. Granted these are the Executive Apartments and I did do a lot of my own cooking, but I also ordered room service. The food was brought up in Styrofoam cartons as if I just ordered Chinese Food, but the prices were still Marriot prices. No beer or wine available, first time I ever saw that in a Dubai hotel. Pork bacon was on the menu, but they said they no longer served it, another pet peeve that bothers me in the Middle East, don\u2019t force your beliefs on me please. Overall a bad experience, I will stay in Marriott\u2019s that I know in Dubai and Kuwait and implore you NOT to stay on this Marriot Property. It is not the caliber of a Marriot Hotel and has absolutely no regard for their customers well being.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "jalabad", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding secluded Resort minutes from Downtown Dubai\u201d", "Author": "dogman202", "ReviewID": "UR93287134", "Content": "My Fiancee and I spent two nights December 2010 out of a choice to get out of the city and relax. The resort itself is very clean and attention to detail are noticeable throughout, especially for a larger hotel chain like Marriott. The standard room size was very nice with an extra large king bed and fine linens, mattress comfort was on par and very comfortable. The resort has its own small private lake and adds a sense of serenity to an already quiet setting, the layout of the hotel lobby as well and restaurant fit nicely. The staff attention was very nice and I cannot say enough nice things about the extra attention that they gave us. My fiancee celebrated Her birthday and was happy to find an eloquently decorated cheese cake on our table when we arrived back at night. With respect as well the hotel provided that complimentarily. Everything was just so nice, very relaxing and well done. The only slight difficulty was finding the resort location as our GPS was not in the best shape. However after a little driving we had no difficulty. As well a supermarket is next door and affords the traveler the opportunity to shop and save a little extra. Travel time to the majority of Dubai and Bur Dubai is only 10 min. or so allowing you to self drive or take a taxi.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marriott Executive Apartments Dubai Green Community", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d589929-Reviews-Marriott_Executive_Apartments_Dubai_Green_Community-Dubai.html", "Price": "$259 - $310*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">37B St</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Dubai Investment Park</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">63845</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "589929", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/23/e1/23e116ef1f4a793b0c9555aa81c43b231large.jpg"}}
