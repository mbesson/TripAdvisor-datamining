Location is very good - 5 mins from underground station and also close to restaurants in Poblu Neu area. We arrived Sunday noon and walked all the way to the sea - not far at all. The general area looks a little iffy but nothing to cause undue concern- you need to keep your wits about you wherever you are in Barcelona. Yes there's graffiti but I think the area is on the up. One thing- the hotel can be hard to spot at first as the green HIE sign is not obvious and the building looks like ( and probably was) an office block. The bar area is a bit bleak but who needs that when you've been out in he city. All in all good value especially if using your free nights as a loyalty club member.

The next time we go back we will stay there again. It is not in the middle of all of the insanity of tourists which for me is a huge plus. We found the room quite comfortable, the breakfast very generous and tasty and as always good staff -extremely kind helpful and multilingual. The bed was comfortable and the room was well equipped. The shower was good and although the view was so so the sunrise out our window every morning was excellent. Accessible to beach, hop on hop off bus, neighborhood restaurants, bakeries, vegetable stands, butcher shops, grocery store, specialty shops, large mall, unique cozy restaurants, parks and local ambience. Now details of the area. It is in an area near the University and also catering to business and located in a charming neighborhood. Every day was a new experience. We went to one of the restaurants and liked the food and when we went back two days later the waiter welcomed us back and remembered even what we drank. Each day the local residents came out and walked to the local stores for groceries sat on the park benches and visited, walked their dogs, waited at the end of the day to pick up children from school, stopped for a drink at the outdoor cafes and often came back out when the streetlights went on for dinner. The grocery store was the source of our munchies for the duration of our stay - what a fun experience - also found great good tasting cheap wine there and I am picky!!!! Each day we walked several blocks and picked up an on off bus to explore the touristy areas of Barcelona. At the end of the day we walked home and discovered a new restaurant or little neighborhood bar. We were not far from the Bullet and the tram. We did walked to Gaudi but it was a bit of a hikealthough we enjoyed the adventure. We went to the beach each day on our walks - probably about 5-6 blocks and there were extensive parks there also. When we went to Barcelona the first time - I did not really care for Barcelona at all - too many tourists and too much traffic. By the time we left, I was falling in love with the neighborhood in which this hotel is located and still not liking Barcelona so much. The return this past fall changed all of that. Now I like it all!!! I travel independently with my DH and find larger cities far more enjoyable when I can experience the local culture which to me is in essence what a travel is all about. I hope that this might help you. Just a bit of a heads up - do not be put off by the local graffiti nearby - I spent a great deal of time trying to capture the essence of the work. Very sophisticated.

From the airport to the hotel, it was about 20 - 25 minutes / 30 - 35 Euros taxi ride, depending on the traffic. I assume it is possible to get here by public transit; the closest subway station is about 2 block away, Llacuna on the L4 / yellow line, offering great access to the downtown, club district, and the port area. Keep in mind that even cabs that claim to be able to use credit cards may revert back to cash once at destination. On 2 out of 5 taxi rides the card readers did not connect properly. The downtown is 5 or 6 stations away. As I was travelling with colleagues, we used a T10 pass, 9.95 Euros, basically 10 rides that can be shared. There is also a day pass that is 6.95euros if you plan a lot of subway riding. The hotel is clean and seems to be very popular with families, and groups, young groups for the most part. The internet works very well, it was included in the room rate, along with the breakfast. It was not apparent that this hotel is heavily used by business travelers, but it does offer all that is needed if you are on a business trip. Street noise was not an issue at least not in the room I had, however there seems to be quite a bit of noise transfer from other rooms, especially just before bed time and in the morning (lots of families with young children) and because of the younger crowd there was a lot of cell phone talking in the corridors. Breakfast was excellent, offering a wide range of options, for both food and drinks, hot and cold. Overall, the hotel was good value for the 85euros rate we paid. It is a 3 star so do not expect a lot of pampering. The staff delivered far more than the 3 stars, providing great service and lots of help at every interaction. One evening I overheard a conversation between a customer and the reception desk, where the customer was complaining that the food they received in their room service was not as they ordered, and they were very hungry. Word of advice, do not use the room service (not that I am saying their food is bad\u2026), be reasonable and go to one of the many restaurant that are less than 50 meters away. There is also a grocery store 20 meters away from the hotel, and on the opposite side of the roundabout there is a convenience store. At least 6 or 7 more deli type food stores within another 100 meters. Absolutely no need for room service\u2026. I would definitely recommend this hotel for business, families, singles, friends, couples as long as there is an understanding that this is a utilitarian hotel in a fabulous city.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value\u201d", "Author": "Mostynboy", "ReviewID": "UR124104715", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights this week during a business trip.

In this hotel there are only two types of room, but it does help for other hotels in the chain. It is the first time I have stayed here and I booked first 4 nights, a couple of other nights somewhere else, see my other reviews, and another 3 nights in January. The hotel is basic standard with an adequate sized rooms. I choose this hotel as I wanted to be close to the beach for my daily runs, and exploring a new area Poble Nou. I am very happy with my choice as the rates are great , breakfast OK and the Rambla Poble Nou is a nice walking street with some nice cafe's and restaurants. I have been to Barcelona about 40-60 times over the last 30 years and I have lived here twice in the 80's. This area is not very visited by tourists, so the prices are lower here and it gives you a better feel of a local area. I did most of my shopping at Mercadona store 100 meter from the hotel on your left, where I bought my food and drinks everyday. There are lots of bread shops around the area , where you can get your daily bread at a very good price. On the parallel street Maria Aguilo on the left side of Rambla Poble Nou, you will find the local market hall with various options to buy. In the same street I found my Internet store where 1 hour cost 1 Euro and you could buy more hours and the prices was then even lower. For example 4 hours for 3 Euros. This store was in the street Maria Aguilo close to the market and it was also possible to phone and use Skype. The breakfast room get very busy after 9am , so try to get down earlier. Thank God there are no bacon, egg or old sausages, so if like this stuff, choose somewhere else. However, the breakfast is good enough for me, and it seems that most people enjoyed it.

Tips: How you can get to the hotel from the airport. 1. You take a free bus from airport to the train station 2. Then you take the train to the Sants Estacio station 3. From Sants Estacio station you take metro L5(blue line) to Verdaguer station 4. From Verdaguer station you take metro L4(yellow line) to Llacuna 5.

First impressions of the area were that of a residential/business area, which is obviously in the process of being rejuvenated - I likened it to Docklands area in London about 5 - 10 years ago, but it was very quiet at night, as there did not seem to be a lot else around. The hotel was about a 5-7 minute walk from Llacuna metro station, which gave easy access to the whole of Barcelona. Rooms were clean and spacious - we had two interconnecting rooms - beds were not very comfortable at all; mattresses were very hard and although there were a choice of pillow softness, it seemed to be a case of 1 pillow was not enough, but 2 was too many. Breakfast was of a good standard lots of choice - fruit juices and hot drinks from dispenser, cereals, yoghurts, bread, cheese, fruit - eat as much as you like in a canteen style environment; find a seat, eat and then clear up after yourself. If you were travelling on a budget and only want to use this as a base to sleep and to eat breakfast, for the price this would be a perfect hotel to use. We all felt perfectly safe walking back from Metro station in the dark; we passed a couple of restaurants on the way and there was a supermarket right outside Llacuna station. First impressions were that the area has been a bit run down in the past, but within a few years this is likely to change. All in all a good experience was had here and if all Holiday Inn Express are of this standard, I would have no hesitation to stay at another. One tip for transfer to and from airport, buy a T10 ticket, cost is 8, 25 Euros which gave 10 (1 hour 15 minute) trips on the metro - you can share this ticket with all the people in your party and 1 trip included travel from Barcelona - we went from Llacuna all the way to the airport, via Passaig de Gracia (unbelievable but true for 3, 30 Euros). Got our ticket from an attendant rather than a machine so must be accurate - there were 4 of us travelling so this was the most cost effective way. I presume for a single traveller, you could buy a single metro ticket for 1, 40 Euros. Our taxi cost 30 Euros so the fact that the Metro cost us 3.30 Euros for 4 was a bargain. Visited many of the sights - don't bother with Sagrada Familia at night, felt uncomfortable as it was so far out from the main shopping area and it wasn\u2019t even lit up, but great in the day. If you have time, visit Montserrat by train, a fantastic day out; very interesting and beautiful views and also the Mercat de La Boqueria on La Rambla- it is an extraordinary market. All in all we had a fantastic time, Barcelona was a fantastic place to visit - one which I would go back to again in a flash; we stayed in a good hotel, I liked the area as it was quiet, but the location could require the use of the Metro to all the main sights unless you want a considerable walk; about 15 minutes walk from the beach and at least a 30 minute walk to the cable car over the port.

Everyone is very nice but we stayed for a night to see if we would return in the fall but with the cost of getting to and from the airport - close to 50 euros I am now rethinking putting that expense into a hotel that is closer to the sights of Barcelona. We spent 14 euros to get from the cruise port to the hotel and then 60 to the airport. If we had stayed closer to Ramblas then the cost would have dropped significantly. I would not plan on hauling luggage to the metro for that trip either - too complicated unless you are just bringing a backpack. I had no problems with the hotel but I did have problems with the location as a tourist- wish it had been close enough to walk to some sights because although there are no extras and the outside looks kind of scary when you first see it because of all the grafitti on the building- the staff were nice and the room was fine.

Next morning we asked again and Marie provide all. Buy the tour bus pack - \u20ac4 euros! You will get that money back buy using vouchers on the tour bus plus more. If we had it in the first day from that guy we would have saved a bit on first day tours and quick food. But at least we had it for other things we did. Beach is a straight 10-15 min walk - and brilliant. The metro station is around the corner - yellow line, so you can get to city or other places really quick. Buy a T10 metro card about \u20ac8. gives you 10 trips on metro bus etc. Read into it for more details - if you pay London prices for tube this is a bargain in comparison!! There is a decent mall about 2 stops away - if you want to do a bit of quiet shopping- forum diagonal. There is so much to do Barcelona all present on maps and guides. Do the sky cart Thingy which I can't believe is not on the top ten attractions list. You get to see beach front views of Barcelona at height so get clicking with the camera. There is a small supermarket near this holiday for quick things. There aren't many great walking eating places near the hotel - just small cafes with not so great food. There is a fraggi close by - Ice creams there are brilliant. All in all connections wise to city centre and other places this holiday is brilliantly located, rooms are clean and noise levels are low to none. Breakfast gets packed because food is plenty and good. Only other thing I found was we very careful with taxis booked from the hotel. The taxi drivers think you are stupid and take you round the bender to make a few bob of you. I had my iPhone and switched on the gps map Thingy to show my current location whistle in a taxi from the hotel. All the taxis drivers we booked from hotel took as in a bender and charged us more for the trip. La Ramba to hotel is about \u20ac8-10. going to from hotel by taxi will cost you \u20ac15. So be wise!!! Stupid taxi driver that took us to airport charged us almost \u20ac50 where coming to hotel cost us \u20ac30. Driver as proved by my iPhone took us away from the hotel around the block back past the hotel on an adjacent road then started toasted airport which at this point hit \u20ac10 on the clock.

You can easily get to/from the airport using one trip off your T-10 TMB ticket and switching between the train and metro on Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia station (though take care as there are some changes impending as the link to the airport is being expanded). Just take care not to enter the railway platform (ticket turnstiles) at the airport when the train has *just* left, as the next one will be in 30 mins and this may mean a tight fit time-wise. The hotel is about 7 mins from the metro station, which means you have an easy access to anywhere in the town. There is a supermarket and a new promenade (Rambla del Poblenou) one block to the east, plus a number of shops selling both fashion and fruits. The whole district of the city is being refurbished which creates some strange contrasts - remains of old factories and previous street network meet new buildings and squares. An interesting experience. The eastern windows of the hotel overlook a new school with a football field on the roof. It's interesting, but could be a bit noisy (though the windows are okay at dampening the sound). The hotel itself looked a bit crowded, which made breakfasts a bit of a challenge, but hey, you don't come to HI Express to stay in the room, right? If you're looking for a bigger mall, there's Centre Commercial Diagonal Mar about 15 mins (walking) to the north-east. There's also a nice promenade along the coast, though it was still partially under construction in Dec 2009. And that would be it.

We were catching a cruise 2 days after we arrived, and stayed at this hotel. The staff at check in was great, even though we got in very early and our room wasn't quite ready yet. When we did get our room shortly after, it was very clean, well stocked and comfortable....but a bit warm. The location on the hotel is perfect. There is a grocery store a block away that has everything you need, and on the same block, an entire area of great resteraunts, shops and stores. The Metro is just a few blocks away, and we easily found our way to Las Ramblas and the other tourist sites. As far as the staff at the hotel, they were VERY helpful even though the hotel was extremely busy. Jordi was the best!! He gave us so much help finding our way around, and getting us resteraunt recommendations, ect. He always had a great attitude and an enthusiasm for helping us, as we were newbies to the whole European experience. It is a bit of a ride from the airport, but the cab ride only cost us about 20 Euro, and the cab to the cruise terminal was painless and not costly either. Highly recommended hotel....we will definetly be back.", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cClean adequate facilities a little way outside the main centre\u201d", "Author": "martida", "ReviewID": "UR48115022", "Content": "A new hotel offering basic but adequate Holiday Inn Express type facilities.

The hotel itself is a short metro ride away from the city centre itself on the L4 line from which you can alight at the Barceolneta stop for the port and beach or a couple of stops further to Urquinaona for Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas. This is nore more than a 10 minute ride from the local Llancuna metro stop but don't be fooled that this is a city centre hotel as it isn't.

The location was a totally different feel - a quiet neighborhood (with a lot of empty lots) made for surroundings which felt like they were in a somewhat run-down neighborhood. From the hotel, you'd never guess that the beach was only a few blocks away. The metro was nearby though we had to change lines for most of the attractions that we wanted to see. In fact, the hotel was willing to keep our bags after check out but it was so inconvenient to return, we actually took our bags with us. The rooms and bathrooms were both clean and the continental breakfast was good (though it only had cold options). There are also two computers in the lobby where you can check email for free which is good since it cost 10EUR/24 hours for wi-fi in the rooms. All in all, a nice place to stop over if you need a place to stay for a couple of days or have hotel points to spend though I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic holiday away.

There was a sofa bed in each one and when we asked for a cot they said it could only take the sofa bed but not both but were happy to take the sofa bed out and put in a cot if we wanted. They were extremely friendly and we were very fortunate the baby is easily settled anywhere and he slept in sofa bed with his brother. It was very clean and modern and the breakfast was great. Not a massive selection but plenty to give you a good continental breakfast. Its a bit far from Las Ramblas but if you turn left when you come out of the hotel, go accross the road and up that street you come to a supermarket and all along there is a mini ramblas which was lovely. As it turned out it was much better for us as the big main streets were a bit too busy for kids. The food along that street though wasnt very nice mostly chips, pizza and burgers, in fact the only real decent meal we got in Barcelona was Hard Rock Cafe. Saying that we were catering for children too and if it had just been adults we could have found loads of lovely restaurants. If you have children go to the Aquarium its quite expensive but worth it. If you fly by Easyjet, keep your boarding passes it gets you 3 euros off the entrance price. Btw its also near the beach you just turn right onto that main street and go straight.
