These two freebies kept my costs down over my four day stay. The rooms were clean, well-appointed and spacious. Despite, some construction in the area, I didn't hear any noise, only a very occasional door slam. There are more than six restaurants within several blocks (Golden Coral, Chilis, Whataburger, Sonic, McDonalds, to name a few). Also there's a Walmart. The hotel is very new.

Everything looks new. I was checked in to a room that matched my preferences which was appreciated. Unfortunately, most of the time it does no good to list preferences on the reservation since they are not read until I ask the clerk. The excuse: 'we must consider availability' is often used, but obviously they have not been considered. I would suggest some detailed instructions for the TV remote operation. We had difficulty finding local channels. Only problem was directions to hotel on my Tom Tom GPS. I was going west on I30 and after exiting to the stop light, it had me turn left even though I could see the hotel on my right. I thought it was going to say to make a U-turn, but it was simply wrong.

When we called down to the front desk the manager on duty offered to move us to a different room. Not only were we moved very easily but our room was also upgraded to a beautifully appointed king suite for the duration of our stay. Both rooms we saw there had furniture style vanities in the bathrooms. The suite we stayed in had a large desk that also served to divide the room so that there was a sitting area with fold-out sofa on one side and the large bed on the other. The suite also included a full wet-bar, complete with another sink and long counter. There were also quite a few lamps and lighting options for the room.
