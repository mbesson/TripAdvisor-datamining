We were by our travelagency promiced a hotel in the center of Rome, and a 3 star hotel. Kent Hotel was not in the center of rome, its barly in the map of the center of Rome, and you should expect almost 30 minutes by bus, or 15-20 minutes by taxi to get to the \"real\" center of Rome. We did not experience this hotel to be a 3'star hotel. The people who worked at the hotel was really helpful. They did not speak good english, but were able to understand and speak in a such matter that we also understood what they tried to say. They explained how to get to the different parts of the city, and wrote down which bus to take where. The rooms were fine. Clean, relatively big, nicely decorated, and a ok bathroom with hairdryer. The beds were hard as rocks. There was a small TV, with only italian channels. -But who travels to Rome to watch TV anyway? ;) The area was quiet, and there was no noice in the hotell during our stay. The free WIFI did not work in the 3.floor where we had our room. So if you are depending on having free internet-access, you should ask to get a room in the 1. or 2. floor. The breakfast was the worst part of this hotell. Cold coffie, toast, dry crossaints, jam and nutello. We only ate breakfast one morning during our stay, and I reccomand you to order without breakfast. (If you are staying at a B&B in Rome, you have to pay 3 euro/night/person in tax. You must pay directly to the hotel when you are leaving). The breakfast was not worth it. All in all, I reccomand a hotell closer to the center of rome so you don't have to use so much time on transportation.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel in peaceful surroundings\u201d", "Author": "Mette S", "ReviewID": "UR117698964", "Content": "We spend 3 nights i Hotel Kent and was met by a very accommodating staff in the 100 years old building.

I travel alone a lot and the room here made me feel very lonely and nervous. There was A/C, but it didn't seem to cool the room down too much. There was a small tv and free wireless internet - which is always nice! Breakfast is served in a nice little room, which was nicely sunlit in the summer. Again, very basic. But yummy and just enough to get you started. It's across the street from the modern art museum. I didn't visit it, but quite convenient for those with an interest. It's about a 10 minute walk to the metro, which isn't too bad. Romans have a completely different sense of time though.

Our criteria for selecting hotels was budget, cleanliness and accessibity of attractions etc. This didn't disappoint. We arrived by train into termini station and walked to the Hotel which took about 20 mins.(this turned out to be unneccesary as a bus ran direct from station to end of via Reggio Emilia) Checked in with ease. The man on the desk (manager?) was extremely helpful. He knew we had a short stay and immediately produced maps and gave us ideas for our three days' itineraries, pointing out the must see attractions etc etc. The room, and the whole hotel was perfectly clean. The chambermaid also doubled as the breakfast server and she was great! Our room was at the back of the hotel and had no view really, local housing and businesses. We slept comfortably with the window open - no noise. The room itself was rreasonably sized and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was clean & adequate. Breakfast were good. Bread, pastries, jams coffee, juice, cereal. Bus services at the end of the road (on via nomentana) took us right into the thick of the attractions. Even direct to Vatican. Manager helped again in knowing where to buy tickets and what type to get (a little shop on the main road) We ate twice locally - much cheaper than in the centre and lovely food. A short walk to the close by park is a must. Fabulous views over the city. A great place to spend an afternoon out of the bustle and rent a bike for an hour. At the end of our stay we had to check out in the morning, but our flight wasn't until the evening from Ciampino airport. They happily arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport and also kept our bags until we returned from our last days sightseeing and got our taxi. This hotel is out of the way if you wanted to be on the door step of the sights. However a short bus drive away for a peaceful nights sleep and cheaper costs are worth it.

Colloseum is glorious in the morning sun.))", "Date": "March 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Albans", "Title": "\u201cDecent but noisy\u201d", "Author": "KlondikeKate", "ReviewID": "UR6134661", "Content": "Very polite staff, clean rooms although small-ish.
