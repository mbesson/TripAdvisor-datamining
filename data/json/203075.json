Our 18 year-old daughter tagged along as well. Hotel - fairly good Holiday Inn, very acceptably clean, very good food, and very attentive staff except for housekeeping which seemed to miss cleaning the odd mug in the room / not topping up the tea / coffee supplies. Coffee in the bar was less than half the price in central Rome. We secured a shower room (disabled) for the father-in-law but there was no tea / coffee in this and we could not get the heating to work. He did not mind as it was spring time. Although the hotel's location may seem out of the centre, it is good for Fiumicino airport when you just want to get in/out with no traffic hold-ups. Taxis - having researched here first, I was wary of taking a taxi before leaving the airport building. They pounced and offered me a fare of 63 EUR to the HI. Once I saw this 'official' fare I said I was going to take a white taxi instead and picked one up outside the airport building. Our average fare to / from the HI was 43 EUR. From HI to St Peter's Square we ranged from 15.20 EUR on a quiet evening to 31 EUR on a busy morning when we were taken in the opposite direction to pick up an 'alternative' route. It is best to make sure that they will charge by the meter. We had one trip offered and accepted by us at 26 EUR and were driven maniacally overtaking other white taxis in the central taxi lane at traffic lights and jumping other lights. Compared with the 15.20 the next night, it did not seem such good value although some in my party enjoyed the entertainment. Tour - we found the 110 bus excellent at 18 EUR for 48 hours to take us North and East from St Peter's (via della Concliazone) covering the train station (Termini), Colosseum, and Trevi Fountains / Spanish Steps. Just jump off wherever at any of the 10 stops, explore, and jump back on the next one.

We lost that gamble and ended up at Holiday Inn Rome Aurelia. The location was a bit crap if you are wanting to visit the city centre but the hotel itself was ok. Breakfast is expensive so we didn't pay for it. There is a grocery store very close so we bought breakfast foods and ate them in the room (ours had a small fridge). Because the location is crap, the hotel offers a shuttle bus to the city centre but it limits your options for arriving and departing the city. I wouldn't bother with the shuttle because public transport is really easy. You can buy bus tickets at a tabachi next door to the grocery store. Take bus 246 or 247 (don't forget to stamp you ticket on the bus) to the metro stop Cornelia, you will see a McDonald's on the left hand corner when you need to get off. The bus ticket will also work on the metro so use the same ticket and head into town. It is easy, quick and it only costs 1 euro per person instead of the 5 euro that the shuttle costs. The hotel says they have air conditioning but they fail to mention that they can't turn it on until May. We didn't need it in April but it would have been nice to have it. The 24 hour room service is limited after 23:00 because the kitchen closes. We got in really late on the night of our arrival and could only get sandwiches. Not ideal but understandable. Overall, I think this hotel would be fine for business travelers or for those who have a car who are using Rome as a base for exploring outside of the city (wouldn't drive in the city) but I wouldn't recommend it for those wanting to explore the city of Rome.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cConvenient hotel in Rome when you have a rental car\u201d", "Author": "charlie m", "ReviewID": "UR125128575", "Content": "The Holiday Inn Rome Aurelia (or Rome West) is on Via Aurelia (SS1) and just a few minutes from the Intersection with the GRA (Grande Raccordo Anulare - Roman Ring Road around the city) which makes it a great hotel for visitors with a rental car or someone who needs to be near the airport. Although I have been to Rome about 12 times I usually don't drive in the city itself....too much traffic, too many little streets and it is difficult to find your way while being surrounded by impatient drivers. While you are not in the center of Rome the hotel offers a shuttle or you can easily use the local bus line and the Metro to get around. The hotel is just average, nothing special...they offer a decent breakfast. We have been there at least six times. It is a good starting point for day trips to the Colle Albani (Roman hill towns) or to other locations around the city.

Eggs, bacon, sausage, a sort of breads, juices and omelets or eggs prepared on the go. The neighborhood is very friendly, there is a McDonald's just next door! The hotel is located at in sort of a small trip mall that contains a mini market (carrefour express), a gas station, a kind of corner bakery and the before mentioned McDonald's. The avenue they are located is a fast avenue with bus to subway or train, this will take probably 10 minutes to get there. The Taxi from here to Vatican City or the Coliseum is about 15 euros.

Wine was 10 euro's a bottle, but no atmosphere in the bar area as no one else in there. Hotel fine if you are taking taxi's (20 euro's to the Vatican) but if there is a taxi strike and the metro is undergoing maintenance (as it was when we arrived) then the whole experience could resemble a living nightmare. I have to say though, that the duty manager Fabio and his colleagues were more than helpful and polite. The one time we did arrive by metro to the Cornelia station there were no taxi's and we had to take the 246 bus to the Supermarket Panorama (purchase your ticket from the Tabac). from there it is a scary walk alongside a duel carriageway in the pitch black. Or, if you are in the know! you can walk through the grounds of the neighbouring hotel which was called the Jolly.....? This seems a much safer option.

If you are driving towards Rome Centre on SS1 and you have passed the bus depot on the right then go to the right lane to use the next exit, make a U turn utilizing the overpass. ( if you miss that one, the next right exit will let you do a turn around using a traffic light). Go back on the hwy heading towards the Ring, stay in the right lane. Just after the Panorama (think Walmart type store) there is an electronica store and then the exit. There is a small sign saying Holiday inn. If you miss it, turn into the Mc Donalds/Gas station and you will be able to back track. Check in took some time as they need passports for all guests and enter it in the computer. There is a 3 euro a day per person city tax, parking is free and relatively plentifull. Although they run conventions during the day, the parking fills up around 9 am and frees up again later in the afternoon. Internet, is NOT free. Several options (something not to love as oppose to what their sign says.) in the lobby area only, wireless for 5 euro a day you need to get a new code every day from the front desk and it is good from 7am till 7am the next day. There are 4 computers in the lobby with chargeable internet access. In the room there is a wireless Vodafone signal, 1 hr = 3 euro, 6hr = 6 euro, 24 hr= 10 euro. As a priority club platinum elite member I received 1 free code once during a 3 day stay and I had to ask for it. (Really ICH???) Shuttle bus into town, is very well explained and taken care off and it leaves/pickes up on time. Thank you. It is 5 euro's per person round trip so it is 1 euro more per ticket than a 24 hour bus/metro pass. It is a good deal as they drop you off in a location to see all the sites. Colosseum is about 10 minutes from drop off point. Drop off is near Piazza Venezzia. The bus was clean and timely. Room. The room was a typical holiday inn room. The bathroom was a good size, plenty of amenities and water pressure. Furnishings were in good shape, however there is NO coffee maker in the room, did have a fridge and a lcd tv, (decent size) There were 2 English channels, CNN and some type of movie channel, the rest is all Italian and 1 German broadcast The cleaniless was ok, it was not super clean (you know that look and feeling you get when it is), however it was not dirty either. In between. Restaurant. They are open for Breakfast at 6.30 am I believe and it looked good. I only had coffee from them which is 1.50 euro each. We did have dinner there and it was blah to ok, overpriced, the red wine was served too cold, the maitre d' was not pleasant nor inviting; waitress was good. We did not go back the next day. Pool was closed due to the time of year. Front desk service was good, with everyone being to communicate in English. All major credit cards accepted. Some hallway carpet needs replacing. Wake up call was done 10 minute late !!!!!! Location, It is about a 30 minute car drive to FCO airport. Next to the Panorama is a Tabachi, where you can buy the bus/metro ticket to use the public transportation system. Bus 247 will take you to the Metro Cipro/ Vatican station and from there you can use the rest of the Metro to get around. Coming back with the bus (247) get off at the Panorama and walk to the hotel (10 min) Getting onto the bus to go to Rome is a bit tricker. If you have a bus ticke,t it is easy, use the overpass near the Panorama and hop on the bus. If you donot have one and you need to find another Tabachi, other than the one next to the Panorama, Stay on the left side of the highway, there are some dangerous spots and then a side walk will appear. Buy a ticket at the next T. and cross the street. The bus seems to run every 15 min. There is an Aurelia trainstation. (near the Bus depot) where you can park your car and hop on a train. Bus is easier. The tickets are single use, 1, 2 or 3 day. Figure out what you need, the system is very easy to navigate and properly marked. In short. It is ok, nothing spectacular.

The major issues seem to be the staff and the location. First of all, the staff was very friendly, nice and helpful--we did not have any issues at all with the staff. We were not part of a tour group, we were just a couple traveling independently. Our room was clean, quiet, and appeared to be newly remodeled--we were on the third floor of the \"tower\" part, with a decent view overlooking the parking lot behind the hotel. The air conditioning worked well and was quiet. The only visible issue was a moldy area on the wall in the bathroom above the shower/tub. I also think that maybe there is a venting problem with the plumbing because our bidet \"farted\" when we turned on the sink faucet in the bathroom. Initially I blamed this on my husband because I kept hearing gassy noises whenever we were not in the same room (one of us in the bathroom, the other in the bed area). He denied having a problem, and claimed it was the plumbing. I subsequently had to agree with him after spending more time in the bathroom. This was not really a problem as it did not impact our comfort or use of the room, all it did was make me smile every time I turned on the faucet. We were happy with the variety of breakfast foods offered and the restaurant staff was gracious. The other big issue with this hotel is the location, which is unfortunate. The neighborhood itself is nothing special--not at all pleasant to walk around here. We did not see any \"ladies of the night\" but I would not have been surprised if I did. The quickest, easiest way to get here from the airport is to take a taxi, but this is also the most expensive and potentially a ripoff if you aren't a savvy traveler. We took the Cotral bus from the airport to the Cornelia metro station, then picked up the local bus #246 that goes past the hotel--total cost less than 5 euros each. This was not easy--it took a couple of hours for us to figure it all out, and we had to rely on some kind local people to let us know when to get off the buses (we would never had known otherwise). The local bus was absolutely packed full of sweaty bodies, and our luggage was being closely studied by a fellow who was so engrossed in figuring out what might be in our bags that he wasn't aware that we were on to him. To get into the city, the hotel provides an air conditioned, comfortable shuttle service which is 5 euros round trip. It only runs at set times and you must reserve a seat on it ahead of time. This is the best way to go, as public transportation from this location is a bit of a pain (see above) and taxis are a bit of a financial risk. The only problem with the shuttle is that there is one drop off/pickup location in the city, which may be far from what you want to see that day. You must be at the pickup on time or miss it--this means you may have to cut short your sightseeing and constantly check your watch while estimating how much time you need to get back to the shuttle stop. Overall, although the staff and room were nice, my biggest issue was the location and I would advise staying in downtown Rome or at least within a safe walkable proximity to a metro stop.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prosperity", "Title": "\u201cStay in downtown Rome, not here.\u201d", "Author": "lovestotravel096", "ReviewID": "UR118500475", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel three separate times (a total of 4 nights) during a two-week bus trip in Italy.

Arrived at the front desk, was greeted and given a room number 320. No bell man to help me with my luggages but I didn't ask for that help so I can understand. I hauled all my luggage to the the room. The hallway carpets were dirty, filthy and smelt of smoke. I went into my room unpacked a few things and made my way downstairs to the restaurant because my daughter wanted to have a bite. At the restaurant I was told to wait outside for a new minutes while they made our table ready. After a few minutes,we were taken to our table. A few minutes later a waiter brought us the menu and explained what they had. I wasn't really hungry so we ordered a pizza for my daughter. As we waited for the food to arrive and noticed the other waiters/waitresses going to other tables to ask if they needed anything and no body came to ours. About ten minutes later, our food was brought to the table and I didin't see any waiter untill we walked to the cashier and asked her to put the bill on my room reservation and walked out. I certainly didn't add a tip to it because they didn't desire it. I then stopped at the front desk to ask if our room was a smoking or non smoking since I had requested a non-smoking room. I was told my room was indeed a smoking room and I was going to be given a nonsmoking room on the first floor. The change was made and I was given a new key. I pulled one of the bell man's luggage cart and headed to my room, loaded my luggages and took the elevator to the first floor and started looking for room 126 to no avail. I then went back to the front desk and asked where room 126 was. I was told it was on the other side of the hotel. I hauled the cart with my luggages to the first elevator, went in and pressed 1. It took me to the 3rd floor and back to 0. Tried the 2nd elevator and the same happened. I went back to the front desk and was told I could use the service elevator. When back and was met by a waitress who was taking food upstairs who rudely told me I couldn't use the elevator and I responded back with a yes I can per the instructions of the front desk personnel. That elevator did not work either so I went back to the front desk. This time, the front desk personnel, stopped what he was doing and accompanied me to the elevator. All three elevators did not work for him either and that's when he said we had to use the stairs. When we got to my room, I let him know the money I was using to pay for that hotel room didn't have a color attached to it so therefore I needed to be treated with respect and dignity. He claimed, for him, I didn't see \"my skin color\" he attempted to apologize for the unfortunate situation. This lousy hotel doesn't have a shuttle to the airport.

Easyjet offered to put us up in a hotel and had us driven to this dreadful place. When we arrived, as we walked to the reception desk, 2 staff members started yelling at us that we cannot check in because it is not 2pm yet. When we explained we were Easyjet passengers and were booked in, they rudely informed us that they had no booking at all. After we made numerous phone calls to Easyjet, it was organised that we stay the night here. The staff at the hotel actually refused to speak to Easyjet on the phone eventhough they are a hotel Easyjet use! Then they refused to allow us lunch, eventhough Easyjet advised us it was included. That was probably a good thing because when we got to dinner that night and advised we were with Easyjet (as the front desk had told us to do), we were ushered to a curtained off area of the very cheap dirty restaurant that had a number of very large tables that were to accommodate every Easyjet passenger and we all had to share the tables. We then ate a terrible buffet meal, where even the \"cooked\" vegetables still had ice on them - now, Im sorry but you can't even make this sort of thing up - it was so bad!!!! Throughout the night we were desperately trying to organise to get out of the hotel, using the EXTREMELY expensive hotel internet - at approximately 8 euro an hour (I actually can't remember the EXACT price but I am very close on that approximation). The room stank of cigarette smoke and was extremely noisey - just to top it all off! The hotel was way out of Rome, costing us 45 euro for a cab into Rome and then took us forever when we went back on a train, a bus and walking. The staff knew we were stranded, and a long way from home (Australia) and they treated us with such distaste and disregard that we have never felt so humiliated. I was so upset by their treatment that I shed quite a number of tears over it - what a waste of my tears! I did my homework on Tripadvisor before we embarked on our European adventure and not one of the hotels that I booked caused me disappointment - actually if you read my other reviews you will see that I was more than impressed! This hotel was not one I chose, but rather due to circumstances beyond ours or anyone else's control, it was picked for us.

BUT...this hotel is very inconveniently located. You cannot walk to the metro, not even if you are willing to walk the 40 minutes, because there is no sidewalk next to Via Aurelia for the first 1/2 km. There is nothing within walking distance except a McDonalds, a Pans (sandwiches), and a large grocery store. Taking a taxi is expensive because they have to go the wrong way on Via Aurelia before making a U-turn -- it's 10 euros before you get back to the same spot going in the other direction, then another 10 or more into town. There's a bus line about 10 minutes away, it runs about every 20 minutes. Now the hotel does have a shuttle into town, and that's a very good thing because otherwise this hotel would be almost impossible to bear. The shuttle was prompt, big, and clean. It stops on the south side of the Vatican (on the way into town only), and then near Palazzo Venezia (about 1 km west of the Colosseum). Those are indeed the two best places to stop. BUT (again), it does NOT stop anywhere near a metro station, and that can be annoying. Also, there is a tone of traffic in Rome, so the bus rides ranged from 35 minutes to 50 minutes, whereas the metro zips along underground at about a minute or two between stops. SO, in summary, use this hotel only as a last resort. TRY TO FIND SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE METRO (orange line) and hopefully something with restaurants nearby. I saw lots of hotels on Via Aurelia further north, not far from the Cornelia station. One of those might work better, or any of the many other places in Rome. Good luck! Oh, and two minor things. We booked two rooms for 3 people each; when we checked in and got to our rooms, we found only two single beds in each room. The person at the counter seemed to imply this was our fault (\"well, you listed kids\" or \"it came to us as two people\") and basically said there was nothing she could do because there were no 3-people rooms available. I was friendly but persistent, and after about 15 minutes (including going to the room to see if a foldaway could be put in -- the porter insisted no), the person at the counter \"somehow\" found two rooms with 3 beds each. I don't know what that was all about. The other thing is that the rooms didn't smell particularly good; kind of a combination of a slight sewage smell (near the bathroom mostly) and a very cheap but strong perfume.

I am happy to report that all of my experiences there were great and the hotel was fun to stay at for my two day layover. First let me start by telling you that the free shuttle bus arrives at the airport (Leonardo da Vinci) at 8:30 AM and 1:15 PM until October 31st of this year. I believe they have a different schedule for the winter time. The bus picks you up outside of terminal C in front of the parking garage and there is a big Holiday Inn sign. The bus is painted in Holiday Inn colors as well. It is easy to find. My plane arrived at 10:00 AM and by the time I handed the kids off to my sister-in-law it was 10:30. I had her call the hotel and they told me when the next free shuttle bus was coming and told me that Taxi was another option and that I should not pay more than 40 Euro to get to the hotel. My sister-in-law said you are not expected to tip. Being the cheap American, and not wanting to pay $60 American, I opted to wait for the next free shuttle bus. I could have also taken the train, but did not. Anyway, whilst I was waiting for the bus I was approached by a few taxi drivers, and if you do not wait in the Taxi line they will approach you, and was offered a ride for 25 Euros. I decided to wait for the free ride. The ride was uneventful and quick, at maybe 25 minutes long. I got to the hotel and checked in and was given a room with a large king size bed. The room was big by European standards and average size for a Motel 6 in the states. It was a clean and very nice room. I checked in and walked down the hill to the grocery store which is one block away from the hotel. There is a McDonalds at the bottom of the hill as well but I never ate there because I wanted Italian food. I purchased a six pack of water and some food, at a bit, read a but and fell asleep trying to shake off the effects of a 20 hour plane trip from hell to Italy. Before I went to sleep I went and reserved a spot for the next morning\u2019s shuttle to the city. I could not book the return trip because they only book the next day\u2019s trip if that time already passed. If you want to book the 9:00 PM return trip you cannot book it until after 9:00 PM the day before. No worries, I then booked my return trip the next morning. I did eat breakfast at the hotel the next morning. I was very hungry and had not had a meal in about 20 hours. The meal is a buffet and it is very nice but cost 14 Euros, or about $20.00. The McDonalds does not serve breakfast like they serve in the US so I opted for the real food. I then boarded the bus for Rome. The bus was never crowded. Ever. I could have got on any shuttle I tried either going into Rome or coming back from Rome. This may be busier during the peak season but I had no issues whatsoever. The ride itself is about 20 minutes to the Vatican and another 10 to the heart of Rome. You can only get on the bus for the return trip at the same place they drop you off in the city, you cannot get on at the Vatican. As I mentioned above the ride back was never full and it was a stress-free ride. I also tried the pool at this hotel but the water was cold so I did not go in. The staff were all extremely helpful except for one bellhop on the last day. Other people have mentioned the small elevators, and they are very small, and I was checking out. I was on the 6th floor and had my backpack loaded. It was fairly heavy when the elevator opened it was filled with luggage and the bellhop. There was not room for me on the elevator so I asked if I could toss my bag on the elevator and meet him at the bottom (the stairs are right next to the elevator). He said OK, but I could hear him swearing and cussing at me as the doors closed and I was walking downstairs. I should have reported him but I did not. Anyway, staying here was not stressful at all. The free shuttle was easier than the subways (I have been to Rome before and stayed in town and took the public transit\u2026.this time I did not) and there was always room. The drop off point is about a six block was to the Coliseum and I ended up walking everywhere. I walked from the Vatican to the bus stop the next day, which was maybe a 15 block walk. I took the side streets and tried to get lost because you always find cool things when you are lost, but it is hard to get lost in Rome. Every person I dealt with spoke English except the bellhop. Every person I dealt with was professional and courteous, except the bellhop. I had no issues whatsoever with the hotel itself. The only thing I can think of to complain about, besides the bellhop, was that there is a stairway that is about half way up the hill that empties into the McDonald\u2019s parking lot. It was overgrown with weeds, tree branches, and cluttered with litter. If they would trim the trees, weed the path and pick up the trash there, it would really help their image on the outside grounds. I used the stairs anyway, and this is only a small complaint.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNice clean hotel with great facilities\u201d", "Author": "Beamy", "ReviewID": "UR17810730", "Content": "Booked a Deluxe double room and really enjoyed our stay.

Breakfast was very good, too, with fresh italian ham and mozzarella, fresh fruit and hot omelette (and many other things of course). As the hotel was outside of the centre (somewhat 4 kilometers to Vatican), there was a courtesy air-conditioned bus dropping guests in the city centre and picking them up at certain times, so we did not mind staying outside of Rome. There was a nice big Panorama supermarket nearby, so one could buy fruit, snacks and water there without paying double price in the city centre.

I will say that the reviews on this site were very helpful. My expectations were pretty low going into it as so many people had complained about the showers, elevators, and beds. I was pleasantly surprised by the modern feel of the hotel and am glad we chose here to stay. It is true that the hotel is no where near the center of Rome but it is accessible by cab and I heard good things about the free shuttle, although there were limited runs. They did have two drop off sites -- one near the Vatican and the other nearer the Colesseum. Let's start with some of the troubles we had. First, the first time we stayed there we stayed for two nights and had trouble with the air conditioner. Finally, someone we had met who was also on our cruise told us about a hidden switch. I actually had seen the little switch at the bottom of the air conditioning controls, but when I switched it on the light went from green to yellow and I just figured green was better. I was wrong -- yellow is the way to go. We finally figured this out and our second night was pretty cool and our return night was perfect. The restaurant was fine. We like our food but it took a little while to figure out the system. They have someone who sits you, someone who takes your order, and then someone who comes and gets that order and then, in turn, is your server. On some occassions English was not spoken much at all, and on others it wasn't a problem. They had buffets at breakfast and at the lunch on Sunday. We ordered off the menu for dinner and lunch. We had good sausage one night, a pizza the next night, and then i had a vegetable ravioli I really liked the final night. You can also order sandwhiches and get drinks from the bar around the opposite side of the front desk. Someone on here had mentioned that the showers were like coffins so I expected something really bad. The first two nights we had a double room and the shower was big. Our last night was in a king bed and the shower was much more coffin-like -- like being in a tube. That bathroom was very small in general, with the arrangement of the bidet behind the bathroom door, it was larger if you kept the door closed. Regarding the elevators, I wanted to share a quick tip. When we were trying to load our 5 suitcases into the elevator, a kind staff person came by and showed us the service elevator right around the corner. So we just pushed our entire cart on and up we went. We used a bellhop to leave and he was very timely. On our return, we used the service elevator both times. I wanted folks to know about this as it is true that the elevators (2 of them) are very small. TV is limited. Lots of Italian tv channels but only 2 English speaking -- an overseas version of CNN and MTV. In times of satellites it seems like have a few more English speaking options, especially at a Holiday Inn, would have been nice. Check in and check out was easy and the staff was professional and helpful, although not very cheery at all. I'm not sure I ever saw one of them smile. We used a safe they have to store our passports and money and that was helpful. They also always made our cab reservations and that worked like clockwork for us. They would give you the cab number so when it pulled up you would know which one was yours if other folks were waiting. All in all, if you want to stay in a more modern hotel and don't mind the travel into Rome, I would suggest the Holiday Inn West. (By the way -- the McDonalds and gas station is down a long hill, but it's the driveway to the hotel and therefore not as dangerous as I had pictured from the reviews here. We also saw ladies of the evening when we went to the airport at 2 a.m. -- not in front of the hotel, but on the driveway up) Hope this helps.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hull", "Title": "\u201cExcellent shuttle into Rome\u201d", "Author": "Rovers426", "ReviewID": "UR16536761", "Content": "The hotel was very easy to find, which was very welcome in the Rome traffic and the car park was excellent and cheap.

This was my first trip to Rome (and Italy), and it was disappointing to be staying at this hotel so far from the city. It would have been great to be able to walk around the city a bit in between my meetings, but this hotel is a 30+ minute and 20 Euro drive (don't let the kms fool you - the traffic is amazing! it took us an hour to get in for dinner on a Thursday night!) If you're staying there to sightseeing, any money you save by staying at a hotel outside the city would easily be asborbed by taxi fare. The hotel does have a shuttle, but in order to maximize my very limited time for sightseeing, I didn't really have enough time to wait for the next run. The hotel itself was OK - 1970's decor, but clean. The staff wasn't not very friendly, but I found that to be the case throughout Rome. There is a flatscreen tv in the room (and some sort of steamer thing), but you have to request an iron and ironing board. They have 3 computers in the lobby that you can pay to use the internet, and then wireless in the rooms. Bed was very stiff and linens not very comfortable. At this stage, I guess I'm used to staying in nicer hotels. The hotel is located next to a major road, and there's a McDonalds within walking distance and perhaps a grocery store (not much!). While I did feel safe within the hotel, I would not (especially as a single woman) walk around the hotel property at night. We noticed a number of \"women of the night\" hanging out around the hotel as we arrived back after dinner each night. Not interested in seeing that side of Rome! There were a bunch of tour groups staying at the hotel, and I suppose it's a decent place for a last stop before heading to the airport (which was only 30 min away). I will not choose to stay here again, but if it's a business meeting and I have to, it would be OK.", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire Dales National Park, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWas ideal for our purposes......\u201d", "Author": "IKB", "ReviewID": "UR10872668", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel twice in the same trip.

Clean, decent sized rooms and a modern airy feel about the lobby/lounge areas. The breakfast was fine and one of the evenings when we arrived we were very late, but they went out of their way to ensure we were able to eat in the restaurant. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The shuttle bus is great. You need to make sure you book it for every trip you want to make to Rome or to the airport as it is understandably very popular. We had to use taxis on a couple of occasions and this wasn't cheap, but it was well compensated for by the great sightseeing available. The swimming pool and surrounding area was great for chilling out after a trip to see the sights, with big towels available and a helpful attendant. It was perfect for our trip and we will certainly consider using it again for that type of trip, but don't book it if you want a central Rome location!

The room size was adequate and the in room mini bar was well stocked and the overall cleanliness were all up to snuff. We booked direct with the hotel and got a great rate during off season. That being said, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It is in a terrbile location for a tourist and it would be virtually inpossible to use public transport. It is not in the city centre, and if you are in Rome as a tourist, there are only 100 hotels in more ideal locations for a similar rate. My girlfriend and I stayed here for 1 night and that was enough. Another thing that I found that was not convenient was the size of the elevator. Only one person at a time can fit in this lift if you have any sort of bag to carry up.I only booked it because I thought it would be more convenient to get to fiumicino, but I was wrong to do that. If you ask me point blank, in which area would I stay if I were going to Rome again, I would say almost anywhere in the city centre. This hotel is in the so called green belt. Not at all convenient unless walking on the side of a highway into oncoming traffic at night time sounds like the kind of fun that you would fly overseas to have. We took the bus back to the hotel on that night and as the bus passed the hotel, we signalled for a stop. The bus driver stopped about 1 kilometer down the road from the hotel. It was such an odd place to be let off of the bus some priests asked us if we were lost because it seemed so odd to them that anyone would want to get off the bus on the side of the highway and want to walk. It was a very dangerous hike back to the hotel from the bus stop. What a nightmare. Stay near Termini, Vatican City or near the ancient sites. Trastevere is a really fun place if you have a taste for adventure and gastronomic pleasure. The area around the Campo de Fiore is also very lively. Long story short, do not waste your time in Rome staying out in the burbs. Enjoy the bustle and the convenience of public transport or the ability to walk to see or eat something good.

It unfortunately did not live up to what I had been led to believe. The location of the hotel is terrible. Although there is a shuttle bus service it is not sufficient. It advertises a pick up from the airport but this trip only happens twice before 12pm (not helpful if like us you land at 12.40) and then later in the evening. Trips into Rome city centre are not much better. We arrived at the hotel at 13.45 and were told that the next bus would leave the hotel at 15.40. The service is often also fully booked, especially the early trips into the centre and the late return trips back. It only has a couple of drop off points and one place to pick up from. We managed to get a place on the bus once back to the hotel and had great difficulty finding the pick up point from the map we were given and spent almost an hour walking around Rome at night. It may be easier if you manage to get dropped off in the morning so you know where you're going. The only other way into the city centre is to get a public bus and then the metro. To get to the bus stop you have to walk alongside a very busy 3 lane road - there is no pavement/sidewalk - which felt quite risky. The public buses are always extremely busy and you may find it difficult to find your correct stop. Some of the hotel staff were not very helpful and in some cases quite rude. I overheard one guest complaining about his room and the receptionist told him that he would have to speak to another receptionist in the morning and walked away from him. I unfortunately booked this hotel through lastminute where it was described as close to Romes attractions which is why I booked there. I therefore assumed that it was walkable or at least near to a metro station. Be warned if you are looking for a hotel close to attractions this is not the place for you. The price was quite reasonable (although my deal did not include breakfast) and the rooms were clean if a bit small.

I agree that the metro was quite accessible, however if you wanted to get there it was a 13 euro taxi ride, unless you used the bus no 246. Please note the correct exit from the cornelia metro station otherwise you will be wandering about looking for the bus station which when it is dark is difficult and quite unnerving. On leaving the bus on the return journey you have a short walk up a dark back road into the hotel grounds. The room we stayed in room no 512 was very good an enormous kingsized bed plenty of room to move around the room and a nice sized en suite. Breakfast was 11 euros each and was a substantial buffet with something to please all nationalities. Mini bar in the room however prices were very steep and we used the panaramo supermarket to stock up our own drinks in the fridge, beer 2.5 euros for 4 cans. If you are going to the sistine chapel make sure you get there as early as possible otherwise the queues are massive and with the opening hours in winter quite short you may not get in. Due to the location and the feasibility of getting back we made the decision of staying out all day rather than waste time going back and forth to go out in the evening. This allowed us to see everything we wanted to, but was very tiring and meant we were out 10 -12 hours each day. The hotel provides a free safety deposit box but you need to ask as soon as you check in as they are limited. You need to book your shuttle bus journeys the day before to ensure you can get a place. If I went again the only reason I would not choose this hotel is because of its location, if you are not concerned about the price of taxis or are happy to stay in the hotel every evening using their restaurant and bar then you should enjoy your stay.", "Date": "November 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Inverness Scotland", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful hotel friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "anthjonoaidmaddie", "ReviewID": "UR3731615", "Content": "We have just returned from one weeks holiday at the holiday inn rome west.

The staff were very friendly and advised us where to visit and the breakfast was very enjoyable with lots of choice from fried eggs to rice crispies with it being a buffet you could eat as much as you liked. We ate a couple of times in the restaurant and the dishes were very tasty and not very expensive a main course for about 10 - 14 euros, again the restaurant staff were very friendly. There is a Macdonalds at the bottom of the hill about 10 mins away, and a very big supermarket which sold flip flops to baked pizza's, lovely freshly baked bread and all the essentials you would ever need.

We had hoped that, being a Holiday Inn, it would have been of a reasonable standard and descent value, and that even though it was out of town, it would have been accessible via public transport. The standard of the hotel left much to be desired. The room was small but clean and a little dated. Our main complaint with the room itself was the bed. It was too short for me and my feet hung off the end (I'm only 6' tall). It was hard, and worst of all, the 'double' was actually two singles attached to each other, so there was an uncomfortable join down the middle. Breakfast was passable but nothing spectacular. Location was the really down side. As other posts have indicated, the only realistic way to get to/from the hotel is by taxi. The average cost for us was 20Euro each way. Having said that, we did use a bus to get down to the city centre in the mornings, but that required some knowledge of the system. We relied on other people helping us out. Getting a taxi back in the evenings was no problem. They were readily available at all the taxi ranks.

First, the good: obviously the free shuttle to the airport..you have to reserve the day before for any shuttle trips..so what..no problem. The shuttle is roomy and comfortable, the drivers friendly and polite. The room was clean and large enough by European standards. The shower was small. Oh and the elevator is tiny..but hey you're in Europe. The restaurant was very reasonable for dinner. It is very nicely decorated, and my husband and I had 2 wonderfully prepared entrees (veal and cannelloni), a salad, basket of bread. and a bottle of the house red wine for 34 euros (12% service fee/tip included). We thought this was a terrific bargain. The waiter was excellent. We felt very safe at this hotel, and utilized the McDonalds, another sandwich shop next to McDonalds, and the Panorama Supermarket ( turn left at McDonalds..go about 1/2 block). Wonderful European beer at less than 2 Euro a six pack or great selection of wines for 2 Euro or so. Also big selection of regional foods. cheeses. olives etc. and a department store. We took the hotel shuttle to the Marcello Teatro drop, which is very near the coliseum and also near the pickup for the Bus 110. This bus will tour you and let you get off and on at Rome's biggest attractions. They have earphones and an English tour by tape. You can even ride in the open air on top of the bus if you like. It was 13 euros and excellent. The pickup was about 2 blocks from Teatro Marcello..ask shop owners for directions..you will see bus 110 sign. As for the shuttle you do have to pre-book with the hotel staff your pickup and drop off times the day before..but that's easy. This is a fantastic place, at least for the last night or so of your visit to Rome. Another traveler we met from SC said the taxi trip from FCO was 80-100 euros, and we got it free. Also through the hotel's web site we only paid 72 euros per night. We loved it and would certainly stay again. Oh..one major disappointment..no coffee machine in room, though website says there is one. We complained to staff, and they said we could order from room service..gee thanks! Was 4 euros per cup..get your coffee at McDonalds. Oh and one other thing, if you come in by air, take the train to Termini and take a cab from there (hotel says 16 euro or so). The hotel had told us to take Line A subway to Cornelia and then bus 246 to hotel. It was pretty rugged with luggage, and there was about a 50' walk on a freeway and then a walk high on the hill where the hotel is.

If I could give this zero stars, I would\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3311646", "Content": "I made the mistake of choosing this hotel for my week-long vacation to Rome. The Travelocity site made is sound like it was very close to the city, and I thought, \"how bad can it be?\" First, the location. The hotel is not located near anything except a McDonalds, a gas station, and a grocery store. It is about 30-40 Euro for a taxi ride into the city. The Metro stop is very far away, and the hotel itself appears to be located in an industrial wasteland. Thus, you are completely dependent on the (poor) shuttle service for everything, including your meals. The last shuttle back to the hotel is at 7:50PM, and since no Italian resturant is open until 7:00 at the very earliest, you cannot eat a proper meal in the city. You have to either buy food at the grocery store (thank god for that grocery store!), eat at McDonald's/gas station, eat at the hotel dining room ($$$), or starve. I never once had a real Italian meal during my stay. Second, the rooms. I agree with the previous reviewer that the shower is indeed like a standing glass casket. I traveled with two family members, and no more than two people can squeeze into the tiny bathroom at a time. The view is non-existent - only a bare construction lot. The sheets were not changed on a regular basis - my mother dropped a strawberry on a sheet and the resulting red stain remained there for several days. Third, the service. The front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful. I have never encountered such poor customer service before. I asked them to call Borghese Gallery to switch the time of my reservation, as I could not do it myself because I had to catch the shuttle bus (more on this later). They never called. When we checked in, we were told that we did not have a continental breakfast. When we checked out, we were asked why we never used our continental breakfasts!!! I'm not sure which is correct, but if we did have that continental breakfast, it would've saved us much inconvenience and money. Fourth, the \"tours\" that the Holiday Inn offers. We decided to take the one- day \"tour\" to Florence that was arranged through the hotel. What a joke! The ride to Florence is about 3-4 hours on that bus, and when you arrive there, this is your itinerary: 10 minutes at Michelangelo's \"David\", 10 minutes each at two churches, 10 minutes at a piazza, ONE FULL HOUR at a leather factory where you are expected to buy something, and then lunch. Why not more time at the museum? Because the tour guides do not receive commission from the museum like they do from these stores! The lunch was also sub-par, although better than the aforementioned McDonald's. After lunch, you pile back into the bus for the 3-4 hour ride back to Rome. The tour guide also did not speak English well, and most people could not understand anything that he said. This cost about 350 Euro for 3 people. Last, the shuttle bus. The shuttle schedule is extremely limited, and you need to reserve a spot on the bus in advance. If you didn't happen to know this little secret, and the bus is full and you don't have a ticket, guess what happens. You're stuck with a 40 Euro taxi trip back to the hotel. I saw many irate people get kicked off the bus because it was too full. I know this review is long, but here it is in summary: The Holiday Inn Rome West is not worth even considering when making your travel plans.", "Date": "March 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh,PA", "Title": "\u201cbathroom shower is a standing glass casket\u201d", "Author": "travelagencyowner", "ReviewID": "UR2849340", "Content": "This hotel's location and setting was made for Italian businessmen with cars, not for any tourists who want to see or be near anything.

You walk out the front, go right, then right down the drive then left at a rolling gate then it curves around the behind the Jaguar dealer then left to the stairs of the pedestrian overpass and you can see the bus stop when you come down the other side.

However as your riding look for a \"Tobacchi\" shop and purchase your ticket there, run it through the little yellow machine on the bus when you get back on.)Take the 246 bus to the Metro (\"subway\" look for the Red square with the M in the center usually on all four corners) Cornelia station and you can get to most anywhere you want to go. The Hotel location is actually nice cause you are away from the crowds. They have a nice grocery store nearby and a McDonalds if you miss having coffee. For the price you definitely can't beat it! Yes there is alot of walking involved. I thought Rome was fasinating and enjoyed taking it in as I walked instead of zooming by in a vehicle. I lost five pounds and feel great! Walking is good for you! Do it! Our room was very small (If you can imagine a lower deck room on a cruise ship it's about the same size) but who spends time in their room? You're in Rome!! you wake up, leave, and don't return till late to shower and sleep only to repeat the process again. Get out and explore! When they say they speak English, they really don't well enough to understand everything. I asked for a wash cloth and they sent up a towel. I did not have any problems getting what I needed and they responded promptly. I found the service anywhere in Rome is not like we find in the USA however it was adequate.
