To get there the best way by car. Hotel is modern the neighborhood not attractive. Outdoor swimming pool is open from June so we do not use this. Breakfast is rather not attractive but overall stay was present. Distance to city center visit quite big but I left the car near the subway and this is the best way see the Rome. I will recommend this hotel as quiet and clean", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cA bad location with okay rooms ! Staffs are awesome !\u201d", "Author": "IndraneelR", "ReviewID": "UR57125235", "Content": "I have chosen this hotel as I had a car always with me. May be otherwise it is too far away from the city center. The location is quite strange as it feels like going to a dumpyard while entering the road leading to the hotel. The rooms are okay type as they are very small. There are more furnitures in the room, as needed. But despite so many bad things, I rate the hotel 7/10 only because of the staffs.
