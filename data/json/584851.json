Bizarre to find a faux-tudor building on Balmoral Rd surrounded by glam, modern highrises. Despite being the cheapest available hotel in the area, I thought $105AUD per night (booked on lastminute.com.au) was a bit expensive for what was delivered. But I guess you\u2019re paying for the area, being comparatively close to Orchard. Room #226: Non-smoking single room has two single beds (extremely firm!), effective aircon, very small TV, telephone, two sitting chairs, small desk with basic coffee-making facilities, wardrobe, small bathroom with shower, bath, toilet and sink. The good points - The staff & service: Efficacious, no-nonsense but friendly. I requested an iron, but was told ironing could only be done by housekeeping \u2026 my shirt was collected and returned perfectly ironed within about 10min. - The location: For me, the location was fine. About 10min walk to Newton MRT and Newton Circus Hawker Centre. From there a 2min train to Orchard. - The rooms: Not my style (obviously inspired by the English B&B), but the theme is carried off with full commitment! The chairs are floral, the pedestal sink is Georgian, the art is tapestry, the wardrobe is antique \u2026 you get the idea. The not-so-good points: - Cleanliness: Found black hairs in the bathtub on arrival and then again on Day 3. On Day 2 the fresh towels had quite a large clump of long black hairs stuck to them. - Appearance of common areas: A bit shabby and rundown. - TV: is there for decoration. The best channels had poor reception \u2026 the worst channels looked like a snowstorm. - Internet: Non-existent in rooms. I was told I could connect my laptop to the LAN line in the reception (for $3SGD/hour) but tried unsuccessfully on two separate occasions. A public computer in the lobby has internet for $1SGD/15min but I didn\u2019t try. No wireless available anywhere in the hotel, and trust me \u2026 it\u2019s almost impossible to access a wireless network in Singapore without a local mobile phone account. - Bath and shower: Hand-held shower head connected via hose from bath-taps. But, there was nowhere at head-height to \u201chouse\u201d the shower head so had to be held by hand. Inadequate shower screen meant bathroom (and some things in it) got wet during shower. Also, no plug so couldn\u2019t run a bath.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cvery terrible stay in this hotel....\u201d", "Author": "maximus_x9", "ReviewID": "UR108878416", "Content": "I had never had a experience like this in other hotels.

We had just that morning disembarked from the Queen Elizabeth after spending 3 glorious weeks in the lap of luxury so we are reasonably particular folks. We were very impressed with the accommodation at Sloane Ct FOR THE PRICE and one has to remember what one pays in other Singapore Hotels. When visiting Singapore feel we only need a bed as we are out and about so much, loving the city as we do. We refuse to pay exorbadent sums for a hotel room hence us giving Sloane Ct a go as it is a third of anywhere else.

We had a bad hunch the moment we reached the place. The first feeling I had was that I had just stepped into a very old haunted house. Service at the front desk and room service was very poor - no smiles or hello or \"thank you see you again\". In fact, we felt like the people working there didn't want us there at all. Though it was generally clean, everything in the hotel was OLD. They look old and yes, smelt OLD too. Even the CRT tvs were showing programs in black and white (we even had to tune some of the channels ourselves). We decided to go out for supper after midnight but found the hotel's main entrance locked and we couldn't get out (or rather stuck in the horrible hotel). There was also no one was at the reception desk. Most lights at the reception area were also switched off. A sign was placed near the door informing guests to press the bell \"ONLY once\". We did as the sign says. Approx 30 seconds later, one of the staff, a middle aged chinese lady, appeared in her PJs, bed hair and a very unhappy face (we assumed it was because we had disturbed her sleep) to open the door for us. The same happened when we came back to the hotel. Only this time, we had to ring the bell more than once and had to wait for almost 10 minutes for someone to open the door for us to enter the hotel!! On the day we were supposed to check out (check out time is at noon by the way), we received calls every 2 minutes from 1200 sharp to check if we had left our room. When told that we needed another 10 minutes, the receptionist said, \"No, only five minutes for you to come to the reception to hand over the room key.\" We were appalled at her level of service. We were even more upset when the first thing she said to us in front of other guests at the reception during check out at 1230, \"Terrible people!!\".

HELLO...is it first time got customer from Latestays. then we mention we already paid. then she search back the computer, then she say oh is at the deleted folder. Wow, how can the reception move the customer paid booking to the delete folder. then, secondly she ask how many ppl will stay, i say 2 person, then she say oh u paid the amount is 1 person, so need to put in extra money for extra person. she insist us to do so. but when we make online booking, there mention got 2 single bed in the room. then she suggest us to add extra sgd 40 for 2 nights for the extra person, so that means a night sgd 20. then actually i will only stay 1 night, and my bf will stay for 2 night.then she say like that i have to charge you sgd29+7% per night. then i say why don't you just charge me sgd 20 on that night. she say cannot, that one must charge two night. then i say normally hotel also got 2 single bed or 1 double bed. and why she insist us to pay the extra, she keep telling that got customer actually four person but only book 2 person. then that is different case. now we only have 2 person. after that she say hotel is different from theirs, hotel won't check how many person. After i hear the last sentence she told me, i feel that i do not want to talk to this person anymore. and i pay the amount. cause she also work in Sloane Court HOTEL. she say singapore is count by person but not room. and the room is spacious but not clean. the aircond with sound. the bed without blanket. then we found in the cupboard, one of the blanket is unfold nicely. and the other one is dirty. so, i assume that there is no room service. the bathroom is not well kept. the chair look very old. and the sofa look dirty. only the wood floor look shiny. in conclusion, I would not go back again.

If you want a bland, typical international hotel, don't stay here. It will not be your bag at all. If however you are travelling and love family run hotels, run by locals who really do know their town - this is fabulous. If you don't know Singapore, you will look at the map of this hotel and think i' s too far away. we did when we first arrived. However, Singapore is very small and it takes not even 10 mins by a regular bus into the main shopping street. We did this, but as we have a 4 year old with us, we often got taxis back at night as he was tired. A taxi from Chinatown to sloane Court was very cheap. In London you would pay 20 pounds for this - it was about 3/4 pounds in Singapore. As for the service - I am stunned that people say it was poor. We've been on the road with our kids for 3 months and this was probably the most helpful place we have stayed. Some hotels sigh when you ask for help - this one bent over backwards. Re the rooms - the bed was very comfy, they did not hesitate to give us for free a good, clean mattress for our son, the towels were a bit thin - laundry service was fast - what else? It is not like an internatioanl hotel where everything matches - the curtains may not match the sofa upholstery, but the curtains are in good condition as is everything else. I think we loved it also as Singapore is so sanitized that to find something a little more 'human' in Singapore was a breath of fresh air. It is quirky - based on an old english inn that does not really exist in england any more - the restaurant serves therefore a very old english menu - very good food. The resto is not very atmospheric, but again, it is what you would have found in the UK at one point in time. Just because of this, I can see why people think it looks tired - it is not - it is old-fashioned, but well loved. Why is it that people always expect places to constantly modernise ? Is it not ok to just maintain well what works? Anyway,I feel it necessary to tell you that this is the 1st trip advisor comment I have ever made as i feel so strongly that this hotel is misunderstood. It is expensive - This is because Singapore is expensive - cheap is hard to find in this town. I am vigilant about cleanliness as the though of a 4 year old getting bed bugs is gross - i cannot fault the cleanliness of this place.

On first arrival, the hotel has definite 'run down' feeling. A dark and dank front desk smelling very strongly of mildew, it just feels tired. On the way to the room, you pass through a hallway where you get visibility of all the hotels discards and junk, which is really a turn off. The room itself however was very clean and the bathroom was surprisingly nice and mold/mildew free. Bedcovers a bit grimey, TV very small, but overall the room was ok. My big problem occured though with the hotel staff. As a man alone checking-in, they warned me that if i had an extra person, i would have to pay extra. I thought it was an odd warning, but said of course (why wouldn't I). I was at the hotel alone and no one else joined me at all through the night. Upon check out however, they accused me of having an extra person and of bringing 'my girlfriend' into the hotel. They went so far as to claim the landlady saw me leaving with this mystery woman in the middle of the night (a complete lie, i went out at 23:30 by myself and even spoke with the landlady as the front door was locked)! Worse, the landlady looked me in the eye and continued to claim my girlfriend was with me and that the girl was still at the hotel. I asked her to get the girl and she said oh she must have just left. I was completely flabergasted by the outright dishonesty of the staff. I hoped that perhaps the landlady was mistaking me for someone else from the evening, but then when she told me the girl was still there (and then miraculously disappeared) i knew it was an outright lie. She also refused to go the room to see the single bed with the almost unruffled sheets. I don't know why the hotel would go so out of their way and be so dishonest as to accuse a guest of such misconduct, simply to extract 30 SGDs from the guest.

They were charging more for this standard room than I would normally pay in a 4 star hotel in Singapore.. I would rate this as a one star hotel, no more and compare the pics I have included with their brochure pics. In their defense they said the pics on their one page brochure were actually of a superior room ie.... only superior rooms come with bed, shower curtain, two taps, light fittings and light bulbs???? As I never saw a superior room I cannot comment.
