We were a bit disappointed by the exterior on arrival but soon got over it once we were greeted by hotel staff. Altun at the front desk took us into the garden area and served us hot tea and home made cookies. Then we were taken to our rooms and were quiet surprized as to how nice the rooms really were. After a short rest we came down stairs and Altun briefed us on the hotel ammeneties and info on everything from restaurants, city tours and must see tourist attractions. The remainder of the staff was super friendly, helpful and always ready to answer any questions we might have. All of our friends indicated their rooms were great also and very clean. The rest of the hotel was kept clean and the only time we saw any other guests were we we went to breakfast. All the main tourists spots are withing a 10 minute (or less) walk from the hotel. Breakfast in the morning was simple and enough to get your day going and there's plenty of nearby restaurants with excellent menus. I recommend this hotel if it's your first Istanbul trip and want to hit up all the main sites in the Old City", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Islamabad", "Title": "\u201cVisit to Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Muhammad N", "ReviewID": "UR127174502", "Content": "One can only talk about his own experience and mine was an awesome.

Similarly, in the same street where the hotel is located, you would find a chain of some very good restaurants. The staff is as friendly as you can Imagine. They guide you in every manner they can with smiling faces. the two young and beautiful ladies at the manger counter and very friendly and energetic and would help you in every possible manner they can. Another staff member wold always know when you need to drink (tea or anything) and would present you with it even before you ask for it. The rooms and especially the washrooms are very clean.

The hotel is located well within easy walking of all the major attractions and the helpful staff is there for anything else that you want transportation to. Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk airport is so close, that a taxi ride costs max 16 euros. If you plan on staying in Istanbul stay at the Vezir, you won't regret it. B.
