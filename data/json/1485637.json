It was spotlessly clean and in a really good location. The rooms were a modern, and good size with a kettle, toaster etc in the kitchen area. The towels were changed every day and the staff were very helpful with directions etc. They let us store our luggage at the end of our stay and we picked it up on the way back to the train station. The beds were clean and comfortable. There is a pool which again was very clean and a gym. We didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on that. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Hauptbahnhof rail station. The rail station has a fantastic underground link which goes straight to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag and only takes about 5 minutes. You can also walk from the hotel to the centre of Berlin which only takes about 20 minutes. Most things are within walking distance, but if not, the Hauptbahnhof station will take you anywhere. It was slightly tricky at times to know which line to take but there is an information desk and the vendors who work at the food outlets were knowledgeable and pointed us in the right direction more than once. There is a supermarket about 5 minutes from the hotel. I would stay there again.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cGreat landing pad hotel\u201d", "Author": "Janniebeth", "ReviewID": "UR128530224", "Content": "For our first-ever visit to Berlin in late March, Dear Hubby and I chose Adina HBF as our \u2018landing pad\u2019 hotel. (It is a 10 minute walk from the station.) Displeased to find ubiquitous construction around the station and its neighborhood, we were all-the-more delighted to find Adina and its street a serene oasis. Our suite was on the sixth floor overlooking a courtyard where guests could sit out. D\u00e9cor was tasteful and modern. There was a living area with couch, armchair & tv; a bedroom with split-mattress double bed, ample closet space and drawers and another tv; a little dining area, desk area, and a kitchen with fridge, dishwasher, two-burner stove and a combination convection oven-microwave. Unhappily, there was no proper coffee maker, even upon request, though there was an electric kettle. The bathroom was large and clean, with combo tub/shower and lots of counter space and makeup mirror. We were there for four days. Cost averaged out to about 90 euros per day, which we considered a really good deal for what we got. Wifi and breakfast are extra. And the best wifi deal is the option that charges only for time spent online BUT be sure to log out each time. There were a couple glitches during out stay, though we do not fault the hotel (unless other travelers report the same experiences): On the two weekdays we were there, window washer crews showed up before 8 and began a clacking round of work at office buildings across the courtyard. And, on our last evening, part of the electricity blew out for that evening, though nothing we needed crucially. But if it had been a hot day, we would have been without ac. But do note: The young woman who came to help us tried several times to fix it, and a technician showed up bright and early the next morning. The construction around the bahnhof was a real \u2018downer\u2019, though we found that all over Berlin. But we loved the futuristic bahnhof building itself, and went there for our food and other supplies and just to gape. And this Adina we do highly recommend.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, null, Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cA cozy and pleasant hotel\u201d", "Author": "Josephine H", "ReviewID": "UR128361959", "Content": "We stayed in the apartment for almost two weeks and had such a fond memory of the place.

We also had a balcony with a table and chairs and view of the TV Tower and Berlin Dome Cathedral. The room had everything you could need. The breakfast was fantastic and much better than I have experienced in other city hotels around Europe. We travelled to the hotel by train from the airport to the Hauptbahnhof and then a ten minute walk to the hotel, and the same on the way back. We also made use of the Berlin Welcome Card sold by the hotel to use the trains in the city from either the Hauptbahnhof or Friedrichstrasse, when our feet got tired.

We booked our flight plus room, for 3 nights, via Easyjet Holidays - and we were delighted with the location of the hotel, the facilities in the room, the friendliness & professionalism of staff plus an extensive, delightful buffet breakfast. The room was large, spotlessly clean, with a contemporary en suite and comfortable bed. Our view from the window was an inner courtyard - but other rooms had external views. The Hotel has a nice swimming pool - a very decent gym, with sturdy equipment - and a sauna. We never used the restaurant - but the food/prices looked good. We did have 'end of evening' night caps sat in the comfy leather armchairs in the classy bar area. We missed the daily 'Happy Hour' from 5 to 7 each evening when prices were very keen. The Adina Hauptbanhof is a 10 minute stroll to Freidrichstrasse - Berlin's equivalent to (say) Oxford St, London. From Friedrichstrasse you can walk to most of the major sites in Berlin. Also off this street are loads of restaurants, bars, cafes, fast food outlets & shops to suit all pockets. As we were in Berlin to spend time with friends, and have done most of the Berlin tourist sites - we visited the nearby Natural History museum, 200 yds from the Adina, containing a great Dinosaur exhibition and huge Hairy Mammoth. On our last day in Berlin we ate Lunch, next to the river, in the sunshine at Koepenick Castle in the East of the City. The Adina is suitable for couples, business travellers or families. Its lounge area, pool, gym, bar & restaurant compare to a good 4* Hotel. The washing machine, cooker, fridge, tea/coffee making facilities, etc. allow those on a budget to obtain even further value for money. As a big fan of The Circus Hotel (TA's #1 Berlin Hotel) I did not expect the Adina to be as good. Both Hotels - are contemporary, spotlessly clean, welcoming, non 'stuffy' and offer excellent value for their location. On my next visit to Berlin I will happily stay at either.

Whilst it is not exactly close to any of the 'headline' sites in the city, it is not too far away from most of them. It is just a five minute walk from the Hauptbahnhoff, Berlin's impressive new central station whilst five minutes in the other direction will bring you to the U-bahn and tram stops at Naturkund Museum. The immediate location is next to a major hospital and residential area and there is a fair bit of development going on so expect a bit of building noise, though the room soundproofing is very good. The hotel itself has a smallish reception area with a bar - nice, if a bit pricey - and restaurant which we didn't use. All the staff were kind and courteous. Our room was on the 6th floor though calling it a room does it a disservice. It was a one bedroom apartment with a well equipped kitchen area, comfortable living area and a separate bedroom and bathroom. The hotel is just three years old and the appartments are furnished in a modern style and have all mod cons. There are plenty of TV channels for the two TVs and you can even do your laundry if you wish with the washing machine and tumble dryer situated in the large bathroom. As our tariff did not include breakfast we simply bought some cornflakes from a nearby convinience store but there was always the alternative of using the local cafe nearby. There were three of us in our party and the hotel was ideal, with our daughter using the bed setee in the living room. There was a surcharge for this but it still meant the price was better than obtaining two rooms in a normal hotel of similar standard. There is a pool and sauna which are well worth checking out if you find you need to relax after a hard day's sightseeing.

Fabulous hotel! My friend and I shared a twin room on the 7th floor on the first night and for the remaining 2 nights were given a room on floor 2. The original bedroom had twin beds separated by a wall holding the tv with no doors to the living room. However, the 2nd floor room was better. This had a separate bedroom and had a washing machine and tumble drier in the bathroom. For us, it was worth the extra. The location is perfect. Opposite is the Natural History museum (well worth a visit), and minutes from the Underground to the right, or the Hautbahnof train station to the left. This is a fabulous place considering you're there to catch trains. Plenty of shopping and very helpful staff. Can't fault the hotel. What problems there were, were niggly ones, missing corkscrew, flat batteries in remote, having to ask for slippers for the pool and dressing gowns which were in the pool area. I would have preferred to go to the pool in the gown and slippers, but that's a minor point. The kitchen was well equipped, although I didn't like all the clutter in the fridge of the minibar stuff which was prohibitively expensive. Who makes up these prices?! Shopping can be bought from LIDL 7 minutes walk down the road (not open Sundays) but open until 8pm. There's also Kaiser's supermarket at the Hautbahnhof. Washing powder sachets can be bought from the hotel. The rooms were very warm indeed, and the quilts very heavyweight. I ended up taking the quilt out and just using the cover and a blanket,although I'm sure the staff would have given me a sheet if I'd asked. Lovely staff, nothing too much trouble. Kindly let us drop our bags in store after we checked out so we could sightsee. The seating area in the lobby is perfect to unwind before travelling, gorgeous fire and interesting books. Swimming pool and sauna are lovely. Lots of towels, dressing gowns and freebie perfume samples, and open until 11pm.

We decided to stay here because we have a young baby and wanted a larger room and kitchenette to prepare our babies home cooked food. We were very disappointed on arrival to be told that the cot would cost us an extra \u20ac10 per night, after complaining that I was spending over \u20ac1000 at the hotel for 2 rooms they eventually waivered the fee. When asked why they charged extra for the cot they informed me it was for changing the sheets, well the sheets were not changed once during the 6 night stay - maybe they waivered this service in line with the charge! We were also disappointed to receive a room without a bath, obviously we had a baby yet this was not factored into the booking. The reception staff said that we could borrow a baby bath, but when we requested this they said someone had it and we couldn't have it until the following day, which was very disappointing. Furthermore the kitchenette is very poorly equipped. Expedia described the rooms as having full kitchenette; both our room and my parents did not have any hobs, only a combination oven/microwave. So the idea of steaming my childs food on the steamer which I bought with me went out of the window, I do 90% of my cooking at home on the hob and would describe this as an essential component of a kitchen, so again very disappointing. In summary do not book this hotel if you want a bath, a kitchenette or a room suitable for a baby. On the other hand if I stayed in the hotel just with my wife I wouldn't have had such complaints so it really depends on your circumstances. The rooms are large, modern and clean. The pool area is lovely, and the hotel also has a small gym and sauna. We didn't eat at the hotel so I cannot comment on that.

We had a great time and the hotel was lovely! I had read Trip advisor reports so had an understanding of options for getting to the hotel. My recommendation after trying various was get to Hauptbahnoff station. Come out on Europlatz exit, steer right going past the modern silver statue of a horse (?) on the steps, cross the road towards the river and go right over the bridge (stay on the right hand side- just before you go over the river you will see a memorial stone to Gunter Litfin who was the first person to be shot and killed after the Berlin wall was erected in 1961). Walk along the road for a couple of hundred meters and you will find a bakery on the corner. The Adina can be found around the corner. (In the night time it will be lit up with a red sign) 10-12 minute walk. Alternatively there is a bus from Hauptbahnoff station.The 147 is only one bus stop along Invalidenstrasse. The reception staff were efficient and we were treated with good customer care (They had responded promptly and positively to previous correspondence requesting particular rooms and information regarding the hotel) We stayed in a one bedroom suite. The hotel was beautifully presented with good quality modern and welcoming furnishings. It was lovely to arrive to a seating area that was like your livingroom with a fire with flames. The rooms are additionally secured by a lift that you have to use your key card to swipe allowing access to your floor . We didnt use the reastaurant but it looked nice, the staff were friendly and it was at times very busy The hotel had a large pool which was open from 06:00 - 23:00 - my son really enjoyed using it. It had bathrobes towels and shower gel The room was well appointed with comfortable quality furnishing. The bedroom had an alarm clock and a free safe. The bed was very comfortable and clean. There was an iron/ironing board in the cupboard. A flat screen T.V on the wall. There was adequate storage and quality hangers. My son slept on the sofa settee which was comfortable. The flat screen TV in the living area has a limited range of English channels mainly news - CNN. There were films that could be accessed 10 euro for one film 18 euro for any over 24 hour . The bathroom was lovely and had shower gel and tissues. In the bathroom there is a washer and dryer. They provide washer tablets at a cost of 0.95 euro (Easy to use with directions of how to use on the inside of the door and in the hotel handbook that you will find on top of the desk.) Towels replaced on request. The kitchen has a hob and microwave (so won't cook pizzas !) There is salt and pepper, dishwashing liquid, a sponge and a tea towel. Dishwasher tablets are provided each day. More than adequate utensils, pots and cutlery . We stocked up with some basic food and drink from the Lidl around the corner. I would recommend that you take your own tea bags, coffee and sugar.The Lidl can be found about 5 min walk from Adina (At the hotel front door turn right and head through the Charity hospital interconnecting bridge. The Lidl can be found on the left hand side. It opens until 19:00. Bags are charged for.) There are quite a few eateries on this stretch of Road though we didn't try any. It feels very safe travelling around the hotel. We bought a day travel ticket from the information centre at the airport and also purchased a Berlin Welcome Card with Museum pass - last for three days (until Midnight on day three) You need to validate your transport tickets on the railway platform/ on the bus. Only need to do it once. Transport system is very good and efficient. You need to get your head around the different transport available.

We explored it with Sandemans tour of Potsdam(12 euro with Berlin Welcome Card) try the yummy chicken soup(about 3 euro and comes with bread/bagel) at the cafe stop off in the dutch quarter advised by the guide in Potsdam centre. Would have loved to spend another day here -Pergammon museum -Hohenschoenhausen prison/stasi museum East Berlin Gallery -Friendly people -Tip A walking tour on the first day helps you to orientate yourself Museums including the Jewish museum are closed on a Monday Get a Good map of Berlin (Sandemans tour company provide free maps at the information centre at the airport. The Map provided in the Berlin Welcome guide book is rubbish) TV Tower had huge queues and waiting times of at least an hour at night and worse in the day. Book ahead! Must book in advance for the Reichstag (my confirmation from the Reichstag took a week to arrive), remember to take your passport and allow time to get through security ... run if you see a school group hot footing it over ... they take a while) The views from the Reichstag dome are as good as the TV Tower You travel fast in the elevator in the TV Tower. Our ears popped! Berlin cathedral is closed when there are services. Check out the classical concerts that take place there Berlin Philarmonic (one of the best in World) needs to be booked well in advance The express train was delayed by 40 minutes getting back to the airport ... we just about made it.

Public transport excellent and \u20ac6.30 for a day pass covers Ubahn SBahn Bus and Trams for the whole city. Staff at hotel were brusque and professional, short on smiles but very efficient.

Air conditioning, real opening windows. It was perfect. Hotel seemed to have an Australian type theme going on.

An Australian themed painted bear stands at the entrance to the hotel. Nothing extreme though.

It's a 10-15 minute walk down Luisenstrasse before you get to anything interesting, but on the positive side you are close to the main railway station, which is enormous and you can find underground parking down to 5 Euros per day in the area. That brings me to one of my few negative comments. We stayed at Adina apartments for 2 nights and we paid 36 Euros for parking! It's actually cheaper to park in the city center than in their parking garage! 18 Euros is simply too much in this part of the city and when you on top of that pay for a room, it\u2019s not reasonable at all. The parking booths are definitely not very big either, but we've seen worse on this trip and the price a side, we were very happy with the parking conditions. We felt the car was 100% safe in the closed basement. The reception staff is friendly, and seems very willing to help you out if you have any questions. We had a room on the top floor (room 603). A very nice and quiet room, with a view of the small square (Platz), in front of the hotel. There is a small balcony as well, where you can sit and enjoy the sun, especially in the morning. The room had a kitchenette and everything you needed except for cooking plates. There's a new microwave and plates, forks, knifes and so on. The fridge was big enough for your own shopping besides the mini bar and there is no electronic registration (hate that), so that's a big plus. The bathroom was extremely big for a European hotel and the shower was nice, but they could have made room for a bathtub. The room came with hairdryer, electric iron and a coffee machine. Quite frankly, we didn't miss anything during our stay. There is a (small) pool which will fit 2-3 people swimming at the same time , but NO Jacuzzi/hot tub, which is something you find in other Adina Hotels (There is one Copenhagen for instance). There's a sauna and a fitness room and a cozy yard with lounge chairs in connection to the pool room. We didn't try the restaurant, but it looked stylish and the food looked good. The area is not great for shopping. If you are there for shopping, you would want to go to Alexander Platz or the new trendy Kurf\u00fcrstendamm shopping street and KaDeWe. Alexander Platz is about 2 kilometers away (1.2 miles or so) and Kurf\u00fcrstendamm is 6-7 kilometers away (4 miles). It might seem a bit far, but you can go down there through Tiergarten, which is an oasis in Berlin and remember to stop by Berlin Zoo (you can see plenty of animals from Tiergarten without having to pay an entrance fee). Or you can just take the train. It takes less than 10 minutes by train from the Hauptbahnhof. No free Wi-Fi, not even in the lobby and that always cost a Trip Advisor star, and the location is not the best in Berlin. Everything else is in order, and so is the standard room charge. A 4 out of 5 star hotel in my book. Get free Wi-Fi and lower the parking fee with a couple of Euros and this is a clear Trip Advisor 5 star hotel.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cModern, Perfect Hotel!

Only negative comments were around wifi charges (\u20ac15/day, \u20ac3.50/3h) & parking charges (\u20ac18/day, even for a short stop) which were excessive considering room rate.

We even had a washer and dryer if you could figure out the German instructions. The Best part of our experience was the front desk staff, Andrea. She answered every question with a smile and had numerous suggestion of what to see and where the closest food store was located.

Our room was like a mini-suite, although we had booked a \u201cstandard\u201d room (whatever that means). Not sure if we got an upgrade, or if this type of room is the standard?? The room we had was split into three sections. On entering, you were in a lovely living area, with big flat screen TV, kitchenette (with dishwasher/large fridge/cooker), sofa area, work desk and small dining area. The bedroom was separate, with yet another flat screen TV. Lovely comfy bed with nice pillows and duvet. The bathroom was accessed via the living area, and was really nice. There was even a washing machine/tumble drier hidden in here! The facilities were fantastic! The d\u00e9cor was modern, in browns/creams with a black/white bathroom. Quality furnishings with co-ordinating cushions and footstools scattered around. Had the feel of a swanky loft apartment! We got a fantastic rate, which included breakfast (normally \u20ac19pp) via quickrooms.com. The breakfast was really good, with a buffet of hot and cold dishes, and the chef would prepare whatever kind of eggs you liked. Everything was delicious. We had very rainy weather, so ate (and drank) in the hotel every night. We had spent the whole day doing the touristy things, and had walked our legs off in the rain, so were quite happy to sit and relax in the hotels lovely surroundings. There is a happy hour between 5.30 and 7pm, and the bar staff looked after us really well. Special mention to Steven who was really smiley and made us feel really welcome. The food in the restaurant was excellent, or you could order appetisers to snack on in the bar area. We did both, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The hotel seemed to be pretty quiet, and is set in a fairly quiet location. It is about a 15 minute stroll straight down Luisenstrasse to the Brandenburg Gate. There are frequent buses on the main street (Inavlidenstrasse). It\u2019s one stop to Hauptbahnhof railway station, or one stop in the other direction to the underground (Zinnowitzer Strasse). It\u2019s a 10 minute walk either way. We used the public transport frequently, jumping on/off buses/trams/underground. No problems whatsoever, as this is included in the \u201cBerlin Welcome Ticket\u201d. Tip1: We took an S Bahn from Schonefeld, thinking this would take us straight to Hauptbahnhof. Unfortunately, we were wrong, and had to change trains. We should have taken the Airport Express, which is an RB14 (I think), which goes through the centre of Berlin. Tip2: We arrived into Hauptbahnhof, and it was raining heavily. We had been intending to walk to the hotel, but there were lots of buses right outside the station (exit Europaplatz). As we had our train tickets, we just jumped on a bus for one stop. The hotel is round the corner from the bus stop (there is a bakery on the corner). Tip3: A lot of the Berlin Wall has been taken down, but there is still a section, and a guard tower within walking distance of the hotel. Walk towards Hauptbahnhof, there is a bridge over the river. If you cross the street, you will notice a cobbled walkway/cyclepath heading away from the city centre. Walk along cyclepath (the Institute of Technology will be on your right, and the river on your left). There is a graveyard, and the BW is in the middle of this (yes, they cut the graveyard in half)! Keep walking and you will see some modern apartments. The old watch tower is in front of these, but you need to go round the corner to see it! We had a really great time in Berlin, it really is a fascinating place. There is so much still to see and do, we will need to return when the weather is a bit better. We would have loved to have done a walking tour, but the weather was just too rainy. Also, we noticed that the walking tours seem to be at 10am during winter months.

The indoor pool is just plain awesome. The styling throughout the place is sleek and modern but still comfy, and the view of Berlin from the terrace in our top-floor room was sensational. The location is pretty darn good, walking distance to several museums and the train station, biking distance to a lot of other great stuff. (Which was handy because we never did figure out the crazy bus system). My only complaint is that during our stay the free WiFi was clearly not working, but the staff seemed unable to admit it! Instead they would tell us \"Try this login and password.\" We'd try it, it wouldn't work, and we'd call back. \"Okay, try this other login then.\" No dice. \"What device are you using? A Mac? Try a PC. A PC? Try a Mac. Oh, it's a Dell? Try your iPhone. iPhone doesn't work? Try this other login and password and select the \"Conference\" option from the menu....\" Later we overheard other guests at the front desk complaining about being put through the same rigamarole. And when we checked out, there was a line item for \"Internet Use\" on our bill. They were nice about removing it once we noticed it, though! Listen here, Adina Hotel! If the Internet is broken, just say so! We won't get mad at you! Otherwise it was a lovely place and I'm sure their WiFi is fixed by now. We were just a bit bemused by the way they chose to handle it.

The group with whom they contract does not have state-of-the-art IT, and I was told several times that they have been experiencing problems with Macs--whether Iphone or laptops.

We had a 1 bedroom suite on the 6th floor (room 610). The room had a small balcony and a nice view of both the dome on the top of the Reichstag and the Hauptbahnhof. Location: The hotel is located on Platz vor dem Neuen Tor, on the west side of the plaza, facing east. You can\u2019t see a sign or the building itself as you are walking along Invalidenstra\u00dfe (exit the Hauptbahnhof from Europlatz and go right). The hotel is a solid 10 minute walk from the station without luggage, more with (especially considering that currently some of the sidewalk is torn up on the south side of Invalidenstra\u00dfe). There is a bus stop (Invalidenpark), located on Invalidenstra\u00dfe within a minute or two of the hotel that is a good option is you have luggage or just don\u2019t want to walk. There are about 5-6 bus lines that stop there (i.e. 120, 142, 147, etc. \u2013 see http://www.bvg.de/index.php/en/) which means you typically don\u2019t have to wait very long for one to show up (we never waited more than a minute or two). Room: Having traveled in both Europe and the U.S extensively, I am very confident in describing the Adina\u2019s rooms as extremely comfortable by both U.S. and especially European standards. Our room was comparable to the newest Staybridge Suites, Homewood Suites, Residence Inns, etc. in the U.S. It featured a small kitchen (sink, 2 burners, convection oven, dishwasher, water kettle, toaster, and small refrigerator with freezer), dining table with 3 chairs (4th was the desk chair), couch with small coffee table and ottoman, true king bed, and flat screen televisions in both the living room and bedroom. Nice touches included the washer/dryer (stick with the 3kg for 30 minutes when washing) in the bathroom and digital safe in the bedroom closet. The refrigerator was handy for storing milk and snacks for our 15 month old. Unlike extended hotels in the States, the Adina provides full housekeeping services each day (made beds, replaced towels, etc.). One final point: the air conditioner was stout, which was very nice for this American who likes it cold when he sleeps. Sightseeing: Although advertised as a Hauptbahnhof hotel, the Adina is probably more targeted to long-term guests studying/visiting/working at the Charit\u00e9 university hospital next door to the hotel. That said, the sights aren\u2019t far. The closest, the Wall Documentation Center, is about a 10-15 minute walk. Everything else requires public transport, which is available at both the Hauptbahnhof or the nearby Naturkundemuseum U-Bahn stop. However, even with travel time, most sights in both the former east and west are within 15 to 25 minutes of the hotel. Food: The hotel has a small restaurant and bar that we didn\u2019t try. There are a number of small cafes and restaurants on or very near Platz vor dem Neuen Tor, including a good little coffee/pastry shop right next to the hotel. There is a Lidl supermarket located on Luisenstra\u00dfe, about 5 minutes south of the hotel. There is also a Kaiser\u2019s supermarket in the Hauptbahnhof, however we found Kaiser\u2019s to be extremely expensive when compared to Lidl (the Kaiser\u2019s does have longer hours which can sometimes be helpful). Overall: We loved the Adina Hauptbanhof. The extra space and amenities were great for traveling with our 15 month old and the convenience to the Hauptbahnhof was great for both our sightseeing within Berlin and the day trip we took to Dresden. At 100 euros per night, we considered the Adina to be a bargain.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cOverbooked, despite reservations well in advance.\u201d", "Author": "SKCTokyo", "ReviewID": "UR77274875", "Content": "We had spent considerable time trying to decide where to stay in Berlin, given that it has no real center.

Immaculately clean, modern, spacious with all the mod cons needed, including a large fridge (which we filled with drinks and fruit from the local supermarket). The air con in the hotel was an absoloute god-send as we were there during a heatwave weekend of 38oC and the hotel was our only respite from the sweltering heat as most restaurants and cafes in Berlin don't have air con. The pool and sauna were great - although the pool wasn't massive and was regularly full of noisy kids, but pick the right time of day and it's a great place to chill out and relax after a long day of sight-seeing. Breakfast was nice - perhaps not the hotels strongest point, but certainly nothing to grumble about. We struggled to find a table one morning as the breakfast room isn't massive and sometimes in the morning the breakfast selection looked a bit bare until the staff got around to replenishing it, but otherwise it was fine. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The location of the hotel was ideal for us: 15-20 mins stroll to the river and Freidrichstrasse station and about 10-15 mins (dragging cases) from Hauptbahnhof. We ate at the italian cafe/restaurant next door to the hotel which was nice and convenient for our first night there when we totally shattered after an early start. Food there was good - very authentic italian and cheap! We absolutely loved Berlin itself - so much to do and see. We had 4 days there and didn't even touch the surface. We could easily have spent a week there and still not have seen everything we wanted. We have got very fond memories of our visit to Berlin and stay at the Adina.

There is even a washer and dryer in the bathroom (you can buy a washing tablet for a modest sum) and a mini bottle of washing up liquid in the kitchen. We have stayed in serviced apartments before, but this place provided so much more than you can usually expect. We had a two room apartment which was very spacious and contemporary in decor. The bathroom was very nice - better quality than many 5 star hotels we have stayed in. The king size bed was very comfortable and had two separate duvets, which I understand is common in Germany. The whole place was spotless and there were two flat screen TVs. The staff were very pleasant and efficient. They didn't have any information about our request for a cot when we arrived, but by the time we got to our room someone was in there putting up the cot for us. I would highly recommend that you make time to visit the pool as it is beautiful and (that word again!) spotless. It's open from early until late and there is no limit on when children can use it ,as is often the case in larger hotels. The location was also very good- close to most attractions yet quiet enough not to be disturbed. There is a supermarket just down the road and I would suggest buying breakfast there as the in house breakfast was pricey. The tapas bar on the ground floor is great for a drink but the food wasn't really worth the money. Overall, it was excellent. and exceeded our expectations in every aspect.

The hotel was modern and clean and nicely decorated and the rooms were spacious studio apartments with LCD tv, kitchenette, and all the amenities you could want. They were cleaned daily to a decent standard. Mini bar was available though expensive compared to what you can buy from the shop. We found a LIDL a few minutes away and here you could buy a bottle of decent red wine for less than 2 euros compared to 9 euros for half a bottle in the mini bar! The hotel had a small pool which was great after a days walking (in 37 degrees!) and was rarely occupied by anyone else. The hotel was located just opposite the natural history musuem in a fairly quiet location (10 mins walk from the main hauptbahnhof rail line) but did have a restaurant or two in the immediate vacinty. We had breakfast which was nice though not much hot food choice (the bacon was always very popular and was sometimes in short supply!!). However, coffee was issued as soon as you walked through into the breakfast area and everything else was buffet and easily obtained (cereals, meats, cheeses, bread, toaster, juices and the likes). The general hauptbahnhof location was excellent for visiting the main attractions such as the Reichstag (free entrance but get there out of peak times or expect an hour wait to get in at popular times) and check point charlie, the holocaust memorial, and tiergarden etc were all just about in walking distance though the train/underground system was easy and cheap enough to use once figured out. If there are a few of you, make use of the daily group ticket for about 16euros (upto 5 people). One useful peace of information: make sure you validate your train ticket in one of the machines in good time before your train arrives. Failure to validate might land you a hefty fine and waiting till the last minute might mean missing the train as several people would often be trying to validate the ticket as the train is about to leave! All in all I liked this hotel and Berlin very much. Probably my only gripe is the hotel charged 2.5 euros for a bag of tea, coffee, sugar and milk to use which I think they could have chucked in for free!

We went with our seven month old son and it was a bonus to have a one room apartment. The hotel is in a great location, minutes from the main train station and easy to get to all the main sights. Food was good but if not your taste there was planty of resturants nearby.Will use again when we go back.", "Date": "November 15, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Adina Apartment Hotel Berlin Hauptbahnhof", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1485637-Reviews-Adina_Apartment_Hotel_Berlin_Hauptbahnhof-Berlin.html", "Price": "$110 - $441*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Platz vor dem Neuen Tor 6</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10115</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1485637", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/65/d6/17/apartment.jpg"}}
