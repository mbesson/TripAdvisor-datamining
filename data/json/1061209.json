He did a good job and to reward his efforts we stepped inside. We were also treated to complimentary baklava at the end of our meal. Now for the food. I ordered the sultana lamb and my friend the chicken kabaps. My Sultana was wonderfully displayed and delicious and my friend loved her meal as well. The only bummer was that the rice portion was so small. I think in the US we expect more of the filler and less of the meat & veggies. I had a chicken kebap this afternoon at a different restaurant and it was not half as good as the one from The Byzantium. Service was good, they had a good view, although it was hard to see at night, and the next day TJ waved to us and even remembered our names! Definitely a tourist restaurant.

When we complained we were shown 2 other rooms (again both in the annex) but if these were the dearer rooms goodness knows what a standard room was like. When I said these were unacceptable we were told if we stayed the first night in the original room we would get a better room in the morning. We did indeed get shown yet another room the next morning and although it was bigger, it was still in the annex and there was an unpleasant smell in the corridor outside the room. Not wanting to spent the rest of our short holiday trying to get a decent room we reluctantly accepted it. On the third night we were awoken by what sounded like a fire alarm. Unsure I phoned reception who said it was being dealt with and to ignore it. Although the alarm eventually stopped it intermittently sounded throughout the night and so our nights sleep was ruined. When we reported this to reception in the morning we were again assured it would be fixed. When we returned to the hotel that night the alarm again sounded but I was again assured it was being fixed. When the alarm keep sounding intermittantly I traced it to the alarm in the lift that stopped outside our room and only then did the staff admit that it was not goiung to be fixed until the following date. As this would mean another sleepless night I said it was unacceptable. The staff then offered to solve the problem by switching off power to the lift but as we were on the fifth floor and this was the only lift in the annex this was still clearly unacceptable. When I said so I was then eventually offered another room in the main part of the hotel.

The location is excellent and within seven minutes walk (slightly uphill) of the main sites. All Istanbul is hilly, but this location meant that I, with slight arthritis, was able to cope well. The outside of the hotel is deceptive and is better inside than at first glance. This is only a minor nag, but the interior can be a little gloomy when entering from the sun, so take care to remember the steps that start immediately behind the door. The reception staff are excellent, as is their English, and very obliging in every way, even allowing us free use of the computer behind the desk to check in on line when departing. The rooms are varied - we only had a standard room (204) that was appropriate for the four days we were there. When we arrived, having booked a king-size bed, we were shown two rooms and given the choice. Room 204 that we chose had two beds that soon became a king-size with no difficulty. Our only quibbles were the possible lack of drawer space for clothes, which again did not put us off as we travel very light, and the slight noises from outside. However, I am a light sleeper and my wife heard nothing.. I am sure that the suites are better equipped, so you get what you ask for. We reckon that the air-conditioning was still on a Winter setting as we had difficulty in lowering the room temperature. All these appear to be negative comments, but are really minor and did not spoil the holiday. Breakfast (7.15-10 AM) in the large dining room is very good with a wide variety of choice breads, fruit, cereals, meats, cheeses, olives, cake and Turkish Delight. The coffee (Nescaf\u00c3\u00a9) is better than many places we have visited. The choice can really set you up for the day or long morning, at least. Dinner can be taken on the top floor terrace with its marvellous view of St. Sophia and the Bosphorous, but the weather was a little cool at the time of our visit. However, the street is lined with restaurants where you can get an excellent three course meal and wine for 45 TL (around \u00c2\u00a319) or a fixed price at 15 TL (around \u00c2\u00a36.25) for a good and filling main course plus a drink. The sort of drink does vary, but is usually the choice between a Sprite/Coke-type or beer or water.

The shower though was spacious, and had good pressure to the plentiful supply of hot water. There was one drawback whilst showering. There is an open vent on the outside wall which blows very cold and icy wind on one when staying in December but the rooms were warm - too warm for us and the air-con only operated on hot. We tried sleeping with the window open but soon discovered the air con pipe work on the outside wall, although insulated, still sounded like a 707 taking off when it kicked in at 6ish in the morning - along with the \"morning call to prayers\".

I had the same rooftop view from my room anyway. The spa is chargeable, reasonable but EXCELLENT. I had a package treatment, the Hamam and a massage. The hamam is private so you can enjoy the experience in comfort. I have to confess, I was at some point out of my senses and just allowed the lady to do her thing....AMAZING. If you staying, dont miss this experience. It was my birthday treat to myself and what a fabulous one. Had one before in Antalya, but this one was way better. Also there is internet available in the spa area for guests, free of charge which is helpful. All in all, a great hotel in a lovely location, minutes away from the Blue Mosque, Haga Sophia, etc. Thank you Ms Zehra, sorry we didnt get to say Bye, and Mr Cenzig, and the wonderful housekeeping staff, always ready to assist with smiles on their face.

We repeatedly asked for help with the heating as it was spring, and warm enough to be without coats- and did not need the heat blasting in the rooms. 2) we had one small window-no ability for cross ventilation but HAD to keep it open. The location meant that we had all the smells and sounds-including people on their cigarette break and music at 5am wafting into our room. 3) We were there for 10 days, and daily asked that they not spray the room with febreeze as the combination of stuffyness and smoke was to much with perfumed spray. Every day they assured us they would cease, and every night it was clear the room had been sprayed again. The bed was not great but not terrible.

The bathroom was compact, and there was one tiny bar of soap and small bottle of white liquid with no label. We moved the next day to a bigger room, but it was not much more luxurious. The rooms are dimly lit, and the hallways are installed with light sensors, so it was always a bit dark. The walls are thin, so one can easily hear ones' neighbours. It's not a particularly inviting place to return to after a long day of sightseeing. Breakfast was simple and unchanging, with a Nescafe machine producing instant coffee, fresh bread and the standard olives, cold cuts and cheeses, whole fruit and plain yogurt. Bottom line is the service is friendly enough, the rooms are spartan but clean, and the location is excellent if you are trying to pack all of the big monuments into a short stay.
