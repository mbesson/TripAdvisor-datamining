The stairs up to third and fourth floor are Dickensian ... tiny, twisting and creaking like they would fall apart. The rooms are so tiny like a dolls house; also it was super noisy, thin walls, do not expect a quiet night. On asking to move room due to the noise from a school group which the staff tried and failed to stop, I was told there were no more rooms. On trying to leave the hotel at 11pm to find a new hotel in the neighbourhood a different staff member found me an empty ground floor, quiet large room! Also beware how you book: even if you book through this hotel's OWN website, the hotel will not deal with any complaints or requests for refunds - they will tell you it is the internet web company who deal with the booking who the customer must contact.

Eventually we were given a room and the receptionist even commented that we had \"a good room\". We were told we were in building one so off were trooped with our three cases and up two narrow flights of stairs. It was immediately obvious that the hotel was dirty and badly in need of a revamp.

All the other positives mentioned are there: situated across from tree-lined park, convenient location with Paddington station and shopping district nearby, and reasonably quick check-in. But the rest of my stay with my child was awful. I discoveed I was in a room at the top of three incredibly difficult stairways, dragging 30 kg of luggage, and no offer of help from the staff. I shouldn't have to ask - a woman travelling with a small boy and two suitcases is obviously going to need help, but the averted eyes of the staff say it all. When we got to the room eventually, it was terrible. (Unlucky room 313.) Dirty, narrow beds with stains on the sheets. (My son fell off the bed twice in five nights.) Cracked glass in picture, holes in the wall, rust down one side of the cupboard, half-done repainting of walls, stiff windows, nothing to lock up your stuff, and nowhere to put your soap and stuff in the shower. The views of the park: non-existent, because we were stuck in the wqorst room in the hotel. Some rooms don't even seem to have their own showers or toilets, but rather have shared facilities. The staff were, to put it mildly, indifferent, if not rude. At breakfast the first morning a rude blonde lady - the manager I think - demanded my breakfast card and triumphantly let everyone know that I was only having a continental, not full breakfast. When I asked the young waitress what the breakfast included, she couldn't even understand my simple question. Eventually, the manager came back, and was also quite incoherent, so we were really stuck. I asked if we could have boiled eggs, and she said only fried eggs with the English breakfast, even though the next morning there was a bowl of boiled eggs there. I asked if there was cheese available, and she replied a curt \"No.\" The butter bowls are such that customers dig their knives in to take what they need, and then, when finished, the staff simply refill the butter and put it back on the table. Incredibly unhygienic. The second morning we arrived at breakfast at 09h00, and had to grab what we could quickly because half the stuff was being cleared away as soon as possible. I decided I wasn't prepared to put up with these Nazis anymore, and we had three incredibly nice breakfasts at Paddington Station for the rest of the trip. In fact, we avoided the hotel completely doing only the most minimal stuff there. And the other customers seemed to consist mostly of 19 year old loud tourists who made an incredible noise when they returned late at night, and who clogged up the entrance and pavement every morning with no sense of manners. Budget hotel? Yes. Good value for money? A definite \"No!\" I know this is not goinmg to come out right, but I need to say it directly: the problem in London is that there are far too many foreigners in service jobs who have not been taught basic manners by their employees. They are crude, impolite, curt, impatient, and simply cannot speak simple English. I found the same in many restaurants, stores like Hamleys, and even attractions like Madame Tussaude's.

We booked in and were given a room key and told our room number then instructed to go through some doors and down stairs. There are no lifts and we had no clue where to go.

After an hour or so when we realised we couldnt do this so we went back up the tight stairway, back through 2 buildings to reception. A new person was on the desk and we asked for another room. She offered us a room for 4 people, at no extra charge so we went to check it out before accepting. It was a palace compared to the dungeon - and at no extra charge!! Very strange. Breakfast was terrible - jammed in to tables and chairs where you couldnt move and the food was just toast and a couple of cereals.

We were three adults and one child, 17 months (travel cot provided by hotel). On arrival we were booked into a room that had bunk beds and single beds in it and would not know how a travel cot would fit in. Also bunk beds will be a great hazard for your young child climbing all over them. This was on the fourth floor and the stairs were steep and narrow near the top.(Carpets near the top also looked very tired and worn) No lift at the hotel and you would find it very difficult (and tiring) to carry your pram etc upstairs. We were moved to a room on 1st floor that was more suitable (only after expressing concerns over the first room). It was comfortable, however had we paid the \u00c2\u00a3170/175 quoted directly by the hotel, we would have felt very ripped off. (Thanks Octopus Travel for your deal) They say breakfast is until 9.00am. Make sure you get there in plenty time to serve yourself, your child and time to eat as by exactly 9.00am everything is cleared away, even the cutlery, so grab what you can when you can. Staff did not appear happy if you had to ask them for something. (Some staff have limited English, which can be a problem if you need something and they don't understand) We had a comfortable night, the hotel was quiet (although can hear people walking in rooms above you), it is in a good location.

We asked for them to be changed, we were told by the receptionist to leave them on the floor, I told the housekeeper to please change them, and when we came back, those towels were on the bed, nicely arranged, wet and dirty. When I went downstairs to complain, the receptionist was angry at me because I was making her work, and of course, I never got an apology. The receptionist only gave me two towels, not 4 (we were 4 people), we were told we would have the other 2 on the next morning, which didn't happen, I had to complain again, and when the new receptionist opened the fresh towels bag, one of them was ll dirty, I mean, how is that possible? I booked 4 nights and they made my reservation for just 3, I still don't know why. This trip was my mum's birthday present from my sister and I, so you can imagine how happy we were...

The nearby hotel that I booked had to be shut down for fire exit renovations. They automatically booked me into the Shakespeare and I didn't follow up with any of my own research and just went with it. I stayed a total of 7 nights in two different rooms. First room's advantage was that it was on the first floor. I didn't mind the small accomodations or the noise from the underground. But there was some sort of sewage ventilation problem that caused sewer gases to back up into my toilet closet. I kept the door to it closed and just dealt with it that way. Another problem with this room was the windows did not lock. Bit of a safety/security concern. After traveling around the countryside and returning to London, I again stayed at the Shakespeare for 2 nights. This time my room was on the top floor which meant dragging a heavy suitcase up 5 flights of stairs. I'm a single gal and that was pretty unforgettable. I did it though. Taught me to not do so much shopping or else not travel around the countryside. The room was more bare bones than the first one. No remote for TV either. I never ate the breakfast really. I went downstairs once for it and their idea of fresh fruit was a big bowl of canned fruit cocktail. Yuck. The front desk folks were not very helpful. Their stated check in time is noon on their website. However, if you try to check in at noon they will inform you that it is by prior arrangement only and you have to leave and comeback at 2pm. That is pretty bold. It does seem like a big party place. Not recommended for families, couples, or solo travelers. Only recommended for a bunch of kids that want to party all night.

If you're booked in already but haven't gone yet, give some serious thought to switching to another hotel. This place is not a hotel, it's a hostel, pure and simple.

I had heard that London was extremely expensive and tried to find a modestly priced hotel in London. I would have liked to have stayed at a chain-type of hotel like the Sheraton, etc., but could not afford it. So I picked a hotel that I thought was priced fairly and near a tube station so that I could move about the city and see some sights. I was only staying one night as I was catching a plane in the morning to another country. I thought, \"how bad can it be, as I am only going to SLEEP there, right?\" I have to say that I was disappointed. I found that their internet site raved about how good the hotel was and showed a photograph of a very nice \"lobby?\". I don't think the lobby in the photo is actually in this hotel as I never saw it. The outside of the hotel looked extremely nice and it is in a very quaint neighbourhood, close to amenities and just around the corner from Paddington Station, which was great. There are no elevators, so I had to carry two extremely heavy bags totaling about 50kg up three flights of stairs to our room. I didn't like the idea of a shared bathroom but I thought that this was the norm in London. The bathroom was on the second floor so I had to walk to it in the middle of the night. Very bland and scary bathroom. The room itself was very bare, just two beds and an armoire-type thing that had a television. Extremely tiny room with not much room to move around in. This hotel was so nasty that on my return trip through London I chose another hotel, thinking it would have to be a better experience. Oh well, that is another review. The continental breakfast was okay, a typical english breakfast, but the dining area seemed to be located in the sub-basement, a bit of a bad location.
