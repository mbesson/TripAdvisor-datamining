First, the rooms are very basic and the furniture adequate but worn. The facility is very clean but there is no ambiance to speak of. The surrounding streets are busy and I did find it noisy at night. The bed was hard, and the blinds bent. Having said that, the room was very clean and had a wash basin, television, air conditioning, and toiletries. There was a guest booklet in the room with helpful information, and the linens included washcloths and towels that were very fresh. The womens toilet and shower area is locked and clean, so the \"shared bathroom\" was not traumatic. The hotel has public internet and laundry machines which can be used for a fee; a pay phone, and an adjacent cafe. The building is on a short, steep hill and not wheelchair accessible. It is within a block of buses (including one that will take the traveler to Victoria Harbor and the Star Ferry) and shopping that includes a Western-style grocery store. Although there are hotels and many restaurants in the area, I did not see many Westerners, so I ate, bused, and shopped among locals or Asian guests. Within walking distance are the tight, narrow streets filled with neon signs and street vendors, as well as a Post Office, McDonald's and Nathan Road. I got a discount card for the adjacent cafe but there was no breakfast plan at this facility. The front desk personnel spoke English and was efficient, even ordering an airport shuttle for me when I left. Except for the hard bed, I was very happy with my stay there and would recommend the Anne Black and the adjoining cafe for anyone who wanted the kind of experience I did, that is, to experience Asia for the first time with adequate English support but without segregating myself with Westerners.", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery good value mid rande jotel\u201d", "Author": "BooBoo007", "ReviewID": "UR131069602", "Content": "I stayed here with my 8 year old daughter in October 2010 for 2 weeks. A great choice as we were there to sight see and shop and not swoon in a hotel. The rooms were a decent size, clean and new. We had a nice little view from our room and a swim in the roof pool on occasion. Breakfast was included in our package and the standard was good. A decent choice. My only gripe was that they closed the doors about 10:00am, and as hong kong is a night life place, it's hard to be up and about by 10am as you generally sleep in. Yes the location is a bit 'up there', but my advice is utilise the taxi cabs. They're cheap and faster than the buses. It's a quieter part of town up in the mid levels and a walk through the park/zoo is a nice break and convenient. I definitely recommend this hotel particularly if you want your own room and space and are a bit beyond the whole back packer scene.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cYWCA, Hong Kong, China\u201d", "Author": "rsp103", "ReviewID": "UR129896574", "Content": "YWCA in Hong Kong China only supplies bath towels; not hand towels or wash cloths.

Clean and quiet room, very friendly staff throughout the hotel, large room. This is a fairly new and very well kept property. Taxi ride from central station downtown is HKG $23 (about USD $3) - taxi is essential to get to the hotel because it is a steep uphill climb otherwise. Breakfast buffet is very good, there is a wide selection of both Asian and Western breakfast offerings. Internet (about USD $5 a day) is sluggish, that is my only complaint. Internet service is by cable (Ethernet), bring your own cable, or, the staff at the front desk will loan you one. All in all, excellent value and a great location in Hong Kong.

Our room/apartment was large for HK, small for the US, King Bed, nice plain decoration, not a lot storage space (dont bring to many things!) small fridge, coffee maker, etc... My room had the greatest view of HK, but I saw many rooms with buildings in front. Its a great place to sleep, clean, and very reasonable for HK sizes. Very centric. I wanted to mention that beside the gym, there is a cafe run by a mental handicap association, which I found so nice. They are training young adults to be independent and find a job, so if you are visiting, you should give it a try.
