Prior to travelling, I had deliberated over several other 5* hotels right the way across Rome, but Hotel Raphael seemed to top them all in terms of budget, locale and atmosphere. It's not the most expensive 5* hotel in Rome, but you get excellent value for money if you take a double room. It could not be in a better location - being on a side street right behind the Piazza Navona and a short(ish) walk away from any of Rome's top attractions. Granted, my fiancee couldn't really stroll too far in her high heels each night, but the Raphael really is bang in the middle of it all. Which also contributes to its atmosphere. The cobbled street it sits in, right off the piazza, and the ivy-clad exterior are a slice of magic. The interior of the hotel is ever so slightly gaudy (think bright red velvet sofas/cushions and gold rope surrounds!) but it is warm and welcoming. The staff are friendly, professional and attentive (including the high-pitched, squeaky doorman). Our room was very comfortable and our stay was thoroughly enjoyable.

Great bedding and linens and fantastic air conditioning (there was a hot spell going on).

Buffet was very extensive - meats, cheeses, eggs, fresh fruit cocktail, etc. Hotel appeared to be full - but the breakfast buffet was never croweded - very professional staff. Roof bar / restaurant is wonderful - pricey drinks (8 euros for a Peroni) but an amzaing view, and again, great service. Worth every penny.

All hotels should treat their guests like this one does. lastly, and this is separate from reviewing the \"hotel\" is the location - it's perfect - directly (about 100 feet away) from the nicest Piazza in rome - Piazza Navona - perfect walkable distances to Vatican, Spanish Steps, Panthenon, Trevi Fountain.

Not big at all, but very well appointed; electric blinds; remote controlled adjustable bed, extremely comfortable; walk in wardrobe; bang & olufsen flat screen built in; lighting in the room is second to none; designer sliding screens everywhere. And the bathroom is sensational with a double walk-in shower, Bulgari toiletries plus all the usual bathroom fittings all finished to the highest standard. The room also had a small balcony overlooking the little square by the hotel entrance, very quaint and we shared a complimentary bottle of Champagne there on the first evening :) Breakfast is first class as you would expect, buffet style but everything you could possibly want and beautifully presented, even the lemon for the smoked salmon comes in a little muslin bag to retain the pips. The rooftop terrace is the major draw here, we had afternoon coffee there on the first afternoon, which was complimentary, and then dinner the second night. The views over Rome are spectacular, particularly the view of the Vatican. Food almost takes second place to the ambience, but is very good and nice sized portions too for a high end restaurant. Food & Wine is reasonably priced but beers and coffee are ridiculously overpriced, I think we paid EUR 8 +6 for a Cappuccino and Espresso. Best of all though is the location, right around the corner from Piazza Navona in the heart of the Centro Storico and so many great bars and restaurants within walking distance.Last time we were in Rome we walked everywhere, this time on honeymoon we took taxis to our starting point each morning and walked from there; the central location makes this affordable just EUR 10 to the Borghese and Terme di Caracalla, and sightseeing is not so exhausting! Staff are very friendly and helpful, they pre-booked tickets for us in advance for the Galleria Borghese and arranged a transfer to the hotel on arrival. Coming back in the afternoon after sightseeing we found bottled water and canapes in the room, a nice touch, and after dinner there's a turn down service with a little boxed chocolate each....small things but they all add up.

The hotel is well maintained and lovely. The location is perfect! The rooms are small - normal for Europe - with the comfort room being extremely small but nice large bathroom. Fine for a single, but a couple would have difficulty in such a small room. The classics are better. We also booked a Meier suite. The suite proved to be unaaceptable due to the absense of a stand up shower. Although we were told that the hotel was fully booked, the suite was changed to a smaller non Meier suite which had a shower but the air conditioning did not function! The room was changed again the next day to another Meier suite which had a shower and was lovely. Although the recovery from the issues was well taken care of and a credit was offered - we were left with the inpression that the front desk reception team would tell us things that may or may not have been completely reliable. When questioned about the rate difference on the Meier suite to the smaller classic suite - there was a comment that it was more money, which seemed unbelievable. Upon check out - we were told although there was a credit due, they would process this later and took an imprint of the card. Time will tell if the credit was applied. To be fair, the hotel was very, very nice. The breakfasts were wonderful. Amenities were excellent and the rooftop bar was lovely. There are no complaints on a technical basis. Just a nagging feeling that somehow the staff has a bit of an issue with exceeding expectations. They MET expectations but not more. For the price paid and for the Relais et Chateaux rating, we had expected a bit more. We booked and prepaid 3 rooms and a suite almost a year ago. We asked for 3 rooms be close together as there were 2 minor children in one of the rooms. We did realize the Meier room was on a different floor. The rooms were on the same floor but in 3 different corners. When asked to move them closer, we were told the hotel was fully booked. We were told that they were \"upgraded\" rooms and that is why they were not together. Not sure about that \"fact\". In fact, it turned out that there were a few \"suites\" availalble as we found out when the suite was changed 3 times. We asked for restaurant recommendations for a family with children, there seemed to be some competing ideas between the front desk and when our reservation from one was changed by another, some raising of voices was heard in the back....could it have been due to some \"kickbacks\"? I don't know......it was just a thought at the time. The bottom line - if you can get the hotel at a good price, it is a marvelous location with great amenities.

Free spa slippers always strategically placed next to daily clean white cloths on the floor for when u wake up. Rooms are so quiet and dark With the automatic drapes that you never know if it's morning or night! Location right next door to piazza navona! The hotel had Bose speakers throughout our room and in the shower (which had double shower heads!) Also, another basic was that every morning we got a new set of toiletries. That may sound basic, but another hotel which will remain unamed only gave us one nights worth of soap for four nights! Even Howard Johnson did better than that. Anyways, raphael's breakfast is a dream! Fresh food, mixed salad, crispy onion rings, fruits, cheeses, everything! The service at breakfast was amazing! Also, their beds have remote controls to recline, sit up, or elevate your feet! Again, this is worth every penny for a restful and pampered life! Thanks for a wonderful hotel.

For this goal, I could not have picked a more perfect hotel. My top priorities when choosing a hotel: Location/convenience, good internet connection, cleanliness (including linens), comfy beds. Hotel Raphael delivered on all of these things and much more. Service was impeccable, characteristic of the R&C line. The housekeeping service somehow knew when I had left and timed the cleanings (daily and turn down) perfectly. I did not get a single \"knock knock housekeeping,\" nor did I return to a not-yet-clean room once during my 6-day/5-night stay. I honestly can't remember the last time that's happened. I wish all hotels would pay attention to details like this. Reception was friendly and supremely competent. The phone didn't even ring when I pressed for the concierge -- he was already on the line and waiting to assist. When I requested an ethernet cable from reception, it arrived in less than 3 minutes. Wired internet was fast (14 min to download an episode of 30 Rock from iTunes) and free. Wireless (used the hotel lobby wifi log-in and signal) was slightly less fast, but more than adequate, and also free using the lobby's network. The room itself was clean, spacious, modern and well-lit (booked one of the Richard Meier doubles on the 3rd floor). Not a great view (facing a stone building next door), but not bad and there were 2 large windows for plenty of light. The room smelled faintly of smoke, even though it was a non-smoking room. The hallways also smelled of smoke once in a while, but it's hard to find a true non-smoking hotel in Rome. Also, the doors to the hallway weren't well insulated so I could hear people coming to and fro. Bed was two twins abutting each other to make a king -- each side was adjustable to elevate your head and legs. Insanely comfortable. One of the nicest hotel bathrooms I've seen in Europe. Toiletries were Bulgari, and the hotel presented me with a boxed Bulgari gift set upon departure. Delicious free breakfast buffet every morning -- lots of great fresh fruit, in addition to gourmet pastries, hot foods and meat. I haven't even gotten to the best part yet: Location. Hotel Raphael is adjacent to Piazza Navona, the most charming and picturesque of all Rome's piazzas, and nestled in the historic center, within a 5 minute walk to Pantheon, 10 minutes to Trevi Fountain, 15 minutes to Spanish Steps, 15 minutes to the Colosseum and Roman Forum, and less than 30 minutes to the Vatican across the bridge. I didn't realize what a huge city Rome is, so being able to walk to all the great monuments was hugely convenient. There are also a number of good restaurants nearby -- best pasta of my life next door at the renowned Santa Lucia. Around the corner is authentic Italian pizza at Focaccia. It's a 10 minute walk to Piazza Lucenzo for some of the best gelato in Rome (San Crispino and Della Palma) and a great, reasonably priced homestyle meal at Matricianella. Finally, the front desk and bellmen were a pleasure at every interaction. Very professional and helpful.

It took several phone calls to reception, and we spent one night having difficulty sleeping as it was so hot. Otherwise the rooms are very clean, with good facilities as one would expect. The staff are helpful, although there isn't the same personal touch we've experienced in other Relais & Chateaux hotels. However, I would warn any visitor away from the hotel restaurant. We visited in winter, so the roof restaurant was not open. The ground floor restaurant was empty when we arrived for dinner on a Friday evening at 8.30pm. Generally speaking, the food was overpriced. We did not receive what we would expect for \u20ac150 for two courses (including a \u20ac48 bottle of wine, which did not seem worth the money) for two people. When we ordered my wife explained she was vegetarian, and the waiter confirmed that her choices were vegetarian. An additional starter was brought, which was fish. When my wife queried this, no substitute was offered. Then the ordered starter arrived, which was supposed to be goat's cheese and mango salad. There was no obvious sign of mango, very little goat's cheese, but there were large strips of bacon. Not vegetarian. Having removed the bacon herself, my wife was faced with what amounted to a \u20ac26 pile of lettuce with a tiny amount of goat's cheese. My food was fine, but nothing special. We were simply left flabbergasted by the way in which the staff didn't seem to care about my wife's dietary requirements. The breakfast was a good buffet with lots of variety, but again the service left something to be desired. The waitress showing guests to their tables repeatedly answered the phone while doing so, and seemed extremely impersonal.

Our friends stayed on one side of the hotel and us on the other, and between us our one major concern was the exterior noise. We had lovely views but things outside on the alleys do not quiet down until very late and then the trucks roll in very early--so I'd definitely suggest interior rooms if quiet is essential.

I used to stay in the Raphael many years ago, but in recent years had switched to the Hotel Eden for reasons I don't now recall. I won't make that error again. There is no more perfect location in all of Rome. From the threshold of the Raphael you can practically look down a tiny alleyway to see Bernini's statues on the Piazza Navona. Though the P.N. is throned with tourists in the summer, in the Rapahel you feel as if they are miles away. The hotel is exquisitely private and quiet. It's covered over with green vines so it seems to magically disappear into the walls of the church behind it. Rooms are lovely, beds are perfection. Bulgari toiletries in all the baths and lovely soft robes and slippers. Stunning breakfast every morning, great fitness room for a workout. If you don't have a drink at dusk on the rooftop terrace, you'll miss one of the great views of Rome. When we arrived in Rome, the hotel upgraded one of our rooms to a large suite. The staff here is impeccable. They booked museum tours, suggested fabulous restaurants and did a multitude of things to make our stay pleasant. When we returned for our final night in Rome, they greeted us like long lost family, again upgraded us to a suite and organized everything impeccably for our early morning departure to Fuimicino.

The hotel is lovely for honeymooners, but it also works brilliantly for families. Because the Piazza Navona is right out the front door, we let the kids come and go on their own, even at night since they were only a few steps from home. From the Raphael you can walk easily to all the places worth seeing in Rome, and when you return, you are in the lap of luxury. It's not easy to become a Chateau &Relais Hotel because the standards are very high, but the Raphael meets them easily.

The manager had left us a note welcoming us and there was a bottle of chilled prosecco, canapes and a red rose waiting for us. It was such a lovely welcome. During our stay, we had breakfast in our room which was set up for us on our terrace - the food and service were faultless. We also had cocktails on the roof terrace which is a gorgeous location; the drinks were quite pricey but came with snacks. The service on the roof terrace was a little slow although it gave us chance to admire the view and relax. I feel that I need to defend this hotel, to some extent, due to the previous reviews although it should not need any defence as it is excellent.

Reception seem to visually assess you to see if you are worth fawning over i.e. an old bat in a fur coat was treated far better than us. For reference I'm a city trader - though we are not so vulgar as to flash wealth. We had a do not disturb sign on the door at 8:30pm as my wife was feeling unwell. At 9:40pm we were rudely awoken by a phone call from reception saying \"we noticed you have do not disturb on your door- do you need any fresh towels?\". We were angry and confused as the room had already been cleaned that day. There was no need to intrude on our privacy. Then, on the next day we noticed a third toothbrush which had been placed in the same glass as ours in the bathroom. It was filthy, the bristles were brown and bent. I also noticed that our toothbrushes had fluff etc on them too. I complained to reception, and they gave me two replacement toothbrushes but no apology for the health hazard in the potentially malicious use of our property and the reason for the deposit of the hotel's filthy toothbrush in the same jar. On exit, the staff were again dismissive and rude. We shall be complaining also to the hotel's parent company Relais and Chateaux. We have stayed in R+C properties in Madagascar, and found no fault.

The classic room did not have a tub, but rather a curtained shower area in the corner. The breakfast is very nice, but quite expensive. I highly recommend breakfast if included in the rate as \u20ac26 is quite high. The only minor problem that I could mention was our request for a simple restaurant. The man at the desk with the shaved head fired off a name that I misunderstood. He said it was 50 meters away and implied it was just up the street. Three days later we noticed the place and wished that he had made more of an effort to assist as it would have taken very little additional effort, but recommending restaurants may be an endeavor that they prefer to avoid.

The area is littered with small similar streets all evoking the same authentic and cosy feeling. The outside of hotel Raphael is completely covered with green climbers and right next door is a church. Upon entering you are immediately welcomed by friendly staff and this remains the same each time you walk in or out. Staff is very accomodating and makes sure everything you wish for is realized. My husband and I and our daughter of 11 stayed in room 318, a junior suite with view on to the side-street and the church. The suite was spacious with a wonderful bathroom (Bulgari products) and comfortable beds. The third bed was of the same quality as the double bed which is exactly what we had asked for. The suite also had plenty of storage space and room for luggage. A welcome snack and bottle of wine and chocolates in the evenings were part of the hotel's treats. The room could also be darkened 100% due to the special electric blinds which is probably also an asset in the summer. At the time we were there the neighbourhood was quiet and inviting. You are only a few steps away from Piazza Navona. Campo Fiori is a 5 minute walk. It takes you 15 minutes to walk to the Colloseum and about 10 minutes to the Pantheon. So actually the location couldn't be better. The hotel's first owner was an art collector and this shows in the pieces you can find throughout the hotel and restaurant. Adjacent to the lobby guests can relax and read in the library. Breakfast in the mornings is plenty and guests from all over the world will find some of their specialties in the buffet. The roof terrace is a big asset too of course. It gives you a wonderful view and you can have a drink or eat when the weather allows it. Hopefully the hotel will not become more expensive because rumour has it that next year it will be part of the Chateaux and Relais Group. One of the major points of attraction is the restaurant. Although it is a bit expensive the food is wonderful. The chef combines Italian style with his origin (Brittany in France) and his experience (restaurants in New york) and what you are served is a world of creativity. Even if you are not staying at the hotel you should eat there at least once. Complementary to the food art of the chef is the expertise of maitre Steven who is uno tresoro with a welcoming and warm personality.

It was also difficult to regulate the room temperature at night, so we were a bit warmer than we would have liked (the A/C had been turned off for the season). Despite these minor factors, the hotel was handsome and charming and the staff was universally cheery and helpful. Everyone was friendly and greeted us whenever we passed by.

This is a lovely little hotel. The staff were really charming and helpful, the situation is perfect - 1 min walk to the Piazza Navona, 10 mins to a bus stop for a sightseeing tour and probably a 20 min walk to the Vatican. In fact you can pretty much walk to any of the major tourist sights. The room was very small but you don't go to Rome to sit in your room do you?! There was a bit of street noise which meant we had to keep our window closed but we were on the first floor so maybe if you were higher up it wouldn't be so bad. The roof terrace is fantastic - having a glass of wine and watching the sun set over St. Peters was unforgettable. Only one real niggle was the cost of breakfast: 26 Euros each!!! Skip it and go around the corner (literally) to one of the many local cafes and have a expresso and a croissant and watch the world go by! GENERAL TRAVEL TIP FOR FIRST-TIME VISITORS TO ROME: This tip will save you time and money on a trip to the Coliseum - honestly, you will thank me! When you visit the Coliseum you buy a 10 Euro ticket that gives you entrance to the Palatine as well. Visiting the Forum is free. There is a simply enormous queue to buy tickets at the Coliseum so the only way to get in reasonably quickly is accept the hassle from a tour guide and join a group. This costs an extra 8 euros each but you then go through the ticket holders queue which is considerably shorter than the main one. You can then leave the tour guide and do what you want. BUT THERE IS A BETTER WAY! Approach the Coliseum from the direction of Central Rome walking down the Via Fori Imeperiali with the Forum on your right. About halfway down on the right is small turning opposite the Largo Corrada Ricci. Walk down this and you will come to an entrance gate to the Forum where there is a ticket booth from which you can buy tickets to the Coliseum and Palatine! When we went there was a queue of just two people! Buy your tickets here then carry on to the Coliseum, join the pre-paid queue and walk smugly in past everyone else!

There may be no better location than this hotel (and other hotels in the immediate area). Everything is within short walking distance.

Sheets and pillows were great but I\u2019ve seen better. LIGHTING: Lighting was fine in both bedroom and bathroom. BATHROOM/SHOWER: Bathroom was clean but had a badly chipped bathtub. Shower had very hot water if desired and good water pressure. Towels were excellent. TOILETRIES: Bulgari; the kind you want to take home. CLEANLINESS: The entire hotel and room were very clean. A/C: In room but didn\u2019t use. CLOSET SPACE: We had one of the smallest (and least expensive) rooms in the hotel. Not really enough space for 2 to unpack all items. STYLE OF ROOM: Tired. Some rooms on the hotel brochure look amazing, not ours. Although clean, it felt very old and needed updating. I am 34 and this hotel is definitely not my style and is more appropriate for those twice my age. QUIET/LIGHT: Some noise (but not much) could be heard from outside of the room (probably very common if in a good location). The room could be made pitch black during the morning sun. FOOD: Didn\u2019t eat here. Chose not to spend 25 Euros per person on breakfast. TV/INTERNET: Free wired internet in room which was fast. There are 2 computers for guests in the lobby for a charge. There is wireless in the lobby with your own computer for a charge. TV had one of the smallest channel selections we have seen in Europe but the most English stations.

We were able to walk from the Hotel to Vatican City in 10-15 minutes, to the Spanish steps in 10-15, to the Roman Forum in 20 and the Colisseum in 25 minutes. The interior of the hotel was clean and cozy. The rooms were average size for Europe and the bathroom was larger than many in Europe. The staff was very friendly, in particular the doormen/porters made us feel at home everytime we left or returned to the hotel. Rome was very friendly, felt very safe and was a great place for travelers that want to both see and live history. The only warning I'd give is that Rome is not for families with young kids or anyone that has trouble walking. Anyone planning a trip to Rome should seriously consider the Hotel Raphael. I would highly recommend it to friends and family.", "Date": "December 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "OC", "Title": "\u201cTerrific roof-top restaurant\u201d", "Author": "swissms.", "ReviewID": "UR5968898", "Content": "The hotel is well situated in a seemingly quiet street near the Piazza Navona (the heart of Rome.)

We stayed here in 2002 and liked it very much. On our floor (two) and the first floor absolutely no work had been done in the intervening years. The room we were allocated at first, 111, should be avoided at all costs. It was small ugly dark looked onto a wall and had airconditioning that was unbelievably noisy. My husband said the bathroom looked like something from a 1950s sanitorium. He went to reception and after insisting on a change we were taken to a room on the second floor. Although the decor was very dated and the room was on the small side it looked out to the Largo Febo & was light filled & the air conditioning & bathroom were ok. When we showered even with the bath plug totally removed the water came up to our ankles & took time to empty. Over the next five days we had a nice stay. The staff were very helpful. The cleaning pretty good. The roof terrace a delight. However, many guests could be heard complaining - plumbing didn't work - rooms were small. We even saw a woman crying in the hall with a staff member saying how terrible her room was how she'd been promised a change & it hadn't happened & her wedding anniversary trip was ruined. You could see staff were trying very hard to cope with people's disappointment.

We can definitely say this because we booked four (4) rooms at the hotel Raphael. We just recently returned from Rome and spent four nights with our family of 8 in this hotel. This is the second time we've booked this hotel and the staff service, room accomodations and maintenance have deteriorated tremendously since the first time we where here three years ago. Needless to say, we had problems in all four rooms from the start. All of our rooms were tiny. One of the rooms had the smell of a permanent sewer and the A/C did not work at all. We tried to get the hotel staff to change this room and they were least bothered with it. Then we tried to get them to fix the A/C and remove the sewer smell coming from the bathroom, and after three days, it was never fixed. This was specially unbearable if you are in Rome in the middle of July. One of the rooms had a bathroom that flooded every time you took a shower and the other two rooms had bathrooms so small that your chin hit the sink each time you sat in the toilet. Another annoyance is the lack of mirrors in the bedroom. It was difficult to put on makeup if there are two people standing in the bathroom. The hotel hallways were not air-conditioned either. Every time we walked out of our rooms, it felt like we were hitting a sauna. Another big minus is that their drinks (OJs and cokes) in their rooftop terrace are very expensive. We had no alcohol and the bill for 8 came to over $100 euros! Breakfast was also outrageously priced at $52 euros per room considering the poor selection in food. The only plus to this hotel is its location next to Piazza Navona and the comfortable pillows. However, we could not overlook the bad service and lousy rooms for the high price we paid.... we certainly would NOT got back or recommend this hotel to anyone...!", "Date": "July 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cDidn't know what to expect...\u201d", "Author": "blndzhvmrfn", "ReviewID": "UR5351841", "Content": "After reading the recent reviews posted on this site, we really did not know what to expect from the Hotel Raphael- other than a great location.

We had stayed in the neighborhood before and thought we knew the area but the concierge made several nice recommendations for dinner that we would have never found otherwise. The staff was not anoyingly attentive but very responsive and that is the way we like them to be - not too obtrusive. The only negative was the 50 euro breakfast which we chose not to include with the room. That was easily remedied with tea and pastries at a local cafe. One suggestion - eat dinner at the completely romantic roof top restaurant!

It was a great location from which to see the sights of Rome. My husband and I stayed there for 8 nights in May. We had never been to Rome and chose the hotel mainly for its location. We were able to walk everywhere, from the Vatican to the ancient sites of the Forum and Colosseum, Piazza Popolo, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Campo di Fiori and Trastevere. We were able to get back every afternoon in time for an afternoon refreshment at Tre Scalini on Piazza Navona -- great for people watching. Good local restaurants within walking distance that were not terribly expensive were La Fiametta, Il Buco, and Teatro di Pompeo. The Hotel Raphael was very expensive as hotel rooms seem to be in Rome, but we were able to get somewhat of a deal through Expedia. Our room was fairly spacious, which I have heard is unusual in Rome. We had a separate sitting area from the alcove where the bed was. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was good-sized, with a tub and a rainfall-type shower, which worked great. Our room was at the end of a hallway on the 2nd floor (their third above the street) and was very quiet the entire time we were there. The room was spotlessly cleaned every day and there was turndown service most nights. They have a restaurant that serves breakfast, but we didn't eat there because it was very expensive (over 20 euros per person), choosing instead to walk to Cafe Eustacchio near the Pantheon for coffee and cornetti, which is reputed to have the best coffee in Rome. We would agree. There was only one major glitch in our stay. We had prearranged transportation through the hotel's concierge from the airport to the hotel for our arrival, which I had re-confirmed via-email before arrival. There was no one waiting for us at the airport, so I had to buy a phone card and call the hotel. The young man who answered the phone, Fabio, showed no record of our transportation arrangements, but he quickly arranged for someone to pick us up. Unfortunately, the man who picked us up spoke no English and did not know where the hotel was. We tried to help with our maps and rudimentary Italian, and he stopped and asked for directions three times. We finally made it. Fabio at the front desk was our \"go-to\" guy the whole time were there. He spoke excellent English and was very helpful whenever we had questions or requests. They have internet service in the lobby that was out of commission for three days of our stay, but Fabio graciously offered use of the hotel's computer if we really needed it. All in all, I would recommend this hotel as a place to stay.

We were told by Domonic (who was very arrogant) that it would be fixed the following day and that there was nothing he could do for us b/c once the hotel found out that it was our honeymoon the upgraded us to a classic room.

Additionally, the hotel failed to notify us that they are in the midst of construction. Unfortunately, our room was 2 rooms over from the construction and the first 2 days, we got almost no sleep. The rooms, without construction are loud, with ample street noise, noise from the front desk and noise from the restaurant. If you plan on staying here, I recommend not staying on the first floor (definitely not rooms 116 or 118). The front desk was not sympathetic to the noise problem, which was extremely disappointing. The hotel is located at Piazza Novana which is a great area to stay, away from the commercial aspects of the Spanish Steps, but close enough to all the main attractions, though there is no Metro stop nearby.
