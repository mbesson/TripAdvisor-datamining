Pointless to list all the reasons as if my comments so far are not helpful then take your chances :-) The building work was not an issue either , It probably masked the state of the place with its ingrained neglect. It was quite refreshing to once go back in time to a place were health and safety was flouted with such regard as a 1950,s Turkish jail .. Breakfast included is funny and I was at least amused at the stretch of the term \u00a0\" continental \".....!!!! Toast and jam with cereal in a bunker which hardened truck drivers might think a tad tacky. And the addition of yogurt pots happily fermenting on a table in a hot room made me consider the only thing missing would be a poorly tummy to make this visit complete :-) On a positive note it did have all the windows in and a newly opened toilet roll.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cGood service\u201d", "Author": "45-nomad", "ReviewID": "UR124175932", "Content": "Having stayed at several hotels on this street, this one has a good size washroom (not one of those all in one toilet/shower/sink rooms).

Although perhaps there is still some finishing touches to be achieved. The room was recently decorated with a new bathroom, and although small, was perfectly adequate. That being said, it was big enough to swing a cat! The windows were velux, so there was no great view but plenty of fresh air. A hairdryer was provided along with tea and coffee (only powdered milk unfortunatly). We didn't attend breakfast so can't comment on whether that has improved also.

On going up to the room I then learned that the hotel was in refurbishment and had to climb over lots of items left in the hallways and was not made aware that the hotel was in refurbishment. I then asked the cleaner for the key - and she just let me in - and didn't even give me a key. Then the room, the room was very small - width - just fitted 2 single beds across - the length - about 1.5 meters filled up with a refrigerator and small wardrobe - no storage space for bags - i had to put my suitcase in the small wardrobe to ensure i didn't fill up the floor space (the suitcase totally filled the wardrobe). On arrival into the room - we found a chocolate bar still in the desk drawer and we found we had no milk in either the fridge or on the side by the kettle. I then asked for milk - the response was 'in a minute' and then i was given coffee Whitener! it was then I went to the shop and bought my own fresh milk and coffee. The fridge took up space and inadvertently heated up the room. The shower and bathroom size - couldn't even stretch 2 full arms out anywhere without hitting the side walls. We went out for 1 hour and came back and I asked for a key to my room which i had not yet received and he reluctantly gave me a spare key to the room that I had paid for. I then got ready to go out and see Mamma Mia. I asked for an ironing board - the response was - 'in a minute' and I was then given an ironing board with NO cover and the board could barely fit in my room and a very cheap iron that was scoldered and not very good. I resorted to using a towel as a iron board cover. On day 2 of the stay we decided not to have breakfast due to the cleanliness and poor service attitude of the hotel. We went out all day and came back to find that our bins were not emptied - bedding not changed and towels not changed and no cleaning had taken place. After the 2nd night and checking out in the morning we were allowed to leave our bags in holding - we came back to our bags on departure for London to find that the hotel voluntarily moved our bags from an unsecured lobby in the hotel into another unsecured lobby in the hotel and the owner didn't apologise for the temporary discomfort that we faced as a result of speculating that our bags may have been taken or moved without our permission. As you can see - there are very little opinions here - I have included as many facts here in order for you to know what happend in the hotel. My opinion is - that many BASICS here were not covered, milk, ironing board, customer service, bin clean, towels, bedding, clean room etc etc.... seemed like when they had my money - That was it - get it yourself! - that's my opinion to which I WILL NOT be judged on this trip advisor review.

The shower and toilet cubicle was 'tired' and not to clean, the shower curtain was hanging from 3 or 4 hooks that did not slide, but, when we went to shower this was not a problem as there was no COLD water at all, only very hot. So only a strip wash from the basin after the water had cooled enough to dip your hands in. The breakfast was plentifull, fruit juice, loads of toast and jam's, only a choice of 'cornflakes or cornflakes' and plenty of tea or coffee. The breakfast room was so small that when we left other guests were sat on the stairs waiting for the next empty table. So if you want really cheap and cheerfull, go for it. It was the first 'cheapie' for me and will be my last.", "Date": "January 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGross\u201d", "Author": "Scaldy", "ReviewID": "UR12321556", "Content": "When booking I knew it wasn't going to be fancy but I expected it to be at least clean. The staff were very friendly and it's ideally located right beside Victoria Station. Our room looked fine on first glance but then I realised the carpet looked like it hadn't been hoovered in 5 months and when I had a shower it hadn't been cleaned. I had the delight of showering in a shower with pubic hair all over the walls. The shower head was fixed to the wall so I couldn't wash the hair away.The plug hole was completely blocked (by what I suspect were more pubes) which meant it over -flowed all over the bathroom floor. The pole on which the shower curtain hung was completely lopsided so I couldn't pull back the curtain without it sliding back. Needless to say I didn't have another shower for the remainder of my stay. If the room had been cleaned initially there wouldn't have been any problems. It's a shame as the staff were most pleasant and helpful.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Lidos Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d261738-Reviews-Lidos_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$141 - $265*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">45 Belgrave Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW1V 2BB</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "261738", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/25/cb/25cbeaec18e64f1cfc298276b33c97d62large.jpg"}}
