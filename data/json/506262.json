As others have mentioned here, the bed sheet thing is ridiculous. The bed is made of vinyl and since the sheet doesn't cover the whole bed, your feet are on the bare, sticky vinyl bed. The whole room was covered in a layer of mold. The smell was godawful. We had a sore throat by the end of the night. The wallpaper was moldy, the roof was moldy, the air coming out of the aircon was moldy. The sink emptied out onto the bathroom floor. Huge families of 6 were staying in one room all over the place and they ran in and out of each others room the whole night, slamming doors. The fire alarm went off because someone was smoking in their room. We saw a dead cat, a fight between a man and woman (fist fight) and a bleeding man laying on the sidewalk all in the span of 6 hours. All for a fantastic bargain of $65 SGD!

Either way, I made a number of visits to Singapore solely for the purpose of obtaining a visa for Thailand and each time I went to the country, and after choosing this hotel just once, I've consistently chosen it time and time again. Why? Well, I guess one of the main considerations was that it's rather close to the Kallang MRT and thus makes for easy access to public transportation when one wants to go into the main city part like Orchard Rd, or any other main areas of the city. If one doesn't mind walking about 15 minutes, they can reach this MRT station and from there, access the rest of the city and the other train lines. (I always found this to be beneficial while staying there). Yeah okay, as I discovered, it is sort of located in the red light district but as another person had mentioned on a recent review, it's not like people are touting you in the area and I always enjoyed going to this location whenever I go to Singapore. The rooms are a little small but that's okay as I usually only need the basics and am not one who needs all the amenities. Whew! The AC runs quite cold though and found myself having to turn it off at time since the room sometimes had a tendency to become a little bit of an ice box. Otherwise, I really couldn't complain about the hotel and thought it to be perfect for my trips. There's also two 7 Elevens close by if one does not want to buy or eat at some of the food stalls that open up in the evenings (or if they just want to go and grab something to eat or drink). Overall, a great hotel for value, price and location, and would gladly stay there again should I travel to Singapore again sometime this year.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila", "Title": "\u201cMay Be An Acceptable Option for Budget Travelers\u201d", "Author": "ReluctantDrifter", "ReviewID": "UR120557423", "Content": "In choosing a hotel to stay at, especially when traveling on a budget with hubby and 2 grownup kids, i usually consider three important things. One- should have earned generally good reviews, two- rate per night for a family room and three- proximity to the nearest transport station. In the case of Singapore, it should not be more than 10 mins walk from MRT. Hotel 81 Orchid satisfies all of the above. It is rated average 3 star by reviews on TripAdvisor. That's good enough for me. Amongst hotels I've shortlisted (which isn't many) it has relatively the cheapest rate for a Family Room. Of course, at a rate of SGD 120 nett per night, I was not expecting luxury. As long as the room has the bare essentials - a clean bed to retire to after a long and tiring day, a toilet that is well maintained, with strong running hot/cold water and clean towels, it will serve its purpose for 3 nights. Well, I later found out that the simple expectations I've set still turned out to be quite an \"overrating\". As soon as you enter the small lobby, it smells of mildew. There was even a time, one evening, coming back from Sentosa, it smelled like cockroach (though i didnt see any crawlers, thank goodness!). Our check-in was efficiently handled though, by a friendly male chinese staff in specs (i'm poor at remembering names). The Family Room is also small, old and cramped up. It is practically 2 connecting rooms, with a curtain instead of the usual door in between. It has 2 bathrooms which are so narrow that you can wash your hair under the shower while sitting on the toilet! It was fairly clean but not all corners. One towel was a bit greyish white and has threads falling off its edges so badly that it looks more like tassels (that evening, i bought medium towels from Tangs). The masters room has one queen sized bed, the other has 2 single beds, which were firm and comfortable. The linens were crisp and clean. The fluffy pillows covered in soft cotton gauze like pillow cases. There was a mini fridge, so mini that it's as low as the bed, has rusted hinges and not plugged in. Instead, we used it as a night table and placed a few things atop it. There was also tea/coffee making facility, hair dryer. There was an LCD flat screen TV on each room with one DVD player - though without remote controls. Hotel 81 Orchid, like most of its hotels, provide accommodations only and does not have any F&B outlet. It does have room service, but i'd rather not try it. We had, however, complimentary access to wifi in our room during the entire stay. They say its near the red light district, but it didnt bother us because we didnt go out at nights. The area nearest the hotel is relatively quiet and has lots of local eateries a block away. The nearest MRT station is Kallang, which is less than 10 mins walk from the hotel. If you're too tired to walk back, a cab costs SGD 3.60. If you're a budget traveler, perhaps you may want to consider other hotels. Although I've only seen the Family Room, so this review may not reflect the condition of all rooms. If what matters to you is a place to stay at night and would rather spend your money on shopping, eating, Sentosa and USS, then Hotel 81 Orchid may be an acceptable option.

Location is good, near to major shopping areas and not too far from the Universal Studios, Casino, Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and the likes. Easily accessible by buses, taxi, and MRT. Changi Airport is about 25 minutes away during non-peak hours. Food is a plenty nearby if you are an Asian and cheap too. At that budget price, the hotel still comes with coffee and tea making facilities, tooth brush and hair and body shampoo c/w a hair dryer (if it is working). There are quite some hookers around Lor 8 and; they do their business and you do yours, unless you choose to patronise them. There are no hookers around at the lift and front counter areas as these most primitive trade practioners go to seperate hotel rooms (not rented to ordinary guests, I think) via a door located at the back of the building with a condom vending machine behind the entrance door. Well-researched, uh? So don't worry about you having to share lift with hookers and their customers. Again, I would like to say that if you are budget-conscious and don't mind staying in the red-light area, then this hotel is a good choice. One shortfall of this hotel was that the fire-alarm would give false alarm in the middle of the night and PA announcements would be annoyingly repeated tens fo times to wake you up only to find out there was no fire nor smoke. I guessd this must be due to some idiots smoking in the rooms and have the smoke-detectors triggered.

Same thing with the towels - they were small and very, very thin. - You had to put your key into a slot to turn on the power when you got in. However, since the room was so small and the air conditioning was powerful and worked well, it always stayed very cool. - The bathroom must have been about 3.5 feet by 3.5 feet. The bathroom is essentially the shower, as when you shower, everything in the bathroom gets soaked. The bathroom did not have a fan, so everything in there is wet all the time.

We found it very conveniently located to the metro station. We also never had any problems catching cabs on the main road (Geylang Road, I believe), and the cabbies always used their fare meters instead of haggling for a price (a nice change from other countries, such as Malaysia and India). - No bugs or insects. Our only slight 'gross-out' in the room, as noted earlier, was that the ceiling above the bed seemed to be peeling off and hanging down, though nothing was actually falling off onto the bed. - Very cheap. In sum, the price is right, getting around was easy enough with the metro and cabs. Just don't expect much else - very, very no frills.

The fire alarm went off twice in the 3 nights we were there. Reception explained when the bedrooms were made non-smoking the smoke detectors were made very sensitive, so management would catch anybody smoking in their room. Whenever somebody lights up, everybody gets woken up. Guests are advised not to evacuate when the alarm starts, but to get ready and only leave if told to do so, this seems dangerous to us. We always use the de-luxe room, which has a wardrobe and fridge, so is suitable for a longer stay. Unfortunately it's next to the lift, so corridor noise can be a problem. Room maintenance is poor. Our washbasin drain had broken, then was repaired with tape, which broke again. Water flooded the floor every time we washed. They were unable to do any repairs during our stay because it was Chinese New Year. However we've known worse, and soundproofing between rooms is very good. Until the fire alarm became a serious problem, we considered it the best option in Singapore, and the low cost made long visits affordable.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cWell what do you expect?\u201d", "Author": "uktraveller1949 Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR56736728", "Content": "I needed one night close to the airport so decided to try a budget hotel.

But it was clean albeit a little rundown, mould on the sink sealant, cracked wall tiles, very slow drain in the basin. And the room was a little musty smelling. At about SG$50 it was probably not bad, but certainly not upto the Travellodge standard for UK visitors.

Hotel location is almost near the train station(kallang), it was a quite a walk, I suggest you take the bus, going to the nearest MRT station its more convinient. Get a Singapore tourist MRT card it is very handy to have one. The \"girls\" outside the hotel area gives the hotel periphery more spunk and character, a sad reality though, you just feel sorry for the girls. Local food outlets in the Geylang area stays open practically 24/7. Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this hotel.
