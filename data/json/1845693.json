The service was flawless. The afternoon tea was replenishable but I really couldn't fit anything else in! So don't have lunch before you do this! I also went to the Fullerton Hotel for afternoon tea a few days later - it was quite nice but not up to the standard of the Fullerton Bay.

Fullerton Bay hotel is beautiful,contemporary, and you are in the heart of business district. The view from our room and balcony is stunning,the room luxurious,amenities excellent, & service & staff provided more then expected. We couldn't help but compare the two hotels and our heart kept coming back to the stay at Fullerton. The whole atmosphere and ambience of the hotel was something we felt fitted us. Maybe its the small scale,the openness,the water,the views? Both properties are ultra-luxurious- you have to decide which area you rather be in. Mr Giovanni Viterale is doing a great job with his staff and we hope it stays at this level when we return. Pool area- outstanding but seating will only accommodate under 30 people,never was full though Breakfast Buffet $50 per person was outstanding and couldn't wait to wake up to go eat!

Little details that did not cut it for me at this level are: - plastic glasses at the rooftop bar (unacceptable considering the price level and the drinks served -champagne, premium wines and cocktails-) - pool stairs deliberately blocked by customers in their lounge chairs (to avoid passage near them). The staff saw this and did not address it (a pregnant woman had to \"jump\" from the side of the pool to get out) - TV not working during the second day; never solved despite gentle request in the morning - main bar is quite gloomy and looks like a hallway - no fresh juice proposed at breakfast; not-fresh-from-the-day breakfast baguette", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "Andymill71", "ReviewID": "UR127893976", "Content": "This is a great hotel in a fantastic location.

The hotel amenities and rooms are beautifully designed (providing that you like modern architecture), the location is central to the Financial District (I was travelling on business) yet also next to the Marina District with its many shops and restaurants, and the service was friendly and helpful (though hardly a unique attribute for high-end Asian hotels.) The rooms and bathrooms are of adequate size though certainly not generous. They are well appointed and, with floor to ceiling windows, offer fantastic views of the Marina. A nice fruit plate was waiting in the room (though it was not replenished during my six night stay which is often the case in other high end hotels) and there was lots of bottled water that was replenished daily. The Bose docking station was a nice touch. There was a good desk and chair in the room, which was important since this was a business trip. The hotel's location is excellent if you are here solely on business or a combined business/pleasure trip. While there is lots to do around the Marina area, it is relatively new and still has a bit of a sterile feeling. (I stayed at the St. Regis on Orchard Road before my meetings started and there is much more vibrancy up there.) Be sure to watch the nightly laser and water show over by the Marina Bay Sands Hotel; you can see the show from the roof deck of the FBH but it is a 10X better experience watching it from the other side. There are 10 or so restaurants within a couple of hundred meters of the FBH: the ones I went to were adequate but nothing stood out. My rate include internet and breakfast. Both were first rate. The Internet was easy to access, connectivity was excellent and download speeds were pretty good. The breakfast buffet was also excellent, with lots of fresh fruit, both Asian and North American hot dishes, pastries, cereal, and a fresh omelette bar. All this sound pretty good so why not five stars? Despite all these pluses, there were several, albeit relative minor, issues that tarnished the hotel's shine. 1. Room service food was very disappointing. I had lunch twice, selecting an Asian option both times, and I was delivered a meal on par with what one would find in a North American food court. Both times the meal came quickly (about 15 minutes) so I suspect that they keep prepared menu items in warming trays. Anyway, avoid room service unless you are really desperate. 2. The food at the Lantern Restaurant on the roof top deck was also mediocre. (I hear the Clifford is quite good but after three pretty crummy meals at FBH, I did not want to pay up for a meal from a team that has a pretty lousy track record.) 3. I called for a laundry pick up. They forgot. Fortunately, I was here for another couple of nights so it was not a problem waiting another day for it to be done. (Laundry is very expensive, though not out of line with other high-end hotels charge.) 4. There was a problem with the light beside the bed: a wiring malfunction that caused one light to flicker even though it was turned off. I asked to have it checked and was assured on my return that it had been taken care of. I turned the lights off that night and the light started to flicker again. Normally I would have just unscrewed the bulb but access was restricted by screws. I called down at 10:00 pm (I was still jet lagged and just wanted to go to sleep) and had to wait 30 minutes for them to deal with it. This is a reasonable waiting period but it should have been fixed the first time I asked. 5. The pool is beautiful. Unfortunately, the are only 8 loungers (and no chairs) around the pool. There are also 3 shaded \"pods\" near by. Whenever I went up to the pool, there was no place to leave my stuff because the 11 places available were all taken. The roof deck area is first and foremost a bar/restaurant and the pool is sadly nothing more than a water feature. This was just a bad design decision. 6. The gym is small and poorly equipped. 7. The rooms are already starting to show some wear and tear. Most noticeable are the hairline cracks in the bathroom sink and the poorly fitted closet doors. Management is going to need to stay on top of these areas or the hotel will run down quickly. Bottom line: Don't get me wrong, this is a great place to stay. However, management needs to up its game if they want to maintain their reputation as one of the best hotels in Singapore.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moonta Bay, South Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel and service\u201d", "Author": "moontatravellers", "ReviewID": "UR127000319", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Fullerton Bay for three nights in March this year as a stopover on the way home from Malaysia. The hotel is faultless, from the doorman to check in and personal escort to our room everything was friendly and professional. As it was our wedding anniversay whilst we were there upon arrival at our room there was a chilled bottle of Moet, fresh fruit, cakes and chocolates with a personal card from the Management wishing us a happy anniversary. What a lovely surprise and it didn't stop there. The breakfast in the gorgeous Clifford restaurant was fantastic, great array of food covering many nationalities and if something wasn't there you wanted they would make it for you. My tip is ask for Eggs Benedict with the smoked salmon - to die for! Nora is a great hostess there and even organised a surprise desert for us when we dined at the Clifford on the night of our anniversary. The hotel is spotless and the room facilities and decor were second to none. We had a Premier Bay View Room with a large deck and loungers looking straight over the water to the Marina Bay Sands. Perfect spot to view the nightly laser and music show whilst sipping some fine Champagne. The bed was very comfortable and the robes were so luxurious that I bought one to take home. We had a late night flight home and although we had to check out by 12 noon the hotel kept our bags safely locked away for us until we were ready to leave. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, they were really well trained but very friendly as well.

It's a lovely hotel as so many guests have already written here and certainly one of my Singapore favourites. I loved the beautiful materials in my sea view room and the bathroom and the common areas are very stylish as well. I enjoyed the room service meals and I found the breakfast quite nice and both had items suitable for vegetarians as well. Maybe the menus could be more varied in thet respect. The pool is best for grown up lap swimmers, which I appreciated. However, the pool area is my main complaint about this hotel. Funnily enough it's a bar area in the evening and there are too few shaded loungers and any proper loungers at that. The loungers are at ground level so if you have any knee/ back etc problem you'll find it terrilbly difficult and not at all flattering to get up from your lounger. Most of these loungers are \"in the pool\" and without any shade. Who wants to fry herself in the sun these days? All in all the area seems more designed to twenty somethings, altough the clientele seemed more middle aged to me. The pods are nice, but there are only a few of them. An other smaller issue I want to mention is the air con controller in the room that is very difficult to manouver without any instructions, it went straight back to really warm. The former applies to the balcony lock as well. If these issues could be made better this would be a wonderful hotel and in my opinion one of the best in SIN .", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAll Class\u201d", "Author": "easy1153", "ReviewID": "UR126376688", "Content": "My wife and I had a 3 nightstop over in Singapore in March 2012 after a break in Malaysia.

From the moment we arrived at the entrance to be met by checkin staff and personally escorted to our bay view room we knew we had made the right choice. The Fullerton Bay is a small hotel (100 or so rooms) in a suberb location close to excellent Singapore transport options. We had a bay view room (311) that gave an excellent front row seat for the light show from the hotel across the bay. The hotel design is nothing short of stunning with a 'wow' at every turn. Having said that, it is still intimate and you can feel comfortably at home...a neat trick. From the rooftop pool and Latern bar to Landing Point and Clifford restaurant this place is all class.

The first room they had put me in a twin bedded room. Yes it was for single occupancy except on the last night but they had not distinguished between single and double occupancy when selling me the room so this was rather cheeky and after I had got used to the sprawlingly big bed at MO I didn't think I would be super comfy here. I had arrived at 7pm and the staff on duty at the time handled things a little clumsily in my view. My experience of the difference in service between here and my last hotel was immediate. Perhaps its to be expected of a younger hotel like the FB but its place at the top of many reviews had also made me expect more efficiency and finesse from the staffs handling of problems. Other than the twin bedded aspect this room on the 5th floor was perfect and my subsequent room transfers left me wishing I had stuck to the original notwithstanding a more restricted bed space arrangement. I was moved to a lower floor even though I had specifically requested a high floor in my booking. I suppose the issue here was that there are only 5 floors to the hotel! But I would have thought that a high floor request usually indicates a preference for quietness away from the noise on the street etc. This was especially relevant since the second room I was given was facing Customs House (a collective of bars and restaurants) which is open until 2am most nights- not great noise factor for a light sleeper. Even worse was the strong musty smell pervading the 3rd and 4th floors not only in the corridors but also in the rooms. I note that other reviewers have mentioned this. Its a real problem which the hotel so far refuse to even acknowledge which doesn't help matters. So I was moved to a third room which had been freshly sprayed with air freshner and by now it was 8.30pm and it was a case of settling for this room or cancelling my plans for later that evening. The room itself was the most spacious and beautifully appointed room and I was told that all rooms are the same other than the floor they are on and the outlook which determines their category. The entire hotel is quite stunning if you appreciate the Starck/ New Design style. The only room I stayed in which has this wow factor is at the Viceroy Miami but generally its not easy to find a standard category of room in any hotel across the world of this calibre. I think the FB has just won the best rooms category in Conde Nast also and it is well deserved. It has the highest ceilings, huge mirrors and floor to ceiling windows giving the room such a great boost of natural light. The room at MO, Singapore was too deep to catch all the light and the ceilings much lower so it wasn't a great room to spend alot of time in. The FB rooms even have a smoking/ sun balcony as standard. Its a great feeling to stay at a hotel that is so generous in its allotment of space to its guests in this way. Bathroom was also spacious with walk in shower and huge bath. The bathroom amenities were the new range of MB (or specially designed for Asia) but had just too much perfume in to use generously. Housekeeping was minimalist and not the best. Towels were of a cheap (hard) quality for this category of hotel. The lighting in the bathroom and bedroom was perfect. The entertainment system was modern and easy to use. The gym is modern but tiny and poorly equipped but (perhaps for that reason) no one seems to use it. There was no bottled water in the gym which was surprising- just old jugs of water with orange bits- looked unappetising. The pool is on the top floor with the Lantern Bar set around it. The latter is always busy so if you like to swim with privacy in mind you won't get it here. Having said that it does create a very nice hang out area in the day and night and bar staff are especially friendly and welcoming. Like many new design hotels the FB has an 'uber-cool' reputation amongst the locals and yes it does have the wow factor that MO lacked. This makes it special especially for the younger crowd. But I have not yet come across a hotel which balances the service versus cool factors together perfectly. It seems one always comes at the expense of the other! But if you have any suggestions otherwise please contact me as I always like to keep informed. Breakfast was a big disappointment- the fruits were not the best quality and the range was small. They should serve freshly squeezed juices as standard where the fruit is available in such abundance instead of having to make a special request for it at breakfast! Ofcourse I would probably have not said this had I not had breakfast at MO for 6 mornings previously but I was not paying that much less here so it could be fair to expect the same. The breakfast room itself was a great space, light and airy although not many nooks and crannies for those seeking a more secluded breakfast experience. Taxis were normally easy to get since the FB is off the highway and they can be flagged down quickly. Infact the location of the FB is very nice as you can easily walk to many bars, restaurants, and right by the waters edge. If you walk over the bridge connected to outside of the hotel you reach Raffles Place with its boutiques and nice cafes or catch the MRT. Its in the Financial District and you can sense this as you go out in the daytime. I would have given FBH 5 stars but for the variable service, the underwhelming breakfast and the odour in the hotel- since it ticks many boxes for an otherwise great stay. The rooms are the best choice if you are working indoors in the day so I would definitely consider staying here again if they could do something about the musty smell.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prague", "Title": "\u201cSingapore rising star\u201d", "Author": "Bimbo37", "ReviewID": "UR125795894", "Content": "Small hotel on Singapore measures, true five star.

We arrived at night at this hotel. We were greeted with friendly staff and had our luggage taken care of promptly. The staff kindly guided us to the reception table where we checked in for our room. To my surprise, Ifa the reception staff, guided us to the lift and all the way to our room, as well as explaining all the room's amenities. Usually in other hotel, we had to find the room ourselves, but this time it was different and I think it's a nice touch and personalised service that the same receptionist who checked you in also show you the room. My wife and I really like the bed and pillows at this hotel. It's really comfortable and we really had a good sleep every night. Bathroom is pretty standard although we feel they should make more room on the bench in bathroom to put our toiletries instead putting an oversized sink. We love the fact that our room has free wireless internet access and all the power point in the room already had international adapter built in it. So you do not need international adapter to connect to your room power point. Sadly, during one night of our stay, we had an inconsiderate neighbour from room above us who decided to turn up house music at his room around 23:35 and had a loud chatter on their balcony. We called the duty manager to complain about the disturbance and within 10 - 15 mins the noise subsided significantly. Our recommendation for this hotel is to prohibit any loud music or chatter on private balcony after 22:30, because it really disturbs other hotel guests. There was one particular incident that made us really impressed with Fullerton Bay personalised service. While we were waiting for our pick up to the airport at hotel lobby, the handle on my wife new luggage suddenly just broke apart. She just purchased that luggage 2 days ago at Marina Bay Sand. We frantically try to find a replacement luggage and we were running out of time before our pick up arrive. Fortunately the concierge team noticed our dire situation and in particular, Deborah, offered us, herself, to take the broken luggage to Marina Bay Sand and get it exchanged with new luggage. Of course we had to pay for her taxi return trip, but her prompt assistance really help us a lot and in no time she came back with new luggage so we didn't miss our flight back to Australia.

BUT NOT at Fullertonbay Hotel ....... the porter and the concierge were very efficient and very very polite . Top points to them . I had a voucher for a free nights' stay at the Hotel from AMEX . The reception checked me into a Cityfacing room based on the package . I had a preference for a Bay facing room , the front desk staff were very very friendly and professional , they were happy to move me into the room of my choice at a nominal fee . I accepted their offer ..... and believe me it was money VERY WELL SPENT . They gave me a room on the 6th floor , and with a view to the Bay . The room was MOST Modern and exquisite . It came with a small balcony which overlooks the Bay ... It is a great view and to add to it .... it also allowed us to watch the MBS light show in the night. The Toilet and toiletteries were excellent Porter and Concierge : Very good Reception : A young Japanese man checked us in and he was very very efficient and professional . Not overly friendly , but just right .. made you feel comfortable and at the same time did his job effectively . Poolside Staff : As we walked out of the lift on the Pool Level , we were greeted by a friendly hostess , who i believe was part of the restaurant / bar they operate there , but she made an effort to introduce the area and locatio of towels etc to us Pool : Looks compact when you first see it , but once you jump into it ..... its perfect Open air Jacuzzis by the pool : Very well built , providing sufficient privacy due to the hedges planted around it , open on one side giving you a view of the sea . The only constraint ..... they have built a walking path on the open side of the jacuzzi , so while we were in the pool one elderly gentleman just strolled by and was taking pictures of the sea view with his back to us. Not realising that we were in a jacuzzi in the back ..... but making my wife a bit concious , since it has a glass front . He was surprised when he saw us and smiled and moved on Housekeeping : At check in , we requested an extra bed to be brought to us at 830pm . When it was 830pm i was thinking whether they would remember my request or i will need to remind them . But just after 830pm , there was a knock on the door. The man who came to layout the extra bed was efficient and friendly Lantern : Nice place to chill out in the late evening with a glass of wine and light snack , on day beds or regular tables or high stools at the bar.

It had large bay floor to ceiling windows and boasted an infinityJacuzzi on the patio. This jacuzzi is perched over the water and enjoys stunning, stunning view of the Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore skyline.

Its location on the bay opposite the Marina Bay Sands and next to the CBD makes it an ideal watering hole for itinerants visiting Singapore, be they tourists or business types. The hotel is small enough to be classed as boutique: its shiplike steel and glass design sits on top of an old pier from the days before land reclamation overlooking the newly created bay. The rooms are architect/ designer uber cool, complete with glassed in bathrooms, sliding glass doors, waterfall showers, electronically operated curtains and unfathomable electronic light switches. They feature every amenity: Nespresso machines, iPod docks, international power sockets, and free WiFi. Our room was on the ground floor and had a deck which faced the Marina Bay Sands, with its Louis Vuitton Island shop and its absurd aerial boat. While very attractively designed and very functional, the rooms are just a bit too small \u2013 you tend to collide with many of the designer square edges in the night and the clothes storage space is woefully inadequate for two on an extended trip like ours \u2013 a small wardrobe and two drawers! The public areas are limited: the formal dining room is attractively finished in a more traditional style in a nod to the old Fullerton Hotel \u2013 we had an excellent buffet breakfast there, although the hotel has no idea at all how to make cappuccinos! There is a bar/coffee shop area in the Lobby, which is rather lacking in atmosphere, and a very nice open air rooftop bar, where the hostess seemed reluctant to seat us as we didn\u2019t have a reservation! On our first day, the air conditioning had been set to arctic levels everywhere (even colder than the usual in Singapore). On the second day, the temperature was far more agreeable. Our overall views? This is a good property which is probably better suited to the two night trip business stopover than the holiday trip we were on. At SGD 680++ the value for money is not quite there \u2013 you do better service and room wise at the Raffles, the Ritz Carlton Club floor or at the Shang, for the same or less money. One final word: the staff need to smarten up a bit: while pleasant and accommodating, they reveal no sense of passion for what they do and they tend not to go the extra mile for their guests.

Staff service was also great and nothing was too much trouble. the only downside to the hotel was the breakfast buffett which was fairly disappointing but not the end of the world.

Breakfast is included; it's pretty typical with an omelette station, fresh fruits, pastries, noodles, meats, etc. What makes it great is the staff is so accommodating if you want something that isn't in the buffet. They also make wicked espresso and iced coffees. If you get the chance, take in a sunset up at The Lantern. It's a chic crowd and the music is loungey.

And the bar was set by the previous hotel so we were a tad bit disappointed with our stay. Let me give you a heads up before you book in The Fullerton Bay Hotel. The Bad 1) We were spending our anniversary in Singapore and I wanted to surprise my girlfriend. I got in touch with 2 different people to make flower and wine arrangements to be ready once we arrive. I gave them all my flight details as well. I specifically told them to have it ready when we walk in to our room. Yet when we got in to our room, I saw nothing. I hid my frustration and talked to the receptionist. 2) Our room felt crampy. I don't know if this is because we booked some sort of promo but nonetheless we felt we were set aside. 3) The receptionists were poorly dressed and gave me the feeling that tending to us was an interruption to their chitchat. 4) I'm sorry Fullerton Bay Hotel but your breakfast buffet was horrible. The food was made me frown and thinking about it now makes me cringe. The service was bad too. There as an Australian lady sitting in the table beside us and was shaking her head waiting for a waiter to come over and then waited even longer for her fork. I gave her a smile and said, \"Pretty bad huh?\" and she went on ranting. We sat together, me, my girlfriend and her and enjoyed some tea. The Good. 1) The view. Some things that you can't really put a price tag on. The view was amazing. Even if we were given a small room at the end of the hallway in front of what I remember to be the fire exit, the view from our room was amazing. 2) In my last review I was singing praises about another hotels shower. But the shower in The Fullerton Bay Hotel was to die for. Rain shower head that would just engulf your whole body, a bathtub good for two persons (although they did not have bath foam readily available) and the tiling was natural stone. 3) The history of the building. I heard it used to be a post office of sorts. And personally, I liked the idea. My imagination went wild once I went in the hotel. 4) They stepped up and pushed through with my request for flowers, letter for my girlfriend (I wrote and emailed to them) and wine and even though I was expecting to pay for it, they did not charge. So there were some bad and some good things in our stay, it all meshed into a so-so experience, I would still recommend the hotel on the thought of maybe we were just unlucky. Oh and before I forget, I let the management know my 2 cents via guest comment card and they were nice enough to send me an email apologizing and inviting me over to prove themselves again. The gesture was well taken and hope other hotels would do the same.

The event was celebrated together with a group of close friends. Everything would be done in style - complete with videography & photography, flowers & a slideshow presentation. As such, I had to do some homework \u2013 to search for, and making an assessment of a hotel that can work with me to make the event a success. The 2 main selection criteria at the top of my list are (i) Attentiveness to details, and (ii) Superior service. Quality of hotel and adequacy of facilities are a given \u2013 these are externally visible and relatively easy to assess. Please view the photos of the hotel that I had taken during my stay at FBH and see for yourself. In the process of making the initial enquiries, the front desk staff came across as warm, friendly and helpful. The Duty Manager offered me a tour of the Premier Bay View room \u2013 which is located at an exclusive and quiet section of the hotel. Guests will need to pass through an additional security door to get to this special section of the hotel. There are only 10 of these Premier Bay View rooms, each featuring a spacious balcony where one can take in the spectacular view of the Marina Bay. I visited the FBH 3 times before making a final decision on the venue. In between my visits, I corresponded with the Duty Manager via email and SMS, stating special requirements for the event. The evening agenda went through several revisions. All my questions and concerns were answered in an accurate and timely fashion. During my follow-up visit, the Duty Manager assisted me to test out the room\u2019s audio/visual system with my portable electronic gadgets (for the in-room birthday slideshow presentation to my guests). A technician was brought in to ensure that the sound system is adapted to my personal AV equipment. It took about 20 minutes and everything was fixed & set to go. The level of service extended to me was on par with that given to a company holding a major function at a 5 star hotel. I told the Duty Manager how impressed I was in his handling my special requests, even though I am just an individual (vs. a corporate client), and had not even committed to anything yet at that point. The Duty Manager reassured me that FBH values all its customers \u2013 corporate as well as individuals. That sealed the deal for me \u2013 I know that I have found the perfect hotel for the special occasion. On the day of arrival, my wife & I were greeted warmly by name. Quite a few of the staff had already known us as a result of my planning. Per the Duty Manager and the Director of F&B, all staff members who were involved in the evening\u2019s agenda had been briefed in advance. We were given an early check-in so that my family can enjoy the rooftop pool. The front desk staff had also assisted my wife in securing a booking at a nearby hair-dresser. Later that evening, champagne glasses were brought in at the right timing to surprise the guests. FBH scored full marks for excellence in execution. The evening started with the guests\u2019 arrival at Lantern \u2013 the rooftop bar. It was drizzling. The staff at Lantern was attentive and had large umbrellas ready. We were escorted individually from the bar reception area to the sheltered section of the rooftop bar. Orders for the pre-dinner drinks went smoothly. The waiters & waitresses at the Lantern were focused in their jobs & alert to all my guests\u2019 needs. As the pre-dinner drinks session came to an end, the leftover liquor was transferred to the dinner venue \u2013 the Clifford restaurant. The seating arrangements at the Clifford were done perfectly according to my specification. Names of guests were correctly typed out on Seating Cards and displayed prominently for everyone to quickly locate their seats at the table. An experienced waiter was deployed to our table and the Restaurant Manager supervised the entire function. The service was impeccable. Glasses were filled promptly; napkins were placed on the laps of guests each time they left & returned to their seats; used dishes & utensils were quickly cleared away at every stage of the meal. The birthday cake was brought out at the precise moment. After the dinner and in-room slideshow presentation, we proceeded back to the rooftop bar and party the night away. The staff members at Lantern seem to be just as attentive and accommodating as they were at the start of the evening. They have an unwavering commitment to ensure that everyone had a great time \u2013 and we did! Here\u2019s an extra tip that I wish to share with you:- If you are planning for an event at the hotel, do get to know the friendly hotel staff members in advance. Building an affiliation with the crew goes a long way towards the success of the function. The FBH staff are really nice to work with. I hereby wish to acknowledge the following hotel staff members who had demonstrated remarkable service (a short narration against each of their names represents a mini-review of their individual contributions):- The Duty Manager \u2013 Mr. Sadiq: He is my main point of contact and is instrumental in overseeing the planning process. He patiently worked with me on the agenda. He orchestrated the team to ensure seamless execution as we moved from one item on the agenda to the next. Director of F&B \u2013 Mr. Sugu: He mobilized his F&B team to extend exceptional service to all my guests. He was personally present on the evening of the event to ensure all systems go, before rushing off for another important appointment. Assistant Restaurant Manager \u2013 Mr. Prakash: He coordinated well with the chef, waiters and waitresses to ensure a perfect dining experience at the Clifford. Waiter \u2013 Mr. Thong: He did an excellent job as an attentive and competent waiter. All the guests were pleased with him as he displayed pride, passion and enthusiasm in his job. Front Desk Reception - Ms. Yasmin: Facilitated the check-in (and check-out) process and showed us to the hotel room. She arranged for an in-room birthday cake & a soft toy gift for my kids. Her cheerfulness and professional demeanor is an embodiment of the spirit of FBH. She had also made special arrangements for an external hair dresser on my wife\u2019s behalf. Front Desk Reception \u2013 Ms. Ifa: She was my first point of contact at FBH, and she made a fantastic first impression. Her warm and friendly greeting will make any potential guest feel welcome at the hotel. The Chef \u2013 Tal: He came out of the kitchen and greeted my wife & I. He made sure that the guests are happy with the meal. Restaurant Manager \u2013 Mr. Shuren: I met him the next day and he listened attentively to our feedback and took notes on areas for improvement. Guest Services Agent, Concierge \u2013 Mr. Paolo: He promptly greeted my family on arrival at the hotel entrance and ushered us to the front desk. Our luggages were handled perfectly. On the day of departure, he escorted us from the lobby to the hotel entrance and bade us a warm farewell. F&B staff at Lantern rooftop bar: I did not have a chance to get their names individually, but every one of them was very attentive to our needs. Last but not least, I wish to extend my heartiest congratulations to the General Manager of Fullerton Bay Hotel, Mr. Giovanni Viterale, for leading this wonderful, world-class team. Fullerton Bay Hotel has my highest recommendation, and I wish that there is one in every country that I travel to.

We had a Premier Bay View Room. This means not only do you get a beautiful bay view and a small terrace (like the regular Bay View Rooms) You get a deck with chaise lounge chairs perched a few feet above the marina. You feel like you are on a boat. We would have morning coffee out there every day and nighttime cocktails there every night. (Do be aware that small boats will cruise by very close if you know what I mean) The hotel bar (Lantern) is stunning as is the whole rooftop pool area. The lobby is just beautiful as well. The hotel faces directly at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is a stunning view. A nightly 9:30pm laser light show from the Marina Bay Sands is beautiful from the FBH. The workout is is small (2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals , 2 bikes a universal, an incline bench, yoga mats an exercise ball and free weights) but it has a nice view and they keep it stocked with fruit infused water, towels and headphones. We were able to spend an hour or 2 in here every day. The staff were all extremely polite and helpful. The breakfast buffet has a omelet station . We went to Raffles to check it out and have a Sling. WAY WAY happy we didn't stay there. It had a lot of foliage which was nice but that's it. We had lunch at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Again, WAY happy we didn't stay there. It was like a Las Vegas or Orlando convention hotel...yikes! But it is beautiful to see from afar. I fretted long and hard about restaurant reservations and made a few changes once we got there. If you want a lovely outdoor table by the River with music in the background and good food, I would say IndoChine Waterfront. Ask for a table at the edge and go right before sunset. The pictures actually turn out better at night with the flash off. Then, if you want to try the Chili Crab and want to see a different area (maybe 10 minutes by cab) Go to Jumbo East Coast. Again, try to get a table outside on the edge. It's at East Coast Park where there are several Chili Crab restaurants. This one seems to be a local favorite. It's on the water with a nice promenade for walking by the sea. We happened upon SKI360 there. Its cable water skiing/boarding. It looked fun so we came back early the next morning for an hours session. After that we went to the Maxwell Food Center for the Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice for lunch. I think it must help if the dish transports you back to your childhood or something. It's not bad; it's just rice and chicken with some condiments. I know it's very touristy, but we took one of the night boats on the River. It's only about 30 minutes but you get commentary on the buildings and history. At night it's gorgeous. That's the most I can offer. If you want a really fancy elegant hotel room pick the St Regis. But if you like a bit of modern minimalist with great views and cool rooftop bar go to the FBH.

Beautiful glittering mosaic tiles, grand chandeliers and their specially curated scent wafts through the air. Staff were polite and extremely hospitable.

As locals, we ventured out to our familiar haunts for food instead of dining in the hotel, although the Lantern bar that is perched by the beautiful pool would be a hit if only for the amazing view. Considering the needs of tourists or foreign visitors, I would definitely recommend a stay at the Fullerton Bay Hotel even if it isn't located within the popular shopping belt. Its a short cab ride away from shopping areas, museums and gives you an alternative point of view of the CBD crowd. Not to mention a short stroll takes you to Customs House or One Fullerton where there is Starbucks, and great restaurants like Overeasy and Kinki - and of course, the Merlion which I suppose would be a great tourist haunt to indulge in. The only drawback - would be the layout of the hotel that has some sections facing inwards that renders the walkways dark at times. Also, being perched on a waterfront of a sea of water that isn't exactly blue and crisp but a little muggy and 'green' instead, it does affect the overall aesthetic of the hotel, albeit an uncontrollable factor.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cI loved it and I will send executive travel clients to this hotel with confidence\u201d", "Author": "AskMariaTodd", "ReviewID": "UR115920428", "Content": "This hotel is top notch.

We opted for the Thai food (obviously) and we went to the mall in which this restaurant was located. However, the restaurant had been closed down for months. After we returned back to our room, housekeeping had brought back some clothes we asked to be pressed. One of them was a dress that I had just purchased the day before and the other was a collared shirt. They brought both items back not pressed with tape all over them. The shirt was ripped and the dress had stains on them. They had ripped the tags off the dress so even if I were to try and return it I could not and they offered no explanation as to why the clothes were the way they were. These items were NOT given to them in that way and all they kept doing is pointing out the stains and the rip. I was honestly speechless. A couple other things, the pool is beautiful but there are only 8 sunbeds which for a luxury resort makes no sense.

But there is one exception. The Fullerton Bay. Went there with my wife last night as I wanted to take her to experience their fabulous wine and cheese offering. In the past, the FBH used to put on an amazing array of imported cheeses, all beautifully arranged on a centre display. It was on offer Fri/Sat/Sun evenings, from 6pm to 9pm. Wine was also included. Call up yesterday to even make a reservation. Ask the nice lady if the wine and cheese option in the lobby is still running. Yes, came the reply. When we get to the hotel, I am saddened to see no magnificent display of fromages. But I did notice quite a few people eating to what appeared to be a \"high-tea\" selection of food, all well presented on a little 3-tier tray. I mentioned my disappointment to the staff and said that we may not eat there now but would head to the rooftop to take a look around (as my wife had not been here before). We decide to have a drink upstairs and enjoy the view and the terrific atmosphere. Moments after we order, I receive a phone call from the Assistant Director of F&B for the hotel. He asks me if he can come and talk to me - and that he would be right up. No more than 5 minutes later, he introduces himself. He apologised profusely for the change in the wine and cheese offering (which was still being offered by the way, but it was now served to you and not self selection) and then said \"let me take care of these drinks for you\". Stunned, but grateful, we accepted his goodwill gesture. We told him we would be more than happy to come downstairs to try out their new offering. The staff could not have been more efficient, friendly and professional. The service was impeccable, the wine and cheese selection excellent (and terrific value) and their desire to make amends was above and beyond the call of duty. Another staff member insisted we try out a new cocktail they were due to release next month. Again, no charge. I'm not going to publicly name the F&B Director of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, but he was one of the best hotel operators I have seen. A consummate professional. I know its not the cheapest hotel in SIN, but in my mind, it's clearly the best. Simply outstanding customer service. Which is rare these days. Bravo to the FBH.

Location is ace too (for me, Singapore eats are #1 & both the Lau Pa Sat & Gluttons Bay hawker centres are walkably close for that late fix). Black out shades & nice, heavy doors (along with the black carrot cake & a couple Tigers) guarantee a good sleep. Now the dumb - and just like a supermodel, most of the dumb stuff happens in the bathroom. The bath design is beautiful but completely brain-dead, non-functional: 1) you must stand deep inside the shower to turn it on, guaranteeing a hot or cold dousing from either the handheld or the rainhead; 2) there is no room to fit your hands under the sink faucet to wash them unless you slide them flat against the basin; 3) if you turn the water in the sink on more than 1/4 of the way, the water will shoot right out of the basin into your lap making you look like you just peed yourself (not great on those romantic getaway weekends); 4) directly over the toilet is a huge & completely necessary picture frame holding a giant gold apple, if you are taller than 5'5\" you will hit your head on it every time you bend over to press the button to flush (every time!) Service was friendly, but we made 2 requests, including a fairly urgent one (even in low crime Singapore) to fix a terrace door that would not lock, and both were ignored. Again, style also has to have some service & substance behind it. The rooftop pool is lovely (the view of the Marina Bay Sands when the elevator doors open is stunning) but it serves more as decoration to the surrounding bars & restaurants than as a functioning pool for guests. All but 2 of the loungers are located directly in the pool, which guarantees sopping towels & any accidents involving cel phones, iPods/Pads, or Blackberries will be fatal (to the device, if not necessarily you). Umbrellas are available only over the restaurant/bar tables. The only other lounging option is an uncomfortable wicker cabana-type contraption, which, I can attest, holds the Singapore heat really well.

Check-in was swift and as promised, the hotel upgraded me to a Premier Bay View room. The Room The so-called Premier Bay view room is actually the same as the standard room except there is a large outdoor balcony with two cabana long chairs for relaxation and enjoyment of the \u201cview\u201d. Talking about the view, the room faces Marina Bay, right opposite to the newly opened Marina Bay sands with it\u2019s three tower and a \u201cfloating boat\u201d on top ( see photo ). However, the exact same view is available right outside the hotel and at the rooftop swimming pool. In fact, the location of the hotel is right at the edge of Marina bay. So I am not sure if it is worth paying the premium if it doesn\u2019t come with a free upgrade. The design of the room is rather basic and standard. There\u2019s a \u201csee-thru\u201d bathroom with a rainforest shower and deep soaking tub. A writing desk at one corner, a sofa area at the other and a king Size bed. There is a cupboard for clothes but no walk-in closet. A 40\u201d LCD TV with DVD player and a Bose iPod dock round up the entertainment system. As mentioned earlier, the design is very conventional, nothing innovative or ground-breaking. However, the furnishing of the room is first class, with good quality material used throughout that makes the room feels very posh and luxurious. The in-room technology is also good. Wireless internet connect effortlessly and there are an abundance of power plugs and multimedia connection. Another nice thought is the Nepresso coffee machine with 9 selections of coffee granules and 6 more variety of tea, all complimentary of course. The room is very comfortable and I feel relaxed in it. The high thread count bed linens are sumptuous and the bed is soft, a bit too soft actually for me. The bathroom water pressure is good and the provided Molton Brown toiletries are a nice touch. Even the towels and bathrobes are very fluffy. However, I do not like the sink, a single vanity that is way too shallow so that water splash everywhere during use. The ceiling is higher than normal ( I think 3.5m at least ) so it feels large and spacious. Common Areas and Location The hotel has a western restaurant and two bars. There is also a rooftop bar + swimming pool + gym that has 360Deg view of the Marina bay area. The common areas are nicely decorated, and most eye-catching is the check-in lobby with it\u2019s soaring height and huge glass chandelier. Here comes the most problematic area of the hotel, which unfortunately, the hotel couldn\u2019t do much to change or improve. It\u2019s location. It\u2019s situated in the business district of Singapore so during the weekends, everything is closed including restaurants so there\u2019s not much to explore. There\u2019s a underground mall ( Marina Bay Link ) a short walk away which contains some cafes and restaurants and a super market. If one is prepared to walk, the Marina shopping area is within 15mins walking distance but under Singapore\u2019s humid 33 Deg weather? No thanks. The nearest subway station is few blocks away, but one has to cross a dangerous road junction and pass thru some unpleasant construction sites. This is in sharp contrast to the other Singapore hotels I have tried that are located in Marina Bay area or Orchard Road as right outside the hotel\u2019s doorstep are a wide selection of shopping and eating places. In comparison, the Fullerton Bay feels very secluded. Sure, cabs are available but it\u2019s an added inconvenience and for any long stay, the cost adds up. Service Service is generally speaking, good and prompt. All service calls were attended immediately and there was no waiting. Only exception was at the roof top bar where the waitor couldn\u2019t understand English well and the nuts only came after I had finished my beer. Also tried room service for both dinner and morning breakfast ( since I had a early plane to catch ). The dinner is fine, which is basically food ordered at the western restaurant but delivered via in-room dinning to my room. Not outstanding by any standards but decent quality although the price is expensive. Breakfast was poor. They forget the orange juice and the pasteries and bread were all cold and not fresh. If the room rate didn\u2019t include breakfast, it will be S$40/=. F&B is certainly not a strong suit of this hotel. Conclusion The Fullerton Bay hotel is a good choice provided you don\u2019t mind the relatively secluded location. The room has great comfort factor and are posh and luxurious. The hotel\u2019s common areas are impressive. The service needs polishing but otherwise decent. Overall, I rate it a 4 out of 5.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGrandstand view for the new year Fireworks 2011\u201d", "Author": "Jihadi_San", "ReviewID": "UR91900537", "Content": "We check-in on new year's eve 2010/11 to witness ourselves the tremendous transformation of the place into what it is today - ultra-luxurious.

You could either choose from loungers right in the pool that soaked half your towel, or far too small and short round double-loungers. This lack of loungers made us even go to the very busy Fullerton Hotel for sunbathing the next day, which is a real pity considering a good pool area is important for us.

The spotlessly clean floor-to-ceiling window affords one an expansive view of the Marina Bay, with a balcony extension to boot. My friend loved the TV in the bathroom, perfect for being entertained while soaking in the spacious bathtub. The swimming pool was another wonderful experience. I don't usually use hotel pools, but once I saw how inviting it was, I knew I had to use it. And boy, it was worth the sunburn I had after it. It was private, peaceful.. with a beautiful view of the marina bay and the surrounding Singapore skyline. The only drawback would be the scarcity of deck chairs - only 6. Breakfast at the Clifford was decent. Slightly lacking in variety but the quality was decent. What I like was that they actually had eggs benedict (which is my all-time favourite brunch food). All in all, the hotel room was so wonderful that we almost did not want to leave the hotel! As with some of the previous reviews, there was some slight glitches in the service.

On one hand this is fair considering the hotel has only been in operation for three months, but on the other, would expect things to be 110% perfect considering the all round exorbitant prices. We found a couple of things disappointing. The service and quality of food served at the roof top bar/pool and the service at Cliffords restaurant. Seated by the pool my husband waited almost 40 minutes for someone to ask whether or not he would like another beverage, very poor considering it was a quiet weekday afternoon. Lunch was a further source of mild vexation, with the club sandwich coming in at $30 for two paltry, double layered, triangle sandwiches comprising \"processed chicken\" amongst other things. At Clifford's, the service appeared amateur with wine and water glasses being left too long before being replenished and almost by ourselves at one point. Simply put, there was a severe lack of \"attention to detail\" by the wait staff.

It's quaint & unique in its own small way. It's much smaller than its sister hotel, Fullerton Hotel (just opposite the end of the same street) which is also a sight to behold amongst all the modern buildings in the Central Business District. It has its own unique history in the past of being a working pier. Fullerton Bay gives a lux feel upon entry with its chandeliers & opulent looking cushions at the lobby. The Deluxe room (facing the Customs House) has a high ceiling that gives off a big room feel. The winners of the room are the TV screen that you can see from your tub in the bathroom & Nespresso coffee machine with complimentary coffee capsules. Free internet access comes with the package although it was highlighted at check-out that it's limited to 1 access at a time...this won't have mattered usually but I carried my iPad, notebook & iPhone that are logged on almost all the time - thankfully, the reception waived the charges for multiple access. I found the pillows too soft as my head sunk to the lowest point within minutes of rest. Up to the rooftop pool that has a rooftop bar area called Lantern. Next to the pool, it has 2 jacuzzis that overlook the Marina Bay skyline. There's a see-through glass wall on one side of the pool so you shouldn't mind being looked at in your bikinis. Service-wise at the pool - it's attentive but not excellent as I waited 1 hour for my order of 12 piece dim sum (costing me SGD$20 if I recall correctly) to arrive at the pool from the 1st level restaurant. The waiter kept checking & apologizing but it was still WAY TOO LONG for a snack to arrive - it was around 3p.m. & the pool was empty at that time. The pool side bar (Lantern) comes alive closer to evening & well into the night. Service-wise, it remains the same dismal standards as it took me around 20 mins to get the attention of a service staff to order my drinks & another 20 mins to pay for them. This time however, the place was quite full at 11p.m. as the scenery makes it a place to be seen in. Service during breakfast (Clifford) is excellent. The servers were attentive & prompt although their Fullerton Bay Egg Benedict could have been better as one came with a broken yolk.
