What a great choice! We were treated upon arrival to a complimentary champagne toast (thanks, Jake Mir) prior to checking into our suite with two bedrooms, a spacious living area, and a well-supplied kitchen. The view from our balcony was a bit limited of the ocean being off to the left, but it was still a great place. The rooms were clean and all accommodations were very comfortable. The concierge, a woman who had family roots in Key West, was able to provide us with bicycles, as well as great restaurant choices, and places to go while in Key West. She was wonderful and had a great sense of humor, making the trip even more enjoyable. Aside from biking all over the key for 6 days, we also made use of the shuttle from the hotel which took people on the hour to Margaritaville and picked them up at the same place at 20 minutes after the hour. One driver (Ken) provided huge amounts of information in his whimsical manner which served us well throughout the stay. While we did not make use of the dinner options at the hotel, we did have wonderful breakfasts in the hotel. We chose the buffet option but my wife, due to gluten intolerance, elected to have omelets made for a small upcharge. I should also note that the cooks were cognizant of what she could eat, which made us more comfortable that no reactions would be experienced. We spent time in Key West in the morning, returned in the afternoon and spent time at the pool and in the hot-tub, and then ventured out again in the evening. And despite the spring break crowd, we only heard noise one night, and that was promptly stopped. We truly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and felt we were treated so well by the staff. Be aware that the rooms are made up any time before 5:00, just something one needs to be aware of and which the hotel notifies its guests about in the room. We worked around it well.

The Marriott is a beautiful property with a great restaurant (indoors not poolside), great amenities, and great service. Do not eat the food at the pool bar! The pool area was the perfect place to relax when I got back from jet sking and shopping downtown. The beach was also perfect at sunset. My room was clean, but obviously well used. The bed was comfy and the the linens and bath towels were top notch. Overall, this was a great place. There were more families than I expected, but I suppose it is the time of year most Euorpeans travel with their kids. My only draw back from staying at this hotel again is the location. That being said, I don't believe I will stay anywhere that far away from the action again. It is only two miles from Duval St, but the wait on a taxi (not very friendly taxi drivers in this town - not a one), the trip there, and waiting forever for a lift home just ate up too many dollars and too much time. Yes I saved money staying two miles away, but transportation costs mounted to rates which could have been spent within walking distance.

I researched trip advisor about this hotel before booking and was confident I was booking with a hotel that both met my standards and gave me the best value for my money. This would be our first trip to Key West and I was unsure where the best location was to stay. The good points are as follows. It was very clean, the grounds were beautiful, the staff was very nice upon check in and out, the shuttle downtown was very convenient, it had nightly turn down service. Overall, it meet my standards on cleanliness and service. Bad points, I booked this hotel in November of 2010. I requested a high floor, extra towels and extra pillows. Upon arrival we were given a room on the first floor. I ask about a higher floor but it was unavailable but I was given the option of calling the next day to see if another room was available. After unpacking I didn't want to pack up and move after getting settled in. The towels and pillows were the customary allotment so I'm not sure \"requests\" are looked at upon check in. I also booked a \"resort view\" which on the website depicted a view of the inside of the resort overlooking the pool. We were booked in a room directly looking at a stucco wall. I called the front desk and was told a resort view was also a view of the gardens. The gardens consisted of a few trees and a few bushes. So my advise, call the desk before arrival and clearly state you want a high floor and overlooking the pool. In the room my only complaint was two of the jets weren't working in the tub and the water pressure in the shower was terrible! Also, if you are going to enjoy the beach, you might look for another location that offers more beach area. On our next trip we will book a little closer to town. We did visit the restaurant one evening for drinks and the staff there was not as friendly as the front desk staff.

But note that 4 people will not be comfortable in some of the 1-bedroom suites because some of tehm have L-shaped sectional sofas rather than sofa beds. And the hotel does not offer roll-away beds. The bedroom in the suite and the normal bedroom are about the same moderately large size, nicely furnished. The hotel is managed a bit too casually. There were not as many towels in the room, and we had to call down to the desk at 2:00 PM to get the room serviced. Room service consisted of making the bed and refreshing the bathroom, but doing almost no cleaning, although that may have been because we were in the room.. Towels do get refreshed at 5:00 PM. There's a $17.00 charge for self-parking that wasn't mentioned when we checked in, and there was no indication of the charge at the entrance to the garage. So... management could be a bit sharper.

Very spotty service at the pool as well. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 There must be a shortage of teaspoons because the restaurant one day only had soup spoons for cereal and coffee; even when we had coffee at the pool it was served with a soup spoon.

The rooms - The lower cost, basic rooms can be very small. The room is hardly big enough for the bed with an en suite bathroom with a shower/tub combo. We spent our first several nights in one of these rooms and felt cramped. A light sleeper might have a hard time as the walls are thin and these rooms are typically situated next to the walkways. These rooms do not have a view. Just look at the description of the rooms carefully before reserving. It is worth the extra cost for a bigger room. At the end of our trip, we were upgraded to a bigger room with a view and couldn't believe the difference! We had a HUGE master bedroom with a spa-quality shower and jacuzzi tub. We had a separate living room with a full kitchen and dining area. There was a half bath attached to the living area as well. Our closet alone was probably the size of our first room, it was unbelievable! The room also had a patio with gorgeous ocean and beach views. We sat outside for morning coffees and evening cocktails & sunsets every day. If you have the points or can budget for these rooms, it is well worth it! Overall, we thought the other beaches in Key West were OK, crowded and disappointing considering you typically have to pay for access - so after exploring the island, shopping, and eating, we would've spent the rest of our trip enjoying the pool and our awesome room at this hotel.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cWorst resort\u201d", "Author": "tslowik", "ReviewID": "UR122289251", "Content": "We reserved a water view room for new years eve at the end of october 2011.

The water view suites which were much more costly actually only have a view of the lagoon (aka) swamp where we would never swim or utilize in any way. The hotel, as many reviewers have already pointed out, is in a nondescript part of Key West and far from the main action along and near Duval Street. The hotel tries to compensate for the poor location by providing an hourly shuttle to and from Duval. Unless you can find a substantial discount from the rack rates or have some other significant discount, I'd highly recommend staying at another property closer to the main action as well as the multitude of good quality restaurants in the Duval area.

My wife and I stayed from Saturday, August 20th through Friday, August 19th, while our daughter was on a cruise with her friends. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know this was originally constructed, before the real estate bust, as primarily 1 bedroom private residences, with a 2nd attached bedroom in a common foyer area. Only a percentage of the residences were sold and people can rent the 1 bedroom suite or the 2nd bedroom like hotel rooms. We were asked at check in if we wanted the balcony view and we declined not knowing it was code for the 1 bedroom suite. We may have opted for that because the 2nd bedroom was really tiny. I could have literally swung my legs off the bed, stood up and be within inches of the bathroom. The bathroom did feature a very nice, deep bathtub, which was very conducive to long, hot soaking baths. They did provide daily housekeeping services. There were only exterior hallways and the floors became slippery when it rained. Whoever was the architect should have his license revoked because the layout of buildings was very confusing and they had parking under each of the buildings. The pool, small as it was, was surrounded by the buildings and we heard car alarms going off every day. The elevators required key cards to access the floors, but anyone could have put their hand through the security gate and unlocked it, allowing access to the staircase. They did have CCTV at each entry point and at least 1 guard patrolling the grounds. The pool was awfully small and thank god the resort wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t full because it would have been ugly. They did have very attentive pool guys who would lay out the pads, scoop up the left over towels and bring out new ones. The nearby man-made beach was ok, but nothing to write home about. The watersports area was a short walk from the main beach area and they had lots of stuff you could rent. The fitness was a small room with 3 treadmills, 2-3 ellipticals and 1-2 bikes. A rack of free weights and 2 mats were the only other equipment. I spent one morning there and never went back. We had lunch at the main restaurant, Tavern and Town and we never went back. The server came to our table three times before she noticed I got up to get my wife and me our own napkins. The lunch selection was pitiful and the food was very salty. They serve the same menu at the Blue Bar, the pool bar. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know Tavern and Town did not serve lunch until after we ate there. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try room service as we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t especially like the food. I will admit the Tavern was rocking most nights were passed by. The resort provided a shuttle at the top of the hour to Duval Street and a return ride at 20 minutes past the hour. They dropped you off and picked you up in front of Jimmy Buffett\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Margaritaville bar. We hit up all the drivers for their favorite local restaurants and we ate at Turtle Krawl, Louie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Caroline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and a couple of other places that were excellent. Ken was the best shuttle driver we had, while the others were also very knowledgeable and friendly. If you ask nicely, and tip, they would actually drive you to your destination, if time allows. For the non-runners, you can skip this part review. I did three 6 mile runs from the resort, located at US 1 and South Roosevelt Blvd, along South Roosevelt and past the airport, to Bertha Street and back. You could add several more miles along Bertha to Flagler or up to Duval and back along North Roosevelt to the resort. Bring your own water as there were no water fountains along the way and no stores to buy any as it was very hot and humid in August. South Roosevelt had lots of runners, walkers and bicyclists, even at 6 am. There was hardly any traffic on Sunday, but a lot on the weekdays so be careful of trucks, school buses and speeding mopeds. While there are many other people using the route after 7 am, I did see a couple of homeless people and it was pretty desolate at 6 am, so be careful. We a fun time searching for the best raw oysters (Turtle Krawl won hands down) and a great everyone knows your name place called Sweat Tea. We ate at Sweat Tea 5 times in one week, it was so good. It was the only place we went back to. Louie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a bit off the beaten track, but not very far from Duval Street, and had a very romantic ambiance. We also ate at A & B Lobster House and we felt it was way over priced tourist trap. Better eats can be had downstairs in their causal location. Better prices and better food. We also ate at a family style Italian joint. I am still amazed at the serving size. The worst place we ate was a Subways (we were doing laundry and it was right across the street from the Laundromat) and Overdrive Bar. Both gave me an upset stomach. Overall, we enjoyed our stay eating and drinking our way up and down Duval Street. We probably will not stay at the Key West Beachside again as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really a true hotel and it lacked a lot of the amenities I would have expected for the price, value and the Marriott brand. We did choose it because of the Marriott brand and while it was a nice place, but it is simply not a true AAA 4 diamond rated resort we had expected.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jesrey", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "gigglebuke", "ReviewID": "UR117641235", "Content": "I just stayed one night in the presidential suite before moving on to my final destination.

My wife and I went to Key West to enjoy the water recreations during the day and to enjoy the restaurants and bars on Duval Street in the evening. Only problem with the Marriott was that the shuttle only left every hour to take us to Duval Street. We just happened to walk out of our room at 8:05 and just missed the shuttle. So we went to the restaurant to eat and wait for the next shuttle at 9pm. Just missed that too, so we got a taxi ($15) not a big deal. Went to the bars and realized that the last shuttle pick up to go back was 11:20. Now that i am older I can't stay out drinking as late as I used to but 11:20 is a little early. This is where the headaches begin - finding a taxi later took some time. When we finished our boat trip on Sunday evening and wanted to go back to change, we had just missed the shuttle and it took us 30 min. to get a taxi.

Lovely lovely room. The pool is nice and we had several fun days at the pool.

The road to/from Duval Street is always backed up and slow. Parking is a bit of a hassle downtown. Overall I am a little bit disappointed with Key West. Not such a nice island and not \"built up\" well. Upscale amenities are lacking. There is a good amount of fine dining here and the watersports (fishing, sailing, parasailing, etc) are a big thing here. But beaches are definately lacking here. The Marriott Beachside is somewhat comical in that the beach can't be more than 20 yards wide and you cant go in the water here. The \"big\" beaches on the island also arent very \"big\" and they dont compare to some of the more well known beaches in the caribbean. also, key west is very pricey for dinning.

We got here at about 8am and the allowed us to check in early (thank gosh) we were SO tired from our 2am drive down from Boca Raton. We had planned on volunteering at the Marine Mammal Conservancy in Key Largo, but was absolutely disgusted with their lack of hygiene at their facility, as well as once we heard how much pain and how extensively the whale was hurt (and that PETA was there boycotting) we immediately left and headed down to Key West. First of all, what a gorgeous drive on the overseas highway! Seeing the sunrise in the rear-view mirror and looking out across nothing but ocean was such a great way to spend the 2 hour drive.... We got to the hotel and went straight to the room. I like how even though there are outside hallways, you have to have a card key to access the elevator. Also, the door that you go into then has a private foyer with two room doors connected off of that. It made our room entry private and I can see how that would be great with a lot of luggage and having to deal with the elements! We had a king bed regular room. The room was great, it was a little small (especially compared to the Marco Island Marriott's rooms) but it was perfect for what we needed it for. The bathroom was decently sized and the whole room was very elegant in color and decor. The pool was regular sized and fine. The outside bar was nice and shaded, and the bartenders were always fast and mixed them pretty strong :). I LOVE the little bit of the beach that is right by the dock off of the pool...it was nice to walk all the way to the end of the strip of beach and just be secluded with one another under the shade of the cabana. Sigh,....just remembering sipping our mojito's in the sun :) BY FAR the best thing about our experience here at this Marriott was the excellent staff...everyone from the bartenders, pool staff, housekeeping (especially very nice!) and last but not least, KEN!!! If you stay at this hotel you HAVE to take their free shuttle into town to Deval street, simply because of the off-chance you MIGHT get the world's most loveable, passionate about life, simply amazing, your new grandpa (you wish) NICEST, friendliest, etc etc man named Ken. He is a shuttle driver for the Marriott that picks you up every hour from the hotel and picks you back up every 20ish minutes from Deval street. ANY SINGLE thing he tells you to do, GO DO!!! It was our first time in Key West, we had no clue what we wanted to do except the snorkeling bit, and we listened to Ken about every single place to eat, sightsee from, etc. He also tells a fantastic story as you're traveling with him all about the island. He mentions everything from the trees to the buildings to whatever else! We had the pleasure of listening to his tour on two different days and I was surprised (even though I shouldn't have been) when he did the exact same tour the second day. Only it was done with the same charisma and heart as the day before.....he is really one in a million, I can't say enough good things about Ken, he really MADE the trip for us. Such a wonderful once in a lifetime person!! Key West recommendations: We did Fury for the snorkeling and they were great! We did the two-reef stop and it was definitely worth it! They were both great snorkel (or scuba) locations and wasn't crowded at all. Also free beer (as much as you can drink) when you're done. Just make sure to bring cash for tips, trust me they deserve it! :) side note - I fell down three steps once we came back from snorkeling...be careful and hold on :) EAT AT ALONZO'S FOR HAPPY HOUR!!!! It's right on the dock, you can see cool boats, HUGE tarpin daily that flock to the docks to catch the fisherman's leftover scraps, people walking by etc. They have some pretty amazing food and their happy hour pricing is to die for! My boyfriend and I had 8 drinks (at least) and 5 appetizers for around $60 (unheard of in Key West)...all of it was fresh caught delicious seafood and strong drinks! HIGHLY recommend!

The island and this hotel left me with a great impression and I would definitely return. The hotel room was really great and any complaints are really just nitpicking. July 2 -5th, 2011 - July 4th weekend Room: It was awesome. We had a third floor room with a spacious balcony and spiral staircase leading to a rooftop terrace. 2nd floor has no extra balcony and 1st floor has spiral staircase leading you to pool (one guy had a few kayaks on his 1st floor balcony). You could set up an airbed with space to spare on this thing. I wish I had my grill. We were able to see Key West 4th of July fireworks wonderfully from there and if you turn around you could see them from other islands and of course from all the boats around the island. The 1 bedroom suite is giant. It has 1.5 bathrooms (great!), full kitchen (stove, oven, sub-zero fridge), 6 person dining table, L-shape couch w/sleeper, 2 modern tv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, huge whirlpool tub, giant shower, and WASHER/DRYER with detergent and dry sheets included. Kitchen has lots of little extras and has everything most people have at home. The room is beautiful and feels like the Caribbean and Key West. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modern and high end. All the furniture tops have glass which keeps them looking nice. The bed is super comfortable and the curtains can make the room pitch black. Bathroom has two robes, blow dryer, shower cap, mouthwash, soap, shampoo, conditioner, sewing kit, cotton balls, and q-tips. TV has a multimedia hook-up for HDMI and MP3 hook-up with cords. Big kids can bring their game system or your camera after being out all day. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even an emergency flash light in the night stand. WASHER/DRYER in room was great. Our suitcase was packed on the way home with only clean clothes. I would have brought dirty clothes from home if I knew. The first day we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have as many toiletries until I spoke to house keeping in Spanish and then our towels were fan folded and room fully stocked. It only has some spots on walls where paint could be freshened up from probably guest suitcases and only some of the grout in the rooms needs bleach (nitpicking). The living room TV has digital channels but they are harder to find/manipulate so regular channels aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as pretty. The room does have the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foyer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which other reviews have mentioned before entering your own room. This would be excellent if you book both rooms. Check-in/check-out: We booked a Presidential suite and arrived to Key West just before 1pm. We had requested early check-in but were told that the room and early check-in was not available as they were sold out the prior night. They requested my phone number to call when the room was finally available. We took this as an opportunity to do a loop around Key West and get some lunch. We were able to check in at about 3:30pm. The front desk was smooth and they delivered my very particular room request. Check-out was easy, too. Had to go to desk to get receipt. They keep fresh fruit at desk and water with cups. There is a sundry station for items to purchase. Parking: $17.50/night but our rate had free parking and a $25 gas card on check out. We actually only used the rate for 2/3 of our nights but got free parking all night. There is PLENTY of actual hotel parking as there are garages under the actual hotel buildings (1st floor) and there is a 3-story lot that most people miss next to the lobby/main building. We never moved our car after it was parked. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s covered parking in sunny/rainy Florida which is nice. Exterior of property: You have to use your room key to activate the elevator which is fine for safety but annoying when your hands are full or are in a rush. The elevator is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outside\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and not in a builder interior so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot and humid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nothing new. The halls are outside and the entire property seemed well-lit and very nicely kept. Pool: The pool has a great view of the water and plenty of chairs and several cabanas which went generally un-used by most when we were there. The chairs were about 80% full. The pool didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have too many people in it so it was pretty nice. There were a couple of kids on the other end but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me. They is gravel mulch around a palm tree that guests unfortunately like to throw their cigarettes in and that part of the pool smells like an ashtray. I did see the pool guy picking butts out every morning, though. I could see where about 15 more people could have made the pool area no fun. The beach is for sunning. There is a nice pier with chairs out to lounge out in. There is about 10-15ft of usable beach by the jet skis. I was able to kick around in it and then go back to the pool. This is not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel as all the reviews already say. Internet: Free wi-fi at the pool and in the lobby. Free WIRED internet in your room \u00ef\ufffd\u0152. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on speeds since I had wi-fi only devices. Oh well, I went to the lobby business center and printed out directions and receipts for a charter. They have a laser printer which was nice and fast. Extras: It looked nice. One of the waiters was super helpful and gave me a cup of olive oil for me to use and cook in our room. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually eat there. Very nice of them! The shuttle leaves promptly on the hour. They can call a cab if you miss it. We always made it on the shuttle back and at times they had two shuttles and at times lots of people were left behind. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hustle and bustle to get on it.

At 8:45 our phone rang and it was the female concierge waking us up to tell us to meet the massage therapist at the cabana in an hour... We did not ask for a wake up call and had cx the reservation and when we informed her of this she was not pleases stating the massage therapist had started driving down the island to the hotl and we were creating a problem.

Great Suite. Less than Excellent Service and Commitment to Guest Satisfaction..\u201d", "Author": "Pabby317", "ReviewID": "UR114123422", "Content": "I planned a 24th anniversary trip to the hotel. My wife and I spent a long weekend there, June 10-13, 2011. I am a very loyal Marriott Rewards Platinum Elite member, so I used points for our stay. The cost is 100k standard points for a small single bedroom with absolutely no view for three nights. I upgraded to a gulf view one bedroom suite for an additional 60k in points. Initial impressions were fantastic: elegant lobby, beautiful suite with 10 ft ceilings, marble floors, balcony, etc. The restaurant is great. We knew the hotel was a few miles from Duval Street when we booked it, so we knew what we were getting into logistically. Now here starts the downside: The front desk staff at check-in did not disclose that there was a $17 per day parking fee. I did not find out until I checked out. The hotel has no access controls in place for the small pool. It was very apparent that the staff gladly accepted locals in the small pool area with no priority given to hotel guests. The locals also parked for free in the spaces that the hotel guest had to pay for on a daily basis. Also non-hotel guests who dined in the property's fine restaurant parked their vehicles in spaces in which guests paid a premium. My wife and I came back to the hotel after diner downtown on Saturday night, and we could not find a parking space for at least 15 minutes. Early on Sunday, the event staff at the hotel removed half of the pool umbrellas for a wedding reception. Shade was now at an unexpected premium. Also all day long, the beach was inaccessible for sun-bathing/ palm tree shade due to a wedding set-up that was utilized for two ceremonies throughout the day. I am incredibly disappointed that our enjoyment of the property was compromised by the lack of proper equipment (umbrellas) for their event planning. I have never been at a Marriott Rewards Category 7 hotel that had such little concern for the quality of the stay for their guests. Later in the afternoon on Sunday, My wife and I experienced something we have never experienced before. Many of the members of the wedding party from the morning were drunk and playing games such as chicken in the pool. One of the drunkards defecated in the pool. So the pool was shut down and yellow \"crime scene\" tape was laced around the perimeter of the pool. That was awful. What also disappointed me is that one would expect that the hotel staff would had stepped up and found ways to accommodate guests that were significantly inconvenienced. I requested to speak to a manager upon check-out on Monday morning, and was told by the reception desk person that none was available. I was also told that I would be able to share my comments/criticism in a survey that I would receive after my stay. I haven't gotten it yet. Final thought: I could (should?) have spent similar points at a JW Marriott or Ritz Carlton tropical resort property and the management staff would not have accepted less than a wonderful guest experience for my wife and me. I will be back to Key West. I will not be back to this property unless the management steps up and commits to an overall excellent guest experience.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "The_Traveller954", "ReviewID": "UR113759495", "Content": "The rooms are very nice and clean.

Check in was quick and eventless as it should be even though we arrived a bit early. We used the hotel pickup service and waited only about 10 minutes which gave us a chance to enjoy the sun. The driver; Joseph was very pleasant and also gave us a ride downtown during the week when the shuttle was off hours. Housekeeping was very accommodating and patient with our schedule. The shuttle makes life easy for getting to Duval St and the schedule works fine especially if you have spent the day at the pool, or FT Zachary Beach or jet skiing etc.,. In the evening I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like driving in to town and definitely didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to drive back to the hotel after dinner so it was great to have the shuttle service. As for the pool, it was pretty much like any resort/hotel pool. People stake claim to chairs early and if you get there too late it is a struggle but we have seen this all over the world. I only had good experiences with the pool wait staff and we enjoyed the food and drink, especially the blackened mahi mahi sandwich. As one commenter has said there was an incident with an obnoxious group of guests that were disruptive and hotel management should have dealt with the situation better. Personally I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about them and played catch with my son but it is true at a resort like this profane and obscene drunken behavior is unacceptable, especially as there were many families with children at the pool at the time. Hotel management you must do a better job responding to and removing this behavior in the future. I know that hotel management reads these reviews so hopefully you are instituting the appropriate procedures. Aside from the single noted incident we enjoyed the pool without issue for the week. Key West is an island that sits on hard coral rock so all Key West beaches are manmade. The onsite beaches were similar to other Keys resort beaches we have stayed at and did the job when you wanted a change of pace from being poolside. As for the wedding related beach closures the kids and I walked the beaches almost up until the actual ceremonies without any issues. Nothing gets a 12 year old girls attention like a beach wedding so we loved that they happened while we were there. If you really want to be on a beach there are a few Key West options and we enjoyed the day at Ft Zachary Taylor Beach and the kids and I loved snorkeling all day and the rented electric car to get there. We rented from a stand across the street from the hotel, the guys working there were great and the only negative is crossing the busy street but it was like crossing any busy street and something we only needed to do a few times so it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue. Also onsite is a rental/activities hut that runs a 2 hour jetski island tour. I highly recommend you do this and early in your stay. We did this on our last full day and I regretted waiting so long. Had I known how much fun it was we would have done it more than once. We really enjoyed our stay here, in fact last night a friend asked my opinion on this hotel for his family and I told him he would love it. As the locals say Key West is a drinking town with a fishing problem so you have to be aware of that when you visit with children, this place is not Disneyland. For us being able to enjoy Duval St for a few hours and then retreating back to the hotel before the late night insanity began worked great.

My family went on a jetski tour around the entire island and visited many places like the Southernmost Point of the Continental United States, the military bases and local hotspots and manmade beaches. We also took the educational trolley tour around the entire island being talked to by experts on the history of this island which, at first didn't seem fun for teenagers like me, but was interesting and fun. Many other excursions were available (just ask the concierge who were extremely personable and helpful), and an hourly shuttle into town to the original Margaritaville where there are endless restaurants and shopping opportunities (shuttles transported people back to the Marriott 20 minutes after each hour). The nightlife was incredible as well with local bars, restaurants, art galleries, and more! My step dad who was on a Rambler (walker) because he shattered his heel weeks prior to the trip maneuvered perfectly because of the roomy rooms, easy elevator access, and in general very handicap accessible environment. The service at the pool was amazing, and awesome drinks (my parents said!) and incredible lunch and appetizers. Town & Tavern which is the restaurant right in the lobby of the hotel is an incredible, elegant and formal steakhouse at night, and a fabulous casual breakfast buffet by morning. The beds were the best, free WiFI internet, and huge stainless steel refrigerator and kitchen appliances, which was essential for keeping our drinks and leftovers.

It was ocean front, with a full deck. Full kitchen, sub zero appliances, and overall very roomy. The noise form the adjoining room was almost non existent. Flat screens, marble floors and baths. The whirlpool wasn't very clean, so we didn't use it. Our maid service was prompt, with turn down service each evening. The staff here was very friendly, especially the bellmen and the shuttle drivers. The 10 min ride to Duvall St, was not an issue. We liked being away from all of the noise, and drinkers. Our hotel was on a man made limited beach. We checked in on Wednesday, and by Friday, we couldn't use the beach because of weddings the entire weekend. There's only one pool, so everyone was either on top of each other, or shuffled to the back of the building, where there was no air, or shade. It was over 90 degrees. Since the weddings were at 7 in the evening, there was no need to make everyone leave the beach area before noon. It was a major inconvenience. The pool area was taken over by kids. Screaming toddlers, overbearing guests, strollers, no chairs, not enough umbrellas, and arrogant pool attendants. I had one that spoke with a Carribean accent that insisted on telling me where to sit, because he did not want to move an umbrella to the chairs that I selected. He reluctantly moved one, but he had no right to dispute my choice. The wait staff at the pool was prompt, but limited at times. This hotel needs another pool for children. If you want peace and quiet, you won't find it at this hotel pool. You will be at the mercy of screaming kids, all day long. I could not make this up. You couldn't hear yourself think at times, and it felt like the walls closing in around us, outside. If you did not claim a chair by 9 AM, good luck. Guests were keeping towels overnite, and putting them on the chairs at 8 AM, before the towels were available. I knew this because I could see them from my suite. This is a poorly run system around this pool. And the man made beach should not be reserved so early in the day for 30 people, making it inconvenient for an entire hotel filled with paying guests. This isn't fair period. The web site should alert guests ahead of time, that the weekends are dedicated to weddings, and there is no access to the limited beach during that time. My husband complained, and we were compensated, because we had some additional issues. Overall, we loved our suite, the staff, and the hotel. But peace, quiet, and a nice beach was not found here. I will return to Key West, but not this resort. We like to relax without rushing to get pool chairs every morning, not listening to screaming kids all day long, having access to a real beach, having more than one pool, having polite pool attendants that understand and speak English without an attitude, have a kiddie pool for children only, have enough chaise lounges, and give the same amount of consideration to all guests, and not special consideration for the small wedding parties. And finally, the housekeeping staff needs to pay attention to keeping whirlpool tubs clean. They are a bedding ground for germs, and ours was filthy.

We did so using a F&F voucher from a good friend who is management at a Ritz Carlton a couple of hours from where we live. Wish we'd have just went to his hotel instead! Even making reservations weeks in advance of our date, and calling the hotel separately to let them know it was a 15th anniversary, when we arrived any hopes of a romantic \"beachside\" vacation were soon dashed. A few comments down a poster mentions \"If not for the name 'beachside', I would have had no idea this place was near the water\". Truer words were never spoken! This is truly a tale of two hotels. If you book here, get it in blood that you will have a water-view room. We just assumed that like most hotels, no matter what your actual view, if you strain you'll eventually see water. What did we see from our window? In the first room we saw a covered walkway about 3-feet across - and directly in front of that, as far as you could see 8-10 feet in either direction was more stucco. No natural sunlight whatsoever. The room was tiny and depressing. Even the \"happy anniversary\" card and Godiva chocolates waiting on the night table could not bring a smile to our face. We started to look around for a mini-fridge -- we live in Florida -- we expect mini-fridges on our beach vacation to be standard (especially at a hotel of this price). Nothing. After an 8+ hour drive to the Keys we were thirsty and tired, so my husband set off to find a Coke machine. Guess what? No Coke machine. He ended up going through buildings and the pool area and eventually to the main lobby before he found anything to drink. I thought at one point that I might never see him again. While he was gone, because I'm paranoid about bed bugs, I lifted back the sheets and fitted sheet. I didn't find bed bugs but I found hair all over the mattress cover and fitted sheet. GROSS! We were not in a \"make due\" situation here. Even at a F&F rate we were spending hundreds of dollars (pre-paid) and it was our FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY. My husband finally got back in the room with our Cokes, exhausted, only to find out I wasn't about to sleep on that bed. So he called the front desk to complain not only about the hair -- but the room size, view, and the fact we were spending our anniversary like this. We were told they were booked up and we'd be getting transferred to the same room. A bellhop would be right over with keys. Whatever. A HALF-HOUR later my husband called back to the front desk. We had watched the entire Nightly News cast and had yet to receive replacement keys. We didn't exactly want to hang out in a hairy room. They finally showed up about 10 minutes later and moved us to another room. Again, no mini-fridge. Great. We got everything situated, assured ourselves this bed was clean, and my husband called the front desk to ask where to find ice. We were told there are no ice machines here -- the bellhop will bring you a bag. Guess how long we waited for that? At least another half-hour. So far this was not the relaxing vacation we had envisioned. It was a true pain in the ____. But we were learning that was only part of what was to come. The way these \"suites\" are constructed, there is one large suite (not the one we had) with a pool or water view. The remaining \"suites\" and closets are stacked side-by-side dorm room style -- all sharing a main breezeway. Our breezeway had two rooms (A & B) and two closets. The main door to the outside of this breezeway is extremely heavy and slams when the pressure changes. So any time you or your suite-mates (even if you have no idea who they are, as was our case) leaves the breezeway -- the main door slams, shakes the entire set of doors inside the breezeway, and it is impossible to sleep through. Then you have to deal with your suite-mate's door closing as well. And if they have maid-service, but you choose to sleep in -- too bad. Because with the breezeway situation the maid's cart might as well be in your room with the noise and door slamming. Somehow we survived our first night though and decided to reward ourselves with breakfast in bed the next morning. The little card was supposed to be hanging on the door by midnight and we had it out at 10 p.m. Forty-five minutes late the next morning we received a call that they had lost our order and just found the card at the front desk. They rushed the food up to our room because my husband was not exactly nice about it at this point. It tasted rushed. It was horrible. And on top of that, we are not coffee drinkers -- we drink Coke in the mornings. That is what we ordered. They brought up two room temp cans of Coke and two glasses -- but no ice. Our ice from the night before had already melted. So we had to call the front desk again just to get ice for our late breakfast. Another 20 minute wait. As mentioned by countless others, there is no real \"beach\" here (just rocks and water) and it's a bit of a drive to the main attractions in Key West. These things we could have overlooked if we'd had a nice room with a decent view and felt like we could have relaxed. But to open our window and simply get natural light in the first room would have been impossible. In the second room, we'd only have a view of tourists schlepping their luggage by or going to and from the pool. We had planned to hit the pool bar our second night there and didn't even bother based on the amount of money we'd already spent and the type of treatment we'd received from the staff. I've noticed that managers come in and comment on some of these reviews after the fact to \"gloss it over\", and they're more than welcome to do so with this post. However, I was sending live e-mails to the friend who helped us get this reservation as this was all occurring so this is not just sour grapes after the fact. We were miserable on the vacation, and depressed to be back home thinking our fifteenth anniversary was so important to this resort they couldn't even bother to give us a clean bed -- much less a view of that Beachside they're so proud to flaunt in their name. If you choose to stay here and get the larger suite in your breezeway, by all means feel lucky. If you get the rooms we had, my sincerest condolences. I wish I'd listened to reviews like mine in advance and went elsewhere! And we didn't even pay full-price! (P.S.

The hotel is situated right over the bridge driving into Key West - directly off a major bouelvard. If you plan to just enjoy the resort and not hit Duval - it may work out for you but you cannot walk to Duval Street. The hotel provides shuttle to Duval, once per hour. But in the early evening (6 pm) it gets a bit crowed for the shuttle rides and people do not respect that others have been waiting for the shuttle ahead of them...they push right onto the shuttle bus with disregard for the line waiting to climb aboard. Very rude. Once the shuttle was full, the hotel did provide additional transportation which was nice - since about 6 or 8 of us would have been waiting another hour for the next scheduled shuttle trip. This is a situation that could end badly with the wrong mix of people and the hotel should add more shuttles during the busy times or somehow monitor the line.

The only other close place to eat is a Denny's. The shuttle leaves for downtown every hour, and I witnessed fights break out over seats on the shuttle. The management did call for another van to take the many guests who want to go downtown, but who needs the hassle on vacation? Fights and pushing occur when trying to get on the shuttle to go back to the hotel as well.

Our unit was very spacious to say the least and was what they call a 1 BR Presidential suite, which is what I call the main unit of a 2 BR lockout. It was very well appointed with washer dryer, full kitchen, 1 master bath and also a 1/2 bath near the entry. 2 large screen TV'S king bed and super Marriott Bedding. The one thing we couldn't figure out was that the unit had a large dining room and table with seating for 6, but seemed if the unit is mostly used by 2 people. The unit overlooked the gulf which was worded as gulfview. Excellent view of the gulf with beach area right outside and 1 level below. There was a spiral stairway from the large balcony to the beachfront area which was very convienient. One could really compare the unit to a high end timeshare property, only with daily maid service for linen and cleaning with no extra charges. The pool area was nicely furnished with plenty of padded lounge chairs and tables. Beach area was well regarded by others around us too. Let me add though that the beach is not a typical beach that leads into the water. It is along the water but raised and swimming or fishing is not permitted ,at least not near the units. There is plenty of parking, even more than what is needed maybe? There is a parking garage on site and may be used if there would be a conventiion or the like. Otherwise seemed empty and a bit of wasted space. We did not use the onsite restaurant/lounge ''Tavern n Town'' but did have a couple of drinks from the poolbar called ''Bluebar''. Drinks were $9.00 minimum. I think a bit high by the time you add 20% for a tip,but I guess everyone that stays there can probably afford this. There were plenty of servers working the pool and beachside areas keeping patrons food and drinks refreshed which was a nice touch. All employees were very friendly and willing to accomodate. We had called housekeeping for several items and were delivered promptly As to the bad rap this place gets on the location, not sure why. They offer a shuttle from there to downtown every hour and returns every 1/2 hr. It is on the gulf, plenty of parking,and IN Key West ,so what more do you need? We had a rental car and used it everyday and always found parking downtown.The elegance and views of the place more than makes up for this location issue in my opinion. The only negative that we found was that Beachside can be a wedding destination and they shoo you off the beach 3 hours prior to the wedding. The beach front runs along the length of the facility and the wedding party gets the whole area? They only used about 150' of (my approx guess) of 600-800' total waterfront. All guests have paid a portion of their stay rate to have full use of the facilities. When they tell you you can't be here it did not set well us or with others around us. Facility credits could be a solution such as a free drink at the bar, food item or souvenier for putting you out , so to speak. We will consider staying at the Beachside Marriott again.

The only thing that is far way from the hotel is nice restaurants, and things to do. The complimentary shuttle offered was the other reason for my choice.

My only criticism is the hotel is laid out with separate buildings that require a little bit of a walk (although I've walked further through the hallways of many other hotels) and the rooms have windows facing onto the walkways of the open air hallways. I would prefer the windows to face onto a courtyard or pool, rather than having people walk past my windows, but the rooms were excellent quality and quiet.

We were very impressed with the hotel and the friendly personnel. The free shuttle to and from the airport and to downtown were great! One morning my daughter and I wanted to use the shuttle to get to the airport to pick up a rental car. We told the front desk we needed an airport shuttle. When it still hadn't arrived after only a five minute wait Dante, at the front desk, got a car and drove us himself. We were very impressed. We stayed in a two bedroom presidential suite. It was lovely with marble floors, granite and bathroom counters, and a large balcony. The bedrooms were beautifully furnished. We are Marriott Gold Elite members, but the hotel (which I believe was originally supposed to be a timeshare facility) did not have a concierge lounge. Providing our party with free breakfasts in the restaurant was a wonderful substitution. The breakfasts were great with an omelet and egg station, a wonderful selection of fresh fruits, breads, and pastries, and warm selections in chafing dishes. The cost of staying here was higher than we typically spend, but considering the amenities it was worth it. We enjoyed the pool bar and restaurant. Roxanne, a waitress, actually came over and introduced herself while I was reading in a lounge chair next to the pool. I enjoyed meeting her and she was our waitress when we had lunch poolside later that day. It was great to be served by someone so upbeat and cheerful! The pool is very large and heated. It was nice that there was also a beach although the sand had to be \"imported\" since this side of the island is surrounded by a reef. The Marriott made a wonderful effort to have the facility actually be beachside. We also really liked Joseph, the airport shuttle driver. A Key West \"native,\" he recommended several places for us to visit. It was obvious he, like the other personnel at the hotel, loved his job. We had originally reserved two rooms at the Fairfield Hotel, but when the Marriott Beachside with two bedrooms became available we changed our reservation. Renting a 2-bedroom unit with the free shuttles actually saved us money. Would we stay here again? You bet.

My father is wheel chair bound and the attention he received by the staff (particularly the pool attendant) was very caring and appreciated. During one evening, there was a bad storm that knocked out the elevator stranding my father in the room until early evening. The Marriot manager on duty tried very hard to find a workable solution (even volunteering to bring in paramedics) and did their best to make sure my father was comfortable, sending up free room service and removing that day's charges from the bill.

We regret not having enough time to try the happy-hour at the bar or dinner although the hotel restaurant had rave reviews in the local mags. The heated pool was perfect so was the pool-side bar - the bar tender made strong drinks! The little man-made beach and small pier are perfect for relaxing away from the crowds. The lobby and public restrooms were beautiful and very clean. Front desk staff were always very friendly and very helpful. The location was just a few minutes drive from Duval street. This was never a problem because of the \"Free\" Shuttle that ran \"hourly\"!! We just needed to be a bit more organized with our itinerary than if we stayed off Duval Street! A bonus: the drivers were great local guides - very friendly, helpful & accommodating. For those late nights out, the taxi ride back to the hotel was only $17. We drove from Miami to experience the drive down Route 1 drive and stayed from Sunday to Wednesday. Our one suggestion to the hotel would be to provide discounted parking at least during weekdays and off-season. We can't wait to go back to the Keys and we would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel!!", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBest Resort in the Keys\u201d", "Author": "Rocco_G13", "ReviewID": "UR78656158", "Content": "We were a group of 3 couples who booked last minute after concerns with a cruise/weather situation.

This hotel was by far one of the best we have ever stayed in. Outstanding staff at the front desk, especially Dante and the concigiere was named Raymond, also a great guy for service. The restaurant was fantastic, our server was Fatima, and she was teriffic. Great food, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Prices are what you might expect at an upscale hotel. Our favorite hangout was the swimming pool; just fantastic. The attendant sets up your lounger with towels or an umbrella, or if you request a cabana, he'll handle that also. The pool was clean and heated; seems strange in Key West but after two heavy rainstorms overnight, we were grateful for the heated pool. The pool bar has happy hour from 2:30 to 7:00; drinks are $4.00. Our bartender was Scott and he mixed the best Pina Coladas and Bay Breezes. The waitress service and food were also top notch; never a need to leave your chair or the water. Needless to say, this was the biggest part of our hotel bill. In back of the pool area is a little man made beach; not too bad but don't expect a natural beach because Key West is all coral reef. You can also rent jet skies at the dock and take a leisurely tour of the island or just use the skies for speed. Our stay only lasted 3 nights and the worst part was leaving this paradise. We were considering a cruise for our 20th anniversary, but we will now seriously consider going back to this location. By the way, we took a shuttle from Ft.Lauderdale airport to our hotel, a distance of 4.5 hours. I didn't feel like driving that distance so we took the \"Keys Shuttle\". It stops at Miami airport, Key Largo, Islemorada, Marathon, and then on to Key West. Our driver was Mario; simply a great driver. He took us door to door; round trip, at less than the price of a rental car.

The bar has a \"happy hour\" that is something like 5 hours long, which is the majority of the time it is open. The beer is only $1.50 during this time, opposed to the $5 regular price. Cocktails are also half price. We booked the jet ski tour that leaves from the Marriott Resort beach. I would highly recommend this tour. It takes approximately two hours to travel around the entire island, with frequent stops to point out landmarks and breaks to just play around on the jet skis. We were able to book this through the pool-side concierge attendent. The pool area is great too, with private cabanas that can be had first-come, first-serve.

I love Marriott and their great hotels. As you can imagine, I am rewarded for my loyalty. In this economy, it is great to get some perks for being away from family and friends. The Girlfriend and I wanted to get away to the beach for a week. What better place than the Florida Keys? After doing some research, we decided to use my reward points for the Marriott Beachside. I had plenty of the required points it asked for. The website also said that it would be an extra $80/night (upgrade fee) for a three bedroom suite. Fine, split between 4 people, that is nothing. It was a steal, compared to some of the hotels down there. Plus, we had a great view, kitchen, and tons of room to move. I printed out my confirmation, and moved on with my life. I did notice, however, that the confirmation had both, $80 a night upgrade fee, and a $200 a night upgrade fee. I was quite confused and decided to call Marriott. The first time I called, a lovely young lady assured me that it was the $80/night fee, not the $200. This put my mind at ease and I resumed my life. When it came closer to our check in date, I called the corporate number again. I had a very nice man tell me not to worry, that we would only pay an $80/night upgrade fee. To be even more confident, I even called the Hotel itself. They, for the third time, confirmed that we would only pay $80/night. Are you starting to see a pattern here? We checked in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 At check in, we were greeted with smiles, received free breakfast tickets for every day we were there (which they did not have to do), and was given assurance for the 4th time, that we were only responsible for the $80/night upgrade fee and incidentals. This hotel was magnificent! Great View! Great Food + Drinks! Pool was awesome! Staff was friendly and accommodating! Everything worked and was Clean! We had a wonderful stay! We checked out\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Guess how much they quoted me that we had to pay? \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6$200/night upgrade fee. After all of that!!!! Obviously, I asked to see the manager on duty. He said to get my receipt and come back down. Did that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I even brought my room key holder, which had the rate of $80/night printed on it. This place would not budge! They could not even tell me why 4 people confirmed the lower price with me. I asked if we could call the corporate number. I think the manager called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in case a customer is yelling at you, call this number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotline. I was told that I was wrong, and that they would have never told me that. So, in other words, they called me a liar. I had to pay $1000, instead of $400. I would have stayed and argued all day, but I had to catch a ride back to the mainland. This totally ruined the rest of our trip, and then had to come home early because of budgetary reasons. There was no record I talked with four different people, even though I was told there would be. No one could tell me why I had to pay the $200/night upgrade. NO ONE!! I asked the hotel to get back to me and tell me why my confirmation sheet said one price and the Hotel demanded another. No one has contacted me and Marriott still avoids the question when I ask them. No one can give me a straight answer!!! I am giving this hotel a 3 star rating.

Being the frugal person that I am, I did NOT want to be unhappy at the end of my honeymoon because of lots of little charges. We knew the Marriott charged for daily parking, but that was fine.

We started with the Marriott because it's right at the entrance of town. Front Desk was nice and immediately offered a special rate for three nights. We were shown the suite on which I will comment later and then decided to think about it while checking out some other hotels. We were at Casa Marina , very nice but apparently the front desk and their computer did not find all available rooms (see my separate review) so we moved on. To make it short, Southernmost is very nice if you pick one of the newly remodeled rooms which are gorgeous but come at a stiff 400$, Reach Resort has also nicely appointed new rooms but the lobby area and the ways to the rooms are not five star and show some fatigue. For lesser money the Paradise Inn looked absolutely ok and well located but looking for some more pool and outdoor space we headed back direction Marriott. On the way we checked out the Parrot Key which is a beautiful property albeit the sister hotel in Marathon, the Tranquility Bay where we had lunch before, was more impressive. Back to the Marriott: We checked in and took our car down the way to the parking which is conveniently located underneath the room levels. Some reviewes complained that this gives the place a motel like atmosphere but I would rather call it a condominium style. You don't have to carry your bags from the parking, help was offered but we didn't need it. The stairways and doorways were all very clean and albeit not posh looked very nice. The one bedroom suites are vast. They have a full kitchen, dryer and washer which is very convenient if you are on a multi-stop trip. Great bed, superb bathroom. Nice balcony with a separate sundeck on top, however you would have to carry the loungers up the stairs if you want to bask in the sun on the roof. We had a view to the pool which is big for Key West standards and a partial view to the gulf side of the ocean. Yes, the beach is manmade and not suitable for swimming but with a car you can easily access other beaches within 10-15 minutes ride. The restaurant served excellent cocktails and very decent food. Small downsides are the lack of a minibar and that room service due to the size of the property takes very long to get to your room. It is also not available 24/7. Overall, this is a very good hotel for the traveller who is mobile. They also have a shuttle to downtown but as with all shuttles you know that they never run when you really need them. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for great accomodation and like to live independently while at a hotel.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brentwood", "Title": "\u201cGet away\u201d", "Author": "JohnBrentwood", "ReviewID": "UR66467799", "Content": "This is a nice resort.

Don't expect a beach - there is only a tiny patch of sand - but the ocean views are beautiful. The pool is great, except for the multiple weddings booked at or near the pool while we were there - three in fact, in one weekend! The food was ok. The restaurants were typical hotel fare. We dined out every night. The concierge seemed clueless about the pricing of restaurants, what to wear there, etc. She also had no idea that Mallory Square had been closed down, even though that is a huge tourist spot.

We are frequent travelers and use Trip Advisor extensively to select accommodations for personal travel. This was our third vacation with our 13 month old son. I selected Marriott Beachside because they offered one bedroom suites with a kitchen and they were well rated on Trip Advisor. The hotel was lovely, the staff attentive and the pool was very enjoyable. Overall, I found the accommodations to be fabulous. However, I have a couple comments that I didn't read in others reviews that I think are noteworthy: 1. This hotel is at the intersection of Rt 1 and N Roosevelt. This is a very busy intersection...and consequently, fairly loud from a street noise standpoint. If you are in Building 2, which is directly next to S. Roosevelt, it can get kind of loud, especially if you are in a room closer to the lobby. However, you don't hear the road noise from the room, only from the balcony. I was kind of surprised that this had not really been mentioned in any of the other reviews (that I read). 2. The rooms are beautiful and have marble floors. The marble floors look nice, but are kind of dangerous from a toddler standpoint - we had a couple faceplants and head knocks that resulted in some bumps and bruises. The minute you spill anything on the floors they become very trecherous and slippery. They are also impossible to keep clean. I found myself wearing socks because the floors were rather gritty. Housekeeping would clean them everyday, but it seemed as if as soon as they cleaned them, they were gritty again.

We were NOT dissappointed at all! Our room was beautiful.. it was on the third floor with a private roof top sunning area above our balcony. We had a gorgeous view of the ocean and spent a LOT of time resting, reading and napping in the comfy furniture out there! Good going with the ceiling fan out there!! Made it nice & cool in the shade! Inside the room was so spacious and comfortable. Full kitchen including a washer and dryer (came in very handy!!). Dining area, living room, bath and 1/2 and master bedroom fit for a king.. the master bath was wonderful too with the HUGE tiled shower area and jacuzzi tub. Not one thing was forgotten in laying these rooms out! We thorougly enjoyed the pool and beach area and spent a lot of time laying in the lounge chairs reading and sunning. The pier on the beach was often a nice quiet place to go and watch the water for while. It was so quiet and relaxing that it was hard to believe that we were just off the main route on to an off of Key West. The shuttle service to Duval street was very convenient and while we missed the last run a couple of nights having too much fun downtown the cab fares weren't too bad to get back to the hotel (Under $20). The drivers were always entertaining and had a lot of information about the area and suggestions on things to do and see. The maid service was wonderful.. cleaning our room top to bottom ever day! Even hand washing dishes if there weren't enough in the diswasher! I asked for extra wash clothes one day and had plenty every day after that! Very friendly and accommodating!! Being Marriott Plantinum members we were given free breakfast buffet every day of our stay and it was very good. Made to order omlettes, delicious fresh fruit (LOVED the pineapple) and tons of other selections. We also had our last dinner at the Tavern & Town and it was incredible. Pretty pricey but worth it! The Key Lime Pie was the best I had the entire time! We used the fitness room one morning we were there but decided after that to take morning walks on the nice wide sidewalk along Route 1 and see more sights. We signed up for the Jet Ski tour that is on site and really enjoyed that experience a lot. We even saw dolphins! I can not think of one thing I could or would complain about for this trip.. except to say I had to check out and come home. We hope to someday get back to the Beachside.

We were part of a group who had been there two night prior to our arrival. We arrived in Key West on Saturday via the Key West Express and all we wanted to do was rest. The shuttle from the ferry station was a far walk (with luggage) to Margaritaville on Duval St, the scheduled pick up location for hotel guests. Fortunately, the shuttle arrived about 5 min after we got there. We checked in and after trying to find our building, finally got to the unit and tried to rest up. Because the buildings are so close together with a \"courtyard\" in between, everything echo's. Between housekeeping pushing carts across the bumpy hallways and the kids yelling on the first floor, needless to say we did not get any rest. We had reservations for dinner at a restaurant on the water, and were guaranteed there would be two vans available to take us downtown. When the first shuttle van arrived, other guests got on and they didn't have room for us. After complaining to the front desk, they ended up calling for 2 taxi vans to take us downtown. The hotel picked up the tab, but apparently the same thing happened the night before. When you want to return to the hotel and if you miss the last shuttle at 11:20 pm, or if they don't have room for everyone, you have to take a cab back to the hotel. This runs anywhere from $20-25.

The room was spotless!! The staff had thought of everything except scented bath oil. The room was the size of a small apartment and very exquisitely decorated.

I wished we had planned to stay longer after I saw the room.The kitchen was so nice that I felt like throwing a meal together and coming from a woman who hates to cook that is something!! We didn't have any nice clothes with us to dine out so we decided to walk west on Roosevelt Street which has an ocean view the entire way. About 1 mile down we came to a grocery store (Publix) that carried a large selection of wine. After dinner in the suite we walked around the grounds. They are beautifully cared for and there is a small beach area with a small pier. It didn't look like an inviting place to swim, mainly because a bunch of dead fish were laying on the shore. We did ask about it and were told they had died because of the freezing cold spell Florida just had. We had noticed the stench on our drive down and had wonderd about the bad odor. The bed felt so good after the long ride and the soft, quality linen and plush down comforter were heavenly . The unit number was 219A and I don't know if all the units are similar or not.

It had a full kitchen, 2 flatscreen TV's, a conference table, a coffee table with a nice couch, a separate room with a queen size bed and 2 bathrooms, which one of had a bathtub and a shower. We also had a balcony that had lying chairs facing the courtyard on the 2nd floor. The great thing was, you could access the courtyard by going down the stairs on the balcony, so you wouldn't have to walk out and around. The front desk staff was attentive and professional, checking us in within a minute, but for some reason, gave us 3 extra room keys. Since I chose the couch to sleep on, I called the reception and asked for some extra pillows and a blanket. The room maids came up in a bit with a rather strange blanket that was pretty uncomfortable (it was like a big rag) and I was handed it over in a sealed plastic bag. That was a bit odd. The phones were cordless, making it easy to place calls, but a bit difficult to make the phone work and the handset was a bit too quiet. They also have a tikibar, a pool, jacuzzi and chairs next to the pool. The beach was pretty much something to laugh at with a small strip of sand, literally maybe about 25 feet wide and 10 feet tall. But Key West isn't known for its beaches anyway, so that's nothing surprising, nice try anyway. There was a nice pier with a view to the sea. Our friend stayed in the next room, which connected, and was a lot smaller, but still very nice. The downside was the Internet connection - they offer complimentary DSL, but no WiFi in the rooms, just at the pool. Fortunately enough, my laptop's wireless card is pretty good, so I caught a good signal from the pool when sitting on the balcony, not sure about the upper floors though. The hallways are a bit motel-like, they are on the outside and you have to walk to your room. A weird thing was, the balcony doors seem to be unlocked, as we got drunk one night and walked back into our room from the balcony stairs only to discover our friend disappeared with everything taken with him. Turns out, we went in the wrong room, which was completely unoccupied and nobody would probably have ever known if we stayed in the newlyfound Suite. We just walked out the door back to our own room. They also offer a complimentary shuttle to Duval Street, where all the action is, which leaves every hour and comes back at 11pm latest. It's quite far from Duval Street, so it's hard to get to the center of action without taking the shuttle if you're planning on drinking.

One of the best run Marriott's I have stayed at.. (I'm a Marriott Groupie) We stayed for the week. I used my Marriott reward points and reserved a 3 bedroom pool view and I had our family upgraded to 3 bedroom oceanfront. Great room!!! 1 king, 1 king, 2 singles, then a pull out couch in living room. Coffee on the balcony every morning, looking at the Key West water and listening to the birds is my kind of vacation. I have 5 children. From college down to elementary school. This was our family vacation before school started. A great place to be to have time together. Beach is small, but the beach chairs are thick pads and when sitting in them, you are on your own private beach, literally. The pool is also perfect in every way. The pool service was excellent and the poolside food was delicious. The restaurant on site is also 5 star and perfect for a romantic evening (we left kids in room). We did rent a van since we landed in Fort Lauderdale (cheap tickets for 7 pp) which made touring Key West easier (But a good 4 - 5 hours drive). Duvall street is just a long street with lots of shops. We are not really into that sort of stuff, but a great place to walk after dinner with the kids and get an icecream cone from one of the shops. We did a day at Fort Zachary Taylor Park right there in Key West. A beautiful place with picnic tables and a beautiful beach and great rocks to climb for the kids. There is quite a bit of chunky like coral on the beach in some areas. But overall a beautiful park. The fort was a great afternoon little walking tour (right next to beach). Kids also loved this. We also spent a day at Smather's beach. This beach has soft sand and you could walk from one end to the other end in a short amount of time. So we walked back and forth several times and sunbathed. Nice relaxing day. Parking across the street was free. This Marriott treated us like I expected to be treated. Anything with the Marriott name should be run like this hotel. Cleaning service every day. The service provided us an ample supply of coffee for the coffee maker, shampoo and toiletries. The maid service also set up my children's stuffed animals so nicely on the beds, which they were so excited to come back to see how they were set up. Nice job! We brought a suitcase of our own food from home, but there is a large Publix Grocery store only minutes away with everything you could possibly need. I made all our meals in the room. I made several calls for things I needed, like a spatula, a cookie sheet, and an extra blanket, etc. and room service was there immediately. (7 pp need lots of things). The room service people were very nice about my many requests. I really appreciated that. The workout room is small, but nobody every used it much. The machines are set up in front of the windows looking out over the bay. A beautifully set up work out room. Nice shower room too and all the equipment was in excellent working order. Excellent hotel. We loved it and would go again.

When I did go to bar to order food bartender 'forgot' to put order in when I came back 45 mins later to check on order and she kind of blamed me and didn't even apologize. SO - pool service left a lot to be desired. Also another downer- no fridge in standard room. Had to order ice everyday for the cooler bc there is no ice machine either. One more downer room service forgot a few things when we ordered bfast in. But I guess that can happen anywhere. So everything except for pool service and the lack of fridge was great. Room prices are great considering it's a luxury hotel. Hotel is just as pictured in the photos which is a plus. We didn't want to get out of that comfy marriot bed which they're known for.

Even so, when we walked in I thought there had to be some mistake. This was not a hotel suite - it was a condo, and it was gorgeous.

I viewed the location being away from Old Town as a plus, considering it took no more than 10 minutes to get there from the hotel, and you didn't have to worry about any noise from Duval St. As other reviewers mentioned, we experienced issues with the pool area. We went down at 9:45 am and every chair was already being used. It's not that the pool area is tiny; it's just that since Key West is not particularly known for its beaches, people are making use of the pool. The private beach at the Marriott is nothing to write home about...it has a nice view of a landfill across the water. (But if you want to try a beach in Key West, try the one at Zachary Taylor State Park - very nice, but take some water shoes, the coastline is rocky). Staff couldn't have been nicer, and we were given a card to get a free buffet breakfast during each day of our stay, which was great. The free parking underneath our building was also a very nice unexpected perk, because their website mentioned a $20 per day parking fee.

We booked the resort with a conference rate, for a king-sized room, but the front desk personnel were more than accomodating and upgraded us to a king suite, gulf view, for no additional charge. My philosophy for upgrades is always, \"just ask\". Generally speaking, good hotels will accomodate you if there is room. The suite was exquisite, fully-equipped kitchen, very comfortable living area, very comfortable beds. My only complaint would be the bathrooms - if you have any physical limitations, the shower/tub is very high and would be difficult to get in and out of. If you are staying here for any length of time, be sure to run to the Publix, which is located only about 1/4 mile down the road to stock up and use the kitchen. It beats pricey breakfasts and lunches out and the kitchen is beautiful, with everything you need. We never met anyone who wasn't more than willing to be accomodating. Our conference had a reception poolside, and although the pool bar closed, they re-opened and fully stocked the area to accomodate our group, with friendly (not hostile) servers. The concierge directed us to a great local spot for lunch, which I would highly recommend - Hurricane Joe's - it is within walking distance of the resort. Although it was chilly, we did manage to make use of the pool facilities, which are lovely. Service at the outside restaurant is good, food tasty and fairly reasonable. I agree with previous reviewers - no need to rent a car - we made extensive use of the shuttle service, which was always prompt and taxis into town are inexpensive as well, and very safe. We dined out frequently and each meal was better than the next, but I would highly recommend Santiago's Bodega (very good tapas restaurant) and La Trattoria (an Italian restaurant on Duval Street) that was phenomenal with a wonderful server and a great wine steward. We took the trolley tour and I'm not sure it was worth the pricey $25/person plux tax.

I will stay at this resort every time I come to Key West which is quite often as long as they have availability. When I first found this location, I was looking for a decent place to stay at a decent price. I stay in Key West 6 to 8 times a year and while I love luxury, I cannot afford to stay in the $300-$500 resorts when I go so often. This Resort turned out to have the luxury I would expect from the higher priced resorts but at a much more reasonable rate. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. I absolutely did not feel like I was staying in a hotel, which Beachside Resort is not, but felt like I was staying in home or condo. This was not a small room with a small kitchenette or a bathroom that is unusually shaped because they tried to fit everything into a small space. This was real luxury. I live in a big house and the master bath here was as big if not bigger then what I have in a big 5 bedroom house. The kitchen was absolutely a complete kitchen of the best cabinets, appliances and marble counter tops. In the one bedroom suite, the bedroom is a completely seperate room from the Kitchen/Dining/Living room and was bigger then any hotel room I have ever stayed in by itself. And finally, the living room and deck were both beautiful and comfortable with LCD TV's and cushioned patio furniture. The rooms however are not the only suprises. The pool area was so beautifully appointed with its very large swimming pool, comfortable lounge chairs including double lounge chairs for the romantic couples, unbelievable landscaping, and Cabanas with curtains when you want a little privacy. Ask the bar tender at the poolside bar and restaurant for a chocolate milk shake or anything else not on the menu. If they know it or you can describe it then they will make it. I have stayed many times in Key West directly on Duval Street thinking that I wanted to be as close as possible to the action. This location is even better. They have a shuttle running between the resort and Duval that is free and you do not have to listen to the motorcycles and screaming all night long like you would if you stayed on Duval. You can stay and party on Duval as long as you like and then go to a extremely comfortable and quite room when you are ready for a quite and luxureous bed. I read a lot of the reviews before staying here and was concerned about the bad remarks about the beach. They are right that the beach area is not for swimming. The sand does not run into the water as it is held back by a retaining wall and the water is not what I would normally swim in. But for laying out in the sun it is fantastic. They have a few hammocks available for those wanting to really relax and the sand is soft with no rocks unlike the real beaches on the south side of Key West. I normally much prefer the beach to the pool when going to any beach resort but this beach has the benefits of both as it is directly between the pool and the ocean. You can enjoy both at the same time. You don't have to leave the pool and go a couple hundred yards to get to the beach. They are right together. Lastly, the restaurant was fantastic. They had some very unusual dishes and I strongly recommend the Ahi Tuna. Yes prices are high as you would expect at any hotel or resort but not extravagant. You are in a tourist area and prices everywhere are a little higher then normal. I eat at the hotel restaurant at least 1 or 2 times whenever I go. I cannot vouche for there breakfasts though as I love cooking breakfast in the room and never made it to the restaurant at that time. As I said at the start. I will stay at this location again and again. I cannot give a stronger recommendation. I was so impressed that I am actually checking on this review that I am willing to be contacted which is something I have never done before.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pensacola, FL", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful but dirty and service lacking.\u201d", "Author": "crissy08", "ReviewID": "UR21848695", "Content": "The units are beautiful but the tile floors were very dirty and after maid service several things were not replaced like one of the robes, the kitchen towels and all the toiletries except for a shower cap and q tips (there was no shampoo, even on the first night).

At check out, the housekeeping manager on duty appologized but offered no compensation. She said someone had gone to our room to replace a lightbulb and bring something but that the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign was up. If they had called back we would have been expecting them. I would not stay here again. They don't pay attention to details, don't seem to care about making your stay comfortable or if you come back.

We were given a complimentary upgrade on our room and when we walked in, it was amazing. The \"room\" was a one bedroom condo complete with a full size kitchen, dining room, living room, bedroom and 1 1/2 baths. The room was spotless and had all the comforts of home! The staff at the hotel were wonderful too. We had dinner at their restaurant, Tavern N Town and it was fantastic! We both had the Filet Mignon and it was delicious. We had dinner at Morton's in Chicago and this was much better and alot cheaper ($250 for dinner for 2 at Mortons; $150 including tip at Tavern N Town). Overall our experience was unbelievable and we highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Key West. As other reviews mentioned, it was on the quieter side of town, but with the shuttle service they provide it was not a problem for us. My only wish is that I didn't stay at Beachside longer.

All modern room with large tub, and trey vaulted ceiling. Impressive thick towels. The king bed was very comfortable and the service was friendly. I do have to admit that even if this is a resort, they should have ice machines and buckets available to the guests. I ended up going to the convience store for a 10 lb bag of ice, because I was afriad of the 4.00 delivery charge plus the cost of the ice and glasses. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, if the price we got was available again. Oh yes, the Tavern restaurant was fabulous.

We pre-booked a one bedroomed suite through Expedia and got an amazing rate of $152 per night. The photos on the hotel website look great, but we all know thats not always what you get. Well this is the exception!!! We have a little private entrance and then into our suite. When we opened the door we dropped our bags and ran around checking everything out. it is totally amazing and I would reccomend it to anyone. Its huge, 2 bathrooms, huge comfy kingsize bed, flat screen TV's in the bedroom and living room and the kitchen is very high spec with everything you could need. Underground car park is a bonus and the pool, cabanas and little private beach are great to relax and watch the sun go down. We only intended to stay 2 nights but are currently on our fourth and final night....we go home tomorrow :( If your looking for a little luxury, great service, great location and much more you wont be dissapointed.

I waited for husband to check out an hour into trip found legs arms and back were itching like crazy. Had to stop get medicine. I called hotel to inform I thought sand fleas were in room they stated thanks for calling they will take care of it. Went to Dr when returned home it was bed bug bites. Called hotel informed them and they refuse to admit and say there was not a problem . I advise anyone who goes do not sleep on sofa. I dont think they are easy to get rid of so it would need in depth exterminating and all furniture will need to be removed and destroyed. If you had any problems w/ bites in a specific room please write a review. I know I got them there b/c I did not sleep anywhere else and they only come out in certain times of early morning and it takes time to start to itch.
