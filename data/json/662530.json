We choose the Motel One Berlin Alexanderplatz mainly because of location and because of limited availability among other hotels in the city. This was my first experience with the Motel Once chain/brand. Firstly: yes it's rather inexpensive: yet I would not call it good value. Mainly because hotel rates in Berlin are rather cheap in any hotel compared to other European cities and also because you get more for the same price with chains like Ibis or the AllSeasons properties. The hotel does position itself as trendy, design, fancy, whatever you wanna call it: and indeed there was an effort of decoration and loon'n'feel that went into the property and these things are always a matter of taste: yet it's nothing to write home about. The hotel is nicely located at just about 100m from Alexanderplatz station where you can catch multiple subway lines and commuter trains. It is also in decent walking distance to Berlin's most important museums and some of the main tourist destinations. The hotel faces on one side the very busy railway tracks, I can imagine those rooms are rather noisy. We were lucky enough to get a room that didn't face the tracks. The hotel features a rather big lounge area in the lobby with loads of seating available. There is free wifi in the lounge and breakfast is served here and you can get drinks and snacks all day from the bar. Rooms are VERY small! They are indeed smaller than anything you get at a similar price at competing budget chains. There is not even a cupboard to put your clothes away. With two people and some luggage: the room is literally crowded. Yes it's a budget hotel so I don't expect a lounge area or balcony or whatever... yet still at least an armoire and a place where to put my luggage. Rooms have AC which is good, not standard in Berlin. Generally both the rooms and bathrooms and the public areas of the hotel are very clean. The room did smell a little strangely however, which housekeeping did notice, so whenever they cleaned the room; they would have opened the window causing the room to be freezing every time we came back. Annoying... Also above average for this type of price range is the bathroom; its very small: so watch out when taking a shower (I did not manage a single time to take a shower without causing the entire bathroom to get wet...) yet its much better than what you get with similar hotels that will give you a plastic, pre-fabricated bathroom. Regarding sleep quality: its not great. The pillows are rather hard and unhandy: there is no extra pillow. Mattress is okay. We did not take breakfast. All in all: I can recommend this hotel for it's location only. Regarding actual price-value; you can get better options. +location +/- clean (yet room did smell funny) +/- bathrooms (small though) -room size (not even a cupboard) -sleep quality -no free wifi in room (ridiculous for a hotel that's supposed to be for GenY travelers)", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNew modern chic\u201d", "Author": "travelbug1959", "ReviewID": "UR122430194", "Content": "We chose this hotel due to the closeness of the Alexanderplatz and the railway station.

It's also very close to the Hackescher Markt and Oranienburgerstrasse for a variety of restaurants, bars and shops. The Hotel staff were friendly, professional and very helpful. Our room was clean and modern, with a good shower, and it was all that we needed for a tourist visit when we tend to be out and about all day. The Hotel's motif is a funky modern design.

That's why Berlin is so refreshing. Take European prices, slash it by 25%, and then remove a few Euros - that's Berlin price for you. Even so, Motel One offers excellent value for money. I stayed at Alexanderplatz (downtown Berlin) for about 65 Euros a night, and it was awesome. In no way was it a 'budget' hotel. My window literally opened out into the square, with an outstanding view of the TV Tower in all its 1960s charm, just 3 minutes walk away. Even closer is the Alexanderplatz station, which has connections to nearly every major landmark within the city (as well as, if I'm right, to other cities). My tour met at the entrance to the TV Tower (as do many other tours), so that was convenient as well. Alexanderplatz is also 'happening' with pubs, eateries and hangout joints just outside the main square. The Museum district (more like a square) and many other places of interest (DDR Museum, etc) are walkable, but one can also catch buses from the bus stop which is also just a few steps away. For such an awesome location, M.O.Alex's rates are very reasonable. Upon arrival, I got checked in in under 3 minutes. I arrived at midnight but there were no hassles at the desk. Payment is up-front, by cash or card. Ask the receptionist for your wi-fi login/password (its quick, and hey..its free!) The room was sufficiently large, very well done, and had just the right amount of furniture. The bathroom was a little small but spotless and well stocked. Breakfast is a buffet that an Easterner might label bland, but it worked. Mostly the usual European fare - Cereal, Croissant, butter/jam/spread, Juices, Tea/Coffee, Fruit salad. Nothing exciting but decent stuff to get you on your way.

But a pretty cheap motel.\u201d", "Author": "DrHickenlocher", "ReviewID": "UR41677310", "Content": "First of all, I'm sure the term \"Motel\" doesn't have the same negative connotation in Berlin as it does in America. From all outward appearances, Motel One is a decent business hotel along the lines of a Holiday Inn Express. Unfortunately, my wife and I found the accommodations a little closer to Motel 6. Motel One Alexanderplatz is in an almost perfect location. The bus stop to the TXL Express is about a block away. The S-Bahn and U-Bahn train stations are just across the street, complete with all their cheap fast-food joints. All the shopping you could want in Berlin is around the Alexanderplatz plaza itself. Museum Island is about a kilometer's walk away, with Hackesche Hof even closer. The location alone earns the place 3 out of 5. Unfortunately, the accommodations themselves were just adequate, and we're far from snobbish people. We're the type to stay in Hilton Garden Inns, not Westins, just looking for someplace clean and decent to give us what we need. Unfortunately, we didn't get it all here. THE GOOD: * The location, as I've said. We were doing the City Segway Tour (HIGHLY recommended. Give Walid a raise!), which is right across the street at the TV tower. * There's also an internet cafe/telephone center at the RENT A BIKE right next to Fat Tire Bike Tours. Calls to America were 0.75 Euros to connect + 0.09/minute. We were able to call home for about 1.50 euros each night without buying a calling card. Definitely recommended if you're only going to be in town a short while. * The TV had a channel playing EUROSPORT! I could watch the US Open!!! THE BAD: * There's no phone in the room. At all. I guess the business hotel assumes everyone has cell phones. Good thing we found that telephone center across the street. * There's no safe in the room. The only hotel not to have it, we instead had to keep our passports and valuables on our persons. Mildly annoying. * The shower would go scalding hot about once a minute. You could feel it happening, giving yourself time to get out of the way. But it wasn't an isolated incident. Two straight nights, showers for both myself and my wife. Six minute shower = six times you have to duck out of the way, not good when you've got facial soap creeping into your eyes. * As usual in Europe (except in our Rome hotel!), the shower only had a half-partition of glass, meaning a lot of water ended up on the floor. The shower also had the weakest pressure of our three hotels, despite only being on the 2nd floor and supposedly in the \"newest\" building compared to Paris and Rome. * Also as usual in Europe, the outlets were recessed, meaning one of our converters couldn't get into the circular hole, and was useless. * No double bed. The two single beds were pushed together, but had separate sheets over the futon mattress and separate blankets as well. When my wife and I tried to cuddle, the mattress would slide on the wood platform away, and one of us would fall in between the two mattresses. * Unfortunately, we also met the only German staff employee who wouldn't smile at us. Our waiters at restaurants were great. Museum staff were quite pleasant. Even other Motel One staff were very polite, one gentleman trying to get a restaurant reservation for us (though the place turned out to be closed that night for a private party). It was so nice to have such friendly Germans after the comparably aloof Parisiens... except for Claudia. She was highly efficient at the front desk both checking us in and out two days later. But she was perpetually frowning in a military sort of sternness. Smile for your guests when the arrive, huh? GOOD TO KNOW: * I think Wi-Fi is free in the lobby, but we didn't have a computer. The \"business center\" was a desktop that charged 6 Euros an hour or something. The Internet cafes at Fat Tire or RENT A BIKE charge like 2 Euros an hour. Internet is NOT free in the room. * There IS a pay phone down the street, as long as you can brave the cold. Again, no phones inside. Fortunately, the front desk DID call to make try and make that reservation for us. * The train tracks literally run right behind the hotel. Fortunately, the glass is pretty good at soundproofing. You can hear trains if you try, but if you're not listening for the sound, you probably won't notice. * There is a market across the street from the Hackesche Hof restaurant, a few blocks away, if you want to buy cases of water and sodas and snacks. All in all, Motel One was in the perfect place. But if you have any desires to have a phone, a hotel safe, a bed that doesn't slide you away from your loved one, or a shower that won't scald you, try and find somewhere else.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sashina", "ReviewID": "UR38573122", "Content": "I am always dubious of hotels located near man railways stations however couldn't fault this branch of Motel One.

The room size was not huge, but was perfectly adequate for us. The decor was just as the hotel website shows, and the addition of the flat screen tv with 'fish and sea' screensaver was very relaxing!

In fact, it was very tempting to give it just 1 star to drag the average down, so that hopefully there will be vacancies next time I visit Berlin! But the sheer value that this hotel offers for the price is something I have yet to see anywhere else I've traveled. There are bones that can be picked (and I shall pick at them), but this... this is what hotels twice the cost should aspire to! The Motel One Alexanderplatz is a brand-new building (when I looked it up on google earth, it was still a parking lot), built just off of Alexanderplatz proper -- which is about as ideal a location in Berlin as you could hope for. It is a very spread out city, with many different neighborhoods and areas, each with their own \"center.\" But Alexanderplatz is about as near as you can get to being in the center of the center! You're around the corner from the express bus stop to/from TXL, and a block away from the Alexanderplatz train station (regional and S-bahn trains), U-Bahn stations, and tram stops. Not only that, you're right next door to one of the bigger department stores (Galleria Kaufhaus... it's not KaDeWe, but it will do in a pinch if you need a pair of shorts), and one of the biggest tourist destinations (the Ferhnsehturm -- which also works as a handy landmark to navigate by). Other major attractions, like the Rotes Rathaus, Nikolaiviertel, Museuminsel, Neue Synagogue, and others are in easy walking distance. Those with a thirst for nightlife will find Club Weekend catty-corner across Alexanderplatz, Kino Internationale just down the road, and the legendary Berghain a cheap cab ride (or rather long drunken stagger) away. I'm not sure if there's any other ways to say \"the location is perfect,\" so I'll move on to the hotel proper. The design is clean, cool, and contemporary, with a lovely series of lounges with free wi-fi on the entrance level. Drinks, coffee, and light snacks are available, and in the morning, a large breakfast buffet that is arguably worth the 6 Euros/day extra. The front desk staff tends to the young, attractive, and very helpful. I had a package sent to me when I first stayed here, but it got held up in customs until after I had left. I figured it was a loss, but when I made a return trip (I really loved Berlin) over a month later, the staff remembered me, and the package, and presented it to me on check-in! The rooms are small, but the minimalist decor and cool tones help keep it from being claustrophobic. The big windows open, depending on what room you have, on the back courtyard, Rosa Luxembourg Strasse, or... the massive, 4-track elevated Stadtbahn running through the city (the Alexanderplatz station is just east of the hotel). The first time I stayed here, I had a room facing this, and was surprised by how quiet it was. I was, however, on the 7th floor, so I'm not sure if the noise would be worse on lower floors or for light sleepers. But for someone who's loved trains since he was a kid, it was, if anything, an extra perk! The bed and pillows were very comfortable, climate control was a cinch. I do wish that there was a proper desk chair in the room, however... sitting on a cushioned cube for too long isn't very comfortable on the back. I'd suggest an alternate arrangement if you're planning on spending a lot of time in your room working on business at the desk. Also, wi-fi, while available in the rooms, is EXPENSIVE. Not only is it overpriced, but your time will continue to run out whether you're logged on or not. Again, there is free wi-fi down in the lobby/lounge, but if you're planning on doing a lot of emailing and chatting from your bed, be prepared to fork over some Euros. The bathroom unfortunately has a shower that doesn't close, making it almost certain that you WILL get the floor wet, no matter what you do. It was, however, clean, nicely laid out, and not too cramped. The toiletry products are on the cheap side, so you might want to bring your own, or pick something up at a convenience store. Everything was cleaned thoroughly and promptly by housekeeping. All in all, I don't think I could have been happier. Their price could almost double, and it would still be a reasonable value (though at that point, I might consider upgrading to something bigger, with a bathtub and more amenities). However, at the prices I paid (about 50 Euros/night), Motel One Alexanderplatz was an incomparable value. You can keep your eyes open for other good values in Berlin, but if the price is still good, you will NOT be disappointed with this hotel. Great location, wonderful staff, quiet peaceful rooms....

The rooms were decorated in aqua fabrics and dark brown wood, with a glass-walled shower with powerful head and black granite tile, plus a modern ceramic bowl sink with shiny stainless fixtures.

I was surprised by the hotel lobby, which was decorated in a shocking but beautiful electric blue, contrasted with dark wood flooring and shiny metallic lamps. All in the latest design, which is the high point of the hotel inside of the rooms, as well. The bathrooms are lovely, with spacious black-stoned showers, ultra-modern sinks, electric blue curtains and bedding, that are in the best taste. A flat-screen TV with dozens of channels in many languages. The lights in the hotel hallways slowly change color and seem like skylights. So as you wait for the elevator, you go from blue to purple to pink to white light. Very funky. The lobby has tons of places to sit and relax in huge designer armchairs, and the location is unbeatable, steps from Alexanderplatz, and of course a train station to get anywhere you need. The down points were there, too, unfortunately: the number one problem for me was that there was construction noise. Pounding hammers from an unknown location, the building next door is currently being built (August 2007) and the street outside our window was being jackhammered for some reason that looked major. Having said that, I imagine that within a year at the most, all of these noise sources will have disappeared, and the basic street noise was little to none, with good windows to block it out. So maybe wait till 2008 to stay here. Most of that noise was only during the day, too, so if you don't need a siesta, no worries! We only stayed one night, so we had no trouble space-wise, but if you were to stay here more than 2-3 nights, I can see that space would be a MAJOR major problem. There was nowhere to put anything at all. Just a tiny metal rack with 4-5 hangers, and then two chairs. Other than that you would have to use the floor for storage space, and even that was scarce. So for our one night stay no big deal, but if you needed to let your luggage explode into a mess, it would be impossible at Motel One.
