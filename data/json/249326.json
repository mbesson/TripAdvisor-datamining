The hotel it's self is simple yet elegant in its design as you can see from the photos, because it's simple designs you can see the rooms are clean as there is none of the odd corners of the room that are not accessible to clean like some older hotels Like other comments the bathroom could be an issue if there are two of you but as I was travelling alone I quite liked it. You get free wifi and there is a uk standard socket, while I had an issue with mine the hotel were good enough to lend me an eu adaptor. The distance on the map makes te hotel look far out but actually it's 2 stops on the metro which takes 10 minutes. I'd buy a day (or longer) travel pass, it's a great way to get around. I got a taxi from the central station a couple of times after the metro had finished and it was 12 euros both times. Would I go back, yeah it was good but really I don't like paying more that 100 euro a night if it's for room only (breakfast is 18 euros extra). I should also note the rates don't cover tourist tax which was seven euro a night.

While the hotel's location is a good walk outside center (don't try strolling from Centraal Train Station), it's located close to the 9 and 14 tram lines, which take you virtually anywhere you'd want to go. Having read all the property's reviews on this site, I'd been expecting more hassle--luckily, all went off without a hitch. A couple weeks before my arrival, I emailed the staff to request a quiet room away from the night club, and they were more than happy to oblige. Also, I didn't experience any billing issues or misunderstandings. I did have wifi devices with me, but the computer near the service desk became a convenient alternative when I needed to send longer messages and change my itinerary. It was open all times I needed to use it. While Room 241 was perfect for me, I don't think it would work as easily with two travelers. The bathroom features a clear glass wall with no shade, meaning it has no privacy from the main suite. Also, quarters were a bit cramped between the bed and tv. (I'd say there was maybe a foot of clearance.) For two, there definitely wouldn't be much space to lounge. - My pictures are of room 241, which doesn't feature a loft layout (this worked fine for me) - Noise wasn't a problem, though from time to time I could hear people's doors open and shut and conversation from the hallway - I'd never seen this: The room key, located in a slot next to the door, was needed to turn on and off any lights in the room - Since the restaurant/cafe menu looked fairly pricey (everything seemed around 15 euros or more), I ended up eating when I was out seeing the city or buying a la carte at Marqt in Rembrandtplein (credit or debit cards only). The closest I ended up eating to the hotel was at Golden Temple in Rembrandtplein, which offered terrific vegetarian dishes. - There's a water-canal taxi stop across from the hotel, however, I didn't look into how often it stopped at this location - I didn't experience any issues with water spilling over from the shower - The front desk let me know the hotel shuttle service--going between multiple hotels--is very unreliable. I opted to take a train between the airport and Centraal Station and a tram to and from the hotel. You can pay for the tram when you board, however, you must buy train tickets at a portal before boarding. (Altogether it's less than 8 euros.) Also, you can buy tram passes from Hotel Arena's front desk. Overall, I'd highly recommend this hotel, especially for solo travelers. As far away as it may be from Dam Square (2.5 km to be exact), it's a perfect place to settle in at the end of a day exploring.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Yik C Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126073855", "Content": "Great Hotel, beautiful decor, great service.

We ended up staying longer than we had planned due to ill health, and the staff were thoughtful, checking we were ok in our room a couple of times a day. However there were many little things which took away from these positives. - shower(which is 'open', not in a cubicle) drain blocked, whole bathroom flooded on using it and all our towels were sodden just trying to make the floor ok to walk on - they could not mop up all the water however. Mentioned to reception but as far as we know it was not checked(certainly not fixed) so we used the bath for the rest of the stay. Admittedly the bath is probably the best I have ever been in but not sure that cancels out the inconvenience with the shower! - daily room cleaning is quite horrendous. On first look it seemed like all they had done was made the bed.. then we noticed they had taken the rubbish bag out of the bin and left out on the sofa, left used cups dirty in room and bathroom, crisp packet left out, toilet roll which we had out to use for tissues not replaced. - the studio room we had was not as special as I would expect from a boutique hotel(but lovely big bed) and TV sound and colour not great - internet on TV was horrible to use, take your laptop or use computers at reception! Due to aforementioned ill health we watched a few movies - individually these were ridiculously expensive but there is an option to watch as many as you like in 24 hrs for 15 euro. - Asked for a banana to go with lunch but was told that was not possible as the fruit had been taken downstairs after breakfast. We did later notice there was a supply of apples at reception, but still.. - Very noisy corridor when people walked up and down it when we were in the room. No way you could sleep through people going for breakfast or nearby rooms being cleaned! The food is good, to get value for money you need to eat a lot for breakfast though.

Paid a little extra and booked a Studio room which looked exactly like the photos on the website. Lovely rooms (not huge) but nice and cosy for a romantic weekend and I loved the contrast of the white and black bathroom. Beds and pillows were really comfy, just what was needed after a long day in the city. The bathroom was huge and had a great walk in shower. Used the hotel bar on the first night as we arrived quite late and to be honest it wasn't too expensive in comparison to the drinks prices that we paid at other bars over the course of the weekend. Location: The hotel isn't central but Amsterdam seems really small and it was so easy to get around the whole city. There is tram stops close to the hotel which take you to just about every location within the city (I think the longest tram ride was to a market just past Jordaan and it took about 15minutes to get to). There is also a great zoo close to the hotel. The only thing I could fault with the hotel is that upon check-in the receptionist asked for a credit card and when I asked what for as the room had been paid in advance,she replied hesitantly that it was to secure the reservation. Once in the room, I had noticed that it stated on the desk that a deposit is taken from your account upon check-in but when the receptionist asked for my credit card she didn't tell me that she would be taking a deposit from my account. So I went straight to the receptionist and asked how much deposit was taken and she said that no money had been taken out, 200 euros had been put on hold incase of mini-bar charges, breakages, etc. On checkout I paid for city tax and mini-bar charges by cash and enquired about the 200euros and was informed that the deposit was cleared and nothing was taken from my account. When checking my bank balance 8 days later, surprise surprise 200 euros was missing from my balance so after emailing the hotel I received a reply informing me that no deposits get kept but then five minutes later received another email apologising as they realised that they had kept my 200 euros and hadn't put it back into my bank account. Kind of do wonder how many people they get away with doing this to and how many people don't actually realise that they have money missing from their account because of this. If this does happen to you, email both reservation and reception as you seem to get a quicker response this way. Despite the deposit fiasco, it doesn't put me off staying at the hotel again as the hotel completely made up for it. It is beautiful and we enjoyed staying in this location as it wasn't right in the middle of it all but it was close enough and easy enough to get to everything.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing stay\u201d", "Author": "theodorekakoliris", "ReviewID": "UR121658870", "Content": "Stayed at the hotel Arena beginning of December with my girlfriend, in search of relaxing holidays.

From the grand lobby to the restaurant, first impressions are favourable. The Hotel is a short walk from most tram routes, so it is accessible. From the moment we arrived, we could not fault the staff. After an early morning flight, we landed at reception some five hours prior to normal check-in time. We were met with a warm welcome and told that our room was ready for us. Throughout our two-night stay, problems were dealt with quickly and staff were friendly and quick to offer advice i.e. best restaurants in which to dine and quickest tram routes across the City et cetera. Free internet access, from either of the two computers available, was a bonus for keeping in touch with family at home and being able to complete airport check-in online. These are based in the main lobby, next to the Reception desk. The Bad: The purpose of the trip was to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. We had upgraded from a standard room to a Deluxe Double. Designer bathroom asides, the overall feel was that of a bog-standard Ikea influenced budget with nothing 'deluxe' to remark upon at all. The well-stocked mini-bar went untouched, owing to the inflated costs of the contents i.e. 3 Euros for a tiny bottle of still water. The Ugly: A cold weather snap meant the temprature of -8 was brought down to -17 taking into account the wind chill factor. The Hotel does not seem equipped to deal with such cold temperatures. A small, under window, radiator meant that this was not sufficient to heat the room. With no underfloor heating, using the designer shower felt like walking into a fridge. Hotel corridors, and second floor lobby, were ice cold and outdoor clothing was required if you wanted to go walk about. There was a floor-length mirror behind the door but, with no overhead lighting, it was impossible to use to any great effect. The only other mirror was located in the dimly-lit bathroom, which meant applying make-up was nigh-on impossible (this, I did using my hand-held compact by the window). As there is no plug socket in the bathroom, I had nowhere to straighten my hair (I ended up turning the mirrored lampbase on end, to get a vague idea of how presentable I was). The usual equipment is to hand i.e. tea-making facilities and iron, but the iron was like a toy iron; not enough heat/weight rendered it useless. In summing up I would stay at a Hotel run by the same staff, but not at the same venue.

Nevertheless we got a very friendly welcome, and because we'd booked a package including parking for our car and 48-hour public transport passes, we were offered free tourist maps and guides, which turned out to be really useful. (I would recommend such a package because the hotel will allow you to leave your car in their car park for the whole of your checkout day, even after checkout time). The story in the room was quite the opposite: after our eyes had acclimatised to the darkness of the public areas, we were presented with the searing whiteness of the room itself: white walls and ceiling, white curtains, white furniture...and a completely black bathroom. The light switches in the bathroom are also black so I spent several minutes searching along the bathroom wall to find the light switch! Be advised that the glass partition separating the bathroom from the bedroom is not frosted glass...and you can see through almost all of it. You have been warned! Also, it might just be my enthusiastic showering which is the problem, but there seemed to be some problem with the water draining away from the shower. You may not have the same problem... Anyway despite the obvious intention for the hotel to distinguish itself by its decoration, the room itself was warm and comfortable, and to have the TV right at the foot of the bed was a nice touch. Some nice toiletries were provided as well. Breakfast was included in our package, and although the breakfast area was often very busy, we found the food plentiful and of really good quality. We didn't use the hotel's own restaurant. As for the hotel's location, it is not really central to the main action in Amsterdam, but there are reliable and frequent trams, the stop being just a short walk away.

Our room was also fine; a split level room (you can have bed upstairs and sitting room down or vice versa), the stairs were a little steep so not for an older couple but a lovely room nontheless. The bathroom is also unique; it is a dark glass cube which a closet/cupboard makes up a corner of the cube. Great fun when showering as you can watch tv at the same time. I should also mention the bedrrom has a king size bed and the second of two flat screen TV's. You have access to around 20 free channels including BBC1 & BBC2. Alot of the dutch channels also broadcast in english, especially films and the american sitcoms. Our room was at the back of the hotel so we had a view of the river, which was a pleasant surprise. The food at the restaurant is made to order and therefore to a high standard...a lot of locals eat at the Arena which is always a good sign of quality. We found all the hotel staff to be very nice and helpful, in fact we only encountered one miserable dutch person and she worked in a department store in the Leidesplein area. The Hotel Arena is a great hotel, the staircases which I believe are original from the buildings previous reincarnations, are beautiful. The Hotel also has it's own night club, I didn't try it but I understand it is an award winning venue so the hotel. Reading various reviews on this site, people have whinged about moving tables or noisy corridors, this is not the hotel itself, it is other inconsiderate guests, so if you get the opportunity to stay here don't be put off by these inconsiderates as they stay at other hotels too. Amsterdam is an expensive city so if you are on a budget you probably won't be looking to eat at the hotel or at restaurants everyday, so if you come out of the hotel and go right, cross over the road and over the river and turn left, there is a supermarket on the right side where you can buy various cold meats & salads etc and store them in your mini bar fridge. if you continue walking up past the supermarket you will come to the metro, central station is just three stops from here and Dam Square is a 5 minute walk, just follow the crowds. I have been to all the major cities in Europe and I found Amsterdam to be an inspirational city, unlike a lot of cities you may visit in the world, Amsterdammers don't take their city seriously at all, on the whole they respect their city for it's wonderful but unsung history and for that reason they want you to take them as you find them and we found them to be great.

He knows me very well and he is aware that I am quite difficult concerning hotels... One problem: ALL the top hotels in Amsterdam were fully booked and the only alternative was Arena. OK, he warned me beforehand that Arena was the kind of hotel I would never ever visit, let alone sleep at. He described it as a \"backpackers hotel\". Fair enough... So here we arrive with the limousine and the Vuitton trunks and bags... You can imagine the shock (also from the hotel staff thinking what had been thrown in: a male Joan Collins...) Anyway, the weekend was great, the hotel was OK. Period. Never again, except maybe in case of an emergency. Every time I went to Amsterdam I went to another hotel on the canals. Two years later: all hotels full. Our travel service assistant booked me at Arena. Hey, sh.. happens. Luckily I thought, the bar has a good vibe. I was booked in the attic. Construction in the (soooo sexy black and dim) hallways were still going on (can't make an omelette without breaking eggs, can you?), opened the door: SURPRISE: welcome to the new and so-improved Arena.

On arrival (only 35 euros and 20 minutes in a taxi..if that), we were impressed by the exterior of the hotel and the quiet but accessible location. The reception staff were friendly on arrival - we asked if we could have our rooms closer together and they upgraded us to deluxe rooms to make this possible, which was a nice bonus! Deluxe rooms are not exactly plush however. The room we were in had a split level, with the bed upstairs and (steep wooden) steps leading up to it. Downstairs had two leather armchairs, small table, the shower-room and a seperate toilet (handy in the mornings!). Our breakfast wasn't included but we opted out of buying any at the hotel - at 16 euros each, it was far too expensive. The restaurant looked really lovely but we didn't eat there at all....rather be out and about in the Dam! The hotel is situated fairly close to the centre - we walked it in about 35 minutes but, after that, opted from the tram as the stop was nearby and had a regular service. The fare one way is 1.60 euro, but you can buy strips of tickets which save you money. The only problem with our room was the steps leading to the mezanine level - they were steep and made of polished wood. My wife slipped on these slippery steps and injured her back, meaning she has been signed off work for weeks.... Our last night was a Friday and their club (ToNight) was open - the bar and club seemed very popular and there was inevitable noise, well into the night. Not from the club but people drunkenly coming and going. We weren't bothered by this but some might be... Overall, a very cool hotel, extremely beautiful and friendly place in a good location.

The cafe and restaurant are really priced at a four star level and are clearly the reason that the hotel has the rating it does as the rooms are not good at all but the food in the restaurant is lovely. However, the rooms just bring this whole place down. We had booked a deluxe room and were given a split level twin even though we booked a double. At first we were impressed because it was split level but then we realised it was more like a room in a hostel. The two single beds were up on one level and the TV, desk, plastic chair and really uncomfortable bench-like sofa were on the bottom level. I personally would have preferred for everything to be on one level so we could watch TV in bed but this might not be a consideration for everyone. The room had no pictures on the walls at all and the ceiling was covered in stains and in desperate need of a lick of paint. When we took the sheets off the mattresses to push them together and make a double bed, we could see that they had stains all over them including a huge one where someone had clearly wet the bed at some point. This isn't something I would expect in a three star hotel. I was a little disappointed so I went to speak to the front desk staff on the second day to see if anything could be done. They seemed annoyed with me even though I was being polite and told me that most people liked the split level rooms. I said that it was more the two beds that had annoyed me as I was away with my boyfriend on our first holiday and we had booked a double room not a twin. They said that if I had said something the day before they would have done something but now they were fully booked, and that there might be a different room the next day if I went down to reception at 9am. All I really wanted was for them to be a little concerned, say sorry and if I couldn't be moved then give us a token for a tea or coffee in the cafe or some goodwill gesture. I don't think that's too much to ask really but they didn't even say sorry. The customer service is just non-existent. They were really unhelpful with other things as well. The vending machine with the internet access keys in it broke on the first day and it took them three days to get it fixed. The room didn't have a kettle so you can't make your own tea or coffee and as my boyfriend got sick this meant I had to keep going downstairs to get hot water for the Lemsip. It also means that if you want a cup of tea in the morning you have to pay for it - I've never realised how handy having tea and coffee in your room is, it just makes you feel at home a bit. I just don't think that this hotel is three star at all and would really not recommend staying here unless you are getting it really cheap. I spent quite a bit and felt really disappointed. It's not even good as a base because the rooms are just so horrible you don't want to be there. If you are concerned about being central also be aware that it takes about ten minutes on the tram to get in to the centre (its not hard but might be important to some people to be central) and if you book through Expedia also be aware that the city tax is not included in the hotel taxes that they say you have paid.

It is on the corner of the Oosterpark, with easy access to the tram for travel to other parts of the city. When you enter the lobby it looks nice with an elegant old marble staircase. The desk staff is very helpful and do speak English. We were given a room on the top floor, number 200 right next to the door entering the hallway. So we heard everyone who came down that hall. It also faced the nightclub, so on friday and saturday nights you could hear the music and people late into the night (1am friday night and 4am saturday night). It was very small with two twin beds pushed together and a small \"desk\" and plastic chair under the eves. There was barely room to walk around 1 side and the foot of the beds as they were pushed into the corner of the room. The ceiling sloped down and the window was in the sloping part. For a closet there were 2 narrow grey metal gym lockers. The color scheme was white only. The television was mounted up by the ceiling, at an angle from the bed, so you got a crick in your neck. The bathroom was small with a sink, toilet, and shower only. The grout between the tiles was mildewed. There was nowhere to put your soap etc. in the shower except on the floor. The style of toilet made it rather smelly when you used it. Our heater (old style radiator) wouldn't adjust and didn't seem to be on so we were cold the first couple of days. Then it came on during one night, so maybe the hotel had just turned the heat on? Finally we had enough and asked for a different room. They gave us one on the first floor (would be called the 2nd floor in the US), #107. It was roomier with a double bed you could walk around both sides of, and a wider desk with 2 chairs. It had a large window opening into a courtyard. The bathroom had a separate door for the toilet, and was much less mildewed. The heater worked nicely; in fact we had to turn it off at night. For some reason we didn't get some of the television channels we got in the other room. Although it was in the middle of the hallway, the hallway echoed and when anyone closed a door the whole wall shook. Even though it didn't face the nightclub, we discovered that it was above a meeting room. One night there was a group meeting and there was music and voices late into the night, and tables being moved at 2am. My husband work earplugs and was okay, but I can't sleep with them in. The more expensive rooms were a bit nicer looking, with real closets. The ones we saw were split level with the bed up a very steep staircase. So if you have issues with stairs, especially if you want to go to the bathroom during the night (downstairs), it may not be good. The food was okay in the restaurant although a bit pricey. There was a different menu, slightly cheaper, in the bar. Service in both places was quite slow. We're coming back to Amsterdam in the spring for an event in the same area, so we're going to try the NH Tropen Hotel which is on the other side of the park.

It is a shame, as their 'brand' is funky, and the club adjoining the hotel is meant to be one of the best in amsterdam - we did not go as it was hard core dance on sat night, and queues were long. we were only using the room to kip in after boozy days out, so it didn't matter so much, but i would not recommend this place to anyone - go to a budget chain- at least you''ll get clean sheets and its probably cheaper.

The restaurant and bar looked equally smart, but I did not try them. The stairwell and lift were a stark contrast, and I appreciate what other reviewers have said about it looking like a youth hostel. Both of the rooms I stayed in were fairly large (164, 268). The furnishings were very basic - bed, table, chair, metal wardrobe, tv. I liked the basic look of the rooms, but obviously it will not be to everyone's taste. Both rooms had wooden floors which can be noisey. The sound insulation could have been better. That might be more important if you stay on a Friday night (I didn't) - there is a nightclub every Friday. Initially the bathroom looked quite smart, but on closer inspection it was clear that the housekeeping was below par (or done by a very hairy person). The sinks in both rooms lacked a plug which made shaving more difficult. The baths had the type of plug that never quite stops the water from draining out, so I used the shower instead. Returning to the bedroom I then noticed that the housekeeping there was not great either . In 164 (I hope I got the number right!) I was woken very early by noise outside, probably the laudry delivery. 268 faces the inner courtyard so it was quieter. The bed in 168 was uneven so I didn't get a good sleep. I've heard from colleagues who stayed in the hotel earlier in the year that is can get quite hot. I had the opposite problem. It was a little bit too cold for me and there was no thermostat.

Having read the reviews on Tripadvisor in advance I was a bit suspect about the place and I have to say many reviewers were right. The Arena is a very confused hotel. It does not know what it tries to be: a boutique hotel or a student dormitory. The lobby is very much eccentric boutique style hotel and reminded me of the Belfast Malmaison. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s however were the upmarket feel ended abruptly. The staff at check in were disinterested and surly and despite requesting a smoking room gave me a non smoking room. After having to walk all the way back (and the corridors are long) I finally got the room I wanted. The room, a so called large double, was strange indeed. A long and narrow tall room with a small lounge area and an ancient TV with cables all over the place and an upstairs open plan sleeping area. The in room booklet about the hotel made a big thing out of the history of the building: it once was an orphanage and then a youth hostel which, according to the owners, was restored to a stylish hotel. Nothing could be further from the truth. The room had very much a hostel feel to it. Gloss painted walls (easy to wash off), not very clean floors and the worst bit bed linen with holes in them and pure polyester. Overall a very basic outfit. The upstairs \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bedroom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd did not feature a TV so any notion of resting on the bed and watching TV was out of the window. No other amenities could be located either: no mini bar (there is a vending machine on the corridors charging very high prices for drinks) or luxurious toiletries or bathrobes. Definitely not a boutique room. Another downside of the room was the fact that you can hear each single neighbour of yours, people walking in the corridors, the guy in the room next door having a shower or the couple above having [--]. Not my idea of a relaxing stay in a hotel. Breakfast is being served in the bar (again not very clean) and was very poor. The scrambled eggs were cold and the selection of cold meats and cheeses very poor. Even as a smoker I thought having the smoking section right next to the buffet is a very odd choice. At night time the bar is quite a happening place and the staff were friendly however the restaurant was another let down. When I tried to get a reservation I was told there was no way, but when my Dutch colleague (who was not staying in the hotel) tried we got a table (plenty of other tables were empty). Just to underline the youth hostel feel a large group of young men were having dinner and were throwing their cutlery and napkins at each other but of course the staff were not bothered by it. Service was very slow and the food was good though nothing special. In summary the hotel is not worth the price it charges. My room was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 150 a night and for that price I expect (and usually get) much more than what the Arena Hotel was offering. I assume the fact that it also has a club and bar means it does not bank on repeat customers. The Arean is still the youth hostel it once was.

We happened to snatch a look inside another room on our day of departure, which we discovered was a superior room, but it has to be said, it was only a little bigger and certainly no more luxurious. To call it 'Dutch minimalist design' is fetching it as far as it can be fetched! The standard rooms are basically 2 man dorms, with everything just a bit shabby.

There is also a nightclub on site which seems to be very poular with locals and had a good programme of events through the month.

The Restaurant looked good, we only used the bar for drinks and food, which was very good on both counts. Some of us had breakfast, not in with our price, which at 9 euros was abit expensive but it had a good selection and was buffet style so we got our monies worth! The building is enormous and very well renovated, there are some great touches that you would not find in more traditional hotels. The reception staff were helpful, and its only a short tram ride from town, ask staff and they will tell you exactly where you need to head for your sights etc. For around \u00c2\u00a350 per night i think this hotel is worth the stay, just for the slightly unconventional suroundings.

A damp cloth on surfaces would have done the trick, especially since there were only 3 surfaces!!! including the windowsill. The bed area was carpeted, but again not very clean. Toilet and shower ok. The \"smugness\" as mentioned in a previous review came from the restaurant waiter when we asked for a table for two he replied \"No! We are full!\" The dining area was by no means full as far as we could see. Again the reseptionist was very helpful and directed us to Utrecht Straat were there were many different restaurants to choose from.

The rooms are unbelieveable small, also dirty and run down and the website-promised \"minimalistic dutch design\" is only a description for \"there is nothing in the room besides two old beds and a chair bought by IKEA years ago\" (see photos). This is not a single impression, we had four rooms and all of them were the same. The building and the basic concept is cool, but here it is like driving a Porsche with 20mph. One good point: The staff is very nice and friendly. I would never stay here again, especially for the price (EUR 120,00 - 150,00/night) it is a big disappointment. If you go out with the boys for a party weekend and if a bad bed is all you need, it may be ok for a night. If you would bring your girl, you would never stay after seeing the room.

The hotel looks rather nice on the surface however, I was very disappointed once I had gotten inside. The room was in desperate need of a good clean - the floor was dirty and there was a thick layer of dust over everything. The bathroom floor was also filthy and there was no extractor fan which meant you could barely find yourself in the bathroom for steam!!! The reception staff were highly inefficent and on departure, we were quoted 3 different charges for our use of the restaurant and hotel. If I had not spoken up, the receptionist would quite happily have charged me an extra 100 euros due to their inefficiency! The \"To Drink\" restaurant was also highly disappointing and a prime candidate for providing it's visitors with food poisioning! I asked for a medium-well done fillet steak which, when on arrival, looked as if it needed cooking to say the least! The steak was actually cold in the middle which of course disgusted me. The dirty and ramshackle hotel surroundings had put me off my food enough and this was now the final straw.
