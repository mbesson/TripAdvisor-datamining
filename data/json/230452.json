I expect this was an old travellers' hotel taken over by Best Western and redecorated (no glitz!). A small breakfast/bar area off the main foyer. No coffee making facilities in the room I had (small twin bedded) but free coffee and tea available all night in the breakfast bar area. Other soft drinks/confectionery only available from a vending machine in the same area. Very economical, staff (I only met the two guys looking after the place at night) very friendly and helpful. For one night between flights if you just want to get your head down in comfort for a few hours and have good shower toilet facilities then this place is ideal.

Located one stop from either of the Madrid Airport metro stops and then only two blocks from the Barajas train station this is great buy. I got a room for about 71.00 U.S dollars, including tax during January. There are plenty of restaurants nearby (try Al Traste Fun & Food) and a lot of friendly bars filled with folks that are staying at one of the many nearby hostels. I will start with the two negatives so that I can finish with positives: The shower was difficult to enter because a shower assembly was constructed above the bathtub. Not all rooms are this was so if you have any problems raising above a three foot wall or are elderly make sure you get a room with an easily accessible shower. The internet was a little shaky so I went four blocks away to Al Traste Fun & Food; however, I have to be fair and say that I appeared to be the only person complaining about intermittent internet. Now on to the positive. They have an airport shuttle and pick you up promptly or you can take the pink metro line one stop to Barajas station. The beds are firm and nice, the toiletries are decent enough but if you prefer using a bar of soap bring your own because they provide the ones that are about one inch by two inches. If you drop this \"bar\" once forgetabout it! The hardwood floors were new and beautiful, there is ample closet space and hangers, a closet safe, a television (dominated by German channels) and nice thick towels. The colors were modern and vibrant and the desk, although small, provided enough space to work. The elevator is the smallest (two people and two suitcases maximum) I have ever seen but it did the job. The little bar area was nice and they lay out a really nice continental breakfast with numerous types of pastries and coffee. They also have a small internet center and provide two laps to use until 1: am.

We found a nearby neighborhood restaurant on a small square (wish I'd noticed the name of it!) that had superlative food at a good price. I believe the square had a church, as is typical for smaller towns and cities in general, but that is all I can remember to help folks with location, unfortunately. There isn't a lot around the hotel other than a few other restaurants here and there (didn't try the largest one just across the street and down about a block), but it is a very convenient stopover.

Also the hallways had some kind of foul odor that probably was due to poor ventillation. The hotel supplied two laptops, the very small 6-8 inch variety in the lobby that were somewhat of a joke.

Bad things - room is about 10X10 (bathroom is separate) feet and occupied by nice size bed, so moving inside room is limited even for average sized person. AC kind worked. Bathtub is tiny by USA standards (but clean). Safe is not free. Room walls need some update, but they are not falling apart and clean.

Had room 404, small balcony overlooking a (the?) main street in Barajas. Clean room, comfortable bed, the polite desk clerk spoke excellent English and made helpful dinner suggestions. Small LCD TV, but it worked, good water pressure in the shower. Robust wifi in the room and several computers for public use on ground floor. Complications: Altho they may pickup from different terminals, they prefer to go to the hotel shuttle pickup point in T4. There's a free shuttle bus at the airport that goes from T4 to the other terminals. You have to call for a pickup. The hard part was calling. It took 30 min. of trying off and on to get thru on the pay phones (select English, don't try to use a US credit card, deposit 0.5 Euro and just dial the # shown on the board outside, 99 whatever, don't try for a + sign). If you have local sim card then you won't have to worry about this, which is not the fault of the hotel. My Verizon LG phone didn't work so I had to use the pay phones. I had trouble using the phone in the room to call the desk, but that's minor. (this was not a good trip for phones...) On calling from T4 for pickup, they said 10 minutes and were there on time. For drop-off, they will take you to your desired terminal, leaving every 1/2 hr in the morning. If you miss the shuttle in the morning, turn left out of the hotel, walk 300 m to the metro - it was 2.5 euro for one stop (a surcharge for airport access). Many US carriers use T1 or T2, rather than T4. Barajas is between the airport metro stops. If going to the hotel from Madrid on the metro, don't go to the airport for a pickup, just get off at the Barajas station, go out and walk right 300 m. In retrospect, wish I'd taken the metro to the hotel, was less frustrating than the pay phones. The 2.5 euro fare for a short, one stop, trip on the metro seemed high but those who have taken taxi to/from MAD from this hotel have reported really high fares to Tripadvisor.

And there is a well-stocked little grocery store directly across the road so you can pick up a wide variety of drinks and snacks if you just want to rest before your next flight.

You should just take the stairs if you're in a hurry. The shades for the rooms were terrific--there are huge outdoor mechanized shades that close with a switch. However, once the side ones were open, I couldn't figure out how to close them. If I were staying longer, I would have asked. The shuttle service was prompt and excellent both arriving and leaving. The only difficult part is calling from the airport to have the shuttle come pick you up. If you are traveling from a foreign country without a cell phone, you need to go outside to the shuttle stand to look up the number, then go back inside to call from a pay phone. It would be nice if there were signs posting the number inside, or having a free station where you can call your hotel before you go outside. All of this took us a while to figure out.

For an airport hotel, the Villa De Barajas is perfectly okay.

When we checked in, they immediately gave us the key to the room, even though it was only 10am in the morning. The room itself was fairly small but spotlessly clean and quiet enough for us to catch a midday snooze before heading into town. Getting to the center of Madrid is easy and only costs one Euro using the Metro which is just a short walk down the road from the hotel. We visited Retiro park, the Prado, the Reina Sofia and Plaza Mayor before returning to the hotel later that night. The Metro is clean and felt perfectly safe to us. We chose a hotel close to the airport because we had to catch an early morning flight to Rome the next day and did want to get up extra early to allow time to get to the airport.

The earlier stays (in 2003) were better than our recent May 2005 stay. The price has gone up significantly and the service has, to our mind, gone down somewhat. The breakfast (cold only) was not as good this time and the desk crew, while polite, were more \"bureaucratic\" and less friendly--far less friendly than last time. Most of the rooms, while very clean, are quite small, with no coffeemaker, although the bathroom is OK in size and connections. One big plus is that the hotel is convenient (2 blocks) to the relatively new airport leg of the Madrid Metro (Barajas station), so visiting locations in the city is a snap. (If there are two or more than one in your party, consider getting the 10-trip ticket at 5.80 euros for a short stay. There is a manned ticket booth at the Barajas station).

The second night I ate in and had a good meal, there are restaurants and other hotels in the streets nearby. Of course, being near the airport there is a risk of noise. I got a room on the back, away from both the street and the airport so it was not too bad. It is best to keep windows closed and use the airconditioning which was quite effective.
