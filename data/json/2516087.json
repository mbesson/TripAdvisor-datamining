Couldn't ask for better service or attention from the wait staff. Concierge Phillip was helpful and every one of his suggestions were perfect! I love that they are so eco-friendly and generally friendly. The shuttle took awhile to come, but it was obviously due to traffic - not the fault of the hotel. The view out our room made me feel like we were sitting on the LAX tarmac. Incredible! But it was absolutely quiet - didn't hear a peep from inside or out. The bad? Well, the in-room coffee pot did not want to wake up and the sleep number bed would not function. Since I expected neither one of these, it wasn't an issue for me. I would have loved to use both, though. Everything else I needed or wanted exceeded expectations and made this stop over into a mini-vacation for my mother and I.

All I can say is, if you are business person looking for a place to stay -- Avoid this one totally. Here is what happened to me: 1. Shuttle service from this hotel is horrid. I think they must have only one shuttle (maybe two). Traffic around the LAX airport loop is always full, so the smart hotels send out like two or three shuttles at the same time to continue to pick up customers around the clock. I counted the Hilton and Westin Shuttles pass me by no less then 6 times while I waited for the Radisson shuttle -- which took 40 mins to reach me. It took me no less then 30 mins to de-plane, go through immigration, and collect my bags.....only to be left to wait 40 mins by my hotel. 2. Room Service - Here is a good one -- The hotel will tell you that they have 24 hour room service. But when you get to the room and read the menu you see that there are all kinds of conditions around when you can order items. Makes it confusing and is clearly oriented toward meeting the needs of the staff, not the customer. 3. I ordered breakfast and asked that it be delivered at 5am so that I could get to the airport in time for my flight. I am a diabetic and cannot take my medication without food. Knowing from the complicated menu that I would not be allowed to order an egg before 5:30am, I called and made a special request that it be delivered at 5am. I was put on \"hold\" by the operator to verify that this could be done and was told \"yes.\" Guess what....it never showed up. No food for a diabetic on medication going to an airport terminal with very limited food services. I should sue these people. My company is expanding and will be doing business in the Philippines over the next two years. We will need a base hotel at LAX to support us. Radisson was our first choice to see if they would work out for us over the next couple of years. My company leadership will want my report next week on recommendations for this hotel. Needless to say, we will not be signing any long term contracts with Radisson. What is clear from this situation is that you have a very poor leadership structure at this hotel. It does not employ the kind of quality improvement systems that keep mistakes from happening. LAX has numerous choices for places to stay -- if you are in Business -- Avoid the Radisson -- they are not designed to support your needs. A hotel that is not designed to support a business person is basically not supporting YOUR BUSINESS -- then what purpose do they actually serve?", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "tempe, az", "Title": "\u201cJust Average\u201d", "Author": "hummergirlTempe_Az", "ReviewID": "UR128982912", "Content": "Stayed here on a business trip w/ 7 other people.

We have done this trip once before 2 years ago, it worked out well so booked with Radisson LAX again. We had a problem with the shuttlebus this time. The first sign you see on coming out of the airport after 18hrs travelling is a red one saying hotel shuttle buses, makes sense to wait there! After 30mins we gave up and got a taxi. Mr Grumpy, the taxi driver reckoned we could have walked it. Not with all our luggage and a 77 year old mother-in-law! Apparently the Radisson bus stops futher to the left under a green sign, though we did'nt see their bus at all. Anyway, the staff as always at a Radisson, were patient and very helpful. This is appreciated as our brains are still halfway over the Atlantic by this time and we are exhausted, especially, the mother-in-law. Good reasonably priced food is easily available, a must for stomach's on UK time. The rooms are big, quiet and clean with a coffee maker. The beds are very comfortable with a remote to alter the hardness of the mattress. We were awake very early as we were keen to get on the road. There were plenty of staff to help us on our way. There was complimentary breakfast (offered because having to get a taxi) at 5.30 am, someone to look after the luggage and someone else to sort out the taxi to pick up car from Alamo rental at Aviation Blvd. The hotel is not suitable for a holiday stay.

This room, with a nasty hole in the carpet and paint and or wall paper peeling right off the walls should NOT be sold as anything other than a 1 star. The faucet in the bathroom was crooked and off center. Strange. There was no working clock in the room. The TV was straight out of the 80's. Weird smell in the room. The closet doors would NOT open. The walls are THIN. Do yourself a favor and do NOT worry about the airplane noises. Worry more about the noise from the hallway and the rooms next door!

Not sure what happened, but for some reason, they had to patch the ceiling. Bathroom: SMALL. When you open the bathroom door, you practically hit the toilet with the door. THAT is small. Scuff marks all over the walls as well. This room was just not good. I am a nice guy. Super cordial to the front desk. No attitude and VERY polite. Why did the front desk guy do this to me?

I arrived in L.A. for a business trip and hopped the convenient shuttle to the Radisson. Once I got to my room, I realized the company I work for had made a terrible mistake placing me in this hotel. The room was decent at best. Everything in the room was dated, from the rear projection television to the outlets barely attached to the walls. The furniture (dresser, desk, two chairs and two nightstands) were beat up and in need of replacement. They looked as though they had been bought at a second-hand furniture store. The bathtub in the restroom had no caulking around the edges, making the shower look less than appealing. The ceiling of the restroom appeared to be moldy. Even the toilet seat needed replacement as it was falling off of the toilet. The bed was fairly comfortable with the \"sleep number\" mattress. However, the sheets were tattered and torn. On day two, the top layer of my bedding was replaced....with bedding that had very large pen marks across them. While the accommodations were lackluster, the most problematic situation arose on day three. I took a look at my bank account while at the hotel. When I checked in to the hotel (which was being paid for by the company I was working for), the front desk associate requested a credit card for incidentals. What I wasn't told was that for every night you stay they charge your credit card $24. I had provided my debit card not knowing they were going to charge $175 against my account. I found out about the charges when my bank called to inform me of a couple overdrafts on my account.....thank you Radisson hotel. At no point during the check-in process was I told about the $24/day hold on my checking account. This would have been a non-issue had I been informed as I would have used a different form of payment for my daily spending. I have made a request with my company to not use this hotel in the future. It was a total disappointment aside from free Wi-Fi access and the complimentary shuttle. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone for any occasion.

The cord was actually hanging over the door the way you would if you weren't going to use a fridge in a while. - There were holes and marks on the walls where painting were clearly supposed to be - There was no room service menu in the room - There were no clear instructions on how to use the phone - The electrical sockets and thermostat were all hanging loosely out of the wall - The AC didn't work - The bath tub was dirty (hair) I was exhausted after a day of travel and meetings and didn't complain. We just ordered chinese take out and went to bed. In retrospect, I should have complained. It looked like they were about to renovate room on the other side of the hotel, so hopefully that means eventually they will renovate all of them. I feel like we were shoved in some extra space they had just so they could make a buck. The only thing I will say is that the internet worked fine and the shuttle service to the airport was decent.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cIt's fine if you don't expect too much\u201d", "Author": "mojave_ben", "ReviewID": "UR119502869", "Content": "The main advantage of the Radisson is that you can walk to it - about 7 minutes from Terminal 1.

I had a high room on the south side. I could see planes on approach but not really hear them. All in all it was quite quiet, except that the room fan was a bit noisy when set to \"high\". The AC shuts off when there is no key card in the slot by the door, so the south facing rooms may be hot when you check into them, and then you MUST run the fan high for a few hours to cool them down (AC is on the weak side). Room has a fridge. There is a Subway down the street. For much of the year some yoga dude runs training programs at the hotel and that means there are many vegan-types around, which the hotel caters to in a little eat/drink lounge in the lobby - though pricey, this is a nice healthy food choice (of course I ate those burgers... but it was great to be able to pick up some milk for my morning coffee on site). Staff were friendly. Guests, other than the yogis, is what you'd expect at an airport hotel. You're not coming here looking for a resort, right? So it's just fine for an airport hotel.

Before you even get to a hallway, you\u2019ll have to make it past the elevator drama. Some gangster-esque \u201cride-or-die chick\u201d says to her beau: \"Who steals jewelry in 2011 anyway?

Thank God for elevator doors and separate floors! But once on my floor, I wasn\u2019t any more comforted. Trash lined up along the hallway in front of doors.

Though I was booked for several days--the first thing in the morning--I bailed to the Sheraton Gateway, the next hotel eastward on Century Boulevard\u2019s row.

Thankfully, Carlson hotels (the Radisson's parent company) offer a money-back guarantee. I was provided a full refund as well as dinner at Palmira Bar & Grill. In fact, the only things positive about the Ol\u2019 Radi are the service/staff and Palmira. Palmira\u2019s food is on the oily side, but it sticks to the tum.

The bar inside Palmira pours heavy, a stark contrast to the lobby bar, which possesses an undeserved sense of chi chi.

Accomodated over 450 people for a yoga training and did it WELL!\u201d", "Author": "TigerPancakes", "ReviewID": "UR116845426", "Content": "I attended a yoga training held at this hotel for 2 months (April 2011-June 2011). We lived on-site for the entire time. By the time I left, I knew the names of all the staff and every nook and corner of that hotel. I can't say enough good things about the staff! They were wonderful and very very accomodating. The food provided at a food bar in the lobby was surprisingly good. I am not one for buffet style food, but it was actually very good and fresh. They used a lot of organic products and provided a huge array of fresh, alternative drinks like smoothies, wheatgrass, fresh squeezed juices, coconut water, and many more. Room service was great and was provided 24/7. Good for us as we were up at all hours of the night. I think may hotels would have a hard time accomdating this many people....especially this crowd, but they were super organized, prepared and ready to made changes as needed. WE also used all of their conference rooms for \"lectures\" and \"clinics\" and the mainballroom became a huge yoga practice room. Excellent facilities! THe rooms themselves were standard fly-through hotel rooms. Decent enough, nothing really stood out. The only drawback I could find in the rooms was the ventilation in the rooms....I doubt anyone staying there a night or two would even noticed, but when you are there for 2 months and have wet laundry drying in your room (we had to wash our yoga clothes out by hand most of the time in the sink for time's sake and by choice-the hotel provided washers and dryers). Our thermastat didn't seem to work. We had maintenance check on it several times, but apparently the problem was never resolved..it just got very very stuffy and humid in the rooms. I heard that they were going to remedy that as many rooms had the same issues. Again, if you are thinking of staying here for a few days, even a week, this is your place. Other than the ventilation, which is not the staff's fault, it's awesome! Other pros: -Car rental facility on site (separate from the Radisson and provide very very low rates)-II rented a car almost every weekend for around $36 TOTAL for one day with taxes and insurance. -24 hour shuttle to the airport -Separte shuttle to Manhattan Beach, which inlcudes stops at the Mall (with all your basic department stores, Whole Foods and a ton of restaurants) -There is a Trader Joes, a regular grocery store, like Safeway, two CVSs with 24 hour pharamacy, a medical clinic for walk in injuries/sick, Bed Bath and Beyond, 2 Starbucks, Panera Bread etc. -The local bus can get you anywhere from the stop near the hotel..I took it to Santa Monica..was a straight stop no changing of bus. -Krispy Kreme doughnut kiosk located inside the Crowne Plaza (about a 10 minute walk down the street -an awesome sushi kiosk located in the Crowne Plaza-some of the freshest sushi i've had and i've had a lot--it's a lone guy that prepares the sushi to order -he is only there from 5/6-10pm M-F or something along those lines. -The pool at the Radisson is heated -They have a bar/lounge in the lobby that servies food until 1am or something like that. I had the best burger ever there... Again, the stafff....EVERY SINGLE PERSON, whas wonderful! They take customer service to another level. I've stayed at 5 star hotels that have not come close to this type of service. As a side, my husband, coincidentally stays at this hotel when traveling for business as required by his company. He is only in a night at a time.....this is one of his favorite hotels for the location and convenience. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the ventilation for long term stayers.....hopefully they will remedy that soon.

I did find them a little unfriendly when they realised that there was quite a lot, \"you'll have to carry some or I'll have to get a second cart\" the guy said...err ok, less of a tip for you then if we're doing half the work! But anyway, not to be deterred, we checked in hassle free. The two rooms were opposite each other, it was a little off putting to find that a tray of food was outside our room, that was still there when we left the following morning, but we were so tired did we care! Both rooms had fridges, although annoyingly, and we were too tired to realise until the morning, one of the fridges hadn't been plugged in so some of the food in there headed straight for the trash. Views were good, both got a look at the runway, with either the planes taking off or landing, and there wasn't any noise to be heard.

When we finished checking out, we found our car there out front, and all our luggage strewn all over the front of the hotel, they were the ones with the car key as well, and I'd pointed out the car and asked them to do it whilst we checked out and then got the kids in car seats. Finally when my husband came back they helped. This episode should'nt define the hotel, this may have been a one off, just something to bear in mind if you have a lot of luggage.

One of their pages said self-park was $20 and valet was $30 so when we arrived we asked for self park and were rudely told there was only valet parking for $22. I might have stayed somewhere else if I'd known that. I ended up getting out and talking to the rude attendant before checking in. There was a wait for check in - when I finally was able to get to the desk I explained the rude attendant and received an apology. The room was fine - nothing fancy except nice beds - 9th floor was quiet but windows were double paned and the film for sun was wrinkled making it difficult to see outside. The toilet ran so we had to turn it off to sleep and the next morning realized the sink also leaked. When we checked out I was pretty annoyed at how things had gone but the desk clerk was very helpful She gave us the original rate and credited us for the parking because of the problem. At that point I was pleased and thinking they made it right. WRONG! We had to present our bill to get our car to prove we had paid for the parking. The female attendant who took the bill said \"You didn't pay for parking!\" - I explained they waived it due to a problem. She then proceeded to call the front desk....and then lecture me on their communication problems. Of course this delayed our departure....I was getting more annoyed and asked for her name....she gave it to me and then said \"He's the manager\" pointing to another man. I asked if I could speak with him and he didn't even go off to the side - the original attendant and another employee stepped closer to hear what I was saying. I finally had to ask them to step back. The manager just smiled and said \"Sorry.\" It was VERY uncomfortable. My guess is that the parking people do not work for Radisson - they need to get rid of them and they may get repeat customers.

When we arrived at the hotel there was only one two-double non-smoking room available on the 5th floor, but it was next to a smoking room. I asked if I could get a two-double room on a lower level.

I particularly liked that the king was a sleep number bed, so I got to set it at the setting I have at home. I would've never known it was a sleep number until my 13yo found the remote. As with every hotel, I previously checked bedbugregistry.com for updates on this hotel and found no reports to date. I still checked for bedbugs in our room and happily report there are none in the room we stayed in. The only drawback was parking. I neglected to read latest reviews and found we had to park in a makeshift parking structure guarded by not-so-friendly attendants. The parking is located northeast of Radisson with inadequate street lighting. This made me nervous as we had to cross two streets after midnight. Apparently, Radisson overnight parking is undergoing some construction. The cost of overnight parking was $11/day flat-rate. I wish I paid the $20 for valet.

I had to cancel.....weeks before the arrival date and in full compliance with their cancellation policy - I have still not receieved my refund to my credit card and dealing with their accounting department amounts to leaving a message on their voicemail and never receiving a call back - these people are total incompetents and I'm now pursuing a refund providing all the relevant documentation through my credit card company because these idiots at Radisson are incapable of providing the assistance and customer support ANY other hotel could - their accounting department at this hotel is staffed by a bunch of incompetent screw ups - be very careful booking at this hotel and watch your credit card statement very, very carefully.

Every staffer I encountered, from the valet to the front desk to the waiter to the housekeeper, was very pleasant and seemed to really care that every guest had an enjoyable stay. Requests for extra towels or retrieval of my car from valet were met promptly and with courtesy that one might not expect from a highly trafficked airport hotel. Check-in and check-out were smooth and painless. My hotel room faced the south runway, and at first, I was concerned about airplane noise, but noise wasn't a problem at all -- I heard NO airplanes at all! The room was very comfortable and well-appointed. My roomie and I enjoyed the free wi-fi and the availability of an in-room refrigerator. The only drawback was the bed, which was one of those Sleep Number outfits. I'd never slept on one, and after two nights of fiddling with settings, I'm not in a hurry to sleep in one again. The bed seemed very squishy, even on a \"firm\" setting. Thankfully, the hotel provided plenty of pillows, so I was able to arrange them in a way that provided my back with sufficient support.

And that remains the ONLY reason we would ever return. The only saving grace was that we spent so little time here, since we arrived late (10 p.m.) and checked out early (8 a.m.). Could not wait to get our car and leave, to be honest. I felt a bit sorry for the families I saw checking in for what seemed to be like a long stay. I really do hope that their rooms were nicer than ours and their experience was better. While this property may look fine from the lobby and from the exterior, we were disappointed to discover that our room was outdated with worn/old fixtures, stains on the walls and most certainly not worth the money we paid ($100+). A decent price for the room we had is probably closer to $70. We paid extra for a \"renovated\" (when - in 1985?) room on a higher floor and \"spectacular views\" (um - what?) of the airport and the city. The room was very warm, so we turned on the AC fan - which whirred and clunked loudly all night and did absolutely nothing to cool the room. The temperature control in the room is quite old-school - just a dial for heat or cold. Very motel-like. The wall area around the air vent was dark and dirty; sorta' gross. We thought we'd leave the fan on high while we ate something downstairs...but even when we returned, the room was still stuffy, warm and slightly musty. (Upon checkout, I told a woman at the front desk about the loud fan and she didn't seem all that surprised, although she said she was sorry. If this was a nicer room at the hotel, I'd hate to see the conditions of the basic rooms.) I'm not sure if the windows opened or not, but there were two layers of window, one of which was covered in some kind of tinted film that made it hard to actually see out. I'm sure the double-layered window has something to do with the noise from the airport, so I totally understand that. But that aforementioned \"spectacular view\" was a wrinkly, blurry mess, thanks to the tinted film. And to be fair, it would've been sorta' cool, since the room was perched high above the famous \"LAX\" sign. On to the Sleep Number bed...which totally reminded me of a Reebok Pump shoe from the 80s (remember those?). You're supposed to be able to control the firmness of both sides of the mattress by pressing a button, which in turns \"pumps up\" the air on that side of the mattress. I was initally excited about this prospect since I like a softer bed than my husband...but this bed seemed like just a novelty. The noise the bed made when we increased the mattress firmness was crazy loud; I'm not sure if our bed was defective or if all of these beds sound like this. The bathroom seemed like it had been updated at some point. While your typical low-end hotel small bathroom setup remained the same - complete with flourescent lighting above (why oh why do hotels still do this?), it looked like the countertop had been replaced in recent years. The good news is that if you arrive late (which many do), the restaurant on-site (Palmira?) is still open. We ate at the bar at 10:30ish. The bartender was certainly very nice and the food was decent. There were some flies buzzing about at the bar, which was a bit distracting. The best thing about this hotel is that Midway car rental is located on-site and opens at 8 a.m...this company has great rates and friendly staff and we spent only $92 for a intermediate rental for four days. Really a positive experience with them. So there was a convenience factor in staying at the Radisson. The airport shuttle service was fine. All the hotel staff I encountered were friendly. This hotel could be nice if Radisson just spent some money on updating the rooms. I truly felt like I was in a time warp staying at this property.

The carpet also had marks, but care factor was zero. Bathroom is pretty tired looking and has been touched up, but standing over the bath to shower with a old tatty curtain is pretty depressing. There is a nice little cafe downstairs which was handy. Biggest frustration was when I left my laptop adapter back in Australia, the prices was like $17 for 15mins which is the most overpriced internet I have ever come across in my travels, and I presume these prices are to make up for the free wifi. The internet area was very trendy and relaxing, even though I did not use it. It was cheaper to go to Best-Buys and get a $70 cord than pay for their net access. Staff were all fine and friendly, and they if you want a different room, just go and ask them, he didn't care.

The first occasion there was a long queue at reception to check in and check out. No assistance offered with luggage, despite it being mid afternoon check in. Reception staff courteous, not overly friendly, unhelpful. The king single room was very small and bathroom shabby. Ordered one meal and hot drink from room service. After 35 mins the meal arrived sans drink. Was told if I wanted it I'd have to wait another 30 mins as the room service attendant was busy with other orders waiting. A hotel of this size with only one room service waiter? Next morning (after flight from Aus) had a Zzzz sign on my door but room attendants didn't take any notice - really noisy out in the hallway with doors slamming regularly. The fitness centre had no towels provided and only 1 of the treadmills was working. The second occasion (prebooked which is why I went there a 2nd time) there was again a long queue at check in (midnight), the lobby bar was being used for a function so it was packed with people, again no assistance offered with luggage/no trolley provided. I asked for a quiet room. Got a larger room this time with 2 beds, but the bathroom was a shocker. Had to hold the sink taps when using them as the whole mechanism was loose in the vanity casing. There was pubic hair on the toilet when I arrived and hair in the shower. No paper cups let alone glasses in the bathroom, and the coffee cups in the room are paper. Neither of the beds had an operational sleep system (which Radisson so heavily promotes). Could hear the TV next door and doors slamming until the early hours of the morning. The wallpaper was very marked and the old aircon unit had water stains on the ceiling next to it. The concierge didn't know how to get to the the nearest shopping centre by public transport and made a big deal of having to look it up on the internet. Huge queue for check out and the shuttle bus was late going to the airport - the staff basically couldn't give a toss and told me that it was a 3 minute walk to the airport! (if you look at Google maps you'll see that you have to cross freeways etc - great with suitcases - not!). That 3 minute walk, mind you, would've cost me US$20 in the hotel \"limousine\" (a regular sedan). Overall this hotel needs a massive refurbish and the staff need to be trained in basic hospitality etiquette. They're either lazy or understaffed - can't work out which. The only plus is that despite it being so close to the airport you can't hear the planes - however the noise in adjacent rooms/hallways will make up for it!!

I had a basic no smoking room with a double bed. Again the room looked tired and had a Motel 6 feeling. The furniture was dinged, the bathroom didn't have the normal 2 bars of soap...just one. There were no glasses in the bathroom and just one in the armoir. Some of the wallpaper was torn. I guess shabby describes it best. It is need of a rehab. It appears they are economizing a lot. However the room was super quiet and overlooked the airport and the sheets were clean. I ate lunch in the restaurant, again it appeared they were economizing and the room was pretty much empty.

The only available parking was valet parking. They were quick and reasonably courteous but I'd like the option to self park. I was told the parking was under construction.

As a regular business traveler, I ask the standard 3 things from an airport-based hotel vs a city, business or resort one: simply put, a decent room, functioning equipment in that room and efficient staff. Spa services, attempted fancy steakhouses and such are irrelevant when the purpose is inevitably just crashing after, or before, air travel. On this trip, my older parents also from the East were joining me in the desert. I usually stay at the LAX Marriott but since its rates were suddenly crazy high and the Radisson was reasonable, the 3 of us booked at the latter for 1 night - two rooms, different names. My flight wound up 3 hours late and was difficult; when I arrived at 8:30pm, all I wanted was a room, food, some TV and a chance to get myself together before I left at 7am the next day. Since my former employer had a corporate arrangement with Radisson, I am familiar with their strengths (some) and weaknesses (many). Here's what i experienced: --I believe I was given the missing room from \"The Shining.\" It was missing a large piece of art from the wall - I know this because there was a print hanging over 1 of the 2 beds and 2 large hooks and a blank space over the other. It had a large floor lamp meant to solely light 1/2 the room, specifically where my luggage was meant to be unpacked - which had a burned out bulb in it. The TV had no reception whatsoever. The standard coffee machine was missing. I spent the first hour of my time there dealing with the front desk (when they stopped putting me on hold), housekeeping and the engineers to get these basics. Even with the engineer working on the TV and getting a picture, it came in and out throughout the rest of my stay. (I work in TV so having a functioning one is a basic necessity to me.) I also called the desk to advise them that I had a room with missing framed art, so they didn't accuse me of taking it. The woman I spoke to couldn't dismiss me fast enough. --It's understandable that the hotel has had to cut costs due to the economy. So face washcloths are gone, pens are gone. OK, no problem. But no bathmat for stepping on out of the shower and no rubber shower mat (or nothing attached to the tub floor to prevent slipping)? I had 80-year-old parents with me and I worried about them slipping in the tub. H-ll, I was worried about me slipping in the tub. This might be a cost savings but it's also an insurance risk. --Bookings were all screwed up. While that's normally just a headache to work out, it became extremely problematic when I tried to leave messages for my parents about my flight delay, to tell them to have dinner early without me. For some inexplicable reason, the hotel put both reservations under my name - despite the fact these reservations were booked separately and our confirmation paperwork showed the distinction. I finally instructed the very confused operator just to leave the same message on both rooms so they would be covered with whichever room they were given when they checked in. My parents received no message so they waited. --Let me offer a few good things. While the hotel is probably the closest on that strip to the airport (a plus) and right on a busy road, it's well-soundproofed on the outside. Not so much on the inside; noise carried from the hall including some very loud partiers at 2am. Room service was solid - decent selection, fast service, nice staff - and that's fairly consistent at all Radissons. Ask for a room facing the airport and you'll be entertained by the gorgeous outdoor artwork (giant pillars of changing lights) that greet arrivals at LAX. But there is a general lack of good management at Radissons. With probably 20-30 visits at various Radisson hotels over the past decade, mostly in the west, they are always just a big off: rooms are often missing basics, burned out lightbulbs and dead batteries in tv remote controls are frequent, standard things are not there. two days into a weeklong stay at a Radisson, the housekeeper amazingly threw out my hardcover book on my nightstand...then when I asked them to check their trash area (which turned up nothing) and then reimburse me, they accused me of lying about the book's existence. A few times when I travelled under the corporate arrangement, I found welcome gifts from the manager(s) in the room upon arrival: the fruit plate left for me once had mostly overripe mushy fruit, and when I was sent a bottle of wine the 2-part corkscrew that came with it had only 1 part. These are all symptoms of poor oversight and lack of accountability by staff. So while the Radisson LAX room was clean and the room service was decent, it required more work than should be needed by a guest staying there for a one-nighter.

When I finally made it to the front of the line at the concierge desk (where your room key is supposed to be waiting for you if you use this service), he curtly said, \"No, it's not here,\" and pointed me to the very long line at the regular check-in counter. I said that the whole point of using the express check-in was to avoid that experience. He snapped, \"There's a difference between 'express check-in' and 'express yourself'\", at which point I simply pointed to the \"Express Yourself\" sign right above his head that matched my confirmation paperwork exactly. He then grumbled and took me to the front of the regular line. Not a good start. Then, on my first day, housekeeping never showed up. I left the sign on the door when I went out at 2:30 pm, but they never came. Calls to housekeeping that night (well, it was New Year's Eve, so...) went unanswered. I did leave them a note and the next day they left me twice as much of everything, so that was nice. I had planned before arrival to spend New Year's Eve at the \"Top of the Radisson\" lounge, which sounded very nice on the hotel website.

Crazy. Main Meals were anywhere from 25-45 USD. We asked at reception and were told that there was another restaurant on one of the higher floors but it was more expensive than the one we were just looking at. I cannot imagine how much more expensive, we just went back to our room and ordered room service. We called down to order, the gentleman taking the order was very nice however he did advise the meal may take 45minutes up to an hour !!!!! Pretty crazy to be honest. But we just said fine. 50 minutes later we got our food and were told the food may be a little cold as the lift\u2019s were not working and only one was in operation so it took the guy a while to get up with the food. Ok we understand the lift is not the guys issue, but the cold food was his issue. I found it pretty wrong that they would openly bring you cold food and admit it and charge you full price and expect a tip !!!!!!! Not on. Keeping in mind that by this stage we had not eaten for about 21 hours and when we asked how long before we could get HOT food, we were told 45 minutes to an hour.

Check in went well, however our room was musty and humid even with the air conditioner on for an hour, after calling the front desk 3 times and waiting an hour we were moved to another room, which had hair on the bed, and \"crusted stains\" on the bed spread.

The switch to the AC was broken off so we had to use a pen/hanger to push the button, wall paper is peeling in bathroom, vents are filthy, and wall plates for light switch are broken off in parts.

Not having to drive back and forth was worth the stay regardless, but make no mistake, this is primarily a business-type of hotel. Upon arriving, the parking lot was under construction and valet was the only option for hotel parking. Being the starving college students that we are, we opted to park in a near-by lot for airport parking, which worked just fine. Check-in was a breeze. The staff was very friendly and we were allowed into our room a good 45 minutes before the listed check-in time of 3pm. The Saturday we were there was also Final Four day, and we had allotted time to watch both games in the room before going on with our evening. The television reception of CBS 2 was tolerable at best, but thankfully, with the hotel's free internet, we were able to watch both games in high-definition on my laptop. Our plans for the night in Culver City got canceled, so we were left with the frenzied task of finding something to do in the area without a car (parking lot charged more for ins-and-outs). This is no knock on the hotel itself, but there isn't much to do in terms of nightlife in the general vicinity, and that wouldn't be a problem for most guests of the hotel. We opted for a little bit of a cultural experience and wandered LAX for a few hours topping it off with a late dinner at the McDonalds in the international terminal. A real fun experience, to be completely honest. We got back to the hotel around midnight and the lobby was empty. Almost creepy. Again, that comes with the turf. Looking back, The Custom hotel a few miles north would have been a better option had we known our plans were scrapped. PROS - Nice, modern rooms with super comfortable beds and good air conditioning. The view was also great. We requested a runway view and got quite a bit of amusement out of that. The two double bed set-up didn't feel nearly as cramped as i've experienced in other hotels. The biggest pro, hands down, was the sound-proofing of the place. The double-pane windows let NO sound in whatsoever even though planes were coming in constantly a few hundred yards from our room. CONS - The elevator system was laggy and confusing at times. This may have been fixed by now. Also, out of boredom, we tried to locate the stairwell. found one, but it was downright creepy. rusty pipes, dark, and odd stains and splatters on the walls. Again, nothing that was too big of a deal, and the hotel was/is going under construction. One more thing was the pool area. Because of it's vicinity to the airport as well as Sepulveda blvd, the pool and spa area was very noisy (nothing anyone can do about that, obviously), but when we arrived, there was nobody out there midday on a Saturday. That, combined with the 70s, horror film architecture of the pool area and the imposing Eastern-European looking office building in the background, turned us off from taking a dip. Overall, though... it's a great hotel for anyone traveling in or out of LAX... especially the closeness to the airport, the quiet rooms, and great prices.

Some hotel features, such as the business center, are not really functioning during renovation, or are on a very limited basis. There are two things that make this hotel exceptional, however. First, customer service. Everyone tried to be extremely helpful. When I needed a letter mailed, it was taken care of for me. The porter was helpful and cheerful. The personnel aimed to please. Second, is location. The hotel is literally within walking distance of LAX airport. I walked over three times to eat and found the walk safe and very do-able. In fact, I saw many airline pilots and stewardesses walking to the hotel with their overnight bags. There are other hotels that are also close to the airport, but the Radisson is the closest.", "Date": "May 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA good base to explore LA\u201d", "Author": "cosmicgirl1978", "ReviewID": "UR29550602", "Content": "We wanted a good location to stay in order to see the sights of LA and the Radisson served us well, as it was close to the airport and several car hire places.

Our second room was much smaller, and strangely, most of the pictures on the walls had been removed, leaving the fixtures behind. It was much quieter though, and no noise from the airport due to well insulated if ugly windows. The room was cleaned well, the only problem we had was a persistantly leaking tap.

We turned up at the hotel to be told that they did not have the reservation and had not heard of Opodo. The gentleman on reception tried different phone numbers on our reservation sheet but Opodo was closed! However, he was very sympathetic and checked us in to a room. This is something he did not have to do. As a result of this, I cannot thank him enough. I decided to get up at 3.30 am and contact Opodo (time difference). I did not have any change and was not prepard to walk the streets of LA at such a time to look for a shop to get change to use the public phone. As such, I called Opodo from the hotel room. I was informed that they had forgot to pass my reservation on to the hotel. Not good enough! Incidently, Opodo forgot to pass another reservation on to a different hotel. PLEASE DONT BOOK WITH OPODO. LOCATION: the closest hotel to LAX. They operate a free and reliable shuttle. Some other reviews have mentioned that you have to pay for the shuttle. You dont. It's free. ROOM; Big, clean and modern.

Day 3 we headed to Universal Studios... If you are not going to be in the heart of LA for your stay why stay there with their over ex-y prices, expensive car parking etc. The staff at the Radisson were extremely knowledgeable and printed out MapQuest directions for every destination we went to and step by step directions on how to get back to the hotel. They have a huge amount of local knowledge which was great for us, especially as this was the first time we had driven in the US. Car parking at the hotel was $13US per night - but we knew this anyway and was really cheap compared to everywhere else. Other reviews are spot on there is no noise from the airport, it is clean, spacious room. Our shower was the worse thing - it trickled, but when we mentioned it to the Front Desk they offered to move us straight away...

My first trip is unmemorable to me now, but it must have been good enough that I decided to try it again. It's not a bad hotel by any means; rooms are very clean and generally comfortable, but on coming into the room, I noticed it was a little warm. I went over to the thermostat -- which was literally disattached from the wall -- and tried to cool things down from the 75 on the readout to a more comfortable 68 or so. The thermostat itself is very similar to the one in my home, so I knew how to adjust the settings, and no matter what I tried, there was no indication that it was working. I left for the evening, hoping it would have kicked in in the interim. When I returned, the room was still in the mid-70s, so I went down to the desk to request either a new room or a repair. After waiting in line (at 11:45 pm! The desk invariably had a line), the clerk assured me that they'd send a maintenance man up to look at it. I went back upstairs, and sure enough, within a few minutes, the maintenance guy appeared. I pointed out the unattached thermostat, which he re-screwed to the wall, then he climbed a ladder to look at the air conditioning's innards. After a few moments examination, he assured me it was broken (I had gotten that much myself) and that they would have to tear it apart to repair it right. He suggested I tell this to the desk and get a new room in the morning. Aftter he left, I did indeed to back to the desk (another line!) and was finally told by the same clerk that they were fully booked (given the crowds in the lobby at that time of night, I believed him), so the room-switch was out. He immediately asked what he could do as a make-good. I said I didn't know, so he offered me a free breakfast. Not a lot, but he was trying; I'll give him that. I went back up to the room, and while it was still about 73. it wasn't awful, and I was able to sleep soundly. The next morning, I told another desk clerk that I wouldn't be needing the breakfast, but that I hoped the room would be repaired. When I returned late that evening, the situation was the same, but again, not to the point where sleep was difficult. Other than that, I have few complaints.

He told me to have a drink in their sky lounge with a view that's worth watching, so I went straight to the lounge which was totally empty at the time (around 5pm). As I enetered the sky lounge the waiters are nicely greeted me, had a small talk and ordered a drink. The view of the LAX was really nice. :) It could look prettier at night. Anyhows, as I finished my drink, the waiter asked me if I'm ready to order a food. I was there for a drink so asked him a check, then he suddenly gave me a very cold look, goes back to the kitchen entrance are where there were other co-workers and told them I was there just for the drink. They should change the name to Sky restaurant, then any customer will be reluctant to go just for the drinks. This case, I wouldn't have been there w/o the friendly concierge suggested me to check it out. The room is a typical 3 star hotel room with so-so bed comfort. the window has a doulbe shield, and the view was nice with the colorful light objects.

I chose this hotel because it offered free shuttle service to & from the airport. Great feature. Having never been to Los Angeles, I asked the hotel Concierge, by the name of Tim, to direct me in the easiest & most economical way to get to the port. Tim was exceptionally friendly & helpful & informed me that there was no shuttle or bus service, that a taxi would cost me $150 & that I was better to take the \"Limo/Car' service offered through the hotel for $120, but would give me a deal at $99. As that appeared to be the way to go, I booked the car service to not only take us to the port, but to pick us up when we returned from our cruise as we were staying another night at the Radisson before returning to Canada. Throughout the cruise as we talked with other passengers, we learned that there is indeed a shuttle service from hotels to San Pedro & that the taxis advertise $53 from LAX airport to the port. I was extremely upset over this & felt I had been taken advantage of by the concierge. Due to a delay in the ship clearing customs, we did take a taxi back to the Radisson & it only cost us $57!! To cut a long story short, both Tim & the car service apologised for the misleading information I was given & did not charge me for our initial ride to the port for our cruise. We did hire the car service & a driver for a 3 hour sightseeing tour of LA. This was very expensive at $65 an hour & of course had there been more people to share the vehicle the expense would have been less. But we really enjoyed having a personal tour guide. The rooms in the hotel were large & beds very comfortable. So all in all, I would certainly recommend the hotel & the car service.

The check-in went smoothly and because we drove to the hotel the clerk explained the parking proceedure and daily charge of $13.00. The parking garage( 2 levels) was behind the hotel and quite large. Hotel guests were able to park on the lower floor. With a validation ticket from the front desk you can leave and enter the parking area at no extra charge. Our room,# 901, was on the south side of the building wilth a view of the hightway entrance to the airport and runways. The only problem with viewing the sites was the window was dirty and with the sound material on the window it was hard to see a clear view of the outside. The room, or more accurately, a roomette, was below average size. With one king size bed, a small table and chair, and furniture for the tv, there was not much room left to move around. The bathroom was very small with very little counter space around the sink area. The room and bathroom needed a good cleaning and updating. There was a cigarette smell that was quite noticeable in the room and bedding. There are 6 elevators for the hotel floors. Going up is ok BUT going down from your room can be a 2-3 or 4 minute wait for a going down elevator. Obtaining breakfast and dinner, at a reasonable price, at the hotel was impossible. They have one restaurant, which appears to be their signature restaurant, with very high prices. (one small box of cornflakes = $4.00) Dinner for two without any drinks or dessert was $ 55.00. They had a breakfast/lunch room but it was closed for what ever reason. It appears that management is going after the business traveler with their pricing structure. The gift shop also had very high prices. Staying at this hotel would be good if you drove to L.A to fly out of LAX. The facility appears to be set-up for this business and from what we saw many, many people are using this service.

When I tried to check into the hotel I was informed that the computers were down and that I would need to wait an hour for the computers to come back up. After waiting for 1 hour in the lobby I proceeded to check in. I went up to my assigned room only to find that when I opened the door there was a female guest screaming. The room had obviously already been assigned to someone else. I returned to the lobby, explained the situation and was assigned a new room number. I entered the new room to see that all of the bedding and curtains were old and very faded. The room was clean however it was not a comfortable room. I pulled out my laptop to connect to the internet received an error stating that there was a problem with the host. I called the front desk to inquire about the problem. They said they would send an engineer to my room to take a look at the problem. The engineer arrived promptly. After performing a few checks he determined that there was a problem with the jack. He explained to me that they often had problems with the internet in certain rooms. He offered to change my room. I agreed. We went to the new room only to find that the Internet did not work in that room either. The engineer told me to stay in my original room. He gave me a phone number to call for their tech support. I called and spoke to the tech support. He told me that he would advise his engineer and then send him to fix the problem. Nobody ever came. After waiting several hours for a response I called the tech support again only to be told that he couldn't help. I then decided to order a pay per view movie. After selecting a movie on the screen and agreeing to payment the screen went black. I called the front desk and explained the problem and they said they would send an engineer. The engineer arrived promptly. He looked at the TV briefly before offering to change my room. I explained that I would move only if they could ensure that the pay per view would work in the new room. I did not want to move all of my luggage again. The engineer said he would go test the system in the new room and then call be back with the info. I never heard anything back. Another troublesome fact about this hotel was that everytime I went to take the elevator it would take literally 10 minutes before the elevator arrived. I do not understand why. I was at the hotel for 3 days and this happened every day! In summary, this is an old hotel that offers an uncomfortable room, and an incompetent staff with zero accountability.

They sent some engineers up to work on it and they got it working - with my ethernet cable I travel with, not the cable provided by the hotel. We chose to use our 2 dinner vouchers in the hotel restaurant downstairs (Palmira Bar and Grille) and was very, very displeased with the level of service we received. The watier was impatient and dissapeared after taking our order. The food tasted great, but upon requesting the check, the waiter then decided to bus the table (very aggresively and noisily) right in front of us as we finished the last of our drinks. I had notified of the food voucher before ordering and told the waiter I would like to charge the remaining (i.e. tax & tip) to my room. We finally got it settled when he opened another tab on the room for $0.02 and then I added the tip (I was just flying in from overseas and didn't have cash). The breakfast vouchers specifically said they could not be applied toward room service purchases. However, breakfast didn't start in the hotel until 6:00am, and our flight was departing at 6:27am. I called the 'Guest Services' to see what could be done about this, and they authorized for use of the vouchers for room service. So we attempted to order room service at 2:30am (we were still on Asia time). It said the service was 24 hours, but we called 5 times over a period of 20 minutes before we finally reached someone. Order was taken promptly and delivered in just the same manner. It was well prepared and tasted good. The vouchers were presented to the attendant and the remaining balance was paid for in cash, not charged to the room. Upon check-out early that morning at 4:00am, the front desk manager told me their computer systems were down and they wouldn't be able to finalize bills. He told me there was a balance of around $40 for room service remaining and I told him about the food vouchers we had used for room service. He assured me it would be no problem and when they system was up and running it would all be worked out and they would email me a copy of the itemized invoice after that. Four days later I still have not received anything from the hotel, and they still charged my card for an amount I have no idea what it relates to (i.e. no itemized invoice to detail).

Here are a list of the negatives: Positives 1) Close to the airport, and rooms were quiet. Its a lottery if you get a clean room. Negatives 1) Shuttle Bus is frequent, but it stops at two other hotels and it can get crowded. The bus takes upto 15 mins to the hotel although it is probably only 5 mins away. 2) Initial check in was friendly(lots of jokes), and there was no long wait. Rooms are not great. We were given a room on the 10th floor (it was supposed to be a non-smoking floor) but as soon as we came out of the lifts there was a heavy smell of smoke. We then went into the room, it was small and in poor condition. I then informed the same check in person and all jokes stopped. He gave me another room, which i went to only to find another couple were moving to look to another room because of a fault in the bathroom! I then informed the same check in person and he gave me a room which was on average o.k but there was still a strange odour in the room ! 3) Hotel staff were not flexible at all. I was initally staying 3 nights in the hotel, then flying to Vancouver for 3 nights and back to the Raddison for 1 night. I asked the hotel after my first check out if it was possible to leave 1 small suitcase in the hotel for 3 nights for collection on my return. The guest realations person said this was o.k, but when I went to the Bellman he asked who had said yes. I mentioned it was a person on guest relations who had a name similar to a manager on the front desk and the Bellman said it was not a problem, he had done it many times before. However, the Front Desk Manager came out and he said he was not aware of saying yes. I pointed out that I had spoken to his namesake in guest relations and thats when I was told it was not company policy to store luggage for more then 24hrs and then started quoting me rates of $10 per day for storage. Whether at this time I was supposed to pay some sort of tip to either one I don't know but I expect some consistency in the hotel staff.

We were there and it was not packed, but the three guys they had working there were __BUSY__ the entire time, and we could not get a drink. Eventually we got a round and some food, but then, we couldn't get the bill! I mean, seriously, this place is a great location with fine decor, we would have blown tons of cash drinking at the hotel bar if only they had any service. We ended up walking down to the Sheraton and enjoying the ambience there. Those guys can run a hotel bar, know what I'm sayin? Oh, the $12 martinis we had that night. How wonderful they were. So that really ticked us off, I mean we're buying $13 martinis and we can't even get service. For someone from Minnesota, you think $13 martini might mean decent service, but no, not anything like it. The breakfast was adequate to mediocre. Satisfactory. Your basic hot-trays of scrambled eggs and bacon, unartistically presented, yawn, with a few attendants running about trying to get everyone coffee. Ho hum. When getting off the elevator, you know the little sign that says \"201-221 -->\" and indicates which way your room is? Well, the numbers were falling off and you had to use trial and error to find your room. The hotel is very close to LAX, but there is no point in walking there. Even at midnight the little bus was running. And it would have been a pretty hazardous walk. So, it's pretty obvious that our ridiculous experience at the hotel bar pretty much ruined our stay at the hotel. That might seem petty, but sometimes a single detail, like non-existent service at the hotel bar, can just blow a whole stay. And it did, for us. Would never stay there again. The Sheraton is nearly as close, and those guys have a bar AND a sushi restaurant. That said, if you are a conventioneer, don't stay at LAX unless you are already renting a car.

We got the property for a $53 Priceline bid. The shuttle service to and from the airport was great and the rooms were pretty with a great view. However, because of the soundproofing on the windows there was no air circulation and our air conditioner kept freezing up and turning itself off so that the room would become hot and stuffy. The food situation was the absolute worst! There is not a single vending machine onsite to get a little snack, so having arrived at midnight we were completely dependant on room service. We ordered up some steak and eggs for $21.50 a plate and when they finally arrived about 45 minutes later (Thank God Taxicab Confessions was on TV to help pass the time!) the food was cold and pathetic, with burnt fried eggs topping teeny tiny dry looking steaks, sans the promised breakfast potatoes. We called up to inquire about the potatoes, and they simply said they were out and there would be no substitutions., We told them we wanted to send the steaks back and order something else and they agreed, so we got 2 pasta primaveras, which was so foul tasting my husband didn't eat his. About 2 hours later I began to get sick and had to fly back from LA to Denver with, without going into sickening detail, what I suspect was a fairly raging case of food poisoning which has lasted 2 days. To add injury to insult, we were charged the prices for the original meals, which were almost twice as much, and the front desk refused to give us a breakdown of the food bill so we could see what we were actually being charged for!!!

We stayed one night Feb 27th and found the hotel to be OK nothing exciting but we were just looking for a place to crash before catching an early AM flight back to Boston. When we arrived at the hotel the \"self\" check in was full and as I had 2 kids and 88 yr old Mom with me I found this very inconvenient. The valet guy was not particularly helpful at first (who wants to wait on a middle age Mom when there are limos lined up everywhere) as it was Oscar night but he valet parked my car for an hour so we could check in before returning the car to Hertz. On check out they wanted to charge me for valet parking (something like $14) until I reminded them that the \"self\" was full and I didn't have any options. Check in was somewhat of a nightmare as the system had \"crashed\". It seemed as though the system must frequently crash as they had a system worked out with walkie talkies and paper cards to determine who got what room. Truly bizarre! We had to wait about 40 mins to be given a room. There were 4 of us so no we couldn't snuggle into a king bed room!! I had booked at the Radisson for the pool & hot tub for the kids but we had a hard time finding it and it was so dark and scary that they wouldn't go near it. The room was quite small though it had a good view of LA from the 9th floor with a little airport noise but not bad. They did quickly bring a rollaway once I reminded them about it. Come to think of it I don't think they charged me for the rollaway. We didn't pay much for the room $69 so that was a plus and we used room service which came pretty quickly and was fairly reasonable and tasty. They had a very big room service menu with lots of casual choices which was great for the teenage kids. I didn't frankly feel safe enough in the area around the hotel to walk outside with an older person and kids to find somewhere else to eat and besides we wanted to watch the Oscars on TV!
