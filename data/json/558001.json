{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A very poor hotel indeed This hotel is one to avoid. The hotel rooms and public areas smell heavily of smoke. The room was small, dusty and smelt strongly of cigarettes. The pillows on the bed had a bad smell as if they had not been washed. The bathroom was not very clean and smelt of urine. Fortunately only stayed one night on a short package tour to China and Hong Kong. On making representation to hotel management about the problems, quite frankly the management did not want to know and were noisy and unsympathetic. The only good thing is its excellent locaton.", "Date": "Jul 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR958869466", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Gordon257"}, {"Content": "Terrible Hotel Hi,I am planning for another holiday trip in HK this year and I suddenly remembered my terrible experience in Chung Hing few years back.The hotel was recommended by the tour agency. They said that the hotel was relatively new, a 3-star hotel with a ok location. However upon reaching the hotel, i almost fainted. The lift is very wuloo and I knew someting is not right. Same as the previous reviewer, I stayed on 15th floor too ( the top level). Its terrible!! there were so many dark patches on the carpet. It looked so dirty and cold. We have to use keys for the room (which t thought is outdated now). Next is our nightmare, we requested for a 3-person room yet there were only 2 single beds. When we asked the person in charge, she said we only have mattress, no extra bed. BUT!! The mattress is so disgusting!! As if it had lots of bugs on it. Who dare to sleep on it?? We felt so cheated by the TOUR AGENCY! Due to budget and time contraints, we accepted the fact and we combined the beds to slp. We tried to stay away from the hotel whenever its possible. Inside the room, I find it ok actually. However, the bath room is not so fine. The heater is not working well. Either the water is too hot or too cold. At night while sleeping, we could hear many noises such as water drawing from the pipes on top of the roof, doors opening and closing. In short, the sound insulation is very bad for the hotel and its very disturbing at night. Therefore, if given a choice, please do not stay in this hotel even though the location is quite accessible.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR987329097", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "elilo"}, {"Content": "We stayed there 3 nights and we felt that it's without air in room. We stayed there 3 nights with 2 rooms and we felt that it's without air in all of 2 rooms. We had to open window and it become okay and better. Inside of 2 rooms were not smell of cigarette. We stayed 3 people in a room and extra bed couldn't sleep. The elevator always strong cigarette smell everydays as well as no smoking written. The size of rooms are small and narrow.
