I am sorry that I have to say, I dont go looking for mildew in the shower, I dont go looking for a piece of paint pealing or a scuff on the wall or a small stain on the carpet, that to me is being nit picky, and to be honest when I read those reviews it makes my blood boil, as hotels are high traffic areas, and they work very hard to keep it to where the dont have to charge you a few hundred to stay there, if you want to live in bubbles stay home and clean your own house like that, but those are silly to say the least. Now I was there this past sunday, and was woke up because of a fire alarm, I did my duty and evacuated the room, went down 26 flights of stairs, but did I complain, nope, I would rather those people keep me safe then let me burn. But it always makes me laugh when I see the reviews on here, so I just like to say for the record, to go to this hotel and enjoy it.

We were told that it was Spring Break week, so there were a lot of children with their families there. I noticed that there were a lot of activities centered around the kids, so it's definitely a family friendly hotel. I didn't try the water slide, so I can't comment on that. When we got to our room, we had a very nice view of the city on the 23rd floor, and overall it was very clean. I didn't get the sticky feel of a poorly done housekeeping job. The beds were pretty comfy; got a good night's sleep, except for the pillows were too high for my liking, but that's just personal choice. I'm giving this rating for the good points mentioned above but more than anything, it's a great location. When we got to the hotel on the first day, we parked and didn't have to use the car the whole time we were there. It's right in the middle of downtown Toronto and everything we needed was at walking distance. The mall, the restaurants, the attractions, it was great! The pricing for the stay was not too bad; we got a discount because it was spring break week, and the fee for parking was the best in the area. The only issue I had with the pricing was that I had to pay a fee to have internet connection in our room, and it was dial-up :( Big no-no. It was a fast connection, but I didn't like to have to pay for it. If I needed wi-fi, it was only in the lobby.

We were looking for a \"big city\" get-awayand the Delta Chelsea made it clear on the web-site they were very kid friendly. My children wanted a pool and the pics of the waterslide and pool, coupled with a good price sold me. In short, it was a bad choice. The rooms they offered us were three floors apart and the pool is very small, even by Toronto hotel standards. We were assured when reserving...and paying in full, in advance, that we would have adjacent rooms yet they were unable to deliver. The hotel was so booked with families that swim times had to be arranged in advance. When we checked in at 3pm all swim times were already fully booked for the rest of the day and dispite assurances that the next morning would be \"wide open...no need to book ahead\" I discovered at 8:30am the only remaining time available was 45 minutes at 12 noon and even then they could not accomodate all four of us. I appreciate that march break is busy and unpredictable, but the hotel gave no indication that pre-booking swim times would be required, even at check-in and I find that unacceptable. Compounding the situation is the Delta's apparently new contact policy. There is no phone number or email available for the hotel on the web-site...or in fact anywhere, and when I asked for an email address/phone number to speak with management I was told by the conceirge that no contact information was available. Delta appear to have passed their on-line and telephone reservations to a third party and the lack of contact information for the hotel is conspicuos in it's absence.

Having got past these unhelpful opening remarks, I was quickly offered a new, larger, quieter room at no extra charge. This was a more modern room than the first, but the common parts of the hotel are all looking a bit tired and old. Extraordinary but true: Internet in rooms is wired only, costs $14 per 24 hours, and is somewhat unreliable but fast when connected (I wasted a fair bit of time wrestling with the login system). Neither of my rooms had a safe or a fridge. The nicer one had 1 robe and both had a decent supply of toiletries. There's a decent gym/pool on the top floor (with another pool for families elsewhere).

There were hand prints all over the windows and balcony door, the wall paper was torn in many places, there were holes in the bathroom wall where an appliance seems to have been removed. Our room faced a construction site, so we were greeted with the sound of cranes and jackhammers every morning at 7 a.m. Just what you want in a vacation! The hotel was so crammed with people that you had to BOOK TIME IN THE POOL every morning. We were allowed two 50 minute slots a day, not back to back, so swam in the evenings from 9-10 p.m. in a packed pool with 75 other people. There is no wifi available in the rooms and wired internet costs $15 a day. There is free WiFi available in the lobby, but frankly, when I can get free WiFi for the price of a cup of coffee at Starbucks or Second Cup, I expect it included with the cost of a three night stay in a hotel, too. Many of the other 3-stars in Toronto offer WiFi free, in-room. The final insult was the breakfast buffet that we had on our last day. (I'm typing from the table right now.) Horrible scrambled eggs, blah, mushy potatoes, cold rubbery pancakes. The bacon was decent, as was the cup of tea I helped myself to. Juice was served in small plastic cups. There were some nice touches, and you can see that the Delta is really courting the family crowd. There were lots of family activities planned, movie nights and bingo in the meeting rooms. In the afternoon, managers served up popcorn and iced tea (iced tea? for kids?) in the lobby, which was a nice treat when we waited in line to check in. The check-in line was enormously long, easily 45-50 people ahead of us when we arrived, but we were checked-in in under 10 minutes.

The location is absolutely amazing. Literally 2 blocks from the Eaton Centre and in the heart of the action. The room however, is very very tired and definitely in need of some updates. I travel a lot for work, so I have come to have certain expectations of hotels - whether they are Travelodge, Comfort Inn, Holiday Inn or a Delta chain. The room was very small, I don't remember them being so small, but I guess they are. The ad also indicates \"balcony access\". The access however is blocked off with wood, so you can not actually go out the patio door. The bathroom had a lot of rust around the trim of the door and on the floor. There was no Kleenex - which doesn't sound like a big deal, but when working with a cold, toilet paper just doesn't cut it. A major deal breaker for me as a business traveler is that there are no plug ins near the bed. The alarm function on the clock did not work and I always need a back up solution to wake up calls, so it meant putting my phone in the bathroom to plug it in. Another problem was that 1 of the coffee cups had stains in it which were rather unappealing. It took 1.5 hrs to get a new cup!! 1.5 hrs!! I went to the front desk but they could not provide it to me at the desk, I had to wait for it to be delivered. So 1 front desk visit, 2 calls and 1.5hrs later, I was able to have a cup of coffee. The room is also very outdated in terms of the pictures on the wall, but that's neither here nor there, just something I thought I'd note. I really am not a picky person, but these are just easy standards that I've come to expect and would highly expect any Delta hotel to meet. It's unfortunate. It may have just been the room I had, and I will hope for that because the location really is amazing. Next time I will spend the extra money and stay at the Sheraton instead as I have stayed there recently and know they live up to their Sheraton name.

That was acceptable, as check-in wasn't until 3pm, but the Front Desk staff told us to come back in one hour and they would rush our room. Again, that was great. Upon return, we were told that our room was facing the construction across the street. We were tired and just wanted to lay down, so we didn't protest and went up to the room. I understand that it is not the hotel's fault that a condominium is being built across the street, but the noise level was absolutely unacceptable. Not only that, the room they put us in was old and dumpy. The TV was a tiny tube TV and the bedspread, curtains and carpet looked old and worn. I phoned Guest Services, requesting a room change and was told that the hotel had nothing else available. I protested that we were not paying the same rate as someone in one of the renovated rooms for this old, noisy room, and they put me on hold. When they came back, the woman I was speaking to told me they would put in a request for a new room for me, but would have to downgrade us from King Bed to a single Queen Bed. We were desperate to get out of our current room and agreed. She ensured me she would call me back and give me an approximate time the room would be ready. After 20 minutes, I phoned back and spoke to the same woman who said that she didn't call back because she didn't have a time for me. I mentioned that we had dinner reservations in just over an hour and would need to know if we should get ready and have the staff move our luggage to our new room, or if we should wait, move and then change. She again said she would phone back. Another 20 minutes pass and I phone again. This time I speak to a gentleman about the situation and he says that my room has been ready for a while and to come down to the Front Desk to get new keys. The new room they placed us in was great: no noise, new decor and it had a King Bed. I hate to think the worst of people, but I wonder if the woman at Guest Services lied to us about downgrading from a King to Queen bed to try to get us to remain in the first room. I am really disappointed in the Delta Chelsea, mainly because I felt that my age was a factor in the service I received. Yes, I'm a young person and not a frequent traveler, but that doesn't mean that I don't deserve to be respected. I understand that the hotel has to fill all of its rooms to make profit, even the old rooms facing construction, but it really seemed like the staff did everything possible to keep us out of a \"good\" room.

The main restaurants are a bit of an over complicated set up, you go in and on the left is a kind of fine dinning area and ahead is the main body of the restaurant which are served by the same waiting staff and the menu's are the same... Bar that, food's great. The rooms are big enough and comfortable but they are in need of a spruce up. The adult pool and gym on the top floor is a little tricky to find, and once you get there is nice and clean enough but the pool is only 20 feet long so swimming is a short affair. The gym is well equipped and the view over Toronto takes your mind off the pain of running on the tread mills. The kids area looked great, I was on business so didn't have the family with me but it looked like it had everything the would want in spade fulls. It's really central to the downtown area so handy for shopping, sight seeing etc, it's just that little bit over complicated to find things and a little tired...", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Stay!\u201d", "Author": "Tammy B", "ReviewID": "UR125771306", "Content": "Amazing hotel, great location and wonderful staff!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgreat service. great people\u201d", "Author": "Cynthia I", "ReviewID": "UR125668542", "Content": "I travel quite a bit and end up staying here a lot. they are great people, take the time to get to know you and really, really value your business I feel safe as I do travel alone, and the rooms are always neat, clean and will appointed.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStarted rough ,ended great\u201d", "Author": "HabsfanJez", "ReviewID": "UR125599083", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel number of times,always liked this hotel for his location,and great fully-equipped gym.

The hotel (as said in many previous reviews) as seen better days.Its quite dated and could do with an overall.Having said that it was cheaper than its competitors so things have to be kept in context. The room was fine with a large double bed which was extremly comfortable and a clean bathroom.The TV has around 20 channels which was also ok.We had a room overlooking the huge new development going on outside the main entrance YUK!! Our room also had a balcony but was litrally FULL of pigeons and pigeon droppings!!! not the most pleasant of sights,surely the hotel could put up some kind of netting to stop the pigeons making homes outside the bedroom balcony doors??? We did visit the pool which was on the 25th floor which was very nice. The bars and resturants were also quite pleasant although on the one time we visited the \"Sports bar\" pub we were sat by the window overlooking the back entrance onto Young St and a large Rat was litrally sat in the bushes directly outside the window!! We made enquires with the conciege about visiting Niagra Falls but were put off by the high price.So we walked around the corner to the main bus station and got a public bus all the way to Niagra for half price!! We also enjoyed the pub just around the corner called the Elephant & Castle which had nice staff and nice food. The location of the Delta Chelsea is pretty good with a lot of places witin walking distance.Although while we were there it was a bone tingling Minus 18 degrees!!

After reading all the reviews I was pleasantly surprised to see upon arrival that the property was \"a little\" more upscale than what their website and the reviews had represented. Check in with my front desk clerk \"Gigee\" was a breeze. She exemplifies customer service with her kind and warm demeanor. As a matter of fact, all the staff treat you as if you're in a bed and breakfast with their attention to your needs, and not like they're actually in the largest hotel in Canada (which the D.C. is). Although just a few employees did give you the \"I don 't see you ignore\" when walking by them. But if you stopped them and asked a question then their demeanor was quite warm. I paid for my room via Expedia so the rate I got was good at 89.00 a night. It would've been a great rate but once you add the $34.00 (including tax per day) parking fee and almost $14.00 per day in-room wireless internet connection, then the rate was \"ok\" considering you're in the middle of downtown Toronto and a six minute walk from Toronto's Younge & Dundas Square area. The only blemish on the service was the concierge. I hate to berate people but the lady concierge was less than extraordinary. Bless her heart, you could tell she held a job that someone with more zeal and enthusiasm should have as her services were 2 out of 5 stars. I wanted to take my family to the Ontario Science Center and on the D.C. web site they boast a 20% discount at the Center if you show your room key. Well she knew nothing about it as she explained to me all the discount info. she had about the Center had expired in Dec, 2011. So I hesitated to allow her to say, \"well let me give them a call\". But that was her final answer. So I gave her another shot at redemption and I told her, your website for the hotel say's that I would get a 20% discount and she continued to stand-fast by her expired information from 2 months prior that \"she didn't know about any discounts there\".I know for a fact she had internet access to research this right in front of her and she had a phone, but just like \"Deal or NO Deal - that was her final answer! Luckily enough, when we went there the ticket agents at the Center knew about the D.C. 20% discount and obliged us with it. After that I guess I was a glutton for punishment and I asked her on the following day if there was any other breakfast restaurant options outside the property like a Denny's or something and she said she didn't know of any. But did she follow up on it again, no. So apparently she must be a managers mother-in-law or something because although she was kind she was also next to useless to me. So my service rating below represents her (whom I needed for advice while there) but everyone else I came into contact with was exemplary with 5/5 stars. Pros - Great location. No car needed to access plenty shopping Eaton Center, etc, and plenty restaurants. Nice view from the 23 floor were our room was located facing the \"non-construction\" side of the city. Very youthful, lively and international clientele. Also the D.C. apparently is the only Toronto hotel with balconies which makes it nice to step out to for fresh air or in the winter time to substitute as a mini fridge incase you have perishable snacks in you room. Decent dollar value and join them on Facebook for $25.00 to be used there. If youi have small children then there's a Kids Zone and pool with a 4 story enclosed water-slide! Cons - old style tube televisions (C'MON D.C.), rust on the balconies rails (please hire a paint contractor D.C.), mile long caravan of cars around check-out time with everyone parked in there expensive below ground parking maze trying to leave a the same time so check out either early or late. And during the final day of our stay a fire alarm sounded witch caused everyone on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th floors to be evacuated outside the hotel. This proved to only be a minor inconvenience and something obviously out of their control but we discovered that our emergency exit point door had to be violently kicked in order to open it due to a back pressure of air flow rushing into the emergency stair well from the 1st floor up the the 23rd.. Had there been an actual emergency then someone perhaps elderly couldn't open that door!!!! Also, one evening while reading a news paper in the lobby - a young lady with a hand full of shopping bags in one hand and a designer purse sat down in a chair about 8 feet from me. After making her phone call she got up and left her purse on the floor beside her chair. Once I noticed they I contacted a bell hop and asked him for a security representative who promptly responded. I showed him the purse exactly where she left it and I described what she looked like so that the right person would get her purse back. Now granted one doesn't do good deeds in order to be rewarded but it would've been nice had the security rep. offered a gratuitous coupon or something for two free drinks at the pub or something for being an honest Joe. After all - had I asked a bellman to take my luggage up then he would stand there with his hand out right!. Anyway, it would've encouraged the hotels clientele to do other good deeds that would benefit the property if word got out that such deeds would be appreciated is all, but that's just me! In closing would we return, we're already planning another D.C. stay for 6 weeks from now because it's over-all family value was 4/5 stars. But I know not to count on the concierge service too much. Also, if you're driving to the D.C. and your car is dirty then good luck in trying to find a car wash as I wish the D.C. had this as a add on service I would paid for!", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "calgary", "Title": "\u201cYuck\u201d", "Author": "christie4007", "ReviewID": "UR125285981", "Content": "I arrived at 9:40 Pm to be told my room wasn't ready.

What a fantastic surprise, and a very memorable moment for both of us. Santa Claus in the lobby waving to guests was a very nice touch too during the holiday season. All of the rooms have been updated, and are very well appointed.

The place is showing its age a bit and upkeep of a building like this must be a challenge. However the rooms are fine and it is very central. The multi-woer structure and the various colour coded elevators can be confusing for first timers I'm sure. Thru a web deal on the Delta site we got a Top Level Signature Club room for 136$ plus taxes. The room is comfortable, they put chocs on the pillow and give you bottled water. The bathrooms in most of the Deltas I've stayed in have been modest, certainly nothing to write home about. The bed was comfortable, but not nearly as good as the soft top of the Sheraton/Westin folk. As I said what makes this is the staff who answer the phone with your name, are unfailingly polite and helpful. The Club lounge has nibblies in the evening and a fine continental breakfast in the morning. I have in the past used the restaurant and it has been fine. Not on this occasion though.

We stayed here in February, 2012 as part of a group event. Some of us (including me) had a wonderful experience, while others were left feeling very underwhelmed. The key is in the definition of the \"DELTA\" room, which is the basic room at the Chelsea. There is no standardization to these rooms at all. Some of us got a decent-sized room with a balcony and a comfortable king-sized bed. Others in our group were in a small room with a queen bed and no balcony for the same price. The secret to success is to take a look at the room, decide if it meets your requirements or not, and if not immediately go back to the front desk and ask for a better room. They are well aware of the disparity among rooms and were quick to offer all guests who asked for better a nicer room. The hotel has several restaurants built in, and I can heartily recommend the all-you-can-eat bistro. It's amazing. However, the restaurants just outside the hotel are so good that eating at the hotel is a difficult choice to make. We attended as a couple and appreciated the fact that the hotel has a pool for kids/families and a pool on a completely different floor that is for adults only. The workout room is the best I've ever seen in a hotel, almost as good as the gym I pay monthly to attend. Again, it's a huge hotel and they've seen your problem before many times.

We had reserved \"City View\" room with kitchen. The Delta Chelsea hotel is shaped like a capital T. Our room was located at the top of the T. At about 6:00 am the following morning the jackhammers started and loud banging on steel which made it impossible to go back to sleep. Aparently there is a large structure being erected across the street and construction will continue for years to come. So the front desk personnel knew I was checking in and with 2 small children to boot but no word about construction. Down to front desk I go to change rooms. No problem. They happened to have one available at the inside of the T away from the construction. So now we have to re-pack all our gear including the kitchen supplies and get relocated to our \"new\" room.. We get to the new room and everything seems in order except its so cold in there you could hang a side of beef. We turn up the thermostat and after an hour my toes feel like they're going to fall off. Turns out we had to turn the thermostat up to 85 degrees F so the room could get to about 68 degrees. Another issue was the balcony door leaked air like a sieve and wouldn't open or close properly. Then around midnight I had to use the bathroom. I go to flush the toilet and no water! In fact no water in sink either. A quick call to front desk and they tell me water was being shut off from midnight to 5 am for maintenence and \"didn't someone tell you on check-in?\" Yeah ok. Then why am I calling you if I already knew? The hotel was very accomodating as far as comping us a free night plus $40 food voucher and free parking but the wife and I didn't care how much we spent, this was a Christmas gift and so long as we had a relaxing mini-vacation, all was well. But in reality we left feeling stressed and not rested. I will say they have a great pool area and slide for the kids but in the rec. hall most of the games are broken. The parking garage is a nightmare! I'm pretty sure it was in an episode of Nightmare on Elm Street if not it should have been! I would not recommend this hotel if you are travelling with a family or otherwise until they can invest some money into their rooms - better soundproofing, windows, heat and parking garage .

The rooms are clean and tidy. The hotel staff are friendly and are always more than willing to help out in any way that they can. It's a great family hotel-yet I've been there on business and find it relaxing and quiet to focus on my work. I feel like it is a safe place to stay which is comforting because I often travel there by myself with my 2 children with special needs.I love how there are so many things going on for children-We have been there when Santa has visited. Enjoyed March Break activiites with your great staff members. My son loves the bunny in the play area.

So we stayed in this hotel on the 8th floor on new year seve Dec. 31, 2011, checked out on Jan. 1st around noon. I was spending a romantic evening with my fiancee. Shortly after checking out and getting back home, I realized I left an special important item with sentimental value and a special card in the room. I know for a fact it fell behind specifiic location. After calling I was not allowed to return to get it after checkout + after repeated calls (6 to be exact) to hotel staff + housekeeping + 1 manager I have since been told the room was inspected and nothing was found even after I advised where to look. In other words my item had been most likely stolen by the grimy housekeeping staff and I was also told it took nearly 4 days to clean the rooms, another lie. These items could have easily been retrieved after I mad several calls, with the first call being made 2-3 hrs after checkout when the room had not been cleaned. I would not expect this from my own city. If someone stiole it, just admit, it don't lie to me. Additionally the TV in the room was outdated, and the room layout is in need of a makeover, our room had a musty smell. If you're thinking about booking here proceed with extreme caution, and god forbid you leave anything of value behind, you most likely will never see it again. This experience is enough to ensure me and ANYONE WE WORK WITH will NEVER EVER BOOK or stay at this hotel again.

My son and I, as well as my sister-in-law and her infant parked in your underground lot, and stood at their parking lot elevator for a few minutes waiting for its arrival in order to access the lobby. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come, and one of your staff passing by asked me and a group of their guests waiting with me, if we had pressed the button which calls the elevator. We certainly had. He re-pressed the button, which oddly enough, the people behind me didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153suggested solution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to wait. Another employee walked by a few minutes later and said it must be broken. We asked how to get up with a baby-stroller which cannot be collapsed easily, and he pointed and said to me only to make a right and then follow the road up. Then he left. My sister-in-law and I directed their other guests on how to access your facility. We pushed luggage and a baby-stroller up their automotive exit ramp, where their parking attendant advised us that we should be taking the elevator. However, upon our explanation, he agreed to open the parking gate for us so we could get up to the main entrance. Then after waiting about fifteen minutes in queue to check-in, I asked for a room close to my family members who had checked in the day earlier, I was advised by the desk clerk that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a room without two pieces of photo ID. I had only my Drivers License as photo ID. I advised that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring my passport with me as their website doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention requirement of two pieces of photo ID. I asked why the clerk couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take any one of my four credit cards, birth certificate, SIN, Health Card, Drivers License, and various (including police security check for working with school-children) association cards. The Desk Clerk told me aloud (loud enough for other guests to hear) that there was so much fraud going on that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take anything other than two pieces of ID in case this credit cards had been stolen. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t verbatim, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty close. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you can see here where it goes downhill. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll point out right now that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a local business owner who has provided services within Delta Chelsea's facility several times. Often recommending my clients use the Delta Chelsea as their event venue of choice. I can tell you that I bend over backwards to make sure I treat my customers with respect due, and to avoid using words or actions that would ever insult them. Following what felt like a suggestion that perhaps I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m one of the vagrants who uses stolen credit cards and stolen drivers licenses, I asked to speak to the registration manager on duty. Their clerk advised me that the manager was busy. There was no pause, no looking around, not even looking at the clerk next to her for backup. She simply advised me that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s busy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When I said that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d need to speak to her manager, even if she is busy, the registrations clerk offered that I could go \u00e2\u20ac\u0153over there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pointing behind me and book myself in online and then I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need the two pieces of ID, I could get back in queue and come back to an attendant with a confirmation number provided online. At this time, my family members whom the clerk knew (as per my advise) were already booked-in, had come down to your lobby to pick up my son, but my sister in law and her infant remained with me at the front desk. I believe my sister-in-law was stunned and wanted to see what would occur, if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be denied lodging. I advised their clerk that I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to get back out of line after having invested the time and experienced what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had; that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to speak to her superior. She went away, came back with a manager, who advised her to process the request and provide us with a full-price room. The manager advised verbally that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d process my room request, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be putting damage insurance on my credit card due to my inability to produce a second piece of photo ID. Their attendant took my Driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s License in order to make a copy of it. Came back to me, and gave me a key to room 2331. Told us to use the blue elevators to the 23rd floor, and to have a nice stay. Now: room 2331. On what was clearly not a busy day for the 23rd floor, when this hotel clearly is not full, and my family members, also on the 23rd floor have large rooms, with identical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153two doubles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd requirements, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m interested in why I received a corner room facing the brick wall, with not enough room to bring our baby-stroller into the room and get past the foyer while we dressed to go out for dinner. We had to put the stroller in the hallway, come in with it behind us, and then send the stroller out into the hallway again in order to leave the room. Delta Chelsea has a remarkably uncomfortably sized rooms. I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you how very unimpressed we were with the customer service and the room provided to us. I was embarrassed and affronted by their staff members, and have had my feelings justified by my witness who agreed she also felt their registrations attendant went out of her way to attempt to embarrass us. I sent an email asking to be refunded for my lodging costs as compensation for this experience, and suggested they revisit customer service requirements with their attendant so that no other customers feel insulted. I escalated when I hadn't heard back in a week. I haven't heard from their Director of Guest Services to date. On a positive note, we felt your attendants who open doors on the 29th and 30th were very quick and polite, and made up for some of the experience.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford", "Title": "\u201cWorst internet connection ever\u201d", "Author": "JM01234", "ReviewID": "UR122852576", "Content": "I have never experienced such a horrible internet connection in my entire life.

The rooms were extremely small and although modern stye, very run down. The bathroom floor was covered with hair and the bathtub did not drain when you had a shower. The worst part about this hotel was the noise level. They put us in a room that faced directly onto construction - the construction went late and it started at 7am including the weekends. As well, the room next door to us (which we are sure was vacant) had a radio alarm clock that would sound at 6:30 am and stay on until 7:30 am and the volume was on full blast so we could hear it through the walls. When I called to complain about it, the front desk did absolutely nothing about it. I even called back to give them reminders and they completely ignored my complaint. A fight on the balcony above us broke out between a couple and they continued to scream and slam the balcony doors - it was brutal. This hotel needss to really consider hiring more staff to monitor the halls and rooms for noise levels. I lost so much sleep and came away from a relaxing weekend with a serious loss of sleep. The business centre is very expensive - internet is charged per 15 minutes and it is very expensive. As well, the charges for making local calls is $2 per call for less than one minute - rip off!! The front desk did little to be accomodating - in additon to not responding to noise complaints, they were not the most accomodationg people. We had a friend call the front desk to speak with us and the front desk staff brushed them off saying that we had already checked out and we hadn't. The few good things about this hotel include: shuttle service to and from the airport, the very sweet pool boy, and the location.

Nothing happened so I called the hotel operator, who asked if my thermostat was off. Told her that I tried to activate the air conditioning without success. She advised that that was because \"we're on heat\". I guess that meant the a/c had been turned off for the winter. She said nothing could be done but sent the maintenance man up promptly.

It gives you speedy check-in - usually at a separate desk, and late check-out without extra charge. The biggest thing for us was free wired Internet access in our room (a great saving \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it could cost up to C$14 a day at most Delta hotels, and much more convenient than having to find a chair in the crowded lobby or restaurant, where WiFi was free of charge). Our experience of the regular check-in at this hotel was poor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the desk clerks were off-hand and lacked the ability to smile. In comparison, the Privilege desk was courteous, cheerful, and a lot less stressed. We spent two nights at the Delta Chelsea before an organised tour of Ontario and Quebec and a further night at the end of our holiday. We also spent nights at Delta hotels in Montreal, Quebec City and Ottawa - see separate reviews. Despite its convenient downtown location, we disliked the Delta Chelsea most of all. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big, big, big \u00e2\u20ac\u201c too big! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a utilitarian barn with 1,590 rooms! There were hoards of people everywhere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including lots of groups, lots of families, and the whole place seemed disorganised beyond belief. In particular, breakfast in the immense restaurant was noisy and chaotic, with self-serve areas being cleared at a ridiculously early time and long lines then forming at the various cooking and serving stations. The cash desk was hidden somewhere in the middle of the pandemonium and I reckon anyone could have come in off the street for breakfast without being noticed and without being asked to pay! Not all floors are served by all lifts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so you have to join a line to board a lift in the correct place to be sure of getting to the floor on which your room is located (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re colour coded, which I guess says it all). Once on your floor, you then follow signs to your room, reached by long, nondescript corridors. This reminded me of stark, characterless Intourist hotels in Russia, but with the space used there for old babushkas to sit guarding the keys on each floor being occupied by the ice and vending machines here.

Location is good and is in easy walking of local pubs, restaurants and malls, especially the neighbouring Eaton Centre: Downtown is nearby, as is Queens Park, though some way from Chinatown, the CN Tower and the Harbour Front The city reminded me of a scaled down version of New York - noisy, bustling, full of skyscrapers and working cranes but, as with all the Canadian towns & cities we visited, incredibly free from litter and graffiti. Masses of building projects, vehicles and malls but some pleasant leafy streets and residential areas, with expensive condominiums springing up all over the city. Our bedroom suite was on the 19th floor - a near two minute walk from the nearest lift. Corridors seemed endless and the large bedroom & twin 5' beds contrasted with the small en-suite bathroom. The room was clean and quiet,hanging space was fine but the furniture was dated & worn: the washbasin was cracked, there was no fridge and we were unable to open the window onto the tiny balcony. Perhaps the worst complaint was having to face a vast billboard picture of Simon Cowell smirking across the neighbouring building site! I found the swimming pool & sauna, the exercise rooms and the swimming pools very impressive and busy, while the restaurants looked inviting - though we deliberately ate out.The top floor restaurant was closed during our 3 night stay which came as a disappointment as the views from there are meant to be spectacular.

Got the room for $90 US. I would suggest using something else as their website seems to charge amounts for the conversion that aren't even close to actual rates for the Canadian dollar. The hotel likes to post their \"USUAL\" pricing on the back of your room door. Seems funny, seeing as how hotels really never have a set, standard price for anything. They like to claim that their usual rate is something between 5 and $600 for one person in their king suite. Delta Chelsea can always be found on Travelzoo, or some other savings site. The hotel was great and I didn't encounter any of the problems that I read in other reviews. The main lobby and reception area is beautiful. The man that received me during check in was very helpful and friendly. I liked that the main corridors to the rooms were actually clean, bright, and temperature was well controlled. Nothing I hate more than going to a \"nicer\" hotel and seeing the same old dark, dingy, stuffy corridors. They were none of those things at this hotel. The balcony was a very nice feature, I just wish the weather had been a little better during our visit. The rooms was very nice and clean. Only noticed one old stain (which may have been blood), but it was very faded. Hey, some stains are bound to be found on the floor of a hotel that probably hundreds of thousands of guests stay at. Bathroom was very clean. Especially when considering the tub surround is still tile and grout. No mould or anything along the grout lines. Elevators were very fast, which is good, considering there are 26 floors. The finess facility is amazing. I have been in some gyms that aren't as well furnished. The pool and hot tub were so clean and refreshing. They were each the perfect temperature (for me anyway), and the view from the pool/fitness area is amazing. You get a great city view and a clear shot of the CN Tower. We were able to walk all over the place or even quickly get to the subway system if need be.

First time guest at this location but many experiences with the hotel brand elsewhere in the GTA and beyond. Property shows 3-star rating consistent with what I have come to expect as a business traveller when staying at Delta or other major hotel chains. Upon arrival the exterior was quite impressive and lobby area bustling with activity. Check in was friendly and efficient. When I got to my room I was shocked by what awaited me behind the deceptive veneer of my preliminary experience. In a word, the place is a dive. Peeling wallpaper, a wall-mounted heating/cooling unit that doesn't work, a television that may have come from my grandparent's yard sale, yellow bathtub (that dripped so loudly I had to place a face cloth under the spigot to quiet it down), dingy tile, a shower that intermittently scalded and froze me, and furnishings that were reminiscent of my dormitory days. The room was small, closet small and amenities like wireless internet were not available - even if one was willng to pay. At one point I was actually tempted to go outside and confirm that a Delta brand logo was adorning this one-star accommodation. I was starving when I arrived, and although I usually order room service, the conditions created the 'perfect storm' for enticement to leave the room and dwell as long as possible in the deceptive veneer of the public areas. I chose the Marketplace for my meal as it offered a cafeteria style variety of options for me to build my dinner from. I cannot explain what compelled me to buy the sushi; it seems an obviously bad decision in retrospect. The label stated: \"My sushi is guaranteed fresh\", which for the record was true about the fish, it is too bad the guarantee did not extend to the avacado - which was rancid. Everything I put together from the salad bar was either tasteless and dry or sour and off; with the exception of the pickles which quickly became the highlight of my repast. To be fair I must include the fact that the bed was quite qood and provided a comfortable night's sleep. There was also a lovely terry robe provided in the room which seemed an out-of-place luxury in such shabby surroundings. At least it gave me something to cling to as I lived with the regret of not having booked my usual room at the Marriott. In my effort to avoid the inconvenience of walking a few blocks, I sacrificed all the style and comfort that I had come to take for granted. I know better now. My advice to you, for whatever it may be worth, is to stay away from the Delta Chelsea because the only thing it succeeds at is proving the old adage true: \"You can't judge a book by its cover\". The Management should focus more attention on what their guest rooms have to offer, because after all, customers are not paying to spend the night in your lobby.

I then upgraded the rooms to Signature Club rooms and signed up for the Delta Privilege program believing this would ensure that I received the best customer service possible. Unfortunately, I was completely WRONG in believing that! I called the hotel approximately an hour and a half prior to check in as the privilege program has a feature where you can call on your way and check in at that time to expedite the check in process. I believed I was checked in. Again, wrong. When I got there at 3:00pm (the hotels check in time!!) I was informed that the room I had requested was still occupied and the only room available was beside the elevator AND there was only one room available at that time. I asked Dawood, the front desk agent, where my friends were supposed to stay and he informed us that their room might be available by 7:00pm, but maybe not. After arguing for about 20 minutes about only one room being available and it being right next to the elevator I became tired and simply accepted that he was not going to do anything at all to help out in our situation. I agreed to take the room by the elevator and then wait until \"sometime later\" for the other room to become available. Stupid me for thinking this was the end of it. Dawood then informed me that the room by the elevator was now taken and there were no rooms available at all....at 3:30pm, half an hour past check in. At this point I became irate. I turned TO MY FRIEND and said \"this is (expletive - tripadvisor wont let me put *'s) ridiculous.\" Here's where this hotel really blew me out of the water....Dawood turned to his associate and said \"can you call security?\" Excuse me???? I am a young professional woman and by using profanity I deserved to have security called on me? What type of customer service is this??? I wouldve left right on the spot had I not already paid for the rooms. I asked him why he was acting like this and he actually said to me in an extremely rude tone, \"I'm talking to you like this because of the way you're talking!\" What happened to the customer being right?? Apparently they arent in this hotel! After this stay I'm so incredibly shocked at the complete lack of customer service I experienced...I will never even consider setting foot inside this hotel again. Other things to note: If you book through a third party site (priceline, travelocity, etc.) expect to be told at every chance that you have no rights as a guest and any \"extras\" offered to guests that booked through the delta site will NOT be offered to you. Do NOT spend the extra money for the signature club floor, the lounge is not worth it. The rooms are old and worn in. Everything is outdated, I dont quite understand where the \"renovated rooms and corridors\" are. The valet took AT LEAST 30 minutes to take our keys and to bring our car up in the morning - and then took the key to our car and put it in his pocket and left! If you want anything brought up to your room from guest services be prepared to wait about 3 hours and make at least 3 phone calls to them. There is no express check out, be prepared to wait in line for at least 20 minutes to check out. There are no guaranteed rooms, even if you are a privilege member. In all, this hotel is absolutely horrible. Take your money and stay somewhere else...this hotel is maybe a 3 star hotel with 1 star customer service. DO NOT STAY HERE!

What a mistake. This has to be the worst hotel I've ever had the misfortune to stay at. The entire experience from check-in to check-out was a disaster. Not only was the foyer an absolute zoo when we came to check-in but it resembled a beach resort during spring break. Loud, noisy teenagers everywhere, yelling and screaming through the foyer and total chaos all round. There was a lengthy queue in order to check-in - not simething I would expect in a four star hotel. But this was only the beginning. On opening the door to our room were met with what can only be described as third world. amenities. Our room (1130) hadn't seen any maintenance for decades, it was dirty with yellowing paint and chipped furniture/bathroom fittings, the bathroom was so small the entry door hit the shower rail over the bath, the grouting was stained and dirty, the filthy balcony looked like it was from some back block tenement building, the TV and telephone came over with Noah on the Ark, there was no fridge or minibar, and the lamp was broken. , This would be what I would expect to pay $50 a night for, if that. The only saving grace was that the bed linen was at least clean. To add insult to injury there were screaming. shrieking teenagers running through the halls at all hours of the night. A complaint to the main desk saw a security guard despatched to wander the corridors but as soon as he/she had left the noise resumed at higher decibels than before. There were youngsters banging on doors which were then opened and banged constantly while the occupants of the room screamed \"OMG\" for about the thousandth time. Overall the atmosphere was one of a youth hostel after a bachelor party. Again not what I would expect from a 4 star hotel.Essentially the hotel was so poor that I would never set foot in it again. It was in a dingy, depressed area and neither my husband nor I felt entirely safe wandering around the streets in the immediate vicinity. And as for the dining options. We made the mistake of dining in Bistro 33. We chose the option of the Asian buffet. Any passing resemblence to Asian cuisine was cursory. The few dishes which bore any resemblence to Asian were being kept warm in bain-maries and in general those items that should have been warm weren't, and those that should not have been, were. There was a lack of serving utensils meaning cross contamination between seafood, meats and cheeses, there were no basic condiments such as soy sauce, the stir-fry station was un-manned for almost the entire time we were there and there was only one poor chef whose responsibility was to staff the entire buffet area. Most items were not labelled so you had no idea what each food item was and where there were labels they were incorrect or the food was missing entirely. Disgusting! And the taste of those items that were on the buffet left a lot to be desired. I certainly expected a great deal more and as a minimum would have expected good food hygiene. It was not to be, We informed the check-out staff that this was the worst hotel experience we had ever had in our exstensive travelling history. While apologetic he really was unable to offer much in the way of excuses. On challenging the hotel management upon our return to New Zealand we were advised that parts of the hotel have undergone renovation and upgrading but unfortunately not the levels we were placed on. Hardly a comfort knowing that we paid the same as those experiencing the upgraded rooms. The staff we dealt with were nice enough but nothing could make up for a poorly run and managed hotel with major renovation requirements and a lack of understanding of what the travelling middle-age couple want from a hotel stay.I for one will never set foot in this hotel again. On our travels over six weeks throughout Canada, Alaska and the States we stayed at other Delta hotels and had nothing lthat even came close to this experience. This proves it was endemic to this hotel only. Wake up your ideas guys and look after those of your customers who pay the bulk of your income.

When I voiced my concerns to (then) General Manager Kathy Rutledge, I was assured that massive renovations were underway to transform tired and dated rooms, like the one I stayed in. Kathy asked me to contact her if I was going to be in Toronto again, assuring me that my next stay would be worlds different. Planning a get-together in Toronto with friends in June, I took the opportunity to write Kathy and I was answered by Jonathan Holliwell, Director of Rooms. Jonathan explained that, indeed, extensive renovations had taken place at the hotel. He went on to say that floors 4-9, the oldest rooms at the hotel, had been demolished starting in December of 2009. My wife and I were truly the last guests to stay in dingy 725, days before a $5 million dollar project saw floors 4-9 completely renovated. Upon returning to the Delta Chelsea, I found the same excellent and friendly customer service waiting at the front desk. Check-in was expedient and personable and, despite a hectic and busy lobby, the front desk clerk was not rushed and frazzled. She took the time to ask how my day was and whether I needed any information on area attractions. The accommodations this time around were significantly improved. While this property sees an incredible amount of traffic, the room was fresh, inviting and clean. The lackluster small CRT television (with no VOLUME CONTROL) that we had in our room back in 2009 had been replaced with a large LCD television. Gone as well was the tired and worn furniture and carpet, replaced instead with comfortable and well-maintained furnishings and decor. Despite an early (1AM) fire alarm that went on for over half an hour, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. This time around, my experience was much more in line with the Delta Chelsea's reputation as a first-rate hotel in downtown Toronto.

The location of the hotel was great however, which made it easy to spend time outside of our room. It is located close to Younge and Dundas square which was a big bonus. The one restaurant that was open when we were looking to eat was so pricey that we found it cheaper to order to our room, and the service from the Room Service staff was great. However, I paid the extra 25 dollars a night for the upgraded room and wish I wouldn't have. I read the reviews prior to going and saw the the rooms that had not been renovated yet, were not worth staying in. So after forking over an extra 50 dollars for this upgraded \"DELUXE\" room, we found a filthy washroom with another guest's used, hair covered bar of soap. After calling and complaining and asking to have it removed, we were assured that they would have housekeeping remove it. After my two day stay, the bar of soap was never removed. It is probably still in that shower. The bath was dirty, the paint in the bath was peeling, probably because of the lack of exhaust fan. The drain was broken and came right out of the shower, with a nice hair ball at the bottom of it. Also, we had some nice large holes in our sheets, if that's not a deluxe room, I'm not sure what is.... On the morning of checkout we had to leave very early, as I'm sure most people do when they have a flight, meeting, or event to attend, and when I complained about the unsatisfactory stay I had, I was offered breakfast on the house (beware, if you want to pay for breakfast at this hotel it will run you at least 20dollars a person, which is why we took a quick walk down the street and found many great, cheap, breakfast locations, just steps away) . If I am checking out of the hotel at 6 am because I have somewhere to be, how could I stay for this complimentary breakfast? I did not find this a suitable compensation for our poor stay, as we could not even enjoy it.

Unfortunately, they didn't have 2 double beds facing away from the construction, so I upgraded to a deluxe room just for $15 more. $90 a night here isn't so bad. The deluxe room though, looked like the size of a regular 2 double bed room, so I was actually wondering how small their regular rooms are. I got into the room and it actually wasn't completely cleaned, but it wasn't disgustingly messy, called the front desk and they had it fixed right away. Got chocolates and bottles of water out it so that was good. There are a lot of small souvenir shops around the hotel, so get your stuff there since the big tourist shops are usually more expensive. There's also this great bar next to the hotel that the concierge recommended called the \"Crystal Elephant\". Great food, drinks, and service.

You can definitely hear people who are rowdy in the hallways, but I couldn't hear the people in the rooms next to us, so, it's not completely bad. The gym is also really nice. I didn't go to the pool, but the gym and the pool are right next to each other, so that looked really nice too. This place doesn't offer free internet like other places, but that's fine if you're willing to go to the lobby which has free internet. I went to the 2nd floor like a lot of reviewers have suggested, and it's really nice to go there, since there are not a lot of people there.

When I finally did make it to the reception, I learned that the parking garage was full, and we were on our own to find parking in one of the busiest areas of downtown Toronto. The biggest disappointment was the quality of our room; with an awkward layout, peeling and dated wallpaper and a sliding door that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully close or latch to act as our bathroom. These are hardly the quality standards I expect from a first rate accommodation, or from the rates I paid for the night.

For those without children, the adult only fitness and pool area on the 27th floor is very relaxing. My only negative is the layout of the main lobby area. Masses of people come from every which way, in a very crowded, tight and poorly laid out reception/concierge/bell desk/elevator lobby/lounge area.

However, I stayed there primarily because it said it had facilities like child minders for kids, etc. The child minder at the Kid's Center was very nice and polite, but after having stayed around the world with several hotels who had child minding services: the child minders at the Delta Chelsea just did not have what it takes to entertain a child. And their hearts were not in it. In fact when I was there with my kid, a parent left a child in the room, he was like 7 or 8, but the minder just walked out with no one there. He was watching a movie, and she was out just for 5 mins, but still, that's not why parents leave them in their care. Anything can happen. Plus when they ask the kids if they want to do craft work, it is asked in a friendly manner but half-heartedly....so thus a fruitless attempt. Children pick the vibes. So this is unfortunate. Sure stay at Delta Chelsea for partying and if you are single or couples for sure. It has great adult services: super gym, super swimming pool, super business center. And it is great for bigger kids.

Recently as mentioned above I took a trip to Toronto and stayed at the Delta Chelsea...Which I have done every year for the last almost 10 years. I have to admit the concirege service at the Delta is second to none...Class act people and attitude...They will do anything to make your say more pleasant. This time my room was located at the end of a long hall on the 8th floor facing another building with absolutely no views...The room was damp and a little musty...Not a room I would classify as a \"Deluxe\" room. I don't normally have a lot of expectations when travelling...Ussually I don't get much time to sleep so any bed will do. And even though this stay with the Delta ws only for 3 days and two nights...It really left me with a bad feeling for this hotel. When I arrived there was food on the floor of the hallway...like chips and other finger foods....Not on a tray or anything actually on the carpet close to our door. I noticed cleaning staff in the hall and left for the day only to return around midnight with the food still there. The following morning 24hrs later the food was there and a foul smell in the hallway...Again I noticed cleaners going right by only this time rolling over it with there carts. I left for the day (too busy to stop and complain) and once again that evening I returned late to see food on the floor. When I checked out of the hotel on my third day the food was still there and this time I notified the check out clerk thaqt I was disappointed...I do not normally complain but this was not right....Food on the floor over 48hrs in a Luxury Hotel? She really did not seem to care. The following day I also wrote a letter to the Delta and informed them of this issue...Which after expliaining the details and photos that this was the worst experience with Delta and to be honest may be my last....Not sure I will return. I have not had anyone follow-up in over a week and was simply told we will follow up with our cleaning Manager.

Turns out the lot was full & I told the valet \"I think she already charged my card\" & he said she should have known it was full & that he would tell her. We parked at the lot right next door (This lot is not affilliated with the hotel) that was perfectly fine for the 1st 2 days. The 3rd day a very unfriendly woman was working there & refused to take our US $'s, although everyone else & the 2 previous cashiers did.

When we showed the pre-paid voucher the next morning to the front office staff and requested them to reverse the extra charges billed on breakfast, they expressed surprise that the pre-paid plan included a full American breakfast ( although it stated that clearly on the voucher). They made a point of taking time to make their corrections. Having checked in at midnight, it took us about an hour to locate someone to request for some In Room food. We had to call the front desk and ask them to have someone call us back. The room, admittedly a twin double bed standard one, had been booked well in advance (about 1 month ahead) with a specific request for the best possible views. But we were told when we checked in at midnight that our room had a view of the construction opposite. Naturally we had tp upgrade.

Within 5 minutes of being in our room we received a call from the front desk saying that they had mistakenly given us the wrong room and that we were being upgraded to a King room which was much bigger and renovated (our original room was renovated with a Queen bed but a small room). As we hadn't unpacked anything, this was no biggie and we appreciated the extra space in the new room. That evening, before we left for dinner, we received a knock at the door and there was a bell-hop with 6 helium pink and yellow baloons, a gift bag and a delicious slice of chocolate mousse cake. With it was a note saying happy birthday to my daughter and was signed by Kerwin at the Front Desk. My daughter was estatic to receive such special treatment and it was this thoughtfulness and attention to detail that totally won me over with this hotel. We ate lunch and breakfast at the Market Place restaurant and found the food to be exceptional. The restaurant was also very clean, the food very fresh, and most items were reasonably priced. Again, the employees working here were professional and friendly. The waterslide was open at 4pm and while my daughter really enjoyed the slide (pitch black inside the tube!), she was disappointed with the size of the pool as there wasnt alot of room to do anything when there are alot of kids and families in there. We also found it to be perhaps overly chlorinated as my daughters eyes were sore even the next day and our skin was VERY dry after being in the pool and our bathing suits were a bit stiff from the chlorine after they dried.

All the employees I came across were awesome with good attitudes and very polite. I thought to myself, who ever does the hiring is very good! I stayed on the 19th floor and the view was cool, there is also balcony's! The beds were the best because they have almost like duvet's and the pillows are amazing, definitely had a great sleeps that whole week. The sauna up on 27th floor which is for adults, I liked how they had cold fresh rags for you in a fridge for afterwards and a bathing suit rinser as well, very nice! It just goes to show that they think about their customers. I also liked how they had oranges for you by the pool. OH can't forget the awesome view on the 27th floor by the gym part, outside they have a big patio and you can see the CN Tower nicely, it was very nice to get pictures. The hotel itself is beautiful, it felt like I was home away from home :) Delta Chelsea is very welcoming, the moment I got there I knew it was going to be a good stay! I loved how they had fresh coffee made for you in the lobby and more. I personally think they have everything a hotel needs, I suggest to go see for yourself! P.s, the location is perfect.

We gladly accepted and were upgraded to a king size suite. This made us very happy as it was twice the size of the original room. They did their best to accomodate us and would happily go back. The indoor slide was great!!!! The hours were crap though. We had enough time to do a couple runs so that was nice as that was the main reason for booking at this hotel. Parking was expensive but if you ask nicely at the front desk they will add extra hours onto your parking pass. This was very nice as they had gave us a late check out for 1pm and we're allowed to stay in the same parking lot until 6. The late chek out was great as well. Overall we were very impressed that this hotel was happy to help us and accommodate us in any way possible. I would definately go back in a heart beat.", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Seneca, NY", "Title": "\u201cJuvenile Delinquents roaming, not too bad of a stay, not great.\u201d", "Author": "JustinH", "ReviewID": "UR96919824", "Content": "Bid a 3.5 star property on priceline for $68 and was assigned this room. Total charges with tax came to $89 for the night. We arrived at the hotel, to find that overnight parking was $31 per night including taxes. I have since learned that parking can be had cheaper in the parking lots next to the hotel, or across the street from the hotel. Check it out. Parking in the hotel had no benefits, we were on the 5th underground floor, and had to walk a mile to get to the room anyways. If you are going to pay for parking, you mine as well get Valet service ($5 additional I think).. At check-in, there were 2 people working the front desk. There were about 20-30 guests ahead of us in line. I had printed out a Delta Privilege card on the internet, so I was able to check in at the VIP desk with no wait. The woman running the VIP desk read me the riot act saying that since I booked with priceline, I wouldn't get any perks of the Privilege card (no free WIFI, no room upgrade), but she would \"do me a favor\" and let me check in with her. That was kind of rude, the woman went back to twiddling her thumbs while mobs of people waited in line after she checked us in. We were assigned a room with two double beds, not exactly romantic for my girlfriend and I. There was no choice in room (we understand this is how priceline works). We were also assigned a very dated room, there are newly remodeled rooms in this hotel and we did not get one of them. Our floor was filled with kids running around the hotel, hanging out in the hallways at all hours and throwing parties. The next morning there were tons of garbage and pizza boxes thrown in the hallways, it was weird to say the least. The plus side is that the room was very clean, yet very no frills for a supposed 3.5 star property. I would consider the accommodations to be no better than many 2.5 or 3 star properties I have stayed in before. Also those 2.5 or 3 star properties will include free breakfast, free parking, and free internet. The delta has none of this. The breakfast, parking, and internet were all overpriced. The huge plus side of the room is that it is walking distance to Younge street. There is a great British restaurant/pub right next to the restaurant on Younge street, we loved it. There are also several decent bars, and lots to see and do within walking distance. There is a very good place for breakfast called Eggspectations that is within walking distance of the room also. Way better than hotel food. The hotel had a very nice Adults only pool and spa. We used the pool, it was very clean. There was also a nice Sauna in the lockerrooms. We didn't use the spa because too many people were in it, but it looked fine. Apparently there is a water slide and a kids pool, but I had no interest in this.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london, uk", "Title": "\u201cOne of the chaviest hotels I've ever stayed in\u201d", "Author": "alexsw1", "ReviewID": "UR96641303", "Content": "For the location and the overall facilities and look of the place this hotel attracts a lot of chavs. My stay was very mixed.

Negatives - my 'non smoking' floor was the smokiest, smelliest non-smoking floor ever. The room was little better. Scratches on furniture, mirror hung crookedly, generally tired looking. See previous comments about chavs - they were roaming the halls and gym with tins of beer, several on my floor were having parties in their rooms late into the night. The next morning the hall way was littered in left over food that was dropped by room service on clearing trays and other debris. Nice. Tips - this hotel does not have enough parking for all the guests. There is a $6 overnight parking next door on Elm Street that I ended up using when the lot was full. Wifi free in reception. If you pay cash like me rather than leave a credit card, they will ask for $250 - pretty high and apparently to ensure there is no smoking in the allegedly non smoking rooms.

I booked our rooms online through Travelzoo and got a rate of $115/night, which I thought was a great deal.

I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. The Airport Shuttle drops you off right on the doorstep of the hotel. Upon check in I asked the front desk clerk if I could possibly get free room upgrades, and he was happy to oblige (and made sure we still had adjoining rooms). I also asked to have fans and mini fridges for both rooms and they were brought up within minutes of arriving. One of my girlfriends had called ahead and asked if they could decorate my room for my birthday, so I arrived to a large wall banner and balloons everywhere, plus a complimentary tray was sent up with wine, cheese, crackers, fruit, cookies and milk. The second day they sent up a dessert of chocolates and dipped fruits. Any time we asked any staff member anything they were super nice and helpful, and made you feel right at home. We had 3 and 4 people per room so we went through towels fairly quickly but it was never an issue to get more. The beds were amazingly comfortable, and despite having 4 occupants the room never felt too small. Loved that we could walk out onto a balcony. The adult-only pool and hot tub on the 27th floor are a great feature. Despite reading numerous complaints about the noise, I heard very little from the hallway, other rooms or outdoors. We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants but we did visit Monarchs Pub a couple of times and enjoyed the atmosphere there. Maybe the biggest selling point of this hotel to me is location. Minutes walk to our theatre, the Eaton Centre and the \"Times Square\" of Toronto, and with 4 entrances bordering different streets, it took no time to get anywhere, even in heels! The only complaint I have (and this is very minor) is that the rooms didn't have free internet. You could get WiFi in the lobby for free but if you wanted to use it in your room it cost $13.95 per day.

On arrival the hotel looks very nice, and the staff were accommodating when we realized that our rooms were further apart than hoped. Unfortunately, it started to go downhill from there. When we got into the one bed suite, it didn't appear to be very clean (to the point where the last guests old lettuce leaves were still on the fridge shelves). This wasn't a huge deal, and as it was we had to move rooms as the door handle was broken. The Family Fun room had stains on the carpet (I realize that accidents happen with kids, but there are ways of cleaning carpeting) and the play area was nothing like that shown on the website. Instead, it was a small childrens table, two stools and a chalkboard. It was a bit disappointing. On the first night we got room service, and although it took a little while to get to the room, it was very nice. As we were watching the news that night, we saw that the hotel workers were going to be going on strike - the next day. At 6am the next morning we woke to construction directly across the road. We weren't warned about this beforehand. At 7am the protesters kicked in, with drums and loudspeakers and whistles. This carried on until about 7- 8pm for the remaining 4 days that we were there. The staff protesting were housekeeping and in-room dining, so that meant that the rooms were not serviced, we were not able to get room service, and 2 of the restaurants were shut during that time. We realize that the situation was unusual, and cleaned our own rooms and ate elsewhere or cooked in-room for ourselves during that time. We did eventually receive notification from Management about the strike, at just before noon on the day it began due to a note slipped under our door. Upon checkout we discussed with the desk attendant the compensation they were offering due to the lack of services available during the strike. They indicated that none were being offered. My husband then bought up that there is a leaflet in each bathroom indicating that, if you are not happy with your stay, they would give you the first night free! She spoke to a manager and it was agreed that of the five nights, one would be free. We were very happy. Later in the day, another Manager called and indicated that the person we spoke to that morning did not have the authority to give us the discount. We mentioned that we were very unhappy, and while we realize it was unusual circumstances the fact of the matter is that we did not receive the services we expected, and compensation should be offered. The manager indicated that they did tell us about the strike - true, but AFTER we found out on the news the night before. We then mentioned the promise to give the first night free if unhappy - apparently this is null and void under strike circumstances (though that small detail wasn't mentioned on the leaflet). After some more back and forth with the Manager, she informed us that we always had the option to stay somewhere else. Next time we will. I do believe that if service was operational as usual, I would have been quite satisfied with the stay. The location was convenient, and kids enjoyed the Family Fun Centre and adjacent pool. And had we been able to order room service again, I have no doubt it would have been good. The rooms left a bit to be desired for a 4-star hotel, and were dated, not as clean as one would expect, and we weren't able to go out on the balconies thanks to the amount of bird poop.

The bads, The room was not very inspring and the room smelled like paint and glue (from recent renovation). The thermostat in our room was NOT always working (which made the paint/glue smell even worse) and the fan kept on spitting out white dust particles (probably from the renovation). The whole situation was extremely irritating to say the very least. The sound proof wasn't anything spectacular either. Anything goes on in the hallway pretty much goes right thru the door. The goods, Provided that our room was a suite with kitchen, Delta was nice enough to complete the suite with all imaginable kitchen necessities (eg, kitchenware [pots, pan], sliver ware and appliance [microwave, frig, coffee machine and stove]). It's very convenient for those who wanna cook (but who would when there are tons of restaurants right around them?!?!?). The mattress was very comfortable. Summing it up... The location is GREAT but I wouldn't stay here (crappy room by my standard) if I had not found a good rate (we paid $79 + TAX/night) thru online deal sites...", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot Happy and Still Here??????\u201d", "Author": "sunshine4evur2010", "ReviewID": "UR84530677", "Content": "I am here because of a pain clinic I am attending.

My mother-in-law called the hotel to book a seniors' rate, and she got one of the recently renovated rooms for $99/night. Our room was bundled with our airfare, and we got an old room (not renovated) that looked like it was straight out of 1990. What was good about this hotel: - excellent downtown Toronto location - our room/floor was quiet and relatively clean - the service at the front desk was good. the bellhops were exceptionally nice and efficient. What was not so good: - everything in our room was old and out-dated. worn-out, ugly furniture and decor, tired and stained carpets, halogen lamps that looked unsafe and rickety, an old Bell telephone whose speed dial buttons (to various areas of the hotel) didn't even work properly anymore and a TV with a clunky system and limited channels. - there were hardly any amenities in the room. we got 2 bottles of water, a coffee/tea maker and that's it. no bar fridge. no wi-fi at all in the room. internet access was available, but it was via ethernet an you had to pay something like $15 per day to use it. If you wanted free wi-fi, you had to go down to the lobby, and try to find a signal that worked. - the heating and cooling system is central and ancient. it was cold at night in Toronto, so we wanted to put on some heat. the thermostat was the old dial kind, and when the heating would not kick in, I called down to the front desk to ask why. I was informed that the hotel was \"not on heating yet\" -- meaning that the *whole hotel* was either on A/C or heating. The hotel was still using air conditioning, and if you wanted heat in your room, too bad. The closest you can get to heat is to shut off the A/C. - Even the windows in the room were old and seemed totally energy inefficient. Maybe that's why it was so cold in the room. The windows were also completely filthy -- so much so that someone had squeezed through the small window onto the balcony you couldn't use and had written in the dirt on the window. Wonder how long it's been like that? Ever hear of window washers, Delta Chelsea? - The hallways also had old peeling wallpaper, dark and stained carpets, and lots of scuffs and scrapes on the walls. The couches in the hotel lobby were also dirty and had stains on them. Some parts of the hotel just seemed a bit trashy and old. Although my mother-in-law really liked her room (it was basically brand new), she did not like the restaurant downstairs she ate at and said that even the sandwich she ordered was sub-par. I should mention too that on our first night there was a fire alarm at 2:30 am. It was not clear initially that it was a fire alarm -- the sound of it was confusing -- and we had to read the notes on the back of our door to know for sure it was a fire alarm. About 5 minutes after the alarm started, the management made announcements over the loudspeaker and told the majority of the guests to stay in their rooms.

I also really enjoy the restaurants - though this time we preferred to stay in. The housekeepers are wonderful. The valet parking is the most reasonable of the downtown hotels. Although $32 seems expensive at first, parking downtown is equally expensive. That rate allows you to get your car and valet it as many times as you need to within the 24hours the rate covers. If you have to stay for several days and cost is an issue, I recommend the kitchenette room. There is a 24hour grocery store right across from the hotel with reasonable prices. The room is really like a one bedroom apartment. However, I have stayed in several different rooms and have never been disappointed.

We have stayed in 2 star to 4 star hotels and have had fabulous experiences. We requested a 3+ star hotel this time around, yet we were immediately disappointed upon walking into our room. The room was very small, yet we have loved some of our smaller rooms, so that was not the biggest concern. The room had a musty smell to it upon entering - the balcony doors were smeared with finger prints and whatever else - the balcony was simply very dirty and really just 'gross'. Upon entering we first noticed the bedding and the extreme lumpiness of it - we discovered that the duvets have their fill in all of the wrong places and there were large two foot sections that did not even have any fill, so essentially we were sleeping with sheets upon us. The washrooms were tiny, and had basic amenities in them. I lost shower pressure during my first use - seeming almost like someone turned on a garden hose or the dishwasher while I was in mid-use. During my third shower, the tub began to fill up. We were so disappointed that there was no mini-fridge in our room and we needed to toss some of the food that we had brought along with us. On our drive home we passed several one to two star hotels, and it was interesting to note that even those advertised fridges being in their rooms! I purchased a pop one evening from their \"market\" restaurant - I took the pop from one of their coolers, so my assumption was that it would be cold, however it was lukewarm. We met some friends who live in a nearby city and we brought them up to our room briefly before heading out again, and the first thing that they noted was the water stains on the ceiling and the stains on the walls. The public washrooms on the first floor were very dirty, with paper overflowing in the garbages and the sinks were dirty and missing a soap dispenser. We were not offered the assistance of someone to help with our luggage, nor were we aware that there was a concierge available to us. All in all, we payed only $75.00 a night by purchasing this room through Priceline. Because of our wonderful experiences with this company, we are not in a position to blame Priceline, yet feel that the Delta Chelsea has sorely misrepresented themselves. This was not a 3+ star hotel - it felt more like a 2 star hotel however - it may have been grand at one time, however it simply feels like it has not been upgraded in several years.

The room service menu is varied and INCREDIBLY fair.. I was shocked when I saw that the price for a meal was pretty much the same or lower than what you would pay for the same fare of similar quality in a restaurant. The hotel was packed full when I was there...National wheelchair power hockey or something like that. Even still, there were few line ups at the restaurants...they must have had extra staff on. As there were many kids in the hotel for the hockey event the hotel had a full size \"robot\" in the lobby talking to people...was very funny to watch. Whoever was the voice of the robot by remote was chatting with people who came near it. Thought this was a nice touch and good plan by the hotel.

We chose to prepay our room with the cheaper advanced rate available on the hotel's website. We selected a regular Delta room. When we arrived, because of all the bad reviews i asked the front desk if we could at least get checked into a renovated room. Samantha (lady who served us at the front desk) did us one better and talked to her manager and upgraded us to a Deluxe King Room for free! it was great we had a king bed, chair and desk with a nice amount of space. We stayed on the 22 floor. I must say the room did smell like cigarettes when we got in but that's really no fault of the hotel when you have 1500+ rooms but it would have been nice if they could have eliminated the smell for whoever the guest would have been in that room. The smell was gone by the next day after we left the door open to the balcony. Not a bother for us since we got a free upgrade. The gym is really nice, there's plenty of machines to go around and even a pool (i'm not one for pool's but people were always in there every time i went to the gym). Downside is that the machines do not have individual tv's but most people use their ipods anyway. The purpose of our trip was to relax and sightsee and go to Caribana. We stayed for over a week and had a great time. The hotel is in the BEST location because it is centered around the main part of downtown so its just a 5 or 10 min walk depending on how far you want to go but there's street shopping, the mall (Eaton Centre) and movie theatre all within 5 mins from the hotel. There's a great tatoo place as well (Ultimate Tattoo). There are always taxis available at the hotel which was a great thing (even when we weren't at the hotel there was always a taxi around at any point to hop into to go to the next place). Ladies there are PLENTY of mani/pedi places, even one right outside the hotel of the Younge Street exit which i went to and enjoyed. During Caribana they had a pizza station in the lobby $5 (not bad at 4 or 5am) which came in handy after late nights of partying. There's enough Bar's to have a drink and the market place is available all day for food if you don't feel like going outside. Yes the elevator wait did get crazy at times because of the amount of people there but that's really not a problem once you get used to it. The conceirge is helpful but there's also a touch screen monitor that allows you to search for things like shopping, dining, music etc which was great when the conceirge was busy.

Though we never chose to eat at the hotel, we certainly had many options if we had wanted to. At one point the concierge told us to use a subway station that was partially closed because of construction. That sent us out of our way quite a bit, since we had to walk to another station. I also really wish someone would have told us there was free wifi.

First off, parking is really hectic at the hotel. It is really narrow and difficult to maneuver, so I would watch out if you have a large vehicle. We traveled with a station wagon and found it difficult to navigate the twist and turns. As a privileged member, you are eligible for a speedy check in. I was REALLY impressed by the organization of the front desk itself (I work as a front desk agent at a hotel). Just to demonstrate why Delta Privilege is helpful, the line up for non-members was really, really long. However, you bypass that as a Privilege member. The staff members are multilingual, so you will not have any problems if you speak a different language or dialect. We had an upgraded room on the crown floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was GREAT because it includes continental breakfast in the morning and the added perk of access to the Club Room. The service at breakfast was friendly and inviting for morning travelers. Our room was newly renovated and furnished, but we did have a few problems. The internet is not wireless except in the lobby. I have a macbook so for some reason the DSL line was not recognizing my computer, which was kind of problematic. However, for the bigger issue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the noise level is really bad. The walls are paper thin (we had the embarrassing issue of hearing a couple fornicating next door!). The next evening we heard them having a party at 2:00am. When we called to report the noise, the issue wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resolved very promptly. In fact, we had to call twice as the issue only got worse. So yes, the noise is bad, but it really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ruin our stay. It was just more embarrassing if anything. I \"might\" stay here again (hotwire will decide that). While it does have its charm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the breakfast room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we kind of just got lucky with our upgrade. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I would have recommended this location had I stayed in a standard room because even with the privilege points, the rooms are still small.

Maybe they stick Priceline people in the unrenovated rooms when they are otherwise booked up, but we got a recently renovated room.

We booked a deluxe package through the Delta Chelsea. The first thing is that the room was fine but certainly not deluxe (not large, no separation of sleeping areas, crt TV, no fridge or microwave, for examples). On top of this, EVERYTHING costs money. Such deals as \"kids eat free\" are slippery things and I still cannot figure out how the exact same breakfast was discounted one morning ($22) and cost over $40 the next. Beware the traps: a plate of watermelon innocently sitting out to be put on one's tray will cost $4.50, and if you take the wrong juice it may void your package. These depressing cons aside, things were okay ... except where they were not. We had the impression that this hotel was \"family friendly\" because of its pool and recreation facilities. The latter are quite run down and both are under too much pressure. There are so many people in the pool that they have to add so much chlorine that if a milliliter gets in your eyes they will be bloodshot. There must have been 20 people of all ages in the hot (actually merely warm) tub, which made it feel quite disgusting. I assume they have coliform counts under control, but it was not a nice experience. This weekend followed upon another in Ottawa, where we had met up with friends staying at the Delta, and many of the same impressions apply. Our first night was marked by a stag party apparently happening in rooms on both sides of us and across the hall. They woke the entire family with obscenities and noise that went on for hours after midnight. Having your 4 year old ask you what a [--] sucker is at 3AM after phoning in multiple complaints and learning that many others had been made was a low point in my parenting life. Staff were timid and ineffectual in dealing with the problem. They also displayed absolute ineptitude (tho pleasant manners) in actually giving us our AGO passes. All around, this is a hotel we will not revisit. The reasons we went in the first place -- the kid friendly stuff and the AGO package were both disappointments. Our room was okay, except the hotel staff did not exercise control over a major disturbance. We had to move to a floor that was under construction and smelled like cigarette smoke. We also di dnot like being nickeled and dimed: 14$ for a movie, cheesey policy on kids meals, expensive parking, internet another 14$ or something. This is low class stuff.

It was so noisy. The work started really early in the morning and did wake me up. Check that you can have a room away from the building work if you book.

They know me by name, they're fun to talk to, and they always do their best to accommodate me. I am often put in a position where my stay has to be extended day-by-day due to my uncertain, sometimes erratic work obligations plus I have a lot of friends in the city and am easily-swayed to stay a bit longer for non-work related fun. The staff is so patient with me; despite the fact that I know I must be a pain in their necks at times. The location is fantastic - my favourite neighbourhood in Toronto - In-fact I used to live a block-away. Lively Yonge Street with the diversity of people, shops, restaurants, and food. The Toronto Eaton Centre (huge mall) is a quick walk away. A car is not necessary and their is life buzzing around the streets 24-7. The Entertainment, business, and film districts are all very close-by. The hotel lobby is huge; always bustling with people. It has a nice, cozy type of feel with plenty of seating. In-terms of dining - I haven't actually dined in the more upscale of the two restaurants but have ordered room service from them numerous times and I am always pleased. Perhaps a few items are a tad over-priced - but room service always is pricey. The more family-style restaurant is great. Huge selection, great salad bar, fresh pizza, made-to order food from the grill. It's cafeteria style, laid-back, and you can request take out if you prefer the serenity of your room. I have been in the pub and received great service from one of the bartenders (although it was a while back and I forget his name). Seeing as it is a huge hotel, there are three blocks of elevators that are separated by colour. The \"blue\" elevators tend to be the busiest and there is sometimes a bit of a wait - but that's nothing that would upset me. The hallways are a bit dated but clean. Depending on where your room is located, it can be a bit of a trek from the elevator. In terms of the rooms - I have been in a wide-range of the hotel's rooms. I will agree that the unrenovated guest rooms are sub-par with very dated furnishings, silly little tvs and they show wear and tear. It has however been noted several times here (and to me personally by the front desk staff), that these older rooms are under-going renovation. The upgraded rooms are very nice, with flatscreen tvs and modern furnishings. Sometimes I will get a room with small imperfections here and there - the odd scuff on the bathroom tiles or a too-loud fan in the bathroom, but never anything that would negatively affect my enjoyment. I really dislike the alarm clocks in the upgraded rooms though. Maid service is good - the cleaning staff is always friendly and accommodating. My only complaint is that despite always requesting a 6pm check-out, there have been a few occasions where the maid has walked in before my scheduled check-out time. Again - very minor complaint and infrequent considering how many times I have stayed at this hotel. The internet is free of charge for Delta Privilege Members, ( a great rewards program for frequent visitors. The perks I receive thanks to being a member have earned them my loyalty). They have a nice fitness centre and adult pool. For those with families - I hear they have great kids-programs. There's a cute little reception desk just for kids; nice touch. Simply-put - the Delta Chelsea is in a fantastic location, has a wonderful roster of employees, nice rooms, good food, good value, and my thumbs-up :)", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dnbma", "Title": "\u201cConstruction noise & poorly appointed room\u201d", "Author": "dnbma", "ReviewID": "UR57706693", "Content": "The construction across the street starts around 7am.

We used Hotwire and got nearly $30 less per night than their advertised AAA special price, so I'm guessing they stuck us in one of the older rooms, as it was a bit run-down. The floors had scuffs and stains, and the moulding and furniture had chips in it. Our room had a small balcony, but it was grimy looking and the railings were rusty. At one point we called the front desk to ask if they would send up a corkscrew. We waited nearly 45 minutes, and finally called again, after which they came up with it in 5 minutes. (The staff was always friendly though) We visited the adult pool area which was nice and not too crowded, although we went at an off time. The main appeal of this hotel is the location. It would be good for families traveling on a budget, and people who plan on a lot of sightseeing and not much time spent in the room.

I confirmed with them that we had reserved by phone a deluxe room, high up with a balcony. Again, \"no problem\". We were standing there with our son with all of our \"things\"...should be obvious...but no, we got to our room and it was the small delta room. I went downstairs to find out what had happened.

She said they down graded us to a delta room (at the $99 rate) because there were no deluxe rooms cleaned/ready. She said if we hadn't had dinner yet, we could bring our things down and go for dinner and whe would get one ready. When we returned there was still not one available, so she talked with her manager, who never came out themselves to help with accomodations or apologize for the other staff. We did end up in a deluxe room on the 7th floor but felt very disppointed with the service and how it was handled. The other disappointment was the pool. We were so looking forward to it, since it bosted being so great and had a slide but we found it very small and dirty. Of course, there was a lot of chlorine to accomodate but, we felt it was cloudy and dirty looking! And my son did end up with a cold the day we returned home.

One thing I found though, is that there are the better parts of the hotel and the older parts. I booked my room thru Priceline, and seemed to get a discount rooms too. It was still clean and the room was up to date but not like I thought it would be. Good for business as it had a big desk, but outlets in this room were a rarity. The service was excellent from staff and as it is a full service hotel, they have concierge to help with directions, and a bell hop to store my luggage upon checkout as I was going to a meeting the morning of checkout and did not want to bring it with me. They also have great lounge areas and a variety of restaurants including a garden bistro, upscale restaurant, more family style restaurant, a pub and a bar. The garden restaurant was great for breakfast - highly recommend it and the prices for lunch were good too. I could see parking may be a challenge there like anywhere in downtown Toronto, so a took a cab from the airport to the hotel and used the subways to get around - works well although crowded in the rush hours - College station is right there. After I found out they have a GO Transit Bus (highway style) make regular runs from the airport to downtown for about $20 - will try that next time and stops right at the front door of the hotel. If only someone could get moving and get a direct highspeed link from the airport, it would make my life and millions of others alot better. My only one complaint was that I was put in a room that was opposite a condo under construction across the street and there was lots of noise during the day, but was confined from 8am to 6pm. No construction noise at night. But if you are trying to prepare for a meeting during the day, ask upon booking for a room away from the condo project across the street. Also the balcony was discusting. No I don't use the balcony, although if someone smoked, I guess it would be good to have, but it was completely covered in bird poop and the railing was really rust covered. I don't know what they could do about that unless screens were put up though.

I booked the room through Priceline so the price was great - almost 50% of the hotel website price. The room was a double on the 16th floor facing north. The room was average size and not bad for an older hotel in a city. The room was clean. Some stains on the bathroom tile appeared to be dirt but they were definitely permanent. The towels were nice, beds were comfortable with ok linens, plenty of hot water. The TV was very small but I wasn't there to watch TV so whatever. The location was excellent and I was able to walk everywhere I needed to go. There were only a few small problems, and not necessarily the fault of the hotel but I think they are worth mentioning. First of all, the clearance for the hotel self-park garage was 5'6\" clearance so I was unable to park my taller vehicle. However, the front desk was very helpful & valet parked the car for the self-park rate. The hotel might want to consider mentioning this on the website as a lot of people drive larger vehicles these days. The second problem was with internet access. My computer automatically looks for wi-fi networks. In the room, I was taken to a login site that looks like it's for the hotel but really it's not. The name of the network was Hotel Guest Access. It asks for your credit card info but it's not legit. Do not enter your information!! I did, and it's a scam!! Had to cancel my credit card while traveling. Total pain. It seems like someone in near by building is phishing. They should really provide more clear directions for how to get on the internet from your room. The directions in the book were vague. All you have to do is plug in the modem to your computer and they automatically charge it to your room. They do have free wi-fi in the lobby. Also, if you use more than one computer in the room, they bill you $13.95 per day per computer which is BS. We couldn't both work at the same time because of no wifi in room. I complained and they waived the fee for the second computer. The third issue, and not any fault of the hotel, is very noisy construction taking place directly across from the north side of the hotel. If you want to sleep past 7am without hearing banging & booming you will be better off requesting a room NOT facing north. It looks like they are putting up a tall building so it could be ongoing for quite some time. Overall, the Delta Chelsea was a good hotel for my purposes. The staff was very helpful, friendly & responsive. I heard the desk staff saying that most of the rooms have been renovated recently.

The hotel is huge, with four separate entrances into the lobby from Gerrard, Bay, Yonge and Elm Sts. Check-in and check -out were efficient on both occasions, though occasionally had to queue for a while at reception on other occasions. The rooms on both occasions were spacious and comfortable. All rooms have balconies. Housekeeping has generally been OK, although there was an overflowing ashtray left on the balcony on the first occasion, and disgusting yellow stains on the toilet flush handle on my second stay. This wiped off easily enough, and should have been spotted by housekeeping. The decor is worn around the edges in both the rooms and the hallways. I found the kingsize beds very comfortable but might be rather firm for some. There is free wi-fi in the lobby and bars on the ground floor; a $30 daily charge applies to have access in the room. The hotel seems very family friendly. Lots of excitable kids in the lobby around Father Christmas. The amenities on the 26th floor are adult only (pool and gym). The Market Garden restaurant was fine for a tired solo traveller. Good local options include the Queen and Beaver pub on Elm St, Pickle Barrel on Yonge St, and plenty of other reasonable places within easy walking distance. Had a couple of breakfasts at Eggsmart on the corner of Elm and Bay. All in all, a comfortable stay on both occasions. This is a very large hotel, and service is somewhat impersonal.

I joined their Privilege plan here about 3 years ago. It was and is free and it does have some nice perks in the program but forget it if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get your room on those floors booked if they are full. Go find another hotel. PERIOD I asked to check in on Nov 23 on Monday and I was checking out on Friday. (4 days) I was told at the time I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get my Signature room because they were full so I asked to be upgraded to a Suite. They said no problem and that was $218/night instead of my usual $179/night. I said well that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine just move me in to the club rooms the day after. I got there no problem on Monday and got a key for a Suite that uses the green elevators (big warning - you want to be in the blue elevator wing) I got up there and opened the door to my suite. I actually took about 55 photos to show people but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I can load them up here. It was just sad, the entire room was a hole. I have pictures of the gross rusted and moldy air vents that feed the room, the air system didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run at all, the peeling and creased wallpaper and the naps and hacks in the rug, the chipped and hacked furniture and walls, and then spitballs I found on the framed print in the bedroom just before I was going to go to bed. I just hung a towel over the print and left a note for housekeeping. It has a kitchen which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for but it was there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rudimentary fridge and stove but again over all I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even live in a house like that mush less a Suite I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m paying a premium for. It was just disappointing over all so I went back downstairs and asked them to find me another room or better yet my usual club room, they said they will but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be another night. I said OK move me on Tuesday night but right now find me a better suite then, or I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to another hotel. So I got moved to a two room (connecting door) set of rooms off the blue elevators and in 1980 and 1982. It was a better room(s) one regular suite with a king and much nicer look and feel over all and a connected hospitality suite next door. I never did get moved in to the club room I asked for. OK, fine I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m here, one morning I went up to get my morning coffee in the lounge upstairs. Again I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in there 10+ times, I walk in and show the guy my room key and he asks what room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in I tell him and he says you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come in. I was a bit shocked and asked why, he said well you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not staying in one of the Signature rooms and said yes, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been waiting to get moved in to one of them. His answer was well I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come in. I then explained to him how I have my Platinum Privilege membership and why I continue to come to the Delta to stay there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a loyalty program. I asked if the manager was aware of this and he then relented and said I could come in, I then declined and went to my work site and bought coffee. I guess if you have the membership it does not matter and your willingness to continue to use the Delta Hotel chain goes out the window if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in a Signature room and instead pay MORE for a suite. Now that makes sense. Then of course upon check out I got my bill and of course it was $160 more because I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get my Signature room that I asked for from the start so I paid more for the suites but then I found out that I still have to pay for my internet access again for an additional $60 dollars and its again because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in that $179/night room but instead paid $218.00/night \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. I must admit I am confused and Yoko at the desk didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to care. She did give me the name of the hotels manager when I asked so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something I guess. So I paid up and checked out, I am on an expense account but its just point of Delta creating a customer rewards program that only applies when they like it. Should I have to pay an additional $220.00 dollars even though I am a member of their program because they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give me the room I want and then I upgrade my room at my cost and the rest of the program does not apply to me as well. I must admit I am confused. So can I suggest the Delta \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. No probably not anymore and there is a Marriot 2 blocks away.

We checked in late at night (around 10:30-11:00) and the front-desk staff was welcoming and very friendly. The gentleman offered us advice on area attractions and shopping and was very outgoing. We checked in expediently and made our way up to our room on the 7th floor (725). The room itself left a lot to be desired. While the hotel is completely non-smoking now, our room had a distinct musky smell to it, like an old dried up air freshener. The single queen bed was hard enough to double as an ironing board and the stained carpet told the tale of many, many, many guests who had enjoyed the room before us. When I closed my eyes, I thought I could actually hear them in the room still.. and then I realized it was just people walking in the hallway outside the very poorly sound-insulated room. We turned on the small CRT television, that was perched on a pitiful little cart, to find that the default volume was AT ABSOLUTE FULL BLAST WHEN YOU TURNED IT ON. I have never stayed in a hotel before that felt so 'used'. While the room was not a complete dump, it was dingy and felt very 'tired'. As previously mentioned, the walls were paper thin and you could distinctly hear noises from adjoining rooms and clear conversations in the hallway. I'm sure they, in turn, loved it when we TURNED ON THE TELEVISION IN THE MORNING. I don't know what I'm more disappointed in.. the fact that I actually held the Delta Chelsea itself in high-esteem before staying here, or simply how poor our accommodations were.

Beware when booking on priceline, as the rooms you get are the crappy extremely outdated musty rooms. The furniture was old and falling apart, the carpet stained and disgusting. The bathroom was old and tiles were broken. The room smelled like a cheap motel. Given that we were not impressed, we went to the front desk to ask for an upgrade. We had to pay $40.00 for a renovated room and told by front desk that it would have a flat panel television, duvet covers (vs the nasty old flowery bedsheets in the first room we checked into) and a renovated washroom. Once we arrived at the room we were disappointed to see that the flat panel tv was not at all that - it was one of those old boxed tvs. NOT really a big deal given that we would spend limited time in a room but since we paid for an upgrade we expected the room to be as he promised. At least this room was cleaner and the bathroom more acceptable. Normally I would not be so picky, but I didn't think the hotel was worth what we paid. Rooms at the Hilton Garden Inn were going for 140 including fees for a room w/ a jacuzzi. Now that's good value for what you pay! I would not recommend booking here, unless if you really do not care about your accomodations and are looking for something cheap. It's not fair to rate this hotel as a 3.5 star, when half the rooms are dingy and old, and the other half renovated. Make sure you know what you will get stuck with.

I love how friend everyone is, so clean, so green, and walkable anywhere! The best part is that the Delta Chelsea was right in the middle of it all between Bloor in the North, Front St. in the South, University Ave in the West and Yonge St. in the East. The Delta Chelsea is a huge hotel with a large lobby with a friend staff and readable signs to find out the street you can exit or enter from. The Airport Express stops right infront of the hotel, which takes travelers from YYZ Pearson to hotels in downtown Toronto. The best airport transportation service that provides free WiFi and electrical outlet! It also gives you a preview of the city when dropping other passengers off at other hotels in Toronto. Rooms at the Delta Chelsea is so comfortable, especially the beds. The views in either direction are wonderful. We had our room onthe 20th floor facing Yonge St. so you can see the people walking up and down Younge, Eaton Center, the Bay at Atrium, and Ryerson University. The bathroom was big, clean, and provides complimentary toiletries. There is Internet access in the room, but recommend to go to the lobby and use their free WiFi. There are many sitting areas in the lobby and everyone is down there to use the WiFi. There are 4 eateries in the lobby, but more choices just outside on Yonge St. and at Eaton Center. We ate the Market Place in the lobby and the food is edible, but could have found a cheaper place to eat outside of the hotel. The breakfast buffet at Bistro 33 was acceptable, but the price was high. Go to a Tim Horton's for cheaper breakfast or enjoy one at the Eaton Center at Eggceptional. At night I would reccommend to try WOO at Dundas Square for a high end Asian Fusion buffet. We did order room service and the food was acceptable, but had better room service at other hotels. The Delta Chelsea is located near the two major subway lines in Toronto. College St. Station is located nearest to the hotel and the other one is Dundas Square on the Yonge Line. Queen's Park station is the closes one on the University Line. However, walking is a good option for visitors since the city takes pride on being \"green\" with many residence riding bikes and using public transportation. Taxis can be used, but scarecely used them. We were able to walk to the ROM, Bloor, Yorkville, The Annex, Chinatown, Kensington, and Eaton Center. I highly recommend the Delta Chelsea for a great central location when visiting Toronto. The staff are nice and very kid friendly. There are two pools, one on th2e 27th floor with a lounge and on the second floor with the big waterslide. However, being so center in the city all of the attactions are walkable, except the ones near Front St. But it doesn't matter on the distance to the CN Tower or Harbourfront since subways stations are nearby.

Not sure why they use this service anyway -- they should be providing free WiFi like everyone else. They certainly have the money to do so. Otherwise, nice stay, nice accommodations, June Jacobs line in the bathroom was a nice plus (actual quality soap, shampoo, conditioner).

Used the Dowtown Express Bus from airport. This service is very efficient and will help you to get your bearings as it drops off at other hotels. The hotel isn't pretty but is ok inside. I would like to see more sofas or lounge areas in the lobby area. You will see a few adult shops and cinemas on Yonge St. Don't be put off by these as they keep themselves to themselves. I would advise to stick to main streets and keep to busy areas. Generally area feels safe but it pays to be aware of your surroundings and be sensible. Upon arrival my check in was with no waiting and was processed very quickly. I was offered an upgrade but chose not to pay the extra 30 dollars per night. My room 1138 was over looking Gerrard St. I would say it was one of the older rooms and was in need of updating but was clean and had everything that you could need. Very good storage and shower was powerful. I was irritated by a constant drone of some generator noise outside. This went all day and night and if you tuned into it would drive you a bit potty. I wasn't in the room too much so wasn't so bad. Is really near the elevators and ice machine room. The staff were very friendly and passed a conversation or two which was nice. Ate mainly in the market garden restaurant. I felt food was expensive and you would get more choice elsewhere and probably better value. However, I suppose you pay for the convenience. If you try Atrium on Bay shopping mall, in the basement I found a great mini supermarket that sold hot soups, salad bars, fresh fruit and veg etc and at good prices. This mall had a good food court too. As my main purpose was to indulge in retail therapy, this hotel is ideally situated for the Eaton Centre and for the subway (Dundas) which can take you all over the city but again if shopping is your thing head up to Yorkdale Mall.

I looked straight into the windows of other high-rises so it was not that. I had booked a king, but the upgrade was 2 double beds for me alone. No seating area. Nothing in the room had been upgraded in 20 years, the TV was the old clunky box style, the one chair was old and dated from the 70's. While the room was acceptable it was nothing like any other Delta I have stayed at before - much inferior. Front Desk efficient but impersonal, Bar Staff: ditto, Bell Desk: ditto. 27th Floor Pool area was OK but lounge up there locked tight - even to be able to sit and read. Actually no place to sit and read or a quiet area. The lounge had blaring music (live) when I checked in at the Privilege Desk (right outside the door to the lounge) and the music and noise permeates through the lobby and is ridiculously loud.

There are usually lines for check-in and bell services, and heaven help you if you want to check in at the same time that several tour groups arrive. There is an 11:00am checkout rule that is rigidly enforced, perhaps understandable in such a large hotel. The hotel is very popular with families and tour groups, and isn't a good choice if you're not in one of those categories. Customers will enjoy the two indoor pools (one with water slide), and there is a cafeteria-style restaurant that's ideal for families. The location is superb. Although the hotel technically doesn't have a frontage on Yonge Street (Toronto's main street), it's only about 50 feet away. Judging from the reviews, some rooms have been redecorated and others have not, and differing price levels reflect this. I paid $204 (August 2009) and had a nicely redecorated room with a magnificent view, and a sliding glass door that opened onto a tiny balcony (not true of all rooms). Nonetheless, the age of the hotel (1975) is apparent, especially in places like bathtub grouting where a building's age is hard to hide. There are a number of nickel-and-diming practices that I find very irritating. I had an \"environmental charge\" of $1.03 on my bill -- what the heck is that? This hotel, like others in Toronto, will charge a \"destination marketing fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (DMF) of 3%. If you ask, they'll tell you it's a tax, but it isn't -- the money goes to a tourism marketing association, not to any government agency. To add insult to injury, they charge sales tax on that fee. These are small amounts, but still they are an irritant. Also, I had been quoted a rate lower than the $204 I was charged, but it was a last-minute reservation made by phone, and when I checked in, I had no documentation to prove the rate the reservationist quoted me. If you're headed to the airport, bellstaff will try to put you in a non-metered taxi. As one employee said to me on a previous visit to this hotel, \"Let me put you in a [non-metered] taxi where I trust the driver,\" and then later I had a dispute over the fare with the driver. If you're going to the airport, insist on a metered taxi, and then negotiate an off-the-meter fare with the driver before getting in the taxi. I know this sounds third-worldish and complicated, but that's how it works in this city. (In mid-2009, a negotiated flat rate to the airport of $55 would be fair, and indeed on the generous side -- no extra tip.)

I could not judge the Delta Chelsea in this manner because there were no problems during my stay, not even a little one! A refreshing change to say the least. I booked this hotel using Hotwire. Sometimes Hotwire guests are treated as second class citizens at some hotels, but I certainly wasn't. At check-in, I received a free room upgrade as a Delta Privilege Member (membership is free). I got a very nice room with two double beds which was more than enough as I was travelling alone. What impressed me was all the fine amenities of this hotel -- a great family pool with a four storey waterslide, children's area and program, teen area, and a separate adults-only pool/hot tub and extensive fitness area that would rival some gyms. The meeting rooms looked great and the hotel itself was clean and well maintained throughout. There is free wireless in the lobby and business centre, but internet is a bit costly at $10/half hour. There is an internet cafe very nearby with presumably lower prices. The staff are second to none and I was given a friendly greeting by pretty well every staff member I passed from housekeeping, maintenance, front desk, and management. What was particularly helpful to me is the business centre which I used with a colleague six to eight hours a day during my four day stay. It has meeting tables and comfortable chairs, someone there to help you at all times, free coffee/tea/hot chocolate, phone service, internet service ($10/half hour) and free wireless. That alone made this hotel well worth it. The location of the hotel is excellent in the heart of downtown Toronto on Yonge Street, about a two minute walk from the Eaton Centre and the subway within a few minute walk. Other than The Market in the hotel, the hotel restaurants were pricey and likely out of many people's price ranges, particularly those travelling with family. However, there are many nearby restaurants and I would particularly recommend the many good restaurants (don't miss the second floor ones) in College Park directly across from the Gerrard Street Entrance. There is a particularly good pasta place there that cooks the meals in front of you as you wait.

We did the \"Family Fun\" package which included parking (a $26 value), plus a $25/day food voucher for the hotel restaurants. It also included 2 hours of supervised childcare at Camp Chelsea. We arrived very early (noon) and much to my surprise, were allowed to check in right away. This was a nice surprise - the kids got to go for a swim and were happy as clams. We were also given an upgraded room on the Bay Street side (much quieter than the rooms facing Yonge Street, as I have learned from past experiences). The room was small, but clean and comfortable. The location is fantastic - we left the car in the garage during our entire stay and just walked everywhere or took public transit. The staff at the Delta were so pleasant and accommodating - they gave excellent directions to any attraction we wanted to see, and were able to give us good information about the attractions as well. The pool was showing its age, but the water slide was fantastic and once my 6 year old got over her initial fear, we couldn't get her off it. Children must be at least 44\" tall and pass a swim test (2 lengths of the pool with no assistance) in order to use the slide. The slide is huge - 4 stories tall, and it actually passes outside the building for part of the ride. Very cool. The children's activity room, located next to the pool, was incredible. There were 3 different video game consoles (including a Wii) with tons of games, a well-stocked craft area, ride on toys, a small climbing structure, lego, etc. Our children adored it, and wanted to spend all their time there. There were also family activities every evening, including Bingo, family Fear Factor etc. as well as a nightly movie with free popcorn. The hotel really caters to families, and does it well. We only ate at the Market Garden, which was not as good as I remembered. The food was quite expensive, and there are much better options just a stone's throw from the hotel. Kids 6 and under do eat for free (with the purchase of an adult meal costing at least $10) so that helps a bit. I found the restaurant a bit dirty and really crowded with bus tours. All in all, we had an excellent time and would definitely recommend this hotel. In terms of pricing, I think you are better booking the room on its own, and then adding parking.

This is my fourth year going and second year staying the weekend. Last year we also stayed at the Delta Chelsea. We booked plenty early and were able to book two Premier rooms for $199 each plus tax, then switch them down to $149 per room before tax when the hotel put them on sale. An excellent deal seeing as we paid the $199 the previous year and found it not an unreasonable price. This year I signed up for Delta Privilege which certainly came in handy! Its free to sign up and I encourage that you do if you travel often to Delta hotels. The staff at the Delta Privilege desk were VERY helpful and were the best of the best at the hotel. Martina in particular was a pleasure to have taking care of us, she was very friendly and went out of her way to ensure we were happy right through our stay. We were happy to find at check in that our request for connecting rooms had been honored and that we were upgraded to Deluxe rooms. These rooms are slightly larger and with much nicer furnishings than the Premier rooms. The iPod connectable clock was very handy for getting some music going! The free bottles of water also helped for what was a rather warm weekend. As always the beds were some of the best that we've had in our travels and provided a great nights sleep. The balcony was a very nice touch and is rare in Toronto. Overall no complaints at all about the rooms. We will always go for the Deluxe room from now on! A side note about rooms: the Delta rooms are certainly considered a 3 star at best, but Premier, Deluxe and Signature rooms are certainly of a 4 star standard. Remember when booking a basic Delta room that you get what you pay for! You have no right to complain if you aren't willing to pay the $20 for an updated room. Trust me: well worth it. You won't find me in a Delta room again. The other amenities at the hotel are great for leisure travelers. One of our favourite things is the adults only pool on the top floor. Its great to have the kids and families down in a separate pool and make it a much more exclusive feeling. The staff in the Deck 27 pool were great! Workout area is well equipped and wasn't crowded. The sun deck was a great touch that we had missed last time. Tanning up there felt like your own personal penthouse! Room service was pricey but that was expected. Downstairs the breakfast at The Marketplace was reasonable for the convenience of having it on-site. I would prefer if wi-fi was included, and not a $12 charge. Location was fabulous! A block from the Eaton Centre and minutes from the Church Wellesley Village. It doesn't get much better!

The hotel room, was modern, clean and spaceous for a 4 night getaway! Much bigger than a usual city break hotel room (i.e New York). We had breakfast every morning in the Garden Market buffet restaurant, which was resonibly priced and you only pay for what you have, which counts! The food was typical Canadian/American fast food nature, but thats what you expect when you cross the Atlantic. The hotel bars have a great atmosphere and friendly staff, how are most accomodating. Only fault was the TV internet we purchased at $13 per hour, inorder for us to check in for our flight the night before. Don't bother with it, as the system sucks and doesn't work properly for seat selection, and the lobby staff can check in for you (over the phone, if you dont want to leave your room too!)

Fits the Yonge Street feel where the full city experience is right outside your door (sights, smells, sounds, everything).

After reading some of the reviews on here about unrenovated rooms I called and changed our reservations from standard to an upgraded concierge level which had free breakfast and evening reception and I was told their best rooms (recently renovated). We were all disappointed in our rooms. If these were the best rooms in the hotel I would not want to see the unrenovated ones. The rooms were a decent size and had a balcony but they all smelled funny, were on the dark side, and the renovations were fairly superficial. The furniture was a little modern and really didn't fit the hotel. The concierge lounge was also disappointing. The breakfast was little more than cereal, juice, and fruit. And the evening receptions was a few overcooked finger foods and you had to pay for wine, beer, and even sodas! The sodas were $2.50 and the wine was $8 a glass. I have stayed at several hotels with concierge lounges and have never been charged for a soda and often the wine and beer are free. And, as many other reviews have mentioned ,the air conditioning (or lack there of) was an issue. Toronto was having an unusually warm April with day temps in the 80's. The air conditioning was clearly not on in the hotel and it was so uncomfortable in the room however the hallways were freezing! (I thought about getting a pillow and blanket and bunking in the hallway a couple of times). I asked for a fan every day of my stay however I never got one. One of my collegues did however she said it didn't help much.

Think I must have stayed in a different hotel to the reviewer below !! Went there with my hubby and daughter to celebrate her forthcoming 21st. On arrival I asked if we could have a renovated room (as others had advised on here) and was given a free upgrade to a luxury room. The room was lovely. Spacious, 2 queen size beds, lovely modern decor, modern bathroom with marble unit tops. Bedding was really nice and changed every other day. The beds were to die for, the comfiest we have ever slept in. .Towels changed daily if required. Good quality complimentary toiletries. Free newspaper delivered to room each morning. Tea/coffee making machine with lots of free supplies. Our room was cleaned every day. The only complaint I had was that we were woken one evening at 11.15pm...yes pm...by maids hoovering the corridoor and cleaning the room next to us. I complained to the front desk next morning and it never happened again. The DC has numerous eating places and bars. I only tried the market garden self service one evening and have to say the hot food was expensive and poor. There is free WIFI access in the public areas around the front desk. The pool area on the top floor is really nice, theres a jacuzzi in there too. The childrens pool down stairs with the corkscrew slide is good. Slides were only open fri/sat. There are coin operated washing machines situated in the girls changing rooms. Werw good value at $2 per wash and $2 per dry and are huge so you can do a large load in one go. There are some great restaurants on the doorstep of the DC. Our faves close by were The Pickle Barrell on Yonge street,close to The Eaton Centre and Spring Rrolls in The Atrium On Bay,again on Yonge street. For a snack or drink you have to try Johnny Rocketts in Dundas Square. Its a fun authentic style diner with chrome fittings and juke box etc, the waitresses sing and dance. They do fab milk shakes. Avoid the Swiss Chalet restaurant just below the yonge street entrance of the hotel. The food was very poor and the toilets were a disgrace. We had a fab meal at Baton Rouge on front street close to the CN Tower. I had the lunch time staek special...a 12oz rib steak and oh boy was it good...it melted in your mouth. My daughter has rack of ribs and it was amazing. Great prices at lunchtime. The DC is situated between 2 subway stations...College and Dundas...each being a good 5 mins walk away. Use the gerrard street entrance for College..and the yonge street entrance for Dundas. Across the road in the college park shopping complex there is a metro supermarket which is very good. They sell lovely fresh pizza and bakery items for breakfast. We purchased a weekly TTC pass which gave us unlimited travel around Toronto (on all TTC routes) on the subway, street cars and buses and was well worth the cost of $33 dollars (adult price). However the passes are only valid from monday-sunday each week so not much point in purchasing one mid-way through the week. You can purchase a daily pass and that seemed good value too. We made a visit to the theatre to see The Jersey Boys and it was really good. purchased our tickets from the discount ticket booth in dundas square. The theatre is a 25min subway ride away. Really nice theatre in a very good area. We did the main sightseeing etc..CN tower...the beaches...china town...went to a baseball game at the rogers centre which was brilliant...purchased tickets on the door 30 mins before the game. We hired a car and went to niagara falls and the beautiful town of niagara on the lake. Just wish we had split our visit between that area and toronto as the niagara area is really lovely. On the coastal rd between niagara falls and niagara on the lake there is a totem pole park and it was fantastic. Shopped at niagara retail outlet and got some great bargains form levi's and tommy hilfiger. The eaton centre is a great place to shop in Toronto, however not for bargain hunters. As my daughter loves shopping we took the subway to yorkdale and went to the yorkdale mall. This mall was much better than the eaton centre and much more affordable. We took a limo from the airport to the hotel which cost us $55 dollars. On our return journey the hotel concierge arranged the limo back to the airport and it cost us $50 dollars. The airport express bus stops at the hotel. The cost one way is $19.99, so for a family of 3 it was cheaper to get the limo. A normal taxi is around $10 cheaper. We noticed that parking at the hotel was expensive. Around $22 a day. However there is a public car park opposite and was much cheaper. We booked this hotel through ebookers and got a good deal.

I've just spent 4 nights at the Delta Chelsea, travelling with a friend. We were both very impressed with the hotel from start to finish. When we checked in we were a bit frazzled after some nightmare treatment by immigration and customs at the Airport (apparently we were suspicious because we were only comming for 5 days and Toronto is not somewhere Tourists come!!! - the hotel was thrilled when we told them we had been told that!). After we recounted our story they gave us a room upgrade and free breakfast. The hotel was spotless and the room was lovely (incredibly comfy beds). There was sometimes a bit of a wait for the lift but nothing that bothered us. The pool area was lovely and the bars and restaurants we ate in were also really nice. It is in a central location and very close to the Eaton Shopping Centre. It is a bit of a walk down to the harbour front area and CN Tower but the taxi's were readily available and pretty cheap to us. The staff in the hotel were really helpful and friendly (a general Toronto trait from our experience of the people we met). The only thing we did find was that the air in the room was very drying. We left the window open at night and that helped. It was a general thing we found everywhere we went in the city - there was always warm air being blown over you. It may be that it was because it had been cold and the heating hadn't been turned off. It did play havoc with our sinuses and judging by the huge display of sinus remedies in the pharmacies we went in to, it is a pretty common problem.

Would suggest that you install supportive assist bars in the shower, however, The pool & exercise room on the 27th floor was quite impressive & very clean--open longer hours than pool areas in other hotels that I have stayed at. The front desk staff,Pool staff & diningroom staff were pleasant & very helpful. If you want a wonderful meal, I would highly recommend the main hotel dining room.

One thing I was glad to see and use was the retractable clothesline in the tub - don't see many of those anymore.

A nice touch to have fresh orange sections or other fruit after your workout plus a choice of three daily newspapers. I only tried one restaurant on site - the Bb33. The food and service was very good. The buffet had a great selection of fresh salads, pastas, prime rib and more desert items than one could eat.

While the bed was comfortable and warm, that was about the only good thing about it. Bathroom was horrible----while it wasn't moldy or dirty it certainly felt that way. The wallboard heating unit was falling apart in the bathroom and the walls looked old and dirty. This hotel is in serious need of a gutting and renovation to bring it up to 3 star standards. Tried the fitness/pool facilities and while the area is quite large and the cardio machines newer, I still couldn't shake that old 1980's feeling so I wasn't comfortable there.

The room was of a good size, with one king size bed, TV, desk etc. The bathroom was quite small but nothing smaller than in other large Northern American cities I have visited before. The room was quieter than we expected. The air conditioning in the room worked well. There was 6 elevators serving our part of the hotel, there was always one waiting and they were very quick. The bed was very comfortable and there is a good choice of TV channels. The shower was extremely powerful! The room was one of the 'updated' ones although it wasn't spotless. It looked used but saying that it was very clean and the maids did a great job each day. The location of this hotel is great, between two subway stops each of which no more than a 5 minute stroll. Walking south of the hotel takes you down Yonge Street past the Eaton Centre and to the lake. It took us about 20 minutes to walk to Union Station and 30 minutes to the waterfront. We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants as there is plenty of better / cheaper choice around the hotel. We did use the shop in the hotel (sells souveniors, chocolate, drinks etc), it was very convenient although the prices were a bit more than local shops as you would imagine. We found a Metro supermarket about 5 - 10 minute away on the Ryerson University campus. This has a great selection and is much cheaper than the Drug Mart stores for drinks and snacks. One gem we found was a pizza store across from the hotel, it doesn't look anything special from the out or inside but the pizzas are amazing! We booked our stay as a flight and hotel package with Expedia which meant we paid around \u00c2\u00a355 per night for the room.

Nevertheless the helpful receptionist suggested that she could contact their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sister\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel - The Delta Chelsea - to check out availability. She got the details, confirmed acceptable and booked us in. A short taxi-ride away we were checked in at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Privilege\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd desk of the Delta Chelsea which was very quiet by comparison to the organised chaos of the hotel lobby and the main reception. This is a very large hotel and could be intimidating for some - the lobby appears at most times to have all the frenzy of a shopping mall on a Saturday afternoon as people criss-cross in all directions! It would be a good warm-up for the Eaton Centre. The lifts are quick and efficient - just make sure you get directions to the correct one to take you to your room because there are quite a number of them. Our room was on the upper levels overlooking Barbara Ann Scott Park on the Gerrard Street West side of the building and had been refurbished. We found the d\u00c3\u00a9cor a bit dark for our liking however everything was tastefully done. The two double beds were comfortable and the room had all the usual facilities you would expect of a decent hotel. The ensuite was small but functional. We had a narrow balcony overlooking the park however it took a moment or two to have the courage to step out on to it since it looked like an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153original\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feature of the building and we were quite a height from the walkway! Needless to say we tried it - separately - and survived! At night the view gave you a definite feeling of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153downtown\" amongst the city lights. As our arrival was quite late we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t venture out onto the streets in search of a place for dinner and instead decided to try the hotel restaurant. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Market Garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd looked about as relaxing as the hotel lobby and appeared to serve up snacks - handy for families. We opted for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bb33\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which was also on the ground level however is a bit more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upmarket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as opposed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153market garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The waiter was very friendly and engaged in a bit of chat, the atmosphere was relaxed, the food very good and the wine list reasonable. We also had breakfast in here in the morning and experienced similar service and good food. No complaints from us in this regard. Unusually the pool and gym is on the 27th floor and our curiosity got the better of us to have a look at these facilities, Although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have the time to use them they both appeared to be modern and were reasonably busy at the time we visited - the pool is not very large. There is a bar on this level too however we didn't use it because we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realised the previous nght that it existed - we only stayed for the one night. The hotel location is convenient for shopping however is located quite a distance from the CN Tower and harbour. Fortunately it is not far to the subway at College or Dundas and you can get down to Union station in a few minutes or alternatively a half hour or so if you stroll through the streets. A Day ticket on the subway is cheap. Surprisingly there are a few \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd entertainment places in the vicinity of the hotel which a previous TA member has commented upon to place those with children on guard possibly for awkward questions!

The hotel is massive, it has 4 entrances and there are 3 different banks of lifts to service all the rooms. Check in time can be quite chaotic due to the large quantities of guests but the long line always seemed to move quickly. One way to avoid this is to sign up for the free Delta Privilege scheme (thanks to the other reviewer on here that recommended this). This gives you a separate reception area (never saw a queue here) and other benefits such as a 6 p.m. check out. The hotel facilities were good, a kids pool area (which we didn't visit) and an adults only spa area called Deck 27 with a pool, spa (this was hot but there were no bubbles) and fitness equipment. There are a number of restaurants including the Market Place which is self service where we found the quality of food good and the prices comparable for a city centre for dinner although sandwiches seemed expensive and we weren't that impressed with breakfast. We stayed in a deluxe room which was spacious, well equipped and maintained and always clean. The only problem we had with the room was the temperature, we couldn't make it feel cool using the climate control (which was very old). However, the only time we really felt the room to be hot was when walking in from the air conditioned corridor otherwise it was quite comfortable.

Generally, this was not a pleasent or luxurious room by any stretch of the imagination! I had to call housekeeping as the bath had no plug stopper so it couldn't be used! The 2nd room we had (we took a break to Niagara half way through our trip and were rechecked into a different room) the bathroom had a plug stopper that didn't fit and again the room was as gloomy depressing and dirty. Although we did not intend spending any great length of time in our room we still didn't want one this bad! We ate only once in the hotel (Market Garden) as were starving and wanted sandwiches on arrival. The food was seriously overpriced and so we never used any restaurants again. Other bad points: The queues at check in desk long, the housekeeper knocking at 08:00 (both times) on departure, despite check out time being 11:00am.... in fact the last time we checked out the housekeeper actually walked in without knocking at 08:00. During our first stay my partner left his debit card in a drawer. The housekeeper handed it into lost and found and despite it having his name on it and the hotel being able to match it to our details and information, no attempt was made to tell us this had been found even when we checked back in (when we realised it was missing). From a tourist perspective we didn't even find the location great, it was a bit of a walk from the harbour, CN tower and major attractions. We didn't mind walking but there were plenty of better located hotels. A few positives - the gym was well equipped and modern and the swimming pool great. The view from the roof was also good.

Our room was great, great view.... i don't know what the priemier room was like, but i know i was extremely happy with our room... The only thing i wasnt happy about was the internet connection fee $11.95 per day... (( we left the laptop at home becasue i didn't want to pay that everyday, but remember there are ways to get around that, ALOT of people did bring their laptops and used them down in the lobby or the market place resturant for FREE... they do have a business centre with 4 computers there if you need a computer, it's $6.00 for 15 mins or $10.00 for half hour... but because i left mind home, i went and got a $5.00 calling card at the little gift store by the yonge street entrance and that gave me 90 mins of talk time and that lasted us all week... The Delta Cheslea has 2 bars, and 3 resturants (that we seen) the marketplace resturant is like a cafeteria style setting, where you get what you want to eat then head to the cashier ((alot of people seem to be using this but it was EXPENSIVE... 600ml bottle of coke it was $2.94... crazy)) the other resturant/bar that we did eat at was in the main lobby next to the business centre, they don't have a big selection but things like (clubhouse, nachos, wings, soups, salads, chicken tenders, and a few more bar type ideas..... there are tons of resturants just outside the hotel whether it's fast food or sit down resturants that your looking for... Right across the street on Gerrard Street there is a college square and that has a dominion store, 2 tim horton's, a richtree, kentucky fried chicken, and taco bell.... I hope this helps you all in deciding whether to go to the Delta Cheslea or not...

It is in an excellent location and we found it to be very family friendly. We were, however, disappointed with a few things. We stayed in a Deluxe Room - tastefully decorated with newer furnishings and comfortable beds and pillows. The beds have duvets which is nice - but they do not have duvet covers on them. A plain white flat sheet is placed under the duvet and on top of the duvet - leaving the duvet itself exposed when the sheets move around. I can't imagine the duvets are washed after every guest so we found this to be a little off-putting. Although the room itself was clearly renovated and updated, as was the sink and shelving area in the bathroom, it appeared that the tub and shower area were in their original form. The grout around the tile was dirty, there was thick and poorly applied caulking around the tap adn tub, and the slip guards in the tub were dirty. The laundry drying cord in the shower was broken. There was a flimsy metal public bathroom-type toilet paper holder attached under the sink cabinet - and as with most public bathrooms, it was easier to take the roll off the holder than to try to make it work. We had requested a fridge and although it was not there upon our arrival, it was brought up to our room immediately when we called down about it. It was was very large and spacious for a bar-type fridge. On the second level there is a large enclosed supervised kids activity area. We just took a quick tour so I can't comment on the childcare or scheduled activities, but it looked well laid-out with lots for the younger set to do. The family pool area was disapppointing. It is very outdated and the pool is about the size of a backyard swimming pool. There are plastic chairs around the pool but getting one is nearly impossible in the evenings when the pool is busy. The evening we were there, the towels had not been replenished so we arrived with nothing and had to go back up to our room to get towels. Beware that there are height and swimming ability requirements for the waterslide. Our 4 year-old was in tears when she learned she was too short for it. Although the hotel advertises the slide extensively, we never saw anything stating the height requirement so were not prepared. The teenagers at the pool seemed to love it. We ate at the pub and the food and service were good. Overall our stay was good and the location can't be beat. The most disppointing thing for us was the pool area but the kids were fine with it and if you don't have kids, you can enjoy the adult pool upstairs which we heard was nicer.

After reading the mixed reviews, I have to admit I was a little nervous about my choice. However, I found it to be a nice hotel in a great location. Check-in was a breeze, although I have to say I think we beat the rush. We arrived around 1:00 on a Thursday and they had rooms ready for us (even gave us a choice of floors!). We checked in quickly and were out exploring Toronto by 2:00. However, as we got closer to the weekend, the lobby got busier and busier and there always seemed to be a line at check-in. Our room was fine\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deluxe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with two double beds. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor had definitely been updated and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find this room to be dark like some other reviews had mentioned. We were on the 17th floor and had a balcony that you could actually step out on and have a little bit of a view. The room and bathroom were clean and housekeeping did a great job. My only complaint was that I had requested a refrigerator with my reservation which I forgot to mention at check-in, so there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one in the room. I called down and requested one and then we stepped out. When we returned at 10:30 that night, there still was no fridge. I called again and they promised one within half an hour. When it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrive at bedtime, I called and cancelled it. They apologized, but I basically gave up on getting a fridge. As for the hotel itself, the kids loved the family pool\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmy 10-year-old daughter went down the waterslide at least 50 times on the first day. It is also supervised and if your child is under 5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tall, they have to take a quick swimming test to go down the slide. It is quite busy and loud (so loud I had a hard time concentrating on my book), but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great for the kids. There is a nicer adult pool area on the 26th floor which I checked out but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to use (sadly). We ate twice in the Marketplace Restaurant (cafeteria style) just for convenience, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit overpriced and the food is mediocre. I do want to emphasize that this is a very big, busy hotel. There are lots of families and people there for weddings, business events, etc. The lobby is always bustling. They have an information desk where you can book tours or simply ask directions or for a restaurant recommendation. (Which we did one night and had dinner at the Pickle Barrel on Yonge Street-good food with something for everyone). Parking was not a problem\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe left and came back once and had no trouble getting a spot, although the parking garage is a little tricky to maneuver (especially with an SUV), but I believe this is typical of city hotels. There are four separate entrances that take you onto four different streets. A word of warning: if you use the Yonge Street exit, be prepared to pass by some not so family-friendly establishments. While the street itself is fine, (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually a very busy street with lots of shopping and restaurants\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit just has a few older questionable movie houses, etc., that have managed to survive), young children might be asking questions you might not be ready to answer. Your closest subway is Dundas, which is in the Eaton Centre shopping center (about a 10-minute walk). I paid a rate of $175/night (through the hotel website using my AAA membership) and self-parking was $23 with in-and-out privileges. Overall, I think this was a nice hotel that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centrally located and great for families.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterloo, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Delta Chelsea\u201d", "Author": "Larryo", "ReviewID": "UR18946241", "Content": "a very, very busy place.

Television and radio in room, although old, work just fine. Bed comfortable enough but definitely not the Hilton or Marriott. Pool/waterslide/hot tub excellent. Two pools to choose from. Amenities plentiful and open late hours. Location of hotel could not be better. Two blocks from two different subway stations and less than 5 minutes from City Hall and Eaton Centre. Everything is within walk; no taxis required. Location and pools sold me on this hotel. Would not return to Delta Chelsea if price exceeds $125 CAD/peak season.

There is no safe in the room, but there is a safety deposit box room, that is manned by hotel staff. We never had trouble gaining access as and when required and it actually felt safer than leaving it in your room. We never actually ate in the hotel, neither the a la carte restaurant or the family restaurant looked that appealing. Although the family restaurant was good for picking up food and coffee to go. The pub in the hotel was really good - the staff were so social and welcoming. The leisure facilities were limited. They looked nicer in the picture on the website. The main word to describe is 'small' There are loungers by the pool, but it wasn't as relaxing a place as it could have been, But it was for adults only, so that did help. The gym was well equipped. Due to it being such a large hotel, it can often feel slightly faceless, but there was still plenty of staff around should we have needed them The hotel is in a great location for downtown. The CN Tower and islands were only a subway ride away. The Eaton centre was about 10 minutes walk away. It's only an hour and 30 minutes drive from Niagra.

I had read a review about dirty glasses, so I decided to check them and sure enough they were dirty. I figured I would just call the front desk and get new ones. So we went to bed that night and had a horrible sleep. The bed was rock hard. I know some people like it that way and I figured for the price I paid it was no biggie. However, once I found a long black hair on one of the towels and a \"questionable\" stain on the head board I had enough. In the bathroom it says on a plaque that if ONE thing is not up to par then you get your first night free. I honestly would have been happy if someone had just cleaned the stain and replaced the towel and glasses. Oh, and gotten that night free too. So I went to the front desk and they were nice enough to upgrade us to a deluxe room. After that, things were golden!

Well equipped exercise area with lots of windows, and lots of fresh, clean towels looked inviting, but I was too lazy to work out while there. They B2 Bistro/buffet was okay but nothing special; I'm not a good one to review fancy restaurants because I eat vegan and most places suck in this regard. Another person's scallop dinner looked quite good. Breakfast \"marketplace\" restaurant was typically overpriced hotel breakfast and the Second Cup coffee was awful; I don't know if the pots need cleaning or what, but it was bitter, but not in the good, roasted too dark way. I went to the bagel spot across Yonge street instead; their coffee was mediocre and bagels were better priced. The bar was reasonable for an afternoon beer.

My car (a Mercedes, which I would think is a bit more of a target than the Honda Civic mentioned above) was untouched. One notable plus about the Delta Chelsea was the staff friendliness; everyone from the desk to the Concierge to the housekeeping staff said Hi when you walked by and made you feel more than welcome.

The staff at check-in was quite helpful. They did not cater to our slightest whims, but they explained clearly what they can do, what they cannot do, which options they have and when each of the rooms will be ready. We opted for a room on a lower floor available immediately. It was a right choice as there is not much difference in terms of a view. As big as the hotel is, it is surrounded by even taller buildings so that we had trouble locating our hotel from the top of CN Tower. The room was big enough, had a coffee-maker with a choice of coffee, decaf, or tea. You get a daily newspaper, Globe or something, which I found unexpectedly interesting. Usually, a newspaper from another city is filled with things totally irrelevant for you. Here I found myself reading 3-4 big articles per issue. A small complaint was the absence of heating in October: they have central heating that was not turned on yet. We decided this problem using an extra blanket from the little closet. The maids seemed to be really thoughtful about what we need in the room. Once we tossed the bed cover in the corner, the next day it was safely put away into the closet. The hotel has a policy: if the room is not cleaned properly, one of the nights is free for your stay. The policy was posted above the toilet for some reason, but it works, we had a chance to check it. It is my conviction that the quality of service is measured not by the absence of problems but the ability to solve problems when they occur. One day I stayed in our hotel room almost all day, till 4pm. I guess that is why our room was not made when we returned in the evening. I went down to complain about it. I asked for a replenishment of tea/coffee and inquired about the one-night free policy. For the latter, the guy had to consult with a supervisor. He returned after 5 minutes confirming that we will only be charged for 3 nights instead of 4. As for the tea, it was brought to us in 15 minutes. That's what I call service.

You can save an additional 10% by buying tickets on line. There is a wicket at the Airport in the Arrivals section where you can purchase the tickets. There is a link on the Delta Chelsea site to the Airport Express website. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants on site, but there are lots to pick from around the hotel.

I ended up on an 11th floor room in the Green tower. it was nice but a little worn in the bathroom and as people have mentioned a little small. The June jacobs tolietries were a nice touch and i have to admit the hotel room was pretty quiet despite the fact there are so many other rooms nearby! For a basic room i thought the TV was tiny and kind of aged (51cm) but nonetheless they had a good selection of channels. The staff were polite on the whole and the only concern i had was one night returning late from a day and night of sightseeing to have a drunk woman sprawled across the hallway talking loudly into her cellphone. I would have thought security would have come up and told her to move along. Lobby is huge and i often got lost looking for my elevators, People were always in there at any time of Day or Night. Just watch the Yonge St entrance, I had a beggar accost me as i stepped out one day and i noticed him the next day lurking around that doorway waiting for people to come out.

From the outside, it's beautiful, and it's location is wonderful. The lobby is fantastic and well maintained, on par with a 4 or 5 star hotel. I arrived in town early, and called ahead to find out if it would be possible for an early check-in. I was told that if they have a room ready, they will normally accomodate my request, but if not, I was free to use the facilities while they prepared a room. When I finally did arrive at the hotel and asked for an early check in, the auditor informed me I would be charged an additional $99 for early check-in. I explained to her what I was told on the phone, and was told there would not be a charge, and would like to avoid any additional charges. The auditor was then basically pushed away and another auditor came to me and told me it would not be a problem, checked me into the hotel, and then proceeded to give me a set of room keys and went to my room on the 20th floor. The room keys didn't fit into the lock, so I had to go back down and have them change the type to fit into my door. I opened the door to find one of the tiniest rooms I've ever stayed in!

To top it off, they have pop-ups that mess up your computer every five minutes! So, I get on to check my account to find out they scammed me and charged me the additional $99 for checking in 3 hours early. I'll be fighting that when I return home!

We were promised a room with a refrigerator and a microwave -- didn't happen. We asked several times and were told it would be taken care of that day. In five days, we never got either. The food in the restaurants was strangely presented and just barely average. There was also a buffet of sorts at the full-service restaurant but it was very small and was badly set up so that it was difficult to get around. The meal was very expensive considering the quality and there was a decided lack of fresh veggies. A huge flock of unhappy tourists arrived pushing their way towards the food all at once after what appeared to be a long bus ride of some sort (not the hotel's fault actually but the group was expected) so getting to the buffet again was problematic plus there was minimal wait staff (only two servers for the entire dining room). Cost for two buffet meals plus $35 bottle of bad wine about $140; value about $50. Breakfast was even worse proportionately -- one little box of dry cereal and tiny carton of milk -- $6.00. The hotel people of whom we asked directions consistently were wrong. The busy street outside one of the three doors was a scary, low-end bunch of store fronts with the most disreputable people hanging around. Pan-handlers are everywhere and aggressive. So we took taxis and were completely ripped off every time but one. They would go around side streets and up and down one-way roads to run up the tab. One ride of about 2 miles cost over $12 while another in the opposite direction to the same starting point was $5. There appears to be no security at all around the hotel exterior and in fact, we did not see a single policeman anywhere in Toronto. That could explain the proliferation of beggars. We even had some high school kids in nice clothes with very expensive bicycles ask us for money. I just got to where I would say, \"No English, go away!\" as sternly as possible in a thick accent and my companion carried a big folding knife in his pocket. On the good side, there is a lovely roof-top pool and whirlpool but strangely, the bar up there was never open although the hotel pool area had loads of thirsty guests. Very weird. There is no public computer even at a fee. They told me to go to a internet cafe but didn't know where I could find one.

The garage ceiling was very low and some of the turns were very tight. We finally found a space about four levels down. Our room was supposedly recently renovated although we couldn't tell it. The room had a musty smell when we entered, which was an immediate turn-off. The carpet was stained and the furnishings seemed dated. We could view a bit of the city from our balcony. The room was very small even though there were only three of us. Both mornings we had our breakfast downstairs. The restaurant was not equpped to handle the number of diners and ran out of several things, including coffee and silverware. We were pleased to see that they offered free wi-fi in the restaurant area, which we ended up using to research and book another hotel. The family pool was extremely crowded (50+) and small. Because the pool was the outlet for the slide, the water was choppy and a little rough for my 7 year old.

If everybody could pay the price we did, I would highly recommend the hotel - it was the best value we could find downtown. However, I've rated it based on what most hotel patrons probably pay.

But if this was an upgraded room, I can only imagine what the regular rooms are like. The room was average for a hotel, nothing more. The room was fine looking - very clean. Balcony useless because as previous reviewers have stated, there is no furniture to sit on out there. It was sweltering in the room and we could not figure out how to cool it off - turns out toggle switch on wall will never cool off the room if it's toggled to the right - perhaps a sign indicating this would be nice - other than to say 'on' for either left or right toggle there was no other instructions. We spent two nights and found the room was either freezing or hot and stuffy, we couldn't find a comfortable medium. Our room came with a $25 food voucher each day. Prices incredibly expensive but covered our breakfast (for two) each morning. I really didn't like that internet service wasn't included in the price - this really took away the convenience factor. Almost $12 for a day of internet is almost theft in my opinion, no way I'd pay it.

Even though my room did have a balcony (a very small, dirty one with nothing on it ) I didn't even have a door to it! I had to climb through a small window to get out to the balcony. Some rooms from what I could see did have a door to the balcony, however they weren't any better.

This room had a balcony we could go out on, and stand among the trash that was on the balcony and stayed there throughout our 4 night stay. Additionally, the hallways had water stains on the carpet, our bathroom had numerous broken tiles, an exhaust fan that didn't work (in fact, had no switch to start it), had a television behind the sitting chair and literally next to the bed. Whenever we asked a question of staff we were told different answers to our questions, so that we came to see it as a game to ask simple questions (like directions or whether any specific services/amenities were in the hotel).

The in-room advertising card said that internet service was $9.95/day, but ended up being $11.95. All in all, if you are just looking for a convenient place to sleep, the Delta Chelsea is okay.

At the public garage, you will have to pay each time you use it and you will have to decide in advance how long to buy your ticket for (or you may have to buy another ticket if you need to park for more time), but you can use a credit card at the ticket machine, and the rates are much cheaper than the hotel's rates: for example, 12 overnight hours (6pm-6am) cost only $6. Our room had two standard double beds. It is rare these days for mid-priced hotels to have beds smaller than queen size, but the room was definitely too small for bigger beds. As it was, the space between the foot of the beds and the dresser was tighter than I'm used to. The end of the room with the upholstered chair and small table and desk was also not particularly roomy, so that direction would also not have tolerated the additional width of larger beds. The room seemed to have been renovated reasonably recently, but the outside balcony had an old rough cement floor and the paint on the divider from the balcony next door was chipped and peeling. The bathroom had a nice granite (or synthetic) counter, but the sink bowl had a long crack along the bottom. The bathroom items like shampoo and soap were nice \"boutique\" types with pleasant and mild citrus scents. There is free WiFi in the lobby. You have to pay an additional fee of approx $11/day to get Internet service in your room. We did not pay for this service. I found a wireless keyboard in the dresser, so presumably it could be used to access the Internet through the TV. We had breakfast one morning at the Marketplace Cafe in the hotel ground floor.

The waterslide was not always available at child friendly times. (between 6pm and 8pm). 2) We had an old room on the 16th floor. The fans didn't work, the TV was blurry and it was very run down. At 2am our first night we asked to move because we couldn't sleep. The noise from outside was so great that we felt we were sleeping outdoors on the street. While the staff was accomodating and moved us to a quieter, more updated room, it was a pain moving all our stuff and our small children. 3) Our second night there the fire alarm went off at 11pm and scared our children. The first three floors were evacuated and a voice came on every few minutes over the intercom to make a statement about the fire alarm. This false alarm took a good hour out of our sleep time. Even when they said all was well they repeated it at least 3 times over a 10 minute period. We had to calm our children down too. 4) The elevators were not reliable either, one was always broken down. 5) While kids eat \"free\", it is still cheaper to go to surrounding restaraunts outside the hotel. What is the point of a hotel if you can't get a good night's sleep there? We were disapointed in choosing this hotel.

We even noted in the comments section of the reservation form on-line that this was a big deal for us - our kids first big hotel stay and a special family occasion. Everyone was excited!

It was adequate for our stay - although I would have been a bit disappointed if we'd booked in for longer. We ate at the market hall on the first night which is a collection of different varieties of food from salads to pizza, hot and cold beverages, etc. It wasn't fantastic. We went for a salad each and it was probably the worst salad I have ever tasted. It wasn't particularly fresh, the sweetcorn was burnt (who can burn sweetcorn!) and the beetroot just tasted odd. We left most of it. We did have a free continental breakfast which was a pastry and muffin plus a beverage and a small cup of juice. That was the best thing about the market place but I'm not saying that was great either! I thought the prices were too expensive considering the quality of the food.

I found it just created a \"homely\" atmosphere and I was interested to see all the diverse groups of people we had staying there. When I arrived, there was no queue for checking in. The girl at the desk was extremely polite and helpful, and I was able to upgrade my room to one of the Deluxe rooms for only $20/night instead of $45/night. My room was very nice. I was impressed with the redecorating that had been done. Hopefully they will eventually get around to redecorating all the rooms, and the corridors (which were a little worse for wear, but who cares they are just corridors!) The room was serviced beautifully everyday, and I was extremely impressed with the food from the Market Garden and from the Pub. I didn't eat at the Bistro but it looked great as well. The concierge was very helpful, especially with regard to picking my bags up from my room on the day of departure and ordering a limery car to take me to the airport. The hotel is very close to the Eaton Centre, a HUGE shopping mall that I visited a couple of times. There are nice restaurants nearby, and the subway is only one block away. The pool and spa on the top floor was nice, and hardly ever busy. I had a relaxing swim and nobody was in the pool or the spa at the same time as me. The gym also looked good although I didn't get around to trying it out. I was very happy with the hotel and feel that many of the people writing the bad reviews are just TOO PICKY!! There is really no need to complain about some of the things they were moaning about, I honestly think some people have ridiculous expectations! I found the staff to be friendly and courteous at all times - perhaps they are rude when guests have a bad attitude?!! I would happily stay at the Delta Chelsea again, and would recommend it to anybody. It sure does seem like a great place for families, I'm sure my boys would have loved the water slide and the kids area.", "Date": "August 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cAn Expensive Headache\u201d", "Author": "worker1bee", "ReviewID": "UR5700539", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Delta Chelsea Hotel in Toronto - the service and policies are very poorly advertised, written, and clarified to incoming customers and don't reflect well on its 4 star rating.

Hotel desk staff ignored the situation out front, and pretended it didn't exist. The receptionist I dealt with lied about the quoted balance being charged to my credit cards that day. I wasn't informed about the hotel policy of requiring an additional $200.00 deposit at check in time. I found out about this when checking out and reviewing my bill. (The hotel staff and management I dealt with wouldn't provide a paper statement verifying this fact at check in. You are forced to check your credit card history / activity for the hotel's charges to your credit card.) While most of the desk staff are personable and professional, there are employees who need updating and retraining in customer relations. Food from the restaurants and room service is of average quality - very disappointing for the expense incurred.

I wouldn't recommend walking near the Yonge Street entrance after 9:00 pm at night - many street people congregate in the area with questionable activity occurring.

Total chaos. Kids (910 & 7) liked the corkscrew slide but pretty standard if your kids have ever gone on a water slide before. They only did it twice. Our third child (4) was intimidated by all the craziness in the family pool area. They do not have a shallow area where a toddler can stand sit, etc. When they say \"kiddy pool\" I'm not sure what they mean becuase there is not kiddy pool around as the family pool is 3.5 feet deep.

There are a million elevators for all different floors and the lobby was chaotic with seemingly the entire visiting population staying here. Elevators were small and took forever - you could not fit a luggage cart in the guest elevators - so you either have to have the bellman take it up - or you carry it piece by piece. Rooms were a bit small but very nice, phone reservations promised up a king and pullout couch, but we got two doubles. Lukewarm water in the showers but they did give a $70 rate reduction for the trouble. Views are just ok.

Perhaps they were expecting me to complain or perhaps the staff were genuinely being helpful but they upgraded my room and accompanied me there to make sure it was acceptable. I stayed in a premier room with 2 double beds on the 7th floor and it was lovely, clean, well aired, spacious and obviously renovated quite recently. Ok so the view wasn't great but I didn't plan on spending my holiday gazing out of the hotel window. I don't understand why someone would leave a hotel and write a terrible review if they were unhappy about the size of the room when all it would take to change this would be a polite conversation. The hotel is massive but all of the staff that I had dealings with were polite and efficient. I ate breakfast at the hotel and found that there was a wide variety to choose from and it was reasonably priced. All of my sightseeing and shopping was done on foot from the hotel which is situated in an ideal location for shops and tourist attractions. Concierge staff assisted me to book excellent seats at the Princess of Wales theatre to see the Lord of the Rings which was amazing.

You could probaly comare the rooms to your 'Travel Lodge' standard in the UK. LOCATION: The hotel is located in a great location for shopping and the Eaton centre is close by. It very easy to get to all the main areas/attractions and the 'College' subway connection is very close, and very easy and cheap to use (far better than the London Underground). There are some excellent dining places in easy walking distance. FACILITIES: The hotel is a good place to stay if you have children as the Kids Swimming Pool is flexible on the opending hours, and has a fun waterslide for kids that can swim approx '20m', it also has a large jacuzzi that our boys enjoyed. The childrens play area is staffed by really friendly and fun staff who could not have been more helful, and you can leave the children in there for up to 2 and half hours for a nominal fee of just under app. \u00c2\u00a31.25 per hour!, while you have some 'you' time or go for a swim in the 'Adults' only pool upstairs, This is a nice area and has great veiws over the City and the CN Tower, the gym equiptment is set up so you have the best veiw and there is a pool and Jacuzzi too. The Childrens play area also organises a fun games night for the kids at the weekend and has a movie night.

But most are tiny, barely big enough to house a double bed, and in dire need of renovation. And, although you can request one of the larger rooms, they can't guarantee you'll get one. So you could find you'll check in and be left with a claustrophobic room. For the final of our three weekends in Toronto, I'd had enough, cancelled our reseration. My room at the Delta was tiny, over-heated, and you couldn't open a window or cool the room down at all. I paid an extra $10-$15 per room per night extra and stayed in the Marriott Courtyard instead.

It's just up the road (College Street subway, still on Yonge) but the rooms are big, spacious, up-to-date rooms, one queen or two double beds per room, and (gasp) enough staff to efficiently handle checking in and out quickly.

The first time I stayed at the Delta Chelsea with my best girlfriend for a weekend of shopping. The hotel was close to the Eaton Centre which is the gigantic mall and that is where we ended up spending most of our time due to a sudden blizzard. Our room was warm and the beds were REALLY comfortable. The adult pool area is nice and peaceful with gorgeous night views. The family pool area has a really fun water slide that you really can't pass up. We had a nice shock at check-out. We were under the impression that parking was $25 for the weekend but turned out to be $25/day. The taxes on hotel stays in Toronto are really high and because we booked through Expedia we were not able to get the taxes refunded at the border. We also did not realize that EVERY time we picked up our phone it cost us like $2. We had made lots of local calls trying to find something to do out of the elements and had used calling cards to call home and check messages and what not and had racked up a near tear inducing bill. The PPV selection during our stay was also very grim. We ended up watching The Animal. BLEH. Its sad when a Rob Schneider movie is your best option. The second time I stayed the the DC was with a group of friends (4 of us in total) and we again got the delta room (2 beds) however this time it was much older and grimier. It was quite noisey this time. The Delta Rooms are small and the double room last time was fine but with 4 adults it just doesn't cut it. This time we had gotten a package and parking was supposed to be complimentary however the attendent tried to charge us anyway and it ended up being a big headache and a lot of time wasted. The best thing about the DC was there was ALWAYS a cab out front and there is a ton in the area. Internet cafes, nail salons, record stores, etc etc. If you have a big group and need a block of rooms I'd highly recommend the chelsea, but if you are just a couple or two looking for a getaway I'd definitly seek out somewhere more quaint and personal.

This means that if your room has it, you can pay $10 (CAN) per 24 hours, but if your room doesn't you have to go to one of two computers in the business center, where you will pay $6/30 minutes, a pretty rotten alternative for business travelers who need to log on several times daily for short periods.

We booked a premier plus room which wasnt available when we arrived. After some discussion, a premier plus room was found... b) there are balconies on a lot of rooms which is great for looking out at the skyline but balconies on the south tower are very very run down. No chairs and dirty. Compared to the room interior - this was very disappointing and the hotel should not be advertising balconies as 'habitable'. c) parking is a nightmare. Even if you have booked into the hotel - there's no guarantee of a parking space and you may need to use a nearby garage d) the adult deck is for adults (not surprisingly) but this is a real shame if you have teenagers with you who would like to swim. There are no facilities for 'proper' swimming on the family deck - merely a pool into which the big waterslide runs. The slide is great fun but it is a shame that there are no other faciliites for teenagers. The family area is much more geared towards young kids (and is very good). The hotel should consider changing the age (perhaps to 14) for clients in the adult pool at particular times.

Hall carpets were dirty. - *some* of the staff were friendly (housekeeping, front desk) Reasons we would never consider going back: - constant room screw ups - room reserved was \"out of order\" so we were placed in another one night with the promise of the right one the next day. Were told to call back. Did so repeatedly (hours apart) only to be told to call back again because they could not accommodate the request yet. Finally, we were told we would go into a room in the same floor thus avoiding the wretchedly overcrowded elevators - but not for another few hours. Came back from dinner to get into our room. The cheerful front desk person issued me keys which were on a vastly different floor and different set of elevators. Resigned, I trudged up - only to find that someone was in there already! Back to the lobby to wait on line again. Got the right room - not on the same floor again so the family packed everything up, waited for three elevators to find one with enough room, down to the lobby and up the other elevators (similar wait). The room was not worth the trouble. - The crowded elevators make you want to die. - The constantly busy lobby gets tedious to wade through. - We had a surly waiter in one of the restaurants. The front desk clerks, although friendly, couldn't figure out much without constantly confering with the manager. They would go in the back for five minutes at a time, leaving us to scratch our heads and tap on the counter. - All food options are overpriced for the quality and service. - As I guess should be expected for such a large hotel, it was impersonal - kind of like a room off of Grand Central Station.

After that situation the person at the front desk sent me to the wrong set of elevators (specific elevators only go to certian floors). Upon entering my room I noticed a very large dark stain in the center of the carpeting and when I made the turn around the bed there was another huge stain on the rug. I looked at the window and noticed that the window sheers were torn in multiple places. I called the front desk and requested another room and was told there was nothing they could do because nothing else was available. It was not until I demanded that they switch my room that they put me into a different room (which all they did was put me into a room of a guest that had not checked in yet and then gave them the dirty room). The reason I know this is because after the house keeping person came and inspected the dirty room and took me to the other room I went to the front desk to get the room key for my new room. At that time I was then told that I had not paid and they needed my credit card again. I asked to speak to a manager and was given a run around before eventually the front desk person realized that they had already put another customer into the room that was unacceptable to me and that she was looking up the other customers reservation information. The second room I was placed in was still not what I was expecting either. There was still a large coffee stain on the carpeting, the balcony had obviously not been checked from the last occupant because there were empty alcohol bottles left on the balcony, and there were brownie crumbs underneath the bed when I noticed that one of the legs which held up the center portion of the bed was missing and that was why the bed sagged toward the middle. The Delta Chelsea definitely is not worth the price no matter how much you pay. Especially since they charge you 25 dollars Canadian (with gst) per day to park in the garage on top of what you are already paying for your room.

I stayed at the hotel for 10 nights at the beginning of April 05. The trip combined business and leisure, so I was accompanied by my sister for half the visit and on my own for the remainder. As both a business and tourist hotel it fulfilled all my needs perfectly!! The location is great. It's one block from the metro, and one block from the Eaton Centre. There are dozens of great resturants within a few minutes walk. The room was excellent - I was somehow fortunate in having not only two double beds but also a lounge area with sofa, chair and coffee table. Beds very comfy, and loads of storage space. Bathroom and other fixtures and fittings all fine. However it is the range of facilitites that make this hotel. The Marketplace resturant is excellent - no need to pay a fortune for breakfast if you just want a coffee and a bowl of cereal (CAN $5). No need to order expensive room service when you can help yourself to whatever you want and carry it back to your room (e.g. delicious pasta dishes for CAN$8, great soup and salad for even less). Consequenty didn't sample the more upmarket Bistro resturant (too many excellent resturants nearby), but it looked pretty good! Other facilities include two quite different bars; one a sports bar with free popcorn, the other more of a wine bar, but both with great value wines, beers and cocktails. Also, there is a very useful shop, and two great pool areas. One is deck 27 which is for adults only and also has a good gym, a great jacuzzi and views of the CN tower. The other is definitely more municipal; designed for famillies, with a flume, a huge oblong family jacuzzi and a very useful mini laundrette (in the women's changing area - not sure if the men had one too!). This area definitely lacks ambiance, but is I imagine a great facility if you have kids (it also includes a creche area). Probably the least succesful public area is the Deck 27 cocktail bar; great drinks, great views - but alas only open from 8pm on Friday and Saturday nights!!!! No use for a sundowner - the sun is well and truly down before it even opens!! Can only assume it opens earlier and more frequently in summer but why not all year round I have no idea....... So apart from this were there any other downsides? Well, I guess if you were totally allergic to children then you might be happier elsewhere, but I certainly didn't find them intrusive and there are plenty of 'adult only' spaces. Equally if you are allergic to big hotels then you might prefer to stay elsewhere, but frankly the pay off in terms of facilities is worth having (and note there is an excellent colour coded lift system which means you never wait more than half a minute for the lift - unlike some large hotels!). Also internet access was at typical (i.e expensive) hotel rates - but there is a great internet cafe right outside the door (Yonge St Entrance) - CAN $3 an hour! However, perhaps the greatest 'lure', especially for UK travellers, is the price of this hotel. I paid just \u00c2\u00a342 per night for the room (which could have easily taken two adults and two kids) booking with 'Globespan' in the UK. It goes up a bit in summer, but is still great value for a city centre hotel!

It was my fiance's second stay in Toronto and my first. I picked this hotel through some internet research and found the price formidable especially for a downtown location. Everyone knows that hotels charge an arm and a leg for a stay in any downtown room so the price I found on the internet was great! It was a rate of approximately $109.00 CND; considering that I am from the US, the price was cool! We got there early, about 11 am, so from working at a hotel myself, I didn't expect the room to be ready until after 3pm anyway. They had it ready at 1pm so no complaints there. Speaking of complaints, it seems that some people just can't stay anywhere without saying something bad about something. The pool area was great! It was heated which was great! The room was clean which was great! The service was fast which was great! I've never seen a housekeeping staff make sure that you don't want service because they didn't want to leave until they were sure you had all your stuff which was great! The front desk staff was great! The concierge was great! The atmosphere was great! (Could come off that $22 a night parking fee, though.) I mean, when you are out of town on pleasure, do you really expect to stay in the hotel room long enough to inspect the individual carpet fibers? Let\"s be real! We walked to almost everywhere we went. It's near shopping and dining and smack dab in the middle of a wondeful city and it's downtown area. Some people complained about prices going up: it's called inflation. Expect it wherever you go!

It's been years but we were always satisfied before. Well, things change..... When booking, we requested an early check-in as we were contemplating attending the Saturday game as well as Sunday. Early check-ins are not guaranteed and we understand this completely. Upon arrival, the lobby was an absolute zoo. The crowd was huge and, to make matters worse, they had set up activities to keep the hundreds of children occupied i.e face painting, an annoying \"Lost in Space\" throw back of a robot (which tried to engage my husband in amusing banter as he waited in long lines - not appreciated), free popcorn (half of which ended up on the floor), etc...I don't understand why they had to turn the lobby into a carnival when they knew it was going to be busy. Why can't children occupy themselves and/or their parents keep an eye on them?? This is a very nice lobby which I would have prefered to relax in as I waited two hours for my room. Instead, it was turned into Romper Room for the afternoon. The desk staff asked for customer patience and understanding due to how busy they were because of the game. Well, I am courteous and understanding but management knew they were going to have a full house that evening (over 1500 rooms occupied) and that people would all want to check-in prior to the game so let's schedule every front desk person and housekeeper we have in order to make that happen, OK. We completed initial check in, in which we were told we could upgrade for extra $$ to a room we had initally reserved anyway, which we declined, politely mentioning the word \"scam\" to them and then one similar magically appeared afterall. Go figure. We were told to return at 3:00 PM. We left, had lunch and returned at 3:00 PM. The room is still not ready. Waited until 3:30 PM and, now with no chance to make it to the game even if we wanted too, husband went up to the desk and requested compensation of some kind for the delay. At 4:00, our room was ready and we had free breakfast for both mornings. Although slow and begging for mercy, the front desk staff were friendly and willing to compensate and long as you were courteous in return. This is good business I guess but let's avoid the situation to begin with. The room was small but cozy, decorated quite nicely. Bathroom was equipped with nice amenties and ample fluffy towels but the floor was filthy and the ceiling moldy. Very small TV. Nice but worn furnishing. A small dirty door led out to a very cramped balcony with no chairs. You wouldn't want to sit out there anyway; bird droppings and pieces of rusty old wire (?). I felt like I needed a shot after I came back in from there!!! Ice was a mile down the hall; good exercise I guess. Hooray!!! An adult only pool area on the 27th floor. First, we ventured down to the Family Fun area as we heard they had a new water slide and we wanted to check that out. Upon entering, I discovered the zoo had moved from the lobby to this pool area! This is a great place for families but it was loud and crowded so no slide for us. The adult only area is quite nice and clean. The fitness area is connected but not separated so all this great equipment is in a very hot area. I found it difficult to use the treadmill. The pool was clean and refreshing; the hot tub was perfect tempature but very heavily clorinated. The view from this area was great. It's open till midnight. Don't try to utilize the deck area for a little private champagne drinking late at night; pool attendant is right there to inform you of the rules, which, by the way, were posted but we felt a little sneaky. No problem. We were quite understanding. Our breakfasts were very good. Nice outside dining area off The Market Place. a rather rude cashier gal Sat. morning though..... We found the staff in general to be helpful - answering questions, giving directions, providing free newspapers. Scam in lobby - a professional gal sitting at a desk offering your visitor tax refund right there. After she processes the paperwork, you're informed of a huge surcharge!! She lies and tells us there are surcharges if you stop at he bridge on the way back. We travel to Canada quite a bit and this is not true. Now, for those who don't want ot stop on the way back, this is a convenience and be my guest but he fact that here is no indication of a surcharge on her signs AND the representative flat out lies to you, this is not appropriate so we went right to the front desk and spoke to management. They informed us that she is not affiliated with the hotel; well, that should also probably be on one her signs. Front desk staff did confront the girl along with us and she promptly cancelled our paperwork, assuring us we would have no problem at the bridge refund place....and we did not. We confronted her about her statement reagrding the surcharge at the bridge and she was somewhat silent. We informed the hotel staff that, although not affiliated with the hotel, it is in fact a reflection of the Delta Chelsea if you allow \"businesses\" like this (misleading tourists) in your lobby. Goodness sake, they have large signs on the doors of the hotel leading out to Yonge Street that indicate ricshaw drivers/service are not affiliated with the Delta Chelsea \"assume own risk....\" but it's OK for a scam to go on right in the lobby?!?!? When I think of all the unknowing tourist in and out of that hotel who fell for that......ugh! So, that was our recent experience at the Delta Chelsea. Be prepared, be alert. It's a nice hotel that eludes class, it just falls short in some key areas and requests your understanding. I guess I'm just not in the mood to \"understand\" when I'm paying high prices to stay in what I expect to be a classy place. I shouldn't have to think twice when I'm trying to enjoy a getaway weekend and certainly should not have to tolerate that many ups and downs, right?", "Date": "August 31, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2351488", "Content": "Stayed at the Delta Chelsea one night this past weekend. The room was very small but the rate was very fair for the hotel's location. It's within walking distance of Eaton Centre, lots of other shops, restaurants, theaters, etc. The food was very overpriced for what we got, I thought. Overall though, it was a real nice visit. Loved Toronto. I agree with others posters who mention that the hotel needs some updating. The balcony was very dirty, the windows were dirty, didn't really entice you to step outside.", "Date": "August 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cUsually a reasonable value\u201d", "Author": "farrelli", "ReviewID": "UR2312242", "Content": "Have stayed there many times but often consider changing. It's usually a fair value for the price. The rooms are sometimes bad but they'll move you to an OK one. Ask to be put in the newer wing.

Delta Chelsea is a quality hotel, nice rooms (But small...), quick checkin-checkout, nice location in downtown Toronto but charging way too much compare to the real 4-5 stars hotel in downtown TO. This is a 3 star hotel, no more. Room Rate are about 25% too high, they charge only 22$ a night for parking(!!!!!!!!!) when they advertise 7$ outside in order to trick you. Food is way too much for what you get. A croissant, milk and yogourt for only 10$(!!!). For the same room rate, I'd rather stay in a nicer hotel for if the city is sold out, you will still be ok if you don't mind paying 22$ for parking.
