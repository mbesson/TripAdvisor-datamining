The service on the beach doesn\u9e93t exist and please, don\u9e93t order anything to eat...you can wait more than 45 minuts !!Anyway, the hotel has a good location. You can find good restaurants next to the hotel ( Casa Luna and La Scala ). There is a shuttle to Bali Connection ( commercial area ). Don\u9e93t buy the souvenirs in the street, in Bali Connection you can find everything and with very good prices !", "Date": "Aug 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR666543102", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Gtibcn"}, {"Content": "Simply Stunning We just spent 6 nights at this hotel and found everything impeccable. The hotel itself is only about a year old, they have 3 levels of rooms, we took the mid level, one bedroom with adjoining loungeroom, 2 bathrooms, 2 airconditioners. They made up the sofa bed for my daughter. They could not do enough for you, from the cleaning of the room, to dropping you back to the airport for your flight home (free of charge). Rooms were immaculately cleaned, everything replenished every day, even leaves flying into the pool on a windy day, were retrieved immediately. Beatifull breakfast buffet, they made pancakes for my daughter on request. Had a few spa treatments in the indoor/outdoor treatment rooms. Plenty of good priced restaurants outside the hotel, plenty taxis if you want to go to Kuta (20 minutes and about AUS$6). Our intention was to hire a car, but there are way too many motorbikes and no-one follows any road rules, so easier to cab it. Only negaitve that i can think of would be they needed a person at breakfast continually checking for coffee/tea refills, and pancakes added to the menu. Be careful if you are changing money nearby, we experienced a con trick that the locals have perfected. When u want to exchange money they only give you the currency in small notes, so you have to count and re-count the money, with sleight of hand they managed to trick us out of 500,000 (approx $60) when i was changing $200, its easy to do as the exchange rate is $8750 rupea to $1. When we realised the hotel insisted that we go back with their security guard to recover the money, which we did.", "Date": "Jul 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR594797337", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jeannaSydney"}, {"Content": "Vastly overpriced with poor service and modest rooms Our travel agent really messed this one up. Bali Khama is located at the northern end of Nusa Dua which is not the nicer end. The staff are clueless. They are clueless relative to the staff of better and more inexpensive hotels like the Conrad.Most of the other guests are Russian. The place was mostly empty. They would not allow for a late check out beyond 2pm even tho the hotel was empty.Rooms are ok, but nothing special. The real crime was the price. We paid nearly $400 for what was called a villa, but was nothing more than a big room with a large outdoor bathtub they called a pool. Better hotel rooms can be had at half the price in Bali.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR217071890", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "CrispyCrispy"}, {"Content": "A very good choice! The Bali Khama Beach Resort  Spa is a new addition to the Nusa Dua area of Bali. It opened in the Spring of 2007 and is undergoing a soft opening until Spring 2008. The hotel is excellent, the staff well-trained, and the setting is superb. Booked via wotif.com (highly recommended) and got a rate of $120 per night. The room was very spacious with all of the expected amenities. The pool was large and situated directly on the beach front. The hotel is not actually in Nusa Dua but is only a kilometer or two from the main area. There are plenty of shops and dining options right outside of the hotel. We found the Bali Khama to be an excellent choice for a relaxing vacation.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR904513383", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "64Jag"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1191333-d676898-r19712955-The_Bali_Khama_Beach_Resort_Spa-Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "676898", "Price": "$369"}}
