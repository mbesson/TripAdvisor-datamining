A small, boutique feel along with the Four Seasons brand of quality and service combine and the result is a property that provides an island of serenity and comfort in the middle of the bustling of one of the great crossroad cities in the world. The layout is an old prison, but you have to wildly stretch the imagination to conjure up any of that past. Highlights include having a drink on the rooftop terrace, the Bosphorous behind you and the Hagia Sofia right in front of you. You can feel the history and commerce all around you. The staff is meticulous, and beyond what you can experience at other five star hotels, it almost feels like each of the staff are hosting you in their own place. That feeling is helped by the small size, with less than 70 rooms. The courtyard is a flowered garden to rest and recharge.

At dinner in the restaurant (which is pricey but great food), our meal was finished with a beautiful birthday cake; all of course, very discreetly done. It is these personal touches that makes the Four Seasons worth it. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms quiet and comfortable; the service, as other reviews indicate, unsurpassed. Turkish people overall are so hospitable; one evening we were trying to locate an out of the way restaurant, and rather than get a taxi, the doorman, who was leaving for the day, drove us on his way home! At that same restaurant, the waiter, who spoke only limited English, was charming and attentive and ensured that we knew how to navigate back to the hotel. Istanbul itself is an unforgettable city. The historic and cultural sites are not to be missed and the Four Seasons is in a perfect location for sightseeing. We walked almost everywhere, and were happy to come back and relax in our suite, where we found daily treats at teatime. Overall, there is a warmth and appreciation for visitors in Istanbul that we have not found in other cities.

The adventure began with our arrival at Ataturk Airport where we wisely opted to have the hotel send a car for us, and were met by a most welcoming \"greeter\" who assisted us to the BMW and our driver Ertan. Along the way he graciously gave us a mini tour and answered so many of our questions. As a fine example of the generosity of the impeccable staff, Ertan later guided us to the Whirling Dervish show after he got off of his shift at the hotel. Who does that? I'll tell you who, every team member of the hotel! They become your friends, assisting you with every phase of your trip to Istanbul. Upon entering the flowerful foyer, we were met by Mehmet Nacar, the front desk mgr. who had arranged all of our reservations for restaurants and tours on typed cards in our room (see photo). The hotel itself is full of Ottoman charm, with delicious warm colors throughout and speckled with mounted Turkish tiles along the graceful hallways (see photos). As you enter your room through the large wood doors you find a plush space, our was overlooking the gardens and breakfast area. The bathroom is huge, furnished with tub and separate shower after which you can sink into the luxurious Turkish towels and robes. Five times a day the call to prayer seeps into the window and you know that you are in an exotic land, with a rich culture and great history. In order to facilitate and maximize our time we hired a private guide for 2 days, Seda Karaca came highly recommended and she was a find. The hotel knew her, the shops in the Spice Market and Grand Bazaar knew her, everyone knew her. She accelerated our visits to the sights with no waiting in line. Her tour of the Topkapi Palace was fascinating and detailed. She was a great sport and a lot of fun so try to plan ahead and book her through the hotel concierge. I cannot express to you how helpful the Concierge and reservations dept. were in plannning this holiday. Their attention to detail and professionalism is unmatched. When you book, take advantage of their aid as that is in itself part of the draw to this crown jewel in the Four Seasons realm. Book a breakfast inclusive pkj. and you will enjoy a full buffet with not only American eggs and meat dishes, but an array of breads, olives, honeys, 10 types of cheese, and homemade preserves (try the pomegranate jelly!). I was so impressed one morning when Farkan took the time to explain the origins of the honeycomb hanging on wood stretchers, it was another example of how the hotel is managed and run. And who is at the helm of this amazing oasis? It is FELIX MURILLO, the General Mgr. Twice during our stay we crossed paths. First when he made it a point to introduce himself to us and then upon our departure, as we were leaving for further travels, we saw him again. The goodbye from this kind, generous, and special group of the Four Seasons family was so touching. Mr. Murillo has refined the art of hotel management and I cannot express to any potential visitor to Istanbul that this is THE place to stay when visiting. P.S. Thanks for the birthday cake!

The location of this hotel could not be better for seeing the sights in the old city. Everything is within walking distance. The staff were extremely friendly, the facilities were very nice. Overall, I think this is a beautiful hotel with very good service, but we left feeling like there were opportunities the hotel didn't take to make this a luxurious experience so associated with the Four Seasons brand. Our room was a very nice hotel room, but... it seemed very dark and a little small. When we checked in we were given an opportunity to upgrade our room for another 75 euro per night. We didn't plan on spending a ton of time in the room, and we've never had a bad room at the Four Seasons before, so we declined. I might have reconsidered after spending two nights at this location. The rooms on the first floor are partially underground, so the windows are small. The draperies are nice, but block out more of the light, and they seem a little \"cavish\". The bathrooms, could not be more spectacular though and we always love the amenities: robes, slippers, high end soaps and lotions. Our first night, the thermostat in our room broke and we woke up at midnight in a sweat. We called the front desk and they sent someone down to fix things. For thirty minutes the staff were in our room with a ladder, crawling around the ceiling and fiddling with things. They fixed the air conditioning, and about an hour later around 1:00 a.m. our room had cooled off to the point we could fall asleep again. The next morning no mention was made of the incident, although in fairness the front desk did call us the next evening to ask about our room. The bed was ok, but not really special. No pillow top. No memory foam. No adjustable anything. It seemed like a standard, medium grade, king size mattress. Again, not bad, but not on par with previous experience at the Four Seasons (not extensive - we don't stay at the Four Seasons all the time). I informed the hotel ahead of time that we were traveling to Istanbul to celebrate our 10th anniversary, and I asked the hotel if they had recommendations for things I could do to mark the occasion. The concierge emailed me a list of recommended restaurants and other activities that was very helpful, although after I arrived the hotel made no mention of our anniversary. Again, I would never expect this from any other hotel, but prior experience has proven that the Four Seasons generally goes out of their way to \"personalize\" your experience. We weren't expecting them to give us anything, but I thought it would have been nice for the hotel to offer to make a reservation in their restaurant, offer us a time for a couple's massage at the spa, or included something in the personalized note in our room. We did not eat dinner at the restaurant, but breakfast both mornings was perfect! We went to the restaurant one evening for dessert and the attendant asked us if we could please sit in a lounge area outside the restaurant. Again, we didn't mind; the lounge area was very nice, but it just seemed like a lapse in attention to service that I found surprising. I suppose if I had insisted on being sat inside the restaurant they would have relented. If you stay here, you'll have a very nice stay. The location alone makes this hotel worth more. The staff were almost all incredibly polite and happy. We had a wonderful time. However, if you're expecting the over-the-top service and luxurious attention to detail that we have found at other Four Seasons properties, you may leave just a little... blah. I would not hesitate to stay at the Four Seasons Bosphorous hotel. I'm willing to give this hotel the benefit of the doubt.

Dinner in the main restaurant, again it was just lovely, I recommend the sole. Although I must admit, I would have liked more meat dishes.

Location in Istanbul is unbeatable. Attentive and detail oriented staff and management left us a very strong impression of this hotel. We were greeted with smiles right at the very first step to the moment you turned around the corner of the street leaving the hotel. You were addressed by our names at all times. Food was a delightful and reasonable prices for its class. Never realized that lamb can be done and presented in such a way that it looked more like a piece of dessert! It was our residence of choice during our stay in Istanbul while we were also popping in and out as we were also taking short trips to Cappadoica and Pamukale. Each time we wwnt back to this hotel, we felt relieved knowing that we would go back to a very comfortable place to rest and relax. Basically, at the end of each short trip away from Istanbul we were looking forward to going back to Four Seasons Sultanahmet. We had three different rooms. We were absolutely satisfied with anyone of them and all of them. Four Seasons is always our first choice of accommodation around the world such as Singapore, Japan, Maldives, Paris, Hong Kong, etc. I can't say all of them we'd been to are as good as our experience at this Four Seasons Sultanahmet. We do have a preference of contemporary design interior so our absolute favorite of Four Seasons is Four Seasons Marunochi in Tokyo, Japan where we stayed twice. This Four Seasons Sultanahmet is among the top three hotels of all the hotels we have stayed before over hundreds of cities we'd been to in terms of location, hardware and software. For sure, it is one of those that we will go back for our next visit in Istanbul. I can never rate excellent for sleep quality as it will only be for my bed at home!

The hotel is very well-located for sight-seeing, especially if you have limited time in Istanbul--all of the major sites are within 5-10 minutes walking distance. The hotel is pretty and the service is what you would expect from a Four Seasons--we were pleased with the two restaurants that they recommended for dinner. We ate breakfast and one lunch at the hotel restaurant and both were quite good. The room, however, was clean but not at all memorable. It was very hot, but the A/C never got quite cool enough. Our room was on the ground floor and thus had no view and was fairly dark. The decor wasn't offensive, but again, was not memorable. Overall, for the amount of money we spent, I felt that the hotel was VERY overpriced. We had a drink at the Four Seasons on the Bosophorous, which was much prettier.

The hotel was a stones throw away from the Blue Mosque and other major tourist attractions. It was a pleasure coming back to the comforts of our room after a long day of walking. If we had more time, I would've spent more time enjoying the hotel's amenitities. We didn't make it to the restaurant or up to the roof. The concierges were extremely helpful as were the bellmen. I jokingly wrote on the feedback sheet that I was aghast that I had to open the front door for myself three times. We stayed there three nights, so of course I was joking. There was always an employee around to greet us, tell us good night, and generally make us feel welcome. A couple things to keep in mind when booking this Four Seasons as opposed to the one on the Bosphorous. The spa is much smaller and lacks the same services offered at the Bosphorous location. We had an early flight into Istanbul, so we arrived at the hotel much earlier than check-in. Our room wasn't ready, so they gave us a list of things we could do, one of them being a service in the spa at a discount. After spending two full days walking around in Athens, I was dying for a mani/pedi. Unfortunately, we were told that this location didn't offer that service. The Bosphorous is about a 20 minute cab drive, which after a morning full of travelling, the last thing we wanted to do was hop in a cab and drive across town. We left Athens during the taxi strike, and had an early flight to Istanbul, so we had to take the first train to the airport from our Athens hotel. Needless to say, we were extremely tired when we got to the hotel. They did refer us to a closer nail salon, but couldn't guaruntee the cleanliness of the service, so I passed, and after taking an extra long lunch, we just loitered in the business center until our room was ready. Also, they told us they would call us if the room was ready early, which it was. However, my husband had to go the front desk and inquire about the status for them to tell us the room was ready. Finally, this was the only hotel during our whole trip where we had to pay for internet access. With the amount we paid nightly to stay here, the very least they could do is offer free wifi. We once stayed at a cheap Extended Stay after a flood in our home, and even they offered free wifi. Even the cafes nearby offered free wifi. It seems ridicoulous that we spent close to $50 for three days of wifi. Those were my only issues with our stay. In the grand scheme of things, they seem small.

Firstly, as others have said the location was just phenomenal. We had two rooms on the fourth floor, both with terraces on opposite sides of a hallway. Although the doors were literally across the hall from one another the two views couldn't have been more different. One terrace had a spectacular view of the Hagia Sophia the other of the Blue Mosque. Being able to see these buildings so close at various times of the day (sunrise, evening, etc.) was a treat. The staff at the Four Seasons were amazing. I still have no idea how the remember the name of every guest but being greeted by name enhanced the intimate feel of the property. Service was impeccable at the restaurant and the spa. Our children were delighted that the hotel greeted them with a number of gifts laid out in their room upon arrival....a Turkey t-shirt, puzzles, local souvenirs. Although there isn't a proper spa at the hotel we did enjoy the signature massage.....a great way to relax after a long trip. If you do stay here you really should go to Ayasofya Haman....it's just been renovated and is the most luxurious haman in Istanbul....and it is literally 50 yards from the hotel. We were a bit apprehensive about going at first because we had no idea what to expect but the experience was extraordinary. Men and women have different entrances and completely different (but comparable) facilities. We selected the VIP treatment which included the traditional bath, soap massage, mud bath and oil massage. The experience felt other-worldly and helped connect to the Turkish culture. There was a point where I was sitting in this amazing marble bath hall all alone, sitting on a steaming marble bench with a platter of fresh fruit in front of me....and your realize how the sultans must have lived. You are assigned your own masseuse who walks you through every step of the 2-hour process which makes the experience very comfortable. In any event this is a special hotel that shouldn't be missed. We've stayed at many Four Seasons properties and this was one of our favorites because it incorporates so much of the character and personality of it's local environment....in the architecture, the service, the cuisine, the people....just amazing.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel...great staff great location!!\u201d", "Author": "Kickstart1", "ReviewID": "UR115864977", "Content": "Amazing hotel and staff....

We were both a bit apprehensive about this as we usually spend our vacation time away from major cities but our anxiety was gone from the moment we landed. We had arranged for an airport transfer through the Four Seasons and were met outside our plane's gate on arrival by a Four Seasons representative who took our bags and whisked us off to the visa counter in a motorized cart. Once there, we breezed through the visa counter in minutes and were eacorted to our car which took us to the Four Seasons. We also used the private transfer for our trip back to the airport (from the FS Bosphorus) and, while it is a bit pricey ($200 euro), we were glad that we did. Again, a FS representative met us curbside and, after taking our bags and passports, quickly checked us in for our flight before escorting us to the secuirty gate. Attention was paid to each and every detail to ensure that our airport passage went as smooth as possible. This was a pleasant and welcome surprise to us in an unfamiliar airport in a foreign land. Being delayed due to a missed connection in London, we didn't arrive at the hotel until 11pm that night, but were quickly shown to our room and given several suggestions as to where we might find a bite to eat (hotel restaurants were closed for the night). Walking a short distance on the cobblestone streets, we found a great little spot for a nice meal and some relaxation after a long trip. The following morning, before breakfast, we arranged to have a private guide take us for a half day tour to familiarize ourselves with the city. The guide took us on a walking tour of Sultanahmet and its amazing sites, including The Blue Mosque, Haghia Sophia, The Hippodrome, Basilica Cistern, and The Grand Bazaar. The guide was very informative and gave us a good idea as to the layout of the surrounding area. If we had any complaint, it was that the guide took us to several stops along the way where we could browse the local shops. While this was something that we were interested in, we couldn't help but get the feeling that we were brought to places where our guide was getting \"kickbacks\" for taking us to these vendors (a bit of an annoyance but certainly not something to ruin the day). Either way, the guide was invaluable for giving us a lay of the land and, after parting ways, we were able to reasonably make our way around that part of the city on our own. As for the hotel itself, what amazed us most was the close proximity of everything to the FS. Any of the major sites were within easy walking distance of the hotel and the rooftop deck offered magnificent views at night of both the Haghia Sophia and The Blue Mosque. The Haghia Sophia seemed to be within arm's reach from the rooftop deck. Simply amazing. We were not only pleased with the beauty of the hotel, but the staff couldn't have been more pleasant and accommodating. On NYE, my wife had a mishap that resulted in her hairbrush getting caught in her hair (don't ask!). The concierge not only made sure that our dinner reservation (off the premises) was pushed back multiple times, but also that a hairdresser was found within 15 minutes and brought to our room to assist her.

Have always heard good things about both the Four Seasons in Istanbul so thought we would spend the first three nights in Sultanhamet and the last three nights at the Bosphorus location. Definately not disappointed in planning the trip this way. I travelled with a friend from home as well as another friend came over from Saudi to join us for our first three days in Istanbul. Chose Sultanhamet as the first legs as it seemed to be in the most historical section of Istanbul with the Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosques, Bazaars, cisterns, Topkepi Palace, etc.... all within walking distance of the hotel. Most foreigners want to see these sights so figured best to stay near them at first as oppossed to travelling to them from the Bosphorus FS location. We also chose the Four Seasons as the last time I was in Turkey over 18 years ago, my hotel had a shared squatters toilet and none of us wanted to risk having that on this trip! We used a regular taxi from the International arrivals section of the Ataturk airport. There is a taxi greeter at the exit door who explains to the taxi drivers which hotel you are staying at and also will advice you how much the rate to the hotel will be! The rate on the meter was under 35 TL so with tip it was still a very good price. I know the hotel offers a pick-up service for over 100 Euro but if you can handle not being transferred in a MB you will do just fine by taxi! Once at the hotel we were greeted with the best service and attention to detail. Our friend had checked into our room early and fortunately we were upgraded from a Deluxe room to a Premier room. Seeing the three of us shared a room we had a fold-away bed which my friend said was as comfortable as any bed she ever slept in before. The bed was in the corner of the room which still gave us more than enough room in the lounge area. Our corner room had four very large windows in the main area (with automatic blinds) plus a large window in the washroom. We had a partial view of the Hagia Sofia, best seen from the bathroom. Our room was beside the newly excavated area that may or may not be the site for future expansion of the hotel. That area could also be part of the archeological park beside the Hagia Sofia. Also there was a venting stack outside of our room but all in all we were happy for the upgrade to a larger room with decent views as oppossed to a smaller room with amazing views. The room has all the amenities one would expect although I was disappointed that there was no coffee/tea/expresso maker in the room. I didn't see any info in the hotel guide either about complimentary coffee delivery to the room either which would have been a nice touch. They do have coffee, fruit and a very small pastry plate set up in the lobby and in the gym (basement a tthe far end of the hotel) in the morning but again it is not in your room so you have to get dressed to go get it yourself. We didn't eat at this property as we wanted to experience all things Turkish and we just felt the Four Seasons food would have been for more of a Westerners taste! As for attention to details, the individual hand written welcome cards were a nice touch. Remember all three names on the phone and in person also made us feel like they appreciated our business. The turn down service and room cleaning were excellent as well! Also my friend asked at the concierge for the direction to the nearest pharmacy so she could go out and buy some hair dye. The concierge simply asked for the brand and number and offered to go pick it up for her! I also had difficulty using the ATM at this and the Bosphorus location of the FS and an employee was passing by and heard that the ATM would not accept my card so the employee told me to come to the desk and they will advance me money on the room to accomodate my needs. I have never experienced that before. Nice added touches! Definately go to the top floor of this hotel and find the large and small public terraces that afford great views of the Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Sultanhamet region, into the archeological park and out to the Sea of Marmara. Solovely to find on our first morning at the hotel! The one big drawback to this property was the lack of a pool. The hotel did have a nice gym and in the mens room there was a steambath but a pool would have been lovely. On the plus side one can use the pool at the Bosphorus location although the two hotels are far enough away from each other that it would be an inconvenience just to go for a swim. Having stayed at both hotels though, the Sultanhamet location, being a converted Turkish prison is by far more unique and architectually splendid than the Bosphorus location. Pluses on both sides but this local definately has more charm, character and attentive staff! The Sultanhamet location also made you feel like you were in Istanbul and not say at a FS in Chicago! The Bosphorus location, although beatifully situated on the historic body of water did feel more generic than this Sultanahmet location!", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Location, Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JMNN", "ReviewID": "UR88215694", "Content": "Traveled with another couple.

Sultanahmet is the \"old town\" of Istanbul and most of the historical sights are great to explore from this location. Everything is geared towards the tour industry around this area, so for more authentic life of locals, the Bosphorus property and the Asian side of Istanbul is more desireable. The best part of the hotel is of course the famous Four Seasons service. No complaints here. The staff are reliable and courteous. The food is excellent. The airport transfer is fantastic, and gave us a great introduction to the city. The hotel is gorgeous albeit a little limited by being in an existing historical building. The ceilings in the rooms are very high, but strangely oppressive. The proportion of the room just didn't feel cozy and relaxing. If you get a room which is directly above the ballroom, be prepared. It didn't bother us too much, but we did notice the thumping at nights. The next street over is full of hostels, so it is a bit of a strange experience transitioning from a luxury property on one end of the street to a lot of backpackers on the other end. Another highlight is the hotel recommended personal tours. We were curious to see the difference between having our own tour guide versus being part of a larger bus tour (besides the price), so we signed up for a personal tour guide for 8 hours for our first day there. Lucky for us, we got Seda! She really set the bar for us and made our trip very enjoyable. Seda is very enthusiastic and easy-going, and her demeanor reminds us of a Turkish Kate Winslet. Having Seda as our guide is more like hanging out with a good local friend who happens to be very knowledgeable. We didn't realize how great that was until when we went to some places on our own and had to get in line for everything. Apparently with a tour guide you are allowed to bypass all the lines! She customized our day according to our \"level\" (including a fantastic lunch recommendation), and was very efficient with our time.

I can relax now!\" We had the king deluxe room on the 2nd floor and the high ceilings gave a sense of a bigger room than it probably was.

But after a couple of days we thought that a a bit of Four Seasons class would go down well. We had midday tea/coffee at the Sultanahmet and it was as fabulous as one would expect. So dinner reservation made - well it was a straight choice between fish under the Galata bridge, at not a lot, or a plush Four Seasons dinner at a price we'd be embarrassed to admit to. Started well with Gin and Tonics on the rooftop terrace, but when we moved down to the courtyard restaurant things deteriorated. Menu was very bland and difficult to find anything that grabbed us. We eventually decided upon various starters and all four of us ordered lamb as a main course. Service was poor - I was missing a starter knife, and ate my complementary amuse-bouche with the main course knife, which then sat there dirty while they cleared away, and all through the starter course. During the starters we had to ask for wine to be poured as they didn't seem too interested, and we were gasping. Then they cleared away three sets of starter plates while my wife was still eating. All poor, but not terrible? Well when the lamb arrived the waiter asked if he could open our red - great, but 10 minutes later still not there,and lamb half eaten (not a good move). Again we had to ask for the wine But the lamb itself was a disgrace. 60 Lire (\u00c2\u00a330) for lamb is not cheap, and for that I expect interesting flavours and textures, well cooked. Instead we had three v small medallions of lamb, tough as old boot, not cooked as ordered (my rare was so over-cooked I could hardly cut it. No vegetables whatsoever, no jus or sauce or gravy or anything, just three dried leather medallions and three figs.

Despite having stayed at numerous 5* hotels around the world this was our first stay at a Four Seasons hotel. This Four Seasons property is based in an old prison right next to some of the oldest attractions in Istanbul, including the Blue Mosque and Agia Sofia the latter of which is truly astounding given its age and is an absolute must see. Our room was spacious and equipped with everything you would expect. The bathroom was also large with an oversized shower, and a smallish but well shaped bath which sat under the window. The bathroom was equipped with wonderful L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Occitane toiletries, and soft heavyweight towel and robes. In short it had everything you could ever need. The bed was dressed with top quality cotton linen, perfectly fluffed pillows, and a duvet that was just so. The decor is traditional in style, but faultlessly executed. The windows are double sealed, and triple glazed, so that you do not have to enjoy the early morning call to prayer from the myriad of mosques if that is not your thing. Four Seasons have a reputation for superb service levels, and our experience bears this out. From check in to check out we were made to feel like we were genuinely important, and as if the staff genuinely wanted us to enjoy our stay. On arrival we were offered an upgrade to a Four Seasons Suite room that was heavily discounted from the EUR2500 rack rate. We decided against it (mainly on cost grounds) but the suite certainly appeared to be more of the same, but with a separate lounge and a balcony. There is no swimming pool here but there is a well equipped gym. The restaurant is situated in the courtyard in the centre of the hotel and is an oasis of calm amid the madness of the old city. The breakfast buffet is highly recommended (although pricey) and the quality of food that we experienced for lunch very good - particularly the olive oil which was served with bread which was possibly the nicest we have ever had.. Wine is very expensive in Istanbul so prepare to get your credit card battered. Sarafin is a local Turkish wine and really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad, although still in excess of \u00c2\u00a340 a bottle. Reservations at a local restaurant (Balakei Sabahamin - recommended for a fun atmosphere, ok food, and only 5 minutes walk from the hotel) were handled without fuss, and a confirmation sent to our room. My wife forgot her hairbrush. I called the concierge to explain, and to ask if he could send a comb up. 15 minutes later there was a knock on the door and my wife was presented with a tray of at least a dozen different (brand new) hairbrushes that they had been out and bought. Wow. If you want a central hotel, peerless service, a wonderfully aesthetic exterior, with perfect execution of more, or less, anything then you should stay at the Four Seasons Sultanahmet. If you were being picky the decor cold do with a being a little more bold, and EUR20 for 24 hour internet access in this day and age really is outrageous (although you can get free Istanbul Wifi if you position your laptop carefully).", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salisbury, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect afternoon tea at Four Seasons Hotel Sultanahmet\u201d", "Author": "steviecee", "ReviewID": "UR60749865", "Content": "My wife and I had the perfect afternoon tea here, with Turkish champagne.

So if location is important to you - this hotel cannot be rivaled. I did not see a single hotel -- of any quality -- closer to the sites than the Four Seasons. I would say the hotel courtyard restaurant is nothing special, particularly compared to the many cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood. So, by all means, have breakfast at the hotel, but be more adventurous for lunch and dinner. Don't get me wrong -- dinner was good there -- but I would try other places. The great thing about the Four Seasons? You can just rock up and they handle everything from posting letters, getting you a great tour guide, or changing currency. The Four Seasons Sultanahmet was just like other Four Seasons in this respect. Here's a tip: Do not use the hotel's airport shuttle. It was crazily over-priced. I recall it was 90 euros - one way! I used \"Backpackers Travel Agency\" and it was 35 euros round trip. And that was for a Mercedes van with fruit juice offered. The driver met us inside the airport, etc. - it was perfect, reliable service at a fraction of the hotel's price. And one last note: I read many off-putting things about Istanbul such as how much of a hassle the airport is. Ignore it all. The airport was modern and easy to deal with.

The hotel itself is a stylish renovation of an old jail with rooms around a central courtyard where the only restaurant is located. As you would expect from 4 Seasons, decor is to a high standard, though we did feel like declining the offered upgrade as the offered room on the lower ground floor (think legs outside the window) was dark and uninspiring. Still, given that we rarely stay in the room during hours of light, we accepted. Staff, and in particular the concierge, very helpful and knowledgeable. For us, downside would have to be the restaurant. Breakfast was OK, but our needs here are always simple. We tried lunch one day, quite bland and so-so quality. The space is darkened and candle-lit for dinner, but you really cannot hide the fact it is more coffee shop than restaurant. Food at dinner better than lunch, but there are better places to eat around town so my advice would be \"call the taxi\". The bar was disappointing in terms of atmosphere, best idea is cocktails on the roof garden, though the call to prayers from nearby speakers can drown out conversation for a while, but that's all part of the city.

We didn't have time to eat anything at all the whole day. We had only Turkish tea and bottled water so we were very hungry by the time we ordered our food which was around at 4 pm. I couldn't finish my pide which was very salty, tasted her caeser salad but didn't like the cream sauce so I left the meal half hungry. My friend's hunger got better of her so she finished all her pizza and salad. After the meal we went back to our meetings. A couple of hours later my friend complained that the food was too heavy and she could not digest it. Around 8.30-9 pm she started feeling not well. We hurried back to the hotel. By 10 pm she was seriously sick in the toilet throwing up and having diarrhea. Because I had experienced food poisoning before, I knew that she needed to remain hydrated and wait until the poison left her system. Going to a hospital while she could not really leave the toilet didn't feel logical. Her situation improved by the next morning and she managed to retain some water. The fact that we both did not eat anything at all that day, and 4 hours after consuming the salad creme she got sick confirmed my suspicions that she had typical dairy food poisoning. We ended up missing our early flight to Izmir and delayed our meetings. The next day we called the hotel to complain. All the staff including the hotel manager was very unhelpful. At first he claimed that it might be our own personal hygene. The hotel's doctor wanted us to go to a hospital and get some tests done which we did not have the time or the energy to do at all. The kitchen manager who was very arrogant insisted that since their kitchen is checked and certified it cannot be their fault. I felt like we were being told off by every one we spoke to. We managed to get a half hearted apology and reimburstmant of the meal; however they refused to compensate us for our plane tickets that we had to buy for the 2nd time because of this unpleasant incident. The kitchen manager gave me her email adress to follow up and seemed happy to have ended the conversation when we could no longer talk to her because we needed to make our way to the airport. We could not follow up this incident after coming back to our countries. My friend had to deal with her sick parents and I got busy with my own life.

We spent five nights in one of the suites (separate sitting and bedroom, plus a small half bath off the seating area, in addition to the spacious bathroom attached to the bedroom).

Some of the guest rooms have impressive views of the Ayah Sophia and/or Blue Mosque\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6worth looking into if you enjoy having a view. Wifi is available in the rooms at a surprisingly hefty cost, but free in the lobby and business center.

After that, we tried restaurants both close by and a cab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drive away. Given the heavy traffic from 6 to 9 in the evening, my recommendation would be to limit your restaurant choices to those within walking distance from the hotel.

The rooms are large and extremely comfortable and the bathrooms are GORGEOUS. Although I love this hotel, at the considerable price I have some reservations. The breakfasts are amazingly overpriced and its better to get them included in the room price or eat out - there is a roof top terrace restaurant across the road with great views. The lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room is noticeable, and there were only 2 computers in the business centre, one which didn't work for the time I was there. The main problem though is the lack of any real turkish feeling about the hotel - it is modern 5 star bland when it could have been absolutely breathtaking with a bit more courage. It has modern paintings of Isnik tiles rather than the real deal, and could be a luxury hotel any where in the world.This is a shame as the hotel is an original building and prides itself on its architectural origins.The lack of a pool is also disappointing but I understand there is one planned above the extensive archaeological excavations of the Bucholeon palace adjacent , when they are finished.

The location could not be more central, with all the 'old town' sights such as the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topikia Palace, Hippodrome, Cisterns, Grand Bazaar, Spice market all within easy walking distance.

You can walk for hours in the district that is so historic and full of local colur. I cannot comment on the restaurant or bar, as we had so many options around the hotel, we didn't eat there at all. The staff are exceptionaly well trained, and anticipated our every need. Very helpful and genuinely friendly without being in your face.

The room had all the luxuries you would expect, ( 3 Plasma TV's and DVD's, large soaking tub with views of the sea, exquisite linens and down duvet and oversized pilows, rainforest shower), but we appreciated the Bose iPod docking station the most. The staff were very willing to share thier local knowledge, of where to go and what and when to see, and this also helped us miss the crowds and find those rare and special places.

And ofcourse it is surrounded by the magical part of Istanbul. The hotel also upgraded us from the Four Seasons room to a higher class which we greatly appreciated but once we got into the rooms it was not something one hasnt seen in much cheaper hotels, While I agree the hotel must have certain limitations in terms of Architecture being an old building it still does not have the passion that one finds in few other boutique hotles (Devi Garh India) comes to mind. Everything about the place feels a little very professional which is not a bad thing but I believe a hotel of this kind could do with a little more ... But maybe the target audience prefer this way of life? I also had a problem with the dining as there was only one restaurant and my Wife being a Vegetarian had little to choose from and ended up eating only salads thanks to a great manager at the restaurant.

The old prison, and yes there's no question we'd love to be imprisoned there. So close to the Blue Mosque and Agia Sophia etc. Best tip - wander out at night when the crowds have gone to view the buildings from outside in the twilight/dark - the majesty blew me away much more than during the bustling daytime. The roads are cobbled so wear high heels with caution, but it's still possible. We stayed in a 4 seasons room (120) which was a lovely haven - faces the outside garden, not the courtyard. The construction of the extension woke us up every morning, not ideal but didn't start til approx 9am so actually it gets you up in time for brakfast which is a very adequate buffet most days. Bathroom very good, Occitane products. Fresh fruit and water daily. Red wine in the minibar was badly corked, they replaced it, didn't charge us for it and sent us a cheese plate. Housekeeping and room service excellent, as expected at these prices. I happened to be in the room, a staff member came in to change the ice, asked me how I was - said slight cough so he brought me apple tea and an extra box of tissues. Restaurant was standard western client stuff - for me a bit dull tasting, no adventure and fairly highly priced, however reliable and it is peaceful which is something that one comes to appreciate in this bustling place. Bar is fine, good staff. Only complaint really would be the concierge desk. Sent 2 emails regarding arranging an airport transfer - no reply (even though the booking confirmation asked if we wanted transfer info sending) but in fact all you need to do is jump in a taxi at the airport, cost approx 30 lira. Even worse they recommended a restaurant specifically with a Bosphorus View, took one hour to drive there in a taxi (traffic is heavy but part of the scene) and when we arrived there was no reservation. We were given a terrible table where the waiters bumped into my husband, and we couldn't even see the Bosphorus! The food was minimal but worse, supposedly fresh sea bass which wasn't at all fresh. Always suspicious when you place an order and it arrives within minutes, as it's obviously been cooked and lined up for unsuspecting tourists. \u00c2\u00a3100 bill for poor food and experience - avoid the Park Fora - you have been warned. Unfortunately we did tell the concierge but they didn't take it seriously, and I suspect they'll recommend this restaurant to you. The Sabbatin fish restaurant 5 minutes walk from the hotel (in the guides) serves much better fresh fish, it's slightly frenetic ,but honest and the red mullet was memorable. Best restaurants seen to be outside Sultanamet. Develi do good kebabs (and I'm usually not a big fan) and they also have non-smoking which is a touch unusual here! My second tip is if you're a wine drinker, drink local wine, better wines are absolutely fine and compliment the food, as foreign wine has hefty taxes attached. Gym in the hotel was actually very enjoyable for us so we went daily - good equipment - 3 lifefitness treadmills and a cross trainer, plus bike machines, weights etc with TV screens. Small but not many people go there. Friendly gym staff. Shame no pool but I think hamams are the thing in Istanbul not swimming. Saunas in the changing rooms.

Consider that there are many things to spend your money on in Istanbul, yet in my view, few will provide the same value as a night's stay at the Four Seasons, Sultanahmet. True, this is an expensive hotel, but you get a lot for your money. All the previous posts about the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luxuries and services are 100% true, so no need to repeat here. There's something about the Turkish culture that lends itself to producing incredibly friendly, helpful staff. The Four Seasons around the world have the same training and management philosophies, but I have a hunch the secret ingredient here is the Turkish people (the staff) that puts this location at the top of ratings lists. I thought the second most impressive aspect of the hotel is its tasteful integration within the old city part of town. It just fits comfortably within its surroundings. Not ostentatious. So, in contrast to the farcically over-priced tourist-related places, restaurants, taxis, shops etc (as compared to other big cities and relative quality expectations), we did feel the Four Season provided a good value. (Other than this hotel, I felt my 20 dollar haircut and shave provided that next best value!) The public transportation system is a great option to taxis, as the tram system is very user friendly, as are the ferries to the Asian side and the underground funicular to Taksim. People are very helpful if you have questions. I suppose there are good buys on carpets and other high end goods, but my advice would be stay away unless you really know your stuff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they'll eat you alive there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6especially the typically timid American. Definitely haggle on your souvenir shopping and you can do OK. Do take note of just how many carpets and other high end goods are for sale everywhere and consider the \"sales effort\" that goes into the process. Like me, you may find it odd to observe so few high-end goods really being purchased yet so much being offered.

I was greeted by the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uniformed greeter and he quickly filled me in on some quick facts regarding Istanbul while at the same time asking for the car to be brought up. The ride was about 30 minutes to the airport and although driving in Istanbul is rather more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thrilling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than your average US city it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely up to par with places like Rome and most of Eastern Europe so it was nothing new to me specially since I have actually driven in Rome for a few days. I was greeted at the hotel entrance by a multitude of people who all called me by my last name, just like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known me for years. Check -in, Check-out: Probably one of the quickest I ever experienced. All the paperwork was done in the car during the trip from the airport (another advantage of the hotel transfer) so by the time I was met by the check-in supervisor at the lobby there was little to do except heading to my room while he explained to me a few pointers regarding the hotel and locations of different amenities. I had booked a Four Seasons Executive Suite but they had upgraded me to a One Bedroom Suite which is a bit more roomy and they also really wanted to try and get me in to the Presidential Suite for half the rack rate or about USD 1500/night which I declined cause simply the One Bedroom was overly big enough for me. Check-out took a bit longer cause they were having issues with their system, although the reception staff probably appologized 4 times in 5 minutes despite the fact I assured them it was just fine and I completely understood problems do happen. Location: This place is right in the heart of the old city. Basically expect a lot of commotion during the day with a lot of taxis and tour buses going through the nearby streets, however don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be afraid of the noise! This hotel is surprisingly quiet and except for the prayer calls from the nearby mosques you can hardly ever hear anything. Special note regarding prayer calls, yes they are LOUD during the day but fortunately our Turkish hosts turn down the volume during the morning call which is around 5:30 AM or so. I never really woke up by the sound in the morning and I could hardly imagine anyone would and if you do, just chalk it up as a part of the whole Turkish experience! Again watch out for cars and buses as you will have to share the streets with them as sidewalks are uneven and narrow not to mention they just simply end at some points in the middle of the road! Food & Drinks: Bottled water is provided everyday (at least in my suite, not sure of the regular rooms). The food at the restaurant was good but not really exceptional. Service at the restaurant was very nice and quick although it seemed like they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153acting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at some points and weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really fluid but still I say it was good. You could actually forget where you were for a second of two, so I give it zero points on originality which again is expected and not a negative but just to inform you. Room Service food was OK, again nothing superbly tasteful but very well presented nontheless. My biggest issue was with the lounge! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decorated really rather untaistful and to top it I had a martini served to me in a whisky glass cause they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any martini glasses! No garnish no nothing! I say this was probably the worst martini I ever had so avoid the over priced bar/lounge and head to so many better ones in the town. Cleanliness: This hotel is very well maintained. My suite was spotless! The housekeeping staff meticulously cleaned my messy suite everyday never missing anything. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a germ freak and I can tell you this was by far the cleanest Four Seasons I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in! I actually left a very small tip everyday for the housekeeping staff for such a superb job they did everyday. Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s common areas also follow on the same footsteps. There is always one or two people cleaning something somewhere, always moving immediately out of the way before you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve even approached them in the hallway, then continuing when you move past. Service: Last but not least is of course service. The Turks are generally a very friendly and happy nation and the staff in Four Seasons Sultanahmet are not any different, if not more exceptional! I received probably the most friendly and professional service I have ever received so far at any property be it Four Seasons or not. These guys are really over the top even for a Four Seasons! Aside from pretty much everyone calling you by name, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the general attitude of the staff that makes the difference. Somehow everyone here seems to be genuinely happy to be here and to be of any assistance to you! They make you feel as if they are your family. The concierge team handled every interaction with utmost friendliness and professionalism. I booked two restaurants through them and both turned out to be superb choices. Four Seasons name carries a weight in Istanbul, the two extremely busy restaurants I visited both gave me their best tables despite me booking just few hours earlier and despite being almost a full house! Concierge also gave me good directions to a few shops I needed to check out as well as handled a few itiniary changes again with professionalism and efficiency. Doormen are also particularly friendly here always watching out for you making sure you know where the directions and offering you umbrellas before you even realize it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raining! Verdict: This hotel delivers top value for the $. I see a lot of complaints about how expensive this hotel is, but I remind you all some things you can never buy. This hotel provides beyond what you can simply buy.

Our trip started off with a few monkey wrenches as they say as the flight left without us and of course, lost luggage. Once we arrived at the hotel, everything was PERFECT!! From the doorman to the front desk employees, we were greeted like they had known us for many years with a warm, \"Welcome Home.\" The font desk employees asked us about our trip and we advised them of the lost luggage situation. One of them then asked if we had received some information regarding that. I gave him the paperwork and he made a copy. He advised us that they were going to take care of the situation. (the next morning, we were told that the suitcase had been located and we would have it by the afternoon ) They then asked what size of clothes both of us wear and they came out with 2- beatiful bags filled with all the toiletries imaginable to carry us through the night. It even included underclothes that were very confortable and socks to keep our feet warm. That was definetly what I believe to be \"over and above\" They make you feel like you are the only guests in their hotel. They would greet us by our names and were always showing that personal attention. There was also another incident that I must tell you. One night we went to a restaurant across the street and there was a little shop nearby and the gentleman in the store had a coin collection from coins all over the world. I looked through and noticed he did not have a lot of the new American coins. (the ones with the states) We finished there, went back to the room and I decided to take him some coins I had. Everyone from my party was tired so I decided to go by myself. It was late and when I walked out, the doorman noticed I was alone. He followed me to the store, waited and escorted me back to the hotel. He went that \"extra mile\" If you want luxury and personal attention and are going to Istanbul, the Four Seasons is definitetly the place to stay.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, UK", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "luxurybackpacker", "ReviewID": "UR7975482", "Content": "Our recent short break to Istanbul was fabulous in every way.

Use the ferries to get across to the modern side of town where the best restaurants are and make time for the Bosphorus scenic cruise - the waterways are a great place to be in the heat - 36C there last week so would not want to travel here in July or August. The only thing missing at the Four Seasons is a pool, and we could have used a couple of hours on a lounger and a dip at the end of each day.

Despite being in a busy and noisy part of town, the hotel manages to convey the serenity of a private garden, even if its history as a former prison may give some guests a few chilling fanasies. The service is impeccable, the rooms are well-appointed, and the garden dining area is lovely. However, it IS expensive for Turkey, and the meals are overpriced when you can simply go around the corner and order a meal for a third of the cost. Although its restaurant is said to be one of the best in the neighborhood, I found the food to be only moderately good -- certainly not on a level of a great New York restaurant. This is not the place for a budget traveler. And I suspect that after one has been to Istanbul a few times, the crazy activity of the Sultanahmet neighborhood with all its tour buses and aggressive carpet salesmen may get old.

What we weren't expecting was what we got: a room with 3 different views. Located on the top floor, room 323 is a spacious executive suite, with a separate living room, bedroom, and a very large bathroom. Two windows faced Aya Sofia, reminding you that Istanbul was right outside waiting for you. From another part of the living room we could see the hotel courtyard and garden, a relaxing view if a little unnatural in its extreme neatness. The bedroom and the bathroom looked out onto the Bosphorous, and I can't imagine why anyone would have watched TV in the bathroom when you could take a bath while looking out onto the sea. The service was faultless. Knowing the brand, you come to a Four Seasons hotel expecting a certain kind of service, and still they manage to surprise you: book markers that suddently appear on top of books you leave lying around, a surprise birthday cake delivered to the room on the special day, a huge DVD library to choose from, an ice bucket that is never empty... the hotel is really a haven of peace in a beautiful but chaotic city. If I had to fault anything, it would be the restaurant. We had dinner there one evening, when we were too tired to go out, and everything was correct but never special. The dishes on the menu were perhaps a bit too creative for the cooking behind them, so the menu might have benefitted from some simpler but well-executed alternatives. But then again, if you think about it as a hotel restaurant, it is fine. Breakfast fared better than dinner, but compared to the breakfasts at other Four Seasons hotels I've stayed in, I'd rate it a little bit lower. It was good and not as expensive as other hotel breakfasts out there ($29), but not spectacular. For anyone having trouble deciding between the Four Seasons and the Ciragan Palace, as we did, here's my take on the two places: choose the Four Seasons if you want to get to know the city of Istanbul, and the Ciragan if you want a relaxing vacation on the Bosphorous and aren't expecting to go out much. The Ciragan has a pool and an enviable view, but is it desperately in the middle of nowhere and not well communicated with the rest of the city, as access is through a small coastal road (think lots of noise, think lots of traffic, and you'll be thinking in the right direction). The same will apply to the new resort that Four Seasons is opening on the Bosphorous in a few months, since it is located right next to the Ciragan Kempinski. The current Four Seasons, on the other hand, is in a beautiful part of Sultanahment and well positioned for exploring the city. Even in June it was very hot in Istanbul, however, so we did miss having a pool in the hotel. Just something to keep in mind. As a side note, when we made the reservation the hotel recommended booking transportation from the airport with them. We chose not to book their $110 limo service and took a cab instead ($20-25).

The Four Seasons Istanbul is possibly the finest hotel in the world! We checked in with three other couples. When the receptionist checked us in, she let us know in a most discrete manner that we had been upgraded to a corner suite (Room 214). The room was superb - extremely large, high ceilings and perfectly appointed. There were four enormous windows in the room with a view of Aga Sophia (which was even better if you went out on the window ledge!). The bathroom had both a tub and stall shower with a separate toilet room with window. The bathroom amenities were very high quality and abundant. There was also a small screen TV in the bathroom. (That TV complemented the 42\" plasma TV in the bedroom/sitting room area). We had a separate entrance foyer with bar area and two enormous closets. We had let the hotel know that we were on our honeymoon, and when we returned to our suite the first evening, they had strewn rose petals all over the bed and bathtub, had a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us, heart shaped candles waiting to be lit, and a tray of strawberries and apricots with various dipping sauces. That was simply over the top! What we liked most about the hotel were the quality of the service, the setting of the hotel, the calm ambience within its walls and the beauty of the flowers and interior courtyard. It was truly an oasis in the midst of the hustle of Istanbul. We were treated superbly by every single staff member. The concierge recommended perfect restaurants close by. We did not eat at the hotel since we prefer to sample local cuisine. We found the perfect pastry shop called Cigdem on the street with the trolley tracks just about across from McDonalds. On the Monday morning we were there, all of the locals were lined up to buy pastries which simply reinforced the fact that we had chosen the right place. We loved the Turks, Istanbul and the Four Seasons and would return in a heartbeat. The hotel is expensive ($650 a night), but I felt it was worth every cent we paid. I've paid higher prices in other 5 star hotels and never felt that I got what I paid for.

It is the only luxury hotel near the major sites (Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace, Aya Sofia). Add to that being in a historical building (former political prison), perfect discreet service, immaculately clean rooms with the best of everything, and you have what must be one of the very best hotels in the world. Even at $700-$800 /night, I felt it was well worth the money to stay in and near the very best of Istanbul. As a former political prison, the walls and rooms of the common areas are definitely solid and rather heavy. The photos on the Four Seasons web site makes it look \"lighter\" when in actuality everything is quite \"heavy\" looking. The mixture of Oriental and European influences is accurate however, giving an exotic air. We tried for a standard or superior room, but there were none available. I checked at the hotel and it appears there are only four (4) standard rooms, so definitely book early if you want those. I ended up reserving a Deluxe room for four nights upon entry to Istanbul (the majority of the rooms are \"Deluxe\"), and then a Four Seasons Room for a two nights before leaving Turkey. Both rooms were equally great, but the Four Seasons Room was HUGE. Based on its location surrounded by other buildings, the best views are of the inner courtyard garden and restaurant, NOT of the outside. The beds, well, I never knew beds could be that comfortable or linens that crisp. Bathrooms are expansive light marble with a touch of \"byzantine\" mosaic blue-green glass tiles. There is a separate shower and tub, and separate toilet room. All bathrooms will have hand-made kilim area rugs. The 44\" flat panel televisions are almost too large for the regular rooms. There is a small wall tv in the bathroom. Bottled mineral water is provided gratis. For the Four Seasons Room, add a large sitting area and gee-whiz gadgetry like electronic shades. I've read complaints about the proximity to the Blue Mosque and the first call to prayer in the AM. We could hardly hear it from our room, certainly not enough to wake us from slumber. The windows have triple panes. Perhaps the rooms in the front of the hotel facing forward may have more of an issue, but this is a guess. At $35 each, the American Breakfast is a bit steep, but is great comfort food (eggs, coffee, fresh oj, potatoes, muffins and danish, fruit, pork BACON) instead of the standard Turkish breakfast (cheese, raw cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, hard boiled eggs, bologna, toast). There are also less expensive ala carte selections. Dinner was good but not worth the price, eat out instead. The Four Seasons has purchased adjacent properties and are currently expanding the hotel, so WARNING: If you face the back of the hotel, you will probably hear construction noise, sometimes as late as 8PM or 9PM, including weekends. The hotel concierge booked us a private guide over two days. Compared to other guides we had in Turkey, we were disappointed to get a \"by the book\" guide that had nothing extra to say. Generally, we were not satisfied with the recommendations for shops or restaurants by the concierge, although their actual service was prompt and professional. The Four Seasons is building a \"sister\" property directly on the Bosphorus, you may want to check to see if it is open when you go. For tourists, I still think this hotel has the better location.", "Date": "May 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cA Hotel Fit for a Sultan!\u201d", "Author": "kingsroadgal", "ReviewID": "UR7414019", "Content": "We were really wowed by this hotel. I had a bit of a rough start with the hotel, because they asked me several times to reconfirm our reservation for some reason, and would not give us any guarantee of connecting rooms, or even rooms close to each other - we had booked two rooms for five nights. We needn't have worried. We were assigned rooms at the end of the hall facing each other. They upgraded one of our rooms to a suite, although frankly, our other room, a Four Seasons room, was absolutely fabulous on its own, and could have easily accomodated the four of us, if a little snugly. I actually thought it was a suite, as it had a very substantial sitting area with couch and chairs. The Executive Suite was also beautiful with separate living room and bedroom, long hallway, and large bathroom with upgraded toiletries (Bulgari - regular rooms have l'Occitane) The good points of the hotel are many. Location is absolutely the top one to have in Istanbul. You can really walk to most major tourist attractions. And I agree with a previous review that there is little reason to cross the Golden Horn. Everything you need is in Sultanahmet, unless you are really staying for an extended period. Food at the hotel is great. Room service breakfast includes a toaster which is brought to your room so you can have hot toast. I also loved their waffles. Lattes were served absolutely hot. Dinner at the hotel was also some of the best food we had in Istanbul (especially the \"smashed salad\", which was something like gazpacho). Great and varied bread was served. On our second visit to the restaurant, we were surprised to see no baklava on the menu after we had had it the night before. We ordered another dessert. The waiter, however, noting our preference, made the effort to find some baklava, and served it to us as a complimentary after dessert treat. There were also some petit fours served with coffee after dinner. The service was attentive. The hotel has a very nice gym which is well equipped and convenient, although it closed at 10 p.m. The gym at the Tokyo Four Seasons is open 24 hours. One fun amenity is the delivery each afternoon or evening of a delicious treat to the room. For my children, this treat was kid-friendly, such as cookies with chocolate sauce for dipping. For us, the treats consisted of petit fours, cookies, and the like. It was a nice extra. There was always plenty of bottled water provided in the room since the tap water in Istanbul is to be avoided. We did, however, brush our teeth with the tap water a couple of times without any ill effect. I can hardly think of anything bad to say about this hotel. It is super pricey, but I think we felt that we really received value for money. The only thing that even crossed my mind as being a negative was that the water pressure in the shower seemed a little low to me, although they did have those large 12\" shower heads. Oh, and for light sleepers, the first call to prayer from the Blue Mosque is audible in some of the rooms at 5:30 a.m. We managed to sleep through it most of the time, but light sleepers might want to take note. Did I mention the beautiful gardens surrounding the restaurant? I could go on forever about all the great features of this hotel. I would absolutely return to this fabulous place.

The blend of east and west is beyond compare, and I can't imagine my stay being nearly what it was if I had stayed elsewhere in Istanbul. I arrived on a 10 hour non-stop flight from New York, so I booked the hotel car. I was a little weary because it cost $135, but figured it'd be better than hassling with a taxi driver who may not speak that much English. As soon as I stepped through customs, a man in a four seasons suit with a sign greeted me. While I stepped away to the Citibank ATM in the lobby of the airport, he made a quick phone call. By the time I had made it back from the ATM, the hotel's BMW 7 series had come from around the corner and my bags were packed. The man who met me wasn't the driver, and he disappeared back into the airport - without the slightest hesitation in a way that would make it seem like he wanted a tip. On the way in the car, the driver had me fill out the normal info you'd do upon check-in. He also pointed out some of the main sights. Upon arriving at the hotel, I was greeted by name. The concierge informed me that the final inspection of my room was taking place (I arrived early in the morning way before check-in). He offered me some complimentary tea in the beautiful lobby. 5 minutes later my key was brought to me. By the time I arrived in my room, my luggage had arrived. Again, not one employee in any way signaled for a tip. The room itself is the Four Seasons as its finest. There was a Bose CD player, a dvd player, and 46\" plasma tv in the room (i booked the standard room). The bathroom was one of the largest standard room FS bathrooms I've seen, with a separate shower, toilet, and bathtub. There's also a TV in the bathroom. I have to admit - the concept of a hotel in a former prison made me think that the FS would have to sacrifice some on amenities. But somehow they made it work. The decor is the regular four seasons classic, with a great Turkish flair. I really believe that the concierges at fine hotels can make or break your stay. They lead you to the sights and the best restaurants, and give you the best advice. Here, the concierges didn't fail. Burak (one of the concierges) was one of the best I've come across. His recommendations for restaurants hit the spot perfectly - for both seafood and traditional turkish. The rest of the staff, too, was amazing. Everyone remembered my name. They remembered only after one day in the restaurant that I'm allergic to milk and so brought soy milk with my coffee. They remembered that I don't like the chocolate cookies that they serve with the tea (so i'd get two sugar cookies instead). The doormen remembered where the taxi took me in the morning, and would ask me how it was. Finally - the location. You can't beat it. The hotel is literally wedged between the 3 main sights - the Hagia Sofia, the Blue Mosque, and the Topkapi Palace. The Grand Bazaar is only a 10 minute walk away. I only crossed to the part of town called Beyoglu once (which is where most of the other grand hotels are). If you're going to splurge once in life, spend at least a night here. And a little hint - if you do stay, some taxi drivers don't speak very good english or know where the hotel is, so tell them you're going to the Hagia Sofia and then you just walk the last 50 meters from there.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel in the World\u201d", "Author": "travelerLasVegas", "ReviewID": "UR6940174", "Content": "We knew there are many luxury hotels in Istanbul like Ciragan palce, swiss hotel or the Hyatt and the Ritz but we choose this one, some of our friends told us about it and they were right, we are from Las Vegas and we have seen many nice ones but with everything combine this was truly the best, we love it so much l wanted to write a rewiew which l never do, so there, expensive but worth every dollar.how ever we will try the Ciragan Palace next time we had a dinner there it looks fantastick.", "Date": "March 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWonderful & Fabulous\u201d", "Author": "cxgarcia", "ReviewID": "UR5526600", "Content": "From the moment we were greeted at the airport by a Four Seasons staff member, we knew we were in for an amazing experience.
