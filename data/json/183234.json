The front office staff were excellent and got us into our room quite early (0900 check-in). The rooms were clean although our room was extremely small. As we were traveling with family we were able to see another of the queen room which was considerably bigger than ours and I'm sure would comfortably accommodate a couple. Simon (our self confessed \"super sexe\" bartender) was excellent and managed the after hockey beer fueled crowd extremely well. He was quick with a laugh & a beer and made us feel very welcomed to Montreal and the hotel. The Cora's restaurant and foyer gift shop were both convenient when we needed a quick breakfast or souvenirs. The hotel is apparently under refurbishment and whilst we obviously had an older room we didn't notice any noise from the work. The only gripe would be the lack of house keeping as we didn't have our room attended to in two days.

As we were in Montreal for a relaxing sight-seeing weekend, we didn't require anything more than a clean, quiet place to sleep the night. As many other travellers mention, on most counts this is a great hotel. The staff were extremely friendly, and usually helpful (e.g. answered all our questions regarding the city, came to troubleshoot our wireless reception problems etc). Room service was fine, and did not have any trouble coming in late to clean. Our room (single queen) was clean, had many great perks (wireless internet that worked most of the time, complete set of toiletries, nice furniture, coffee maker in room, iron, hairdryer, etc). The location is also great & safe (a slightly sketchy side-street, but only a few meters from the central street of Montreal). The room was a little smaller than other hotels, but very comfortable. Unfortunately, when selecting this hotel, we ignored comments from other travelers regarding the noise level in this hotel; this was a mistake. The walls in the hotel are rice-paper thin; at night we could hear every single sound from adjoining rooms, as if it were happening right next to us , from chairs creaking, and people holding whispered discussions, to laughing companies of undergrads returning from their nighttime revelries at 5am, having a good time in their rooms. Note that, at most times, guests at the hotel were not being unreasonably loud; however, the lack of sound-proofing made their everyday noises a serious impediment to a good night's sleep. Needless to say, we didn't manage to get much sleep. We were also quite dismayed when, after bringing the problem to the staff's attention, they were unable to provide us with earplugs (or offer any other solution, for that matter), and suggested we try a local pharmacy (albeit very politely). Other - very minor- issues we had: The bed was incredibly squeaky (even slight motions would result in loud squeaks); the guest directory in the room was a bit outdated (it stated that the hotel sells stamps, while it does not); the alley close to the hotel smells foul, and twice we saw drunk/homeless people using it as a toilet. In summary, this is a great place if you don't intend to sleep much (e.g. if you are a young adult traveling to Montreal for wild nightlife), or are able to sleep regardless of the noise.

I was expecting a little bit more from a Best Western...! I stayed in many (sometimes categorized as lower quality tan Best Western) hotel chains (i.e, Super 8, Comfort Inn etc...) and had a much better experience than Best Western Europa. Notes: - The hotel has no dedicated parking. You have to use public parking nearby. As we were staying during a weekend, no problem for available space, but I suspect that during business hours, it would be a challenge to find parking with nearby public parking. - Our room (second floor) had a Queen bed. The room was extremely small. The bathroom was very, very small. The toilet is facing the bathtub (with only 4 inches clearance. Tall person have to sit sideway. TV was LCD and our room had a new A/C Unit. No fridge in the room. We ask for a fridge, but none available. - Wireless Internet is available and free. However, it wasn't working in our room. We called the front desk and were referred to call a 1-800 # just to be told that the \"Internet Server\" was down and no ETA available. I was surprised to see that the Front Desk staff would not \"handle the issue\" as this was a \"hotel internet problem\" but referred their guests to liaise with a support agency...! - The room adjacent to ours, had their alarm clock set (buzzer making loud noise) with no one in the room. We reported it to the Front Desk (in the morning) and were told that someone would go to \"turn it off\", but at night it was still buzzing (more than 10 hrs later), we had to report it again and it was turned off approx 2 hours later. Needless to say I have seen much better staff response/service with similar issue at other hotel in the past...! - Our mattress had seen much bettter days. We kept rolling in the center of it as the bed was quite old. In conclusion: In my previous stay in Montreal, we stayed at the Omni Mont-Royal (on Sherbrooke Street) and for almost the same price ($20.00 difference per night) we had a much better experience.

I was provided with everything I needed such as the standard soap, shampoo and clean towels.

We had a breakfast at the Cora, and it was very satisfying. I highly recommend!! They do have a fitness center along with their new Spa facility. PARKING: There is a public, paid parking lot across from the hotel and it was $20 for 24hours. It's an outdoor parking, but it was safe enough. GETTING AROUND: After getting some informations from the front desk(they are very helpful), we immediately went out to take the Metro to get to the Old City. Metro was $2.75 per person, one way. We had to transfer to another train after 3 stops, but it was very easy to transfer once you follow the signs. I think it took us less than 20min to get to the old city area by Metro. It was a good experience. SHOPPING: When I asked the front desk staff the hours for the underground shopping, he said 9am-9pm. But I guess that was only during the weekdays?? We were there on saturday and all the shops were closed by 6pm.

I did that at the end of July 2007 seeing that one of the four people couldn't attend do to personal circumstances. Instead of keeping the two rooms I thought that I changed it to one room instead of the two rooms. I guess that once you book a room with the Best Western at the 800# you can't change the reservation that it says you can in your email to confirm the reservation (so many days in advance). Totally disgusted by that part. Well, we arrived on Friday August 10, 2007 and they didn't have the one room that I thought was changed. They had the two rooms instead, the original reservation for $119.00 a night, at a total rate of $418.98 a piece. I was totally dissatisfied from my arrival. The rooms are on the very small side and if someone is walking around the bed from the window where the desk is someone had better sit down to let the person go by, because there just isn't enough room for two people to go by each other at all. Dissatisfied! The parking for the Best Western is across the street for $20 a day in a open parking lot (I checked on my car the entire time because nobody was at the lot watching the cars). Especially when they aren't responsible for what happens to your vehicle. Then on Friday August 10, 2007 (sometime after our arrival) we were sent a notice under both of our doors that we would be getting the breakfast in the morning from 6:30am-11:00am for the following morning. Well, when we got there on Saturday August 11, 2007 we were told that we didn't pay for the breakfast with the room. How much does a person have to pay extra to get a complientary breakfast in Montreal with the room? In the United States it comes with the room last time I checked in the area that I live in and a much nicer breakfast from what I was told by my daughter. What I saw at the breakfast wasn't something that I would ever pay for while traveling in my life. We all were disgusted by this and we moved to a wonderful place Chez Cora on Rue Stanley were they serve wonderful breakfast at wonderful prices. If you go try the strawberry/banana smoothie as it comes with a strawberry and grapes for $3.25. We ate there every morning during our stay. Sunday August 12, 2007 we started having a problem with our toilet in one of the rooms as it wouldn't flush. It didn't flush the rest of the time while we were there. Also, during the whole stay we all had a hard time getting water to flow alot and didn't have much hot water so to speak of, totally disgusted with the room and the price that I paid. When I checked out the Best Western Downtown Europa online at the beginning of the year 2007 I thought that they had a pool, they don't have a pool at all. Would of liked to have a pool after walking around seeing the sights all day while we were there. I guess they only have a fitness center and spa. After all the walking that you do why do you need to go to the fitness center at the Best Western?

This was the second time I have stayed here and I will say that I wasn't disappointed. We paid under $100 (U.S.) per night for the room and it was everything I expected. I didn't go in expecting the Ritz Carlton and was quite happy with everything. I have added photos of our room to this review. I, unfortunately, forgot to take pictures of the parking lot and the outside of the hotel. I had planned to take those shots, but forgot. Before getting to my pros and cons, I'll go through a couple of things. The desk people and housekeeping staff were considerate and friendly. They were also very helpful when needed and always welcomed you when coming back into the hotel. The interior is interesting and clean. I didn't check out any of the restaurants or bar in the hotel -- or any other the other hotel amenities -- so I can't comment on those. I have pretty easy standards when it comes to hotels and traveling: price, cleanliness, location and safety. I'm not looking for all the bells and whistles some people look for when traveling. Taking all those into consideration, the Best Western was a great place to be at. So first, I'll go to the pros. PROS - The room was extremely clean when we first arrived. Each day the room was cleaned and shaped up. The staff was quick and courteous when dealing with this. - The beds were comfortable and there were more than enough sheets and pillows on each bed (we had a double room). - The TV was decent sized (25-27 inch or so) and worked well. We didn't use it much, but it was nice to have when needed. - Free wireless Internet access. Very easy to connect to and quite speedy. It was nice to be able to check my email and not have to dial up somewhere. - The water in the shower was powerful enough for me. I like it when there is actually water pressure. In this situation, I wasn't disappointed. - The location for the hotel is perfect. Situated on Drummond, you are steps from St. Catharine St., and two blocks from Crescent St. The whole area is perfect. It's also a very safe area. - In regard to safety, the hotel has a system set up where you have to use your key card to enter the hotel after a certain time as well as needing said card to access the elevator after a certain time. In five nights in Montreal, I also never had any problems with my key cards. - I can't reiterate how nice and helpful the staff was. We didn't utilize them often, but with checking in, checking out and the few questions we asked, they were always professional and smiling. You can't ask for much more than that. - Just a couple blocks from a metro station (Peel), which is even better. MIDDLE GROUND (Not a con for me, but might be for others). - Room size. It's small, so don't let anyone kid you differently. You can see in my photos that the room is tight. But it's to be expected. I've stayed in probably 8-9 different hotels in my travels to Montreal and not many have huge rooms. Not in this price range, anyway. For two people traveling and probably even three -- this wouldn't be bad. We had a king room a couple years ago and had 4-5 people and it wasn't bad. But the double we were in isn't made for many more than 2-3 people. I could see where a family would have a hard time with it. But, if you don't expect to spend much time there, it's not bad. - Parking. The lot is across the street and independently owned. It's $20 (Can) per night. They jam a lot of cars in the lot. There is also a parking lot about 3 buildings down from the hotel. These lots are a little shabby, but did the job for me. There always seemed to be someone on duty, which was nice. My car was perfect when we left and nothing had happened. Seemed fine to me, but I know a lot of people are worried about the lot. - The air conditioner. This kind of goes as a pro and con for me. The pro part was that it worked well. The con part is when you put the shade over the window at the night, it kind of covered it, so by morning, the AC wasn't flowing as well and it was warmer in the room. - Elevators. There are two of them and they are each pretty small. Didn't bother me because we were never trying to cram in with a ton of others, but I could see where if people were staying longer and had a lot more luggage, it could be hard to use these. CONS The only reason I couldn't give the hotel a 5-star rating was that there were a couple things I would consider cons. Now mind you, I gave this place a 4, but it was actually like a 4.5. - Bathroom size. I like a bigger bathroom. I hate having to feel cramped when I'm getting out of the shower. I felt that way here. I was out of the shower and right in front of the toilet and sink. It was too crammed for my liking. - Windows. There was one window in the main room and one in the bathroom (although the glass they used for the one in the bathroom wouldn't allow you to look out, it was more to allow light in). The window wasn't too big and it was partially taken up by the AC unit. I just like natural light, so an extra or bigger window would have been nice. - Electric outlets. There weren't enough of them near the chairs/table, allowing two people to plug laptops in, as well as keeping a lamp and the TV plugged in. They were too spread out and in spots where they were only good for like charging camera batteries or a cell phone. Wasn't too bad, but could be a little annoying. OVERVIEW The positives of this hotel far outweighed the negatives. While we had some cons with our stay, they weren't enough to make us sour on the hotel. It was a pleasant stay and well worth the money. We stayed for five nights and each was fine. Checking in and checking out were both easy and painless. The room was ready when we arrived and everyone was friendly. I'd stay here again and would highly recommend others to stay here.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peak District National Park, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExactly what I wanted\u201d", "Author": "BigDave", "ReviewID": "UR5316014", "Content": "I stayed at the BW Europa in May 2006.

Only at the rear where there is an open car park and a view onto Crescent would I think there might be some noise. The shower worked well. Breakfast was from 6 am to 11 with an attentive and helpful waiter offering a wide variety of breakfast items. The restaurant was closed on Sunday night but there are plenty of places to eat on Crescent. I would change one thing and put a bigger shelf in the bathroom if I were going to share the room.

I was carrying 2 suitcases and a laptop and he claimed there was no room for him to check them somewhere for me so that I could at least go find something to eat while waiting for my room. Luckily some extremely nice travellers from BC overheard my predicament and offered to keep my bags in THEIR room. Came back to the hotel at 6pm, as told, and finally my room was available, 3 hours after the 3pm check-in. Went upstairs, the key doesn't work. Went downstairs for re-coding. Back upstairs, key doesn't work again. Back downstairs for re-coding. Once I finally got in my room, to my utter non-surprise, the Europa drops the ball AGAIN. They gave me the most filthy, disgusting smoking room I've ever been in - browned wallpaper, film on the windows and cigarette burns on the bedspread. The smell was absolutely putrid (my brief time in this room had smelled up my clothes so badly that I had to have them cleaned the next day). Furious, I returned to the front desk and demanded the room I reserved. Luckily there had been a shift change and the useless front desk manager had been replaced by a lovely young woman who was gracious, apologetic and very understanding. She booked me into a suite with a king bed for my trouble. The room was acceptable, but dated and like the rest of the hotel, appeared cheap and dirty. There was a huge soaker tub in the bathroom which was its only redeeming quality. Given the overall shabby appearance of the hotel, my experience and the way I was treated, I will never stay here again. I wrote a 3-page complaint letter to Best Western head office once my trip was complete and they were at least nice enough to offer up a written apology for my negative experience. FYI, there is no parking available here, just a paid lot across the street. As well, all the windows in the rooms are sealed shut, so there is no way you can get fresh air into the room to at least chase some of the musty smell away. Do yourself a favour - spend an extra couple of bucks and go somewhere else. The price of this place is definitely appealing, but I learned the hard way that you get what you pay for.", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "miami, fl.", "Title": "\u201cFor those in need of a suite\u201d", "Author": "mabellaMiami_Fl_", "ReviewID": "UR3994835", "Content": "We were able to find two rooms available at this hotel on a weekend with several conferences in town.

We had 2 very large rooms, 4!!!! bathrooms (1 with a whirlpool tub) a full eat in kitchen, very large living room, washer & dryer & the absolute best part was a large private tarrace with BBQ. This suite was very convinient as we were two families with 3 infants, & they were able to run around all over. Now, for the negatives, While we thought this was a good deal for us, at the price we paid, we were told the running rate is apx. $1000.00 per night. At 1000.00 per night I would be very disapointed. The kitchen wasn't well stocked,( as to the basics, i.e., soap, paper towels, dish cloths, etc. ) the dryer in one bathroom wasn't working, one of the rooms did not have a t.v., there was a loud noise coming from the other side of the suite that sounded like some sort of machinery that went on all night long, it did not keep us, or more importantly our kids from sleeping, and you have to go up 2 flights of stairs, as the elevator stops two level below the suite.

Once you are inside the hotel you will find yourself in a clean and luxurious European-style environment. I stayed in a well-sized room with excellent furniture including a business chair. Also, you will find an in-room coffee maker and a hair dryer. No fridge or microwave, though. The only downside was that there was no outside view. Only a wall of the opposite building. There are different rate plans available. Make sure that the breakfast is included in your rate. It really is worth every cent.
