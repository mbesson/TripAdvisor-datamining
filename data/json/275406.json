When I booked a surperior room, it was supposed to come with a balcony which their superior rooms don't have. I travel 8 -10 times a year on business and have stayed at 50+ 4 star hotels and this is by far the dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed at. When we entered our room the first thing we noticed was the dust on the floor - our friends down the hall noticed the same thing. We asked that day to have the floors (hard woods) cleaned but when we got back it was clear that they only did a partial job - cleaning in front of the TV and couch and not near the bed or in the washroom. To check it, I threw a glass off water on the floor and wiped it up with a towel - it was black with dirt. So not only was the floor dusty it was actually dirty. I have a baby crawling around so I actually cleaned the floor myself with the towels. All the furniture was dirty as well, with crumbs and stains on every seat and bed. I didn't feel comfortable there and most likely will stay somewhere else next time.

NH hotels however do and we were extremely impressed with their assistance - my son even received his own children's toiletries in a lovely bag!! The only criticisms I would have are the usual - bar drinks very expensive although that is really the same i guess at any city centre hotel. The facilities for food at the hotel were limited and due to travelling with a young child on our arrival day we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant. It has won several awards but in our experience it wasn't so great. Advertised as opening at 6 we booked a table to be told to arrive at 630 and were then kept waiting for over an hour for our food. Initially we were the only people in the restaurant but by the time our food arrived it was getting quite busy but my son was also quite agitated by this point and began i feel upsetting some of the other diners. Had the service been better we would have eaten and been our before he became bored and also before the other guests arrived! Food was average and very expensive and to top it off we found three hairs that were baked into the bread that was served! Not great for a supposed gourmet restaurant! On the positive side rooms were clean and comfortable, mini bar was not over priced, location was great and staff very helpful.

The hotel was recommended for us by the cruise line, but overall ended up being a good stay. In reference to the title, the location was fabulous for walking to all of our desired things to see, including museums, Dam Square, Ann Frank huis and red light district, central shopping areas in the old town, etc. Also just down the street from the hotel is an entrance into beautiful Vondel Park. We had two different rooms (one being prior to our cruise, and one after.) The first room on the second floor was very small, two people and luggage filled up the space fast and left little room. Basically being the size of two small beds - but with a small balcony and french door that was very pleasant to leave open to watch the endlessly fascinating herds of bicycles go by on the street below. The other room we had on the first floor was bigger, with room for a couch - but no balcony. The bathroom in the first room had a stall shower (quite roomy) and was very clean. The bathroom in the second room was a tub/shower that was also roomy and clean - but with a very high rise to get in and out of same making the wet exit somewhat precarious. One complaint is that you get a tiny chip of orange (but pleasantly scented) soap - and that the shampoo and body wash seem to be exactly the same product. The beds were comfortable in both rooms. There was only 1 pillow per bed in the room, but the room service menu lists pillow options, which we did not bother with. The TV was difficult to use in the second room, but we were in the room such a short period of time that we did not miss using the TV. Our room included breakfast in the restaurant off the lobby, Attractively decorated in a modern style, this restaurant has windows overlooking the back of the building out to a street - a nice view. The restaurant was very busy every morning and bustling - somtimes the cheese and pastry trays cleared out, but were generally refilled without too much delay. The food choices in the buffet are nice and varied - our favorites included the gouda cheese/leiden cheese, wide variety of delicious danish pastries, fresh fruits and cereal/yogurt options. There are also hot trays with eggs, bacon/sausage, potatoes, baked tomatoes. We liked all the hot items except the eggs, which had a strange taste to us like reconstituted powder, so we did not eat them.

Up until that time, the trip was very good. This was a post cruise 2 day stay in Amsterdam, and from the minute we arrived it was very disappointing. We arrived at the hotel in the morning, and to their credit they did have our room ready. We had requested a room with two twin beds as my husband has a breathing machine at night so we need two beds. We went into the room and there was a 1 double bed. On top of that the carpet in the room was stained, and the room was quite small considering we paid 1258.00 Cdn for 2 nights thru Uniworld, as they did the reservation. That works out to 629.00 Cdn for each night, and for that kind of money we expected a much bigger room that was without stained carpets. We did go and talk to the front desk and they were very accomodating as they found us another room with twin beds. We decided to upgrade to a jr. suite for an extra 120 euros a night, and it was worth it as the room was much bigger, but it also had stained carpets, as well as a stain on the couch. We had breakfast the next morning in their dining room. The food when it was available was good, although they had a tough time keeping up with the food as they were a bit shy of staff. The staff they did have were being run off their feet trying to keep up with the coffee and juice as well as replenish the buffet trays. The restaurant wasn't open after they served breakfast, as we were told we had to eat in the lounge in the lobby. The menu items were very poor as you had a very limited choice on the menu. It was a one page menu with very little to choose from. The Italian restaurant wasn't open on Sundays, so we chose to go there on our last night in Amsterdam which was a Monday and for some reason it was still closed. The staff at the hotel was wonderful. My beef is the way the hotel is run. They are very understaffed and the staff they do have are extremely accomodating, especially the girls who work at the reception desk. When we called for someone to come and get our bags the day we left, the girl from the reception desk showed up. She did her best to heave our heavy bags onto the cart, but it was not her job. Where are the porters, does this hotel not have any??? Shameful For the life on me I cannot understand why we paid so much for a basic double room with no extra amenities, when i look at their website, it looks like I can get the same kind of room at the same hotel for about 400.00 less per night. Someone is making a lot of money on these post cruises at our expense. From now on I will make our own reservations for post cruises so I know exactly what I'm getting.

It was on the first floor which had filthy hallway carpet. There was room for 1 suitcase stand and we had to use the business work table for everything else. The bathroom tub/shower was a safety nightmare. The one grab handle was difficult to reach because of the way it was mounted; a second grab handle would have been welcome, and, the bottom of the tub was very, very slick.

The Food & Beverage Manager answer to these problems was that she had no way of knowing when a large group would go through the buffet; and that they prevented her staff from filling-in the empty containers.

The staff was friendly and helpful; the room was very clean and comfortable. We felt very safe in and around the area; in fact, you must use your room key to access the elevator. Directions on the hotel website to get there from Centraal train station were vague. If you do arrive from Centraal: Follow the tram signs out of the train station. Get on any of the 1,2 or 5 trams. You pay an attendant on the tram, who can make change for you. You can only enter through the front and rear doors for that reason. Exit at Leidse Square stop (about the 5th one). Turn left and walk southeast on Leidseplain Street past Cafe Americain and over the canal bridge; the hotel will be visible across your street and to your right. When we checked in, we were given a room on the first floor. Based on other travelers' recommendations, due to noise on the first several floors, we asked if it was possible to be moved to a higher floor. They were very accommodating and placed us on the 7th floor. Noise was not a problem at all. If you need to print boarding passes or otherwise need to use a computer, ask the front desk for a voucher(s). We made the mistake of needlessly paying 8,95 Euro for 24 hours for the hotel wi-fi service when all we needed to do was to print our boarding passes. And, it appears that there is free wi-fi in the lobby, anyway - just not in your room. The view out our window was OK (Burger King sign) but not great. There was no soap (hand or bath) provided, so bring your own! A blow dryer is provided. The electricity in the room (except for outlets to charge your phone, etc) will not operate unless you place your room key in a slot inside the door. Maybe this is common in Europe, but we thought it was very innovative...saves energy in case you forget to turn off the lights when you leave the room, and you always know where your room key is! The bathtub edge is very high (not sure if we've ever seen one as high), so you need to be careful entering and exiting; would not be suitable for guests with mobility difficulties. Upon checkout, we were told that we needed to pay tax on the room, as we had booked on Priceline and it was not included. Thankfully, I had the printout of our booking and was able to show her that we had, indeed, paid tax.

The hairdryer was better than any other hotel hairdryer I had previously used. Checking in and out was faultless with helpful & pleasant staff. The hotel is very near the Riksmuseum, Vondelpark and Leidseplein although it is a 5-6 minute tram ride from the Red Light district and Central Station. We walked to Anne Frank's House which we are glad we did because it was definitely worth seeing. It is a lovely 10 minute walk from the hotel. (Tip: If possible, book your tickets online to avoid the queues. We arrived at 10.30am Monday and waited 40 minutes!) The only downside was the number of trams we took at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2.60 per trip. Had we known we would have bought a 24/48/72 hour tram pass at Central Station which is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac13 for 72 hours.

LOL. Never noticed it until much later in my stay and didn't want to pack everything up to change rooms. This alone could destroy an otherwise perfect stay, so be forewarned. So if you get a room here, tell the front-desk clerk you \"don't want one of those rooms with a narrow toilet\". When you get to the room, inspect the bathroom immediately; if you see no bathtub but a nice (wide) walk-in shower stall instead, put the toilet seat cover down and see if you fit! If not, then call the front desk and ask for another room with a normal toilet. Other than that, you can't do much better than this hotel for location and the up-to-date, clean and comfortable rooms. They could update the TVs from the old box type to the newer large flat-screens monitors.

The location is convenient for travel by car, and an easy walk to most tourist sites.

I had a one night stay this month and stayed at this hotel again. The best thing for me about this hotel is the location. It's easy to get to the hotel from the airport by bus or by train/tram. This time I arrived at Centraal Station from Eindhoven so just took a tram to Leidseplein (the 1, 2, or 5 - a ten minute trip) and the hotel is a short walk from there. Getting around the city by tram is easy but the hotel is in a great location such that many things are a walk away (the museums, the park, the canal belt and so on). Check-in at the hotel was efficient (they accommodated my request for a double bed, despite me calling a few days before asking for a twin room!) The room was on the 6th floor overlooking the road towards Leidseplein. Noise was not an issue (the windows opened but even then, it wasn't terribly noisy). The room was fairly small but modern and very clean - in addition to the bed, there was an armchair, tables and television and that was about it. The bathroom was clean with a large shower area and good, powerful shower. Toiletries were included. At this hotel, you can call reception and choose from an array of different pillows to be brought to your room. They also have a late check-out on a Sunday (5pm I think from memory). I didn't use either of these as I was only staying for one night and it wasn't a Sunday. There is free WIFI in the lobby but not in the room.

It was small, the couch had a large burn on it, and it stunk horribly. I asked to be moved and was given a large, nonsmoking L-shaped room looking out over the popular Leidesplein. Much better. That unpleasantry out of the way, this room (#209) was quite nice, especially considering I'd bid $100. night thru Priceline and asked for a 4-star hotel. The style was modern and spare, the sitting furniture acceptable, but the bedding was very comfortable. The bathroom was very very modern and featured a wonderful shower with two heads - nice! I ordered a sandwich from room service, and found its Croque Monsieur very tasty and reasonably priced. I should also mention that when my room safe stopped working, the manager came up to assist, and he looked like a cross between James Bond and Prince Charming with a French accent.

Our accommodation was not available at 11 a.m. but we were allowed store our luggage. ROOM Dark wood furniture and timber floor; large comfy double bed; a pillow menu (we did not avail of this); old style television; work desk; blackout curtains; iron/ironing board; electronic safe (no charge); excellent general lighting and reading lights which were adjustable to the angle of your choice; mini bar (did not use); nicely illustrated Guide book entitled \"Amsterdam Insight\"; individually controlled air-conditioning and heating; electric jug kettle; cups; sugar; Pickwicks tea-bags and Douwe Egberts coffee sachets. We had a standard non-smoking room on the fifth floor to the back with a nice view of Vondelkerk (former church). However, carpet in the corridor was worn and stained. Keycard was needed for lift on ground floor, room door, and entrance to hotel late at night. Reception was open 24 hours. BATHROOM This was compact but had an excellent bath/shower combination. Also provided were shampoo and shower gel with citrus aromas; soap with orange extract (very nice); box of tissues; soft white terry towels with guidance for eco friendly use;- a mirror proclaiming it had seen a lot of faces and a smiling face was always beautiful! Shower initially a little tricky to use, but maybe that's just me! GENERAL Buffet breakfast was not included, but we simply made tea and enjoyed a continental breakfast in our room. We shopped in the nearby Albert Heijn Supermarket, 116-124 Overtoom (open till 10 pm except Sundays). At lunchtime we ate at La Place, Kalverstraat/Rokin and The Soup Kitchen, Niewendijk 50 (near Central Station). Had evening dinner not far from the hotel at Hap Hmm (means yummy bite), Eerste Helmerstaat 33, a cosy restaurant frequented by locals- a recommendation in itself. Incidentally, just across the street is a Lidl store. All our eateries were very reasonably priced. We used the free internet in the new and very spacious public library at 143, Oosterdokskade 143 (east of Central Station). It's open 10am - 10pm, 7 days a week. There are great views of the city from the 7th floor. Amsterdam is pancake flat and compact so walking around is a joy if the days are not wet. We also purchased a Strippenkaart at Schiphol Airport information desk. Price is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.30 for 15 strips or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.80 if you are aged 65 or over. Five strips, stamped by the driver, will bring you to the hotel and is valid for trams or buses for 1.5 hours. Two persons (or more) can use the same Strippenkaart. CONCLUSION Hotels in Amsterdam are expensive. Slightly worried by the fact that most of the one-star or two-star hotels have very steep and narrow stairs, without lifts, we took the advice of the TripAdvisor Amsterdam Experts, who give so freely of their time and knowledge to try Priceline \"name your own price\" site for four-star or five-star hotels. Result - our stay made all the sweeter by getting a double room for just under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 per night when the non-refundable rate on Booking.com for a similar room averaged \u00e2\u201a\u00ac177 per night. We really are indebted to you guys! Our favourite moments in Amsterdam: Alfred Stephens Exhibition in Van Gogh Museum (until January 24th, 2010); Jordaan area and the vivid green parakeet birds on the leafy treetops in Vondelstraat, who seemed so excited by our visit.

The Bath/Shower was great, but is rather high up from the floor, so getting out of it is tricky if you are all wet. Because I got the room on priceline, I didn't get any extras with the room, such as breakfast or internet access and the hotel seems to charge alot for these extras. Even the gym was extra. (The gym was more of a fitness room and not really a gym, to be charged admittance for this is just plain silly greed. I went to a real Gym a few blocks away Splash Fitness, and for the same price got all the amenities that a real gym offers.) Internet access is similarly priced restrictively, so most days I went to a restaurant with free wifi and my laptop. They have 2 restaurants and a bar, again, priced out of whack with neighboring bars and restaurants, so saw no need to try them when the liedersplein is just a minute away. (Also in 5 days I never saw anyone actually eat or drink there). The front desk people were fine and mostly helpful, although they did lead me astray on some public transport intructions. Maid service was excellent and honored my do not disturb sign. (Even when I didn't wake up until 2:30pm the first day! They came in after they were sure I was gone). The location is excellent for visiting the Museumplein, VondelPark, The leidersplein, Rembrentplein and tram service is just outside the front entrance.

It's a comfortable hotel. It's almost well located. The 5* status that it holds however is only as result of cramming as many different facilities and assorted room accessories in as possible and is in no way reflective of this being a luxurious hotel. My partner and I went to Amsterdam for a long weekend. The hotel was suggested by Lastminute.com as one of their luxury 5* secret properties, the name of which would only be revealed once payment has been made and the booking secure. It is approximately E35 from the airport to the hotel by taxi and it is well located for the Rijks Museum (currently closed for refurbishment) and the Albert Cuyp market (seemingly consiting entirely of stalls selling either cheap wigs, cheap (and nasty) leather goods and the odd cheese stall). First impressions of the hotel were that the room (standard) was on the small side. There was no bath in the ensuite but there was a good sized walk in shower, with underpowered shower heads. The staff were not all that friendly and seemed rather bemused when I called down to the front desk one evening to request the turn down service, which they told me that they didn't do. This is something that I am used to getting in 5* hotels and also something that they advertise as being offered in the inroom service guide book. When this was pointed out to the receptionist she tried to tell me that the service directory in our room must be wrong. The hotel is located at the opposite end of the city to the old town and took about 30 minutes to walk there, although this was no real problem as the walk was pleasant enough. All in all I would recommend the NH Amsterdam Centre (just). The way in which I booked it through Lastminute.com meant that the rate was \u00c2\u00a370 per night which was just about right at 50% less than the normal rate.

I have had a variety, all in the same price category. I haven't a clue how they figure out their price ranges, so this time I got wise and requested a larger room beforehand. (I booked online). I also reiterated this request when I checked in. We had room 119, a corner room (see photos); it was quite spacious. Request this one if you can. The double bed is not two beds smashed together, either. Furnishings are spartan, but that's an NH thing. When I've been on business (read: expense account), I also had my breakfast included because it is such an impressive spread. However, since we were on vacation, we would just go to nearby pancake houses. The NH is not for the super budget-conscious, but I think it's just as good as the nearby Marriott, at quite a bit less.

One very short tram ride from Central Station and walking distance to almost everything. It is located almost right on Leidesplein (one of the main squares) and therefore very central for all entertainment and touristy stuff. It is on the same street as the Rijksmuseum/Museum District (walking: 10min) and the Heineken Experience (> 20 min). The Albert Cuyp Market is about a 25 min walk. The Red Light district is about the same...maybe a little longer at night with all the foot traffic. SERVICE: Amazing. We flew into AMS on a red-eye (arriving at 6 am). The front desk allowed us to check in early at about 8:00 am. Just ask - if they have an available room they will allow you to check in. This part is for the ladies: I had an unexpected \"visitor\" late at night (AKA no pharmacy/store open) - I called down to the desk and they had someone send some supplies up to our room. ROOM: Spacious and clean - what more could you want? Your choice of several different types of pillow? OK they offer that too! Isn't that great. You can keep the pillows provided in the room or request one of the several other kinds sent up for you instead. A 'menu' of the different pillows will be in your room.

We received a bill at the end of our stay that shocked us. They charged us 7 days at the maximum rate when we knew for sure that this rate applied only for the 2 weekends. When we tried to explain, the receptionist pretended that she did not understand us. The manager was standing right next to her but did not introduce herself and just instructed the receptionist in Dutch to bring up the concern with the company we booked the hotel through. Also, my husband had a late flight so we asked whether he can check out 2 hours later than the regular check out time. They wanted to charge us 50 Euros. There was not even an offer to store his luggage as an alternative. Finally, from their website one can easily assume that Internet is provided. Well, it is not and their plans are totally inadequate to meet business needs. The price of the breakfast is exaggerated and you end up paying 2.5 times the amount of an Irish breakfast just across the bridge in the plaza. If you inquire about information that provides alternatives such as cheaper ways to get to attractions you are faced with ambiguous and hardly helpful answers from the concierge.

I personally consider this lying: 1. When I checked in, the lady at the front desk informed me that the breakfast was included. So I asked if I still had time to get it that day, and she said yes and that it was included. And I asked again to verify that I was able to get it that day, and she said yes. Excited about my free breakfast for the day, I go to get it, and they guy tells me that I would have to pay cash up front since it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t included on the first day. He even called the front desk (which was literally right around the corner) and he said that they verified what he was telling me. Why tell me one thing, if you are going to immediately deny me it seconds later? 2. The first day, I called to ask how to use the heating since it was too warm in the room, and they told me that if I turn the knob all the way down that it would cool down in about 15 min or so. So even though it had been turned down all day, I did as they told me. 20-30 min later I called and told them that it did not cool down as expected. So she asked if I wanted to switch rooms (which really was the nicest thing they did for me all trip), and so she showed me a couple rooms until we found a room with cooler temperature. I slept that night, and it heated up a lot. So I called again that morning to tell them about it, and she said that the engineer would come and check it out and that it would be the right temp when I got home. When I got home, it was still hot. So I call again, and I show them the instructions on how to use the heating and according to that, the room should average at 22degC, and that you could heat/cool it plus/minus 5degC. They tell me that during the winter it is always warmer than that and that I just have to open my window. Why couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they have told me that the first three times I called? Plus, when they showed me the rooms, the first room they showed me was considerably bigger than the one I was in. Why wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they put someone who is staying for 2 weeks in a nicer room? 3. When checking out, she asked if I wanted my phone charges on my CC, to which I asked how much and she said it was 5.50eruo, so I said ok. Then she gave me my credit card slip to sign, and it was over 18 euro. Why did she tell me the wrong information to begin with, and why wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t she have corrected herself before charging my card? 4. After opening my windows, the next night I get home from work and my windows were closed and the room was once again warm. So I called to ask that they not be closed, and they told me that they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close them again. The next day I get home from work and they were once again closed and it was warm. So I once again called to ask that they not close my windows. Finally, they stopped closing them. I understand that not everything can be perfect, but I felt like they just kept getting things wrong: 5. Friday night at 2am I was locked out of the hotel outside for at least 5-10min. Luckily someone was leaving that allowed me to get into the hotel because they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear me pounding on the windows. When I asked them about it, they barely shrugged their shoulders and said sorry. When I called the customer service number to complain, after talking to them for about 6-7 min or so, they told me to hold and then hung up on me. I also informed the person the next morning about it, and again, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as if they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. 6. I bought the internet, and immediately upon using it, I had troubles accessing sites that I know were up (ie, cnn ...). So I had to call a service number to figure it out. 7. I asked to use their free internet in the lobby, and it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t access google. So I had to ask to have someone look at it. 8. They told me that they sold stamps, so I had planned on getting stamps there to mail post cards, and when I went to purchase them, they told me that they were out. 9. I asked the concierge to make a reservation for me through a tour company, and he told me that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do work with that company and that he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call for me. Incredulously, I asked why he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call, and his co-worker (realizing that I was annoyed) said that he would call for me. 10. After he made me the reservation, I asked him to point out where on the map I had to go. He pointed to the wrong place on the map (it was close, but wrong). Why wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t he say that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly sure where it was located, but that it is near where he pointed? Or why not look it up on the internet that was right in front of him? I know that a lot of what I said above are really small things, but it just kept building on top of each other. I especially take offense to being told wrong information with such certainty. I would much rather be told that they will look into something than to lie to my face. I hate to sound like a whiny American who expects the best customer service, but I have travelled a good amount through Europe and some parts of Asia. Also, I have stayed in a wide variety of hotels (from the cheapest hostels to much nicer hotels), and this is by far the most frustrating experience I have ever had. In terms of good things about the hotel, the facilities were clean and new. The shower was nice. The breakfast was good. It is in a great location (close to a lot of action, but removed enough that I could thankfully sleep with the windows open without any noise).

We ordered room service a couple of times and they were great. We got our order within 15 or 20 minutes each time. The room was cleaned well and we had no complaints with housekeeping. got turn down service when we remembered to request it. You can choose from a variety of pillows and they will bring whatever you choose to your room.

We had a brilliant time in Amsterdam - it's a wonderful city. We tried to fit in as much as possible and it was nice to come back to such a wonderful hotel to rest those aching feet! First impressions were great - the lobby was clean and modern with small but stylish bar, lounge area, resturants etc. Check-in was quick and our bags were taken up to the room. We paid for a standard room, which as previous reviews have stated was a bit on the small side, but if you only use the room for sleeping then it's more than adequate. The room was clean and comfortable and offered dressing-gown, slippers etc. as well as tea/coffee facilities, mini-bar, safe, television (with English chnnels). The queen-size bed was extremely comfortable with choice of pillows. Could not hear any noise during the night and had really good night's sleep. Bathroom was small but well designed with large wet-room style shower area - with double shower-head. Nice toiletries and I was impresed with the fact that you could adjust the lighting in the bathroom. We didn't opt for breakfast as it seemed quite pricey . We drank in the bar one night which was expensive but we expected this. Sevice was great and atmosphere really relaxed. The area is fantastic - the front of the hotel looks out onto a canal where canal cruises (definately try an evening candle-light cruise - very romantic) and river bikes can be hired. Opposite is Leidsplein (a square with bars/restaurants and street entertainment) and the main street off of the square - Leidstraat is lined with lots of 'high street' shops. The hotel is two minutes walk from VondelPark and another few minutes from the musuem area (where the more upmarket shops are). Use trams to get around - really cheap and stops right outside the hotel. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a retreat from a hetic day in Amsterdam. Staff were friendly and helpful.

As a warning, there are many NH hotels in Amsterdam named similarly and we found ourselves at the incorrect hotel(NH City Centre) hotel at first. After seeing the unbelievably tiny rooms and feeling the heat from the broken A/C we promptly requested a transfer to the Amsterdam Centre. The hotel was well kept, clean, and the staff had an overall friendly demeaner. While we found Amsterdam extremely expensive, this hotel was no exception. We ordered a coffee and a tea for breakfast one morning, recieved them 45 minutes later and were charged 8 euro(about 10 US dollars). Needless to say, we didn't eat breakfast at the hotel again. Also overpriced was the internet usage fee- 15 euro per day. We instead opted to use free internet cafes, which were plentiful around the city. We chose to pay a 25/euro a night fee to be upgraded, and it was worth it for a larger room on the side of the hotel(away from the noise of the trams and street traffic). The bed was extremely comfortable and a variety of pillows were available upon request. The only complaint was an un-cooperative consierge, whom incorrectly informed us how to purchase a ticket for the Talis(the high-speed train to Paris). After first asking, he informed us it would be approximately 135 euro per person. He checked the prices, and said it was 250 per person. He then told us to buy internet usage to book the tickets ourselves. After we pleasantly asked him to book for us, he told us the tickets were sold out and we should go to the Central Station at once to try to get a ticket. An hour later, we arrived at Central Station to find an hour and a half wait to purchase tickets. We were very disgruntled. The next day, we inquired with another consierge. He promptly told us booking online was not possible, and he could arrange for a reservation so that we would not have to wait in the always long lines at the station. This trip for us was last minute, for we were not aware a 4 hour train ride would take us to Paris. If you have the chance, I would most definitely book this train for a wonderful trip. In general, we found Amsterdam food to consist of bread, cheese, french fries with mayo(at EVERY meal), and a fried-croquet type of dish. And of course, lots of beer. Be prepared to eat these odd dishes, or go hungry. We stopped at their grocery stores(Albert Heijn's), but could not decipher the labels on the food items. Travel around the city is primarily by bike or tram. Tram cards can be purchased at the Albert Heijn's for a lower price than on the tram itself.

As well, it is right on tram and bus routes. The rooms were very clean and modern, and I think they were large by European standards.

When we arrived, I was all excited and gave them my name and comfirmed a superior room, et. al. Our room wasn't ready, so we went for a walk. When we came back, we got our room and it was the smallest room I'd seen outside of a tourist class hotel in Japan. There was a one chair, but hardly room for your knees to sit in it. As tired and weary as we were, we decided to shower. Afterwards, I had my partner go downstairs to complain. He told them if this is a superior room, he'd hate to see your standard room. At which time they admitted it was a standard room. I was so mad. He then went and looked at all the rooms available and choose the best one. It was very lovely with dark wood floors, plenty of seating and room to walk around. It must have been a junior suite as I was able to see other rooms when the maids were cleaning and none were as big as ours. The view was of the back side of the hotel and another building (design house I think). From that point on, my view of the hotel was better, although I still find it hard to get over the initial room experience. I also feel they tried to pull the wool over our eyes like suckers.

I chose this hotel having reviewed all AMsterdam hotels reviewed on this site so was more than a little surprised! Like the previous review stated, I wasnt told that the hotel was still undergoing renovation and having been dropped outside the 'entrance' of the hotel by the taxi we then had to find the unmarked entrance around the corner, struggling with 2 large bags only to find that there was no doorman or anyone around to help us and one only turned up as we were struggling up the stairs with our bags - not what one would expect from a 5 star hotel. The room was particularly small and despite being told we had a 'good view' it wasnt that good! The main lifts were not working at the time of our stay and the one lift that did work took an eternity to ever show up. I would like to point out that there is no bar just a restaurant and at no time, other than breakfast, did i see anyone dine in it. We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel and something tells me it was a wise move! One evening we had a reservation at Jamie Olivers 15 restaurant and when the taxi driver didnt know where it was I ran back into the hotel and the front desk staff had no idea where it was either which i found astonishing and they made little effort in helping us get directions. We were on a really tight deadline so in the end gave up of making it to the restaurant on time and back for an evening boat trip planned later. We asked that they call the restaurant on our behalf and cancel our reservation but they couldnt because the number of the restaurant was a '0900 number' which apparently they cant call from their phones - it was extraordinary and most unsatisfactory. Having stayed in many 5 star hotels I can honestly say this is more of a 3*/4* hotel and wouldnt stay at this hotel again and whilst I didnt check out any other hotels in Amsterdam I am sure for the money you could do better.

Rooms are very well decorated and well equipped. Hotel is not in the very centre of the city but everything is within walking distance and museums are very close by, so its quite a good location to explore the sights from. However, don't expect a 5* - there's nothing too special about this hotel. Having said that, if you get this at a decent price (say, under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150), you can't go wrong.

Loved the rooms, which, although small, were refurbed to a top class standard, with wooden floors, comfortable beds, Grohe fittings and limestone floors and walls in the bathroom....felt like the lap of luxury! The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, even lending us an umbrella when we needed one :) It's just off Leidesplein (tram routes 1, 2 and 5 from the station) which means you're looking at a 15-20 minute walk to more central places, but we still loved the upmarket location near all the fancy shops and museums. I have only *not* given it 5 stars because the refurbishment is still ongoing, and although they told us about it when we got there, we were still woken at 8.30am by heavy drilling. This was okay for us, being on Euro time already, but I imagine it wouldn't be so good if you'd flown in on the red-eye from NYC and were still on East Coast time.... Having checked on this site before booking any of the major hotels in Amsterdam, this was the only hotel with a consistently good review history, and deservedly so. You won't regret it! Make sure you ring and ask whether the renovations have finished though if you're going to book and think it might bother you.", "Date": "October 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Schenectady, NY", "Title": "\u201cI want one of their beds!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2598587", "Content": "Awesome hotel!
