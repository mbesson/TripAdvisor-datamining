The hotel was not difficult to find if you follow the tram track to Street Cavour after come out of the Termini station, walking about five minutes, the hotel is on your right. The next door is a souvenir shop where you can buy an adopter for your chargers as Italian use a 3 pin plug, it cost \u20ac5. The room 207 was very basic as many of others described. The room was tiny but clean. There wasn\u2019t much of the view as the hotel was behind another ugly dirty building. No air-conditioning but a fan in the room, it was end of September so it was ok at night; the pillow was very thin, I had to put my clothes underneath it; the TV was small and it didn\u2019t have a signal, I don\u2019t speak Italian anyway so didn\u2019t bother to ask for a change or repairing. I had to share the bathroom with others who stayed on the same floor, I didn\u2019t mind until the second night when I went in to find out that the bathroom was like an elephant had just been taking a bath in it, water was everywhere on the floor, I guess some people just don\u2019t consider of other users. The toilet was as difficult to use as described by others, so I had to use the free toilet in the museums or galleries for three days, (they charge you \u20ac1 for using toilet at the Termini station!) The wall was quite thin, the first night I was exhausted so went to bed early. Around eleven o\u2019clock, I was woken by the couple next door who were chatting in their room loudly, that lady\u2019s laughter was so dramatic! The third night I couldn\u2019t sleep because the noises from the air condition units outside. The breakfast was the worst I have ever had, only a couple of bread rolls and a cup of tea. When checked out, on top of \u20ac60/night there was also \u20ac2 each night for city tax. I am not sure if I should recommend this hotel as I would not go back myself, for that price I would find a more comfortable place but a little bit outside the centre area next time. If you have not yet bored with my review, that I would like to share a few experiences which may benefit your future trip. 1. When arriving Roma, there is a shuttle bus (at airport stand 1) from the airport to Roma city centre, \u20ac8 single way or \u20ac15 returns. It runs every hour and seven days a week. It takes approximate an hour to get to the Roma city centre. It has two stops, first stop is Vatican, and then Termini station in the city centre. 2. I booked \u2018skip the line\u2019 on the Vatican museum website which cost me \u20ac27 + \u20ac7 audio tour hiring. However, the ticket price of Vatican museum was only \u20ac15, and you have to queue for the security check anyway. Most of these skip the line services are in the morning when most of the tourists have the same idea to visit the museum early, you couldn\u2019t see much without push or been pushed. I stayed until noon when there are less people so I could calmly enjoy my visiting. It\u2019s same to St. Peter\u2019s a long queue in the morning but much less people visiting after 2pm. 3. There are two lines of underground in Roma which can take you to all the attractions. From Termini station to Vatican museum (Ottaviano, San Pietro) only six stops by using Line A and only cost \u20ac1 for a single trip, but don\u2019t be surprised if you can\u2019t find many English instructions. 4. There is a small supermarket at lower level of Termini station which is the only one that I could find in the city, the price of the food was reasonable; you can enjoy some fresh fruit and yogurt. 5. The sightseeing tour bus by passes most tourist attractions in the city centre, to find your way around you have to have a detailed street map as the old town have so many small streets and visibility of street signs on some buildings is not good in the dark. 6. If you are a cat lover, please bring some cat treats when visit Vatican museum. There is a black cat - Mr.V that just looks like my cat Maomao. He is a very nice and sociable cat, when I chilled out in the garden, he walked toward me and sit down next to my feet enjoyed me patting him. He\u2019s quite slim which makes his head looks much bigger.

That's actually pretty hard in Rome, I found. Enter the Hotel Cavour. For 75 euros a night (about $110 a night), we got exactly what we paid for. A very clean (but cramped) double room with a sink and bidet, shower & toilet shared for the hall (though we never saw anyone else using it). Bed a bit stiff, but hey, you can only expect so much for 75 euros. Two blocks from Termini, so easy to catch a bus or train to anywhere you please. And, if you have your walking shoes on, you can be at the Colosseum within 20 minutes or so. The staff was friendly and provided a nice walking map (though we found our GPS on our phone to be more useful). Everyone spoke good English. They have a lift, though you will need to drag your bag up a stair or two to get into the office. They also have an included breakfast (though we chose to sleep in to work off the jet lag) and free wifi in the lobby (handy for a last blast of email before hitting the sea). TV is only in Italian, but we didn't come to Italy to watch TV (and watching TV in a language that you speak very little of is actually a lot of fun).

Reception is on the 1st floor and so is the breakfast room: breakfast is less than stellar with 1 croissant/bread, jam and a coffee.

Hotel Cavour is on the right hand side \u2013 the most prominent sign being Hotel Argentina in the same building! The location is about half-way between Via Antonio Rosmini and Via Principe Amedeo. This area is choc-a-bloc with excellent small restaurants, and you cannot go too far wrong with most of them. However, the Restaurant Santi in Via Daniele Manin is well worth a mention since here you have a genuine family-run restaurant offering Roman (and other provinces) food. Yes, they have the Menu Turisitico if you want to ease yourself in gently \u2013 but then go for the local stuff! Signori and Signora Santi are in their seventies and have been running this restaurant for most of their married lives \u2013 try it! Finally \u2013 if you want to do Rome, you\u2019ll be hard put to find a better compromise than this area.", "Date": "October 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ansonia, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cA pleasnt experience\u201d", "Author": "wherleybird", "ReviewID": "UR5938696", "Content": "A great find in a crowded city. 47 Cavour is very close to the Termini and an easy walk to all of Rome's major attractions. It is very close to the Coliseum and about a 45 minute stroll through the city to reach the Vatican. i would recomend this hotel to anyone. The rooms are very small but very clean. For the price, you won't do much better in expensive Rome. The staff at the front is extremely polite and very helpful. This is a traditional tourist hotel that will give you a good nights rest. If you are a 'hotel' person who likes ammentities, go elsewhere, but if you want a clean, safe, friendly place to lay your head after a long day of sighseeing, I would say this would suit you well.

Let me then warn you that the A/C's in Europe have about the same power as a Geo Metro. Let me then say again that this hotel was the ONLY hotel in Europe that we stayed at that finally got the idea that all you really need is a ceiling fan!! This hotel had a ceiling fan AND an A/C unit. Rome is extremely brutal and hot and to come home to a cold room is excellent. The hotel is actually on the 5th floor I believe, but there is a lift, so it isn't very inconvenient to get to the room at all. The shared bathrooms that we had were ok and the rooms were pretty clean. The proximatey to the train station was excellent. Right down the block. Not a bad walk at all to all the locations of Rome besides the Vatican. For the price, I would definitely recommend this hotel. The staff was very nice as well.", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "newcastle", "Title": "\u201cClose to Termini\u201d", "Author": "bargaintraveller", "ReviewID": "UR5822280", "Content": "With a few minor changes this hotel could be a perfect base in Rome. We arrived close to midnight, hours late after a delayed flight from Venice, the young man on reception was excellent, as were all the staff throughout our stay. It is typical of hotels we have stay in when we have visited Rome, our recpt on the ground floor and rooms on 2nd & 5th with other hotels on the floors between. One old small lift to all floors was only a problem on two occassions. We had an ensuite room that had a 7inch drop as soon as you entered the room. Not a problem once you knew it was there, but on arrival I fell into the room as there was no warning of it on the door. If you like a good nights sleep be sure to request a room that does not face via Cavour as the noise from the traffic is 24/7 and with no double glazing you hear it constantly. Italians use their car horns to drive as well. The breakfast staff were super but their fair a little basic, although to their credit its one of the few places I have stayed and had hot coffee, much better than the warm variety. For a 2* hotel at a reasonable price for the centre of Rome you could do alot worse than stay here.", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Cavour", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d619805-Reviews-Hotel_Cavour-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$50 - $177*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Cavour, 47</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00184</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "619805", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/1/2/3/8/8321/8321.jpg"}}
