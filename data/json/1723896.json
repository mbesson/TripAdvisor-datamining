Hotel staff were kind and helpful. I got charged an extra fee for using a credit card, which really aggravated me, but when I checked in it was midnight and I was exhausted and not in the mood to argue or understand his explanation. The location is also great and very close to many of the most popular tourist destinations. However, the address of the hotel is on a small pedestrian-only side street.

About the hotel: first of all, it's in a great location - two minutes from Sultanahmet tram station which connects you to various areas in the city; Aya Sofya and Sultan Ahmet Mosque are a short walk away. Now, the rooms are really small, but I guess that's how it is if you want a reasonable price at the prime location. Housekeeping does a good job at cleaning the room. Just like some others have mentioned, there is some unpleasant smell coming out of bathroom but I did notice that the housekeeping used some bleach-like substance to try and reduce that smell. Wifi was spotty; I couldn't get a good signal at my room, so I had to go to the restaurant where the signal was strong. The top floor terrace has a wonderful view of Aya Sofya, but it is open only at night. Breakfast is a standard fare of bread, coffee or tea, jam, cheeses, olives, and vegetables.
