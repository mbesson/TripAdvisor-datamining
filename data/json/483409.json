I noticed a few things that were not quite right, firstly the only light switch was by the door, so once in bed there was no way of turning the light off without getting out of bed as there was no bedside lighting provided, also the room was for four people yet there were only three towels, three cups & three drinking glasses! We had booked the room so we could stay over for the night whilst we made a first time visit to watch West Ham, upton park is approximately a 20 minute walk away, after watching the football we found it near impossible to find an eatery where we felt comforable with the children, we walked in every direction to locate something other than a fast food establishment, not even a pizza hut or weatherspoons in sight! so we had to eat in the local KFC. I tried to have a shower in the morning after an uncomfortable nights sleep, the room was very noisy with police sirens going all night (Police station is located opposite the Hotel), the shower was impressive to look at, but was a nightmare to get right! the water was a mere trickle and very hot or very cold, it was extremely difficult to find a medium setting! We left after breakfast as planned, no problems with the food, plenty of toast, eggs, bacon, mushrooms, sausages etc etc. (Cold Coffee though) Since arriving home my son & I have both discovered that we have been bitten badly by bed bugs or fleas, I am now constantly itching & scratching...... my original thoughts was that the hotel was ok for the cost, however, given the poor facilities & the persistent scratching I would not use this hotel again, I would happily pay an extra \u00a320-\u00a330 to stay somewhere a bit better than this flea-pit!", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDo NOT stay here!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Annabel L", "ReviewID": "UR119145763", "Content": "Myself and my Manager arrived at this hotel and was horrifed from the first moment we saw it.

He had pointed out where my manager's room was but took me outside the building next door to what can only be described as a council house/flat. He opened the door to thr house/flat and then inserted a key into a shared access door. Behind the door were 4 bedroom doors and a communal bathroom. He gave me the key to my door where i found a bed a shower a tele and a very large spider. My natural reaction was to sit on my bed and think 'is this a joke'. Myself and my manager spent approx an hour ringing round hotels near by and were willing to spend \u00c2\u00a3180 on a room for 1 night, this was not an option as all hotels nearby seemed to have been fully booked. I informed the receptionist that i was not happy staying in the room as i knew 3 men were staying next door to me and could easily get into my room. The receptionist kindly put me into another room in the same building as my manager. Again this was awful. The sheets were dirty, the bathroom was dirty. Down the side of the bed i was horrified to find newspapers,labels,sweets,wrappers. I slept with my light on all night and had around 4 hours sleep.

My boyfriend and I left the hotel to go to into the City and then on returning quickly realised we couldnt stay there. We slept for one night, fully clothed on top of the bed sheets.

The attitude from him was that he didnt care either. It so gross i ended up washing my hair in the sink and couldn't even close the toilet door to use the loo as the smell was so bad.

I've read the other reviews, so I expected worse, but it was not bad at all. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised. Better than 2 other London hotels I had seen (years earlier). They were more expensive and more... euh... crap*. Availability: I made a booking a week prior to the trip, around Christmas time. That means that most hotels are fully booked, or really expensive. Considering we were only in the UK for less than 24 hours (visiting a concert in the O2 venue) room rate was most important. Rates are high in London, no doubt, this was one of the cheapest options, no actually, the cheapest. The hotel itself: It's on a busy road, extending backwards. Hotel is typically red plush with overly decorated wall to wall carpet. Very British :) Not luxurious, but to me perfect. Staff was friendly and helpful, and did give a quiet room as requested. The hotel has small corridors, tricky corners and stairs, but all okay. I felt welcome and it had a pleasant feeling. The room: Good! Middle sized, a twin room, with tea and coffee facilities(?) and a small fridge, good mirror, good beds, matrasses, clean sheets, warm blanket (duvet?*) and proper sized closet, and a small tv. (Did not check that) Also the opened windows gave the room a crisp feeling. Nice. The bathroom is not big but convenient. Absolutely spotless sink, mirror and toilet. The shower was a bit troublesome. Getting a constant temperature took some getting used to, and there was some mould at the corners. (But I've seen that in before, even in more luxurios hotels) Does not look attractive, but I didn't care that much. Maybe because everything else was good! Also... we did not smell any cigarette odour, but maybe it was luck? We left very early so we skipped breakfast. Can't help you out with that one. Public Transport, to and from: With the O2 in mind, in fact connectivity to the center also, connections are very okay. 300ft(*)/100mtr from the hotel there are busstops (25 en 86) going to and from Stratford Underground Station. I think every 5 min during the day, and 24 hours a day (every 10 min or so). From Stratford on it's easy. I was weary about the busses thinking that only the underground is easy, but busses are very handy! Just step off the bus when you see the McDonalds ;-) In short: Good value for money, I would recommend for weekend breaks, but do not expect the world. Then you have to shell out more.... and a lot more I think.
