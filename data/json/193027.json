The room I had was very, very small in comparison to other PI's, and the single beds had been pushed together, due to the small space...but the room was very clean and well maintained, as usual for PI's.. The hotel is well positioned for walking to the HMV Hammersmith Apollo (approx 15 minutes stroll away), and I didn't feel unsafe doing this walk alone gone midnight... Its also ideal to use as a base to venture into central London, as there are 3 mainline stations nearby - with Ravenscourt Road station being the nearest (about 5 mins away). The only other niggles I had (apart from the small room size), were small things...only one chair in the room (when it was a twin, so one of us had to perch on one of the beds)...noisy students running up and down the corridor...no double glazing (so let road noise etc in)...and was woken up one night by the couple next door having sex! Haha - yeah, the walls are PRETTY thin!!! :D :D And the car park is TINY!!! Apart from these minor gripes, this hotel offers a great location for getting out and about in London, and is brilliant for going to the Hammersmith if you've a gig on (like I had)...and the attitude of the staff makes up for these moans too - they're all really friendly and helpful and were genuinely interested in what I had been doing that day etc. I'd definately use the Hammersmith Premier Inn again - its just a shame the small room etc dulled the shine on what would have been my best Premier Inn stay to date!", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Molton, Devon", "Title": "\u201cYou get what it says on the tin!\u201d", "Author": "dollydollop", "ReviewID": "UR126492118", "Content": "A standard Premier Inn so you know what to expect when you open the door.

The building, from the outside, is not inspiring (but is easy to spot), a great concrete high rise, but then I was staying in it, not looking at it! There were some security measures in place (you had to use your room key to access the accommodation floors) which helped make me feel safe and secure. The hotel was well maintained and comfortable. The room I had was very small, although I expected nothing else for the price in London. It was fine for me, but a couple would have struggled a bit. The double bed was pushed up against one wall and floor space was minimal - there would have been a lot of edging past one another! The room was clean and well presented, and it had secondary double glazing to help deaden the noise from outside. The bed was what I would class as 'all right' - it certainly could have been a bit firmer but it was by no means was the worst I have ever experienced. The shower room was also clean. Again, it was small, and had no bath, but the water pressure was fantastic. Breakfast was fine, although some Premier Inns give a wider choice of breakfast, space in the dining room was constrained. Above all, the staff were fantastic - all very helpful and courteous. The hotel is roughly 200 yards from a tube station.

The reception area is spacious and has seats and tables where guests can hold an informal meeting or gather to chat before going out. The bar and restaurant area is immediately adjacent to reception and fairly small by the standards of Premier Inn, but very clean and well laid out. All staff members that we encountered were very friendly, efficient and well trained. The hotel is thirteen storeys high and there are certain security measures in place that suggest there may have been issues with unwanted guests in the past. That said, my colleague and I wandered up to a local pub and felt safe enough. While my room was unconventionally shaped, everything was exactly as it should be and I enjoyed a comfortable night.

It's easy to find and just two minutes from Ravenscourt Park tube. The room was smaller than I've enjoyed at other Premier Inns but had everything I expected & needed. Even a good full-length mirror with excellent lighting and a hair dryer with a long cable. I was shattered after a very long and busy day. All I wanted was a bite to eat and go to bed. I went to eat in the restaurant, I was asked how many the table was for. I replied that it was just me and saw I was the only one in the place. The manager replied that I was not on my own as he & the waiter would look after me. I thought that was a lovely touch. I felt a bit guilty when I saw I could have pizza in my room. But I still ordered one, with a side salad and a bottle of wine. It was all nicely wrapped with a selection of condiments within a short time. The waiter offered to carry it to my room - I declined as a few people had started to arrive. I slept like a log and heard no noise in the corridor even though I was by the doors/lift. Breakfast was a buffet but with poached/boiled eggs/porridge on request. There was no queuing to make toast, pour drinks etc. and I only waited a few minutes for my poached eggs. I don't know what some people expect. But the couple on the table next to me moaned that the buffet was not fresh and food had been hanging about. It was not and had not - the food was not piled high and was being refreshed regularly as it was in small containers and the place was full of people wanting the full English.

When we arrived at the hotel (14.30pm) we struggled with the parking, as it only offered about 10-15 parking spaces, so we had to drop the car infront of a skip just untill we had checked in, When we checked in the lady on reception advised we could not leave our car there as it was not a designated space and directed us to a nearby car-park. We got checked in really quickly and were given a room on the 11th floor, however when we got to the room we opened the door to find it had not yet been cleaned, as there was a empty wine glass on the side, rubbish in the bin and the bed hadnt been made - I went back down to reception who appologised for this and issued us another room immediately on the 9th floor, we were satisfied with this room as it was very clean, modern and had everything we needed - although it was on the small side. The facilties in the room included - Digital TV, Hairdryer, Tea/Coffee making facilites and Free 30mins of Wifi. The Location of the hotel was fine for us as we were close to the TV studios and we found a few cheap pubs/restaurants along this road (weatherspoons are good for cheap drink and food) however it does take around 30mins on the tube if you want to get to central london (picadilly circus, oxford street, leicester sq).

The bedroom and the toilet were very clean even though there was the carpet as you can expect in every bedroom in London. The bedroom is not very very big, just appropriate to sleep and then leave early in the morning to walk and visit this fantastic city. It' s true that breakfast is not included in the price and that to have a full continental and english breakfast is 8.50 pounds more but it's worth because after that full breakfast you can probably skip your lunch. I didn't pay 29 pounds per nights as someone over there informed me that it can be if you reserve in advance of a few months, but I also know hotels in London are very expensive, unless you want to sleep in a very dirty place.

We booked a meal for 8pm. We arrived early after coming back from Twickenham and got to the restaurant at 7.45pm. We ordered about 5 minutes later. From where we were sat we could see the meals at the serving hatch. The first meal was placed on the tray, but did not arrive at the table for approx 5 minutes along with two of the other meals. The fourth meal came 5 minutes after this. Whilst we were eating, the waitress started taking plates away while others were still eating - poor etiquette. Next morning, housekeeping tried to clean the rooms at 8.30am while we were still preparing to go for breakfast. Considering check out time is 12, very annoying. Again at breakfast, plates were taken from our table while people were still eating. Overall a disappointing experience after a good weekend of visiting Twickenham to see England v Wales.

The reviews on Trip Advisor helped us make that decision to pick this hotel. We were not quite aware of how far we were from Hammersmith tube station. It was a good 10-15 mins walk. Upon arrival, the reception lounge was noisy & filled with students. We could barely get through with the pushchair & suitcase. The room itself was very compact and our 2 year old daughter's bed was merely a mattress on the floor right next to our bed. The room was clean, comfortable and neat with everything we required to stay. Bath, shower, tv, soft duvet, hairdryer, air conditioning, lots of lighting, towels, tea, coffee, kettle etc... Our first night, we could not find anywhere suitable in Hammersmith to eat, so we ended up back at the Inn, after a drink at The Rutland Arms on the Thames off Hammersmith Bridge which was nice. We'd already paid to have a continental and premier breakfast, but the staff were more than happy to change this so we could have their \u00a322 meal deal which included a very nice 3 course meal, with drink & the full brekkie! We were more than delighted with this great deal. The staff were very polite and friendly at all times. They could not be more kind, always greeting us and chatting to our daughter and making her laugh. They offered us extras like hot chocolate for our daughter and the option to have poached or boiled egg, if required. Our room was situated on the 2nd floor at the front side of the building, the view was of the road, car park and a skip (although we were informed of refurbishments going on before we booked, which did not interrupt us at all). At night it was very loud. Our room was near the stairs too, so we could hear people going up them late at night and into the hall. Outside traffic could be heard late at night and early in the morning. The binmen arrive early Monday morning too. I think Premier Inn would have been better putting us in a room at the top as we have a small child and will be using the lift anyway, so we would not be disturbed at night.

However, the beds are really comfortable (inc. decent pillows) and the curtains are heavily backed to prevent light entering, also the windows are doubled (external set / air space / internal set) inhibiting most sounds from entering.

The rooms contain basics; TV, kettle (with coffee/tea etc), hairdryer, storage cupboard, spare pillows/blankets, telephone etc etc.....but no fridge (2 x vending machines in reception and a 24/7 across the road - which has a large selection of fresh fruit/veges aswell.)

Breakfast was incredibly good value for money and one of the best we have had in a hotel in this country. The views from our room (1201) were fantastic but what stood out most of all was the amazing customer service. I have never been so impressed-all staff were very friendly, attentive and genuinely concerned that guests had everything they needed. I would like to compliment the staff team on this. For value for money and great service this was a great choice of hotel.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staines", "Title": "\u201cTheir Hypnose bed didn't g'tee me a good night sleep just bites from bedbugs\u201d", "Author": "Wudgieboon", "ReviewID": "UR78098982", "Content": "I was attending a course over a 4 week period requiring me to stay at the Premier Inn for between 2-3 nights per week. I did not have a say in where I got to stay and having travelled the world and stayed primarily in genuine premier hotel groups, I was not looking forward to my stay at a budget hotel. However, having been checked in to a 2nd floor room all of which are refurbished I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the room. However, the claim of a good night sleep on the hypnose mattress is not so as I found the beds in each of the rooms I stayed in to be extremely uncomfortable and awoke each morning with a stiff back and aching ribs!!! Having arrived at the hotel in week 3 and been greeted by Jane who I will say is an extremely professional and pleasant member of the team, was allocated room 211 which I had stayed in during the previous week and was very happy to be staying there again. Regretabley, during the two nights of my stay I was horribley bitten over 35 times on my arms and legs and it was only on the morning of my departure that the Operations Manager admitted there was a current infestation problem in the hotel which was being treated by a company called Ecolab. So if you are about to check in and see their vans parked outside, carry on walking and find another hotel elsewhere!!! A colleague had overheard a conversation that several rooms were being treated on another floor at the time!!! I had to return to the hotal the following Tuesday for another 2 night stay and was extremely worried as having spoken to Environmental Health, I was advised bedbugs are extremely difficult to get rid of once they are established as they can hibernate anywhere in a room for months at a time, and are easily transferred between rooms through air conditioning ducts, by the cleaners as the move from room to room and so on!!! I was assured by the Operations Manager that I would be well looked after with a good room (I was not, as I was allocated a standard room after being in a family sized room for the previous 2 weeks and had to complain before being moved!) Other issues with the Operations Manager made me realise that the management didn't care for their customers despite stating they did have a bedbug infestation problem and I had been a victim! So my advice to anyone thinking about going to a Premier Inn and this one in particular is, you will be paying them a lot of money (no where near the so called \u00a329!!!) for a night's sleep in a bed that will at least be pretty uncomfortable but could also include some nasty critters leaving you with bites that will itch for at least 5 days which antihistamines do not relieve, AND also LOOK extremely unsightly.

The hotel is in a converted office block and the corridors still have a slightly institutional feel, it's certainly not going to win awards for design, but then Premier Inn is hardly a design led chain!. The room was one of the smaller ones which was OK as a solo traveller, however it was a shame there wasn't a full size bath for me to stretch out and enjoy a soak in. I was on a high floor, twelfth I think, so the views were lovely. I got a good nights sleep however colleagues were disturbed throughout the night by students staying at the hotel (four to a room apparently so hardly surprising!). My colleagues did call down to reception, but naturally as soon as the students were asked to be quiet they did so for all of five minutes before starting up again. Breakfast was of a good standard and the breakfast team were all really friendly.

Unfortunately, this stay, we had the car with us - the Travel Inn do have some spaces which are available on a first come, first served basis at \u00a312 a day, but they were all taken by the time we arrived at 6pm so had to park in the NCP car park 5 mins walk away which charges \u00a322.50 per day. Pleasant stay at the Travel Inn though and would stay there again if we needed to be in that part of London. My favourite PTI in London is County Hall - can't beat that one for location in my opinion.", "Date": "November 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sheffield", "Title": "\u201cConverted office Block???\u201d", "Author": "proterra", "ReviewID": "UR20052897", "Content": "Not uo to usual premier standards, We had booked a family room and my childs bed was practically a matress onb the floor not a proer bed as we have had elsewhere.

The aircon did the best it could but by virtue of the fact that this Travel Inn is situated in a tall building the windows would only open so far, so sleeping was a bit difficult. The food in the small restaurant was traditional predictable Travel Inn fare ( lots of things are \"off the menu on a Sunday evening sadly !), but this was actually an advantage to us since with 2 young sons a bit of predicatbility in terms of available food over a 3 night stay is quite useful ! In terms of location this Travel Inn is close enough to Central London so as not have to spend too long on the Tube (District Line from Ravenscourt Park) and far enough out to avoid the congestion charge ! Special mention must go to a young lady on the staff called Christine who works in the restaurant who was incredibly kind and patient with our youngest son Peter who has Prader Willi Synderome and can be a bit of a handful at times.

It is a no-frills hotel. The rooms are on the small size - particularly noticeable for our friend from the U.S. - and being in Central London the prices are a little higher than their other hotels around the country, typically \u00a390 per night. However, as one correspondent has already put it, \"it does what it says on the tin\". My room was very clean and was well furnished. The service was excellent with all of the staff I came into contact with being extremely friendly and helpful. Surpisingly, the hotel was quieter than I expected. I usually take a pair of ear-plugs when I book into a London budget hotel but didn't need to use them on this occassion. My 11th-floor rooom had great views and the traffic noise was undetectable. The hotel is just 3 minutes walk from the closest Tube station (Ravenscourt Park) with trains into the city taking about 25 minutes. Premier Inn hotels do not usually have their own on-site restaurant so Hammersmith was an exception in this regard. However, I would not recommend it. The service was great and the prices were OK but the pizza that I had was about the worst pizza I've ever eaten..... very greasy and artificial-tasting.

It was a Saturday in July, and we paid \u00a390 for a double en-suite, which we thought a little steep, especially seeing as my partner's parents were staying at the 4* Novotel down the road for the same price. However, the location (about 1 minute from the tube, close to bars, restaurants, shops and on a major, but quiet, road) made up for it as it's ideal for those driving (in London!?) or on public transport. The hotel itself was fine, pretty average really, apart from the beds, which truly were VERY comfortable (as the company promise). Check-in was a hassle-free affair, and the staff were very friendly indeed. They were happy to answer questions, and offer directions to the event we were heading to. Our room was a good size with an equally good sized bathroom, with pretty boring, but not unpleasant, views across the car park. Most importantly, the room had air-conditioning, which was much appreciated after a 1hour trip on the underground on a 30 degree centigrade day...Moreover this was GOOD air-con (and anyone who stays in hotels regularly will apreciate this I'm sure!). The bathroom was a bit basic, and took an AGE to get any hot water through the taps, despite turning my hand to all the tricks in the book to get them to run warm. But it had everything I needed; bath, shower, etc. Functional I believe is the word... The room and bathroom were both immaculately clean, but there was a slightly odd, almost damp smell in the room, which I see another reviewer has mentioned. It was innocuous, but not being able to open the window didn't help. It didn't bother me in the slightest but it was noticable when I walked in the door The room was quiet, as I say we stayed on a Saturday night in the school summer holidays and we didn't hear a thing, either from other rooms or from outside. Such a relief and a change from some other, more expensive hotels! Breakfasts were good, but quite expensive for what is on offer (as I often find). Guests would probably do better to head out to one fo the local delis or cafes (5-10 mins away) to pick up a bite, but what was on offer in the hotel was perfectly passable and the staff serving were very kind and helpful. All in all a very good, middle of the road London hotel. It's nothing special, but great if you need to head to West London for whatever reason, it's a safe bet. Would I stay here again?
