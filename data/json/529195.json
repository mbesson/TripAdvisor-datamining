Do not expect a 5* hotel, but do expect a good nights sleep in a clean bed, a nice shower and a breakfast that will keep you going until lunch. We chose the hotel after reading the reviews here on TA. We were not disappointed! Very good value for our money. The hotel was clean, the staff were VERY helpful and kind. The breakfast did indeed have many sweet things to offer as another rewiever here said, but you dont HAVE to choose them. There were also some healthier alternatives. When I asked for coffee the man behind the counter offered me a cappuccino which he made for me. That was a bonus I did not expect. In other hotels I usually have to pay extra for \"special\" coffees Room The bathroom was over expectation for a Italian budget hotel. Clean and no mould and good ventilation, no plumbing issues and some amenities like shower cap, hair conditioner etc. The bed was a little bit hard though. The airconditioning made the room wonderfully cold rather fast. Our room was facing the street, but we were not at all disturbed by any noise from the street.

The rooms were very well heated - at times too hot! Breakfast was a choice of a couple of cereals, croissants and bread, fruit, yogurt, ham, cheese and fruit juice. Coffee or tea was freshly made for you. The staff were always helpful and mainly spoke english - the man when we checked in didn't but we managed between us. There are a number of restaurants in the close vicinity and the food in these was better than in the tourist areas.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "LondonBanana", "ReviewID": "UR51041967", "Content": "My first trip to Rome with 2 friends. We were in Rome for 4 days. The hotel was easy to find and 200 m away from Termini train station. If you are taking the Leonardo Express from the main Rome airport, the walk from platform at Termini to the main station area takes about 15 minutes (fast walking). When we got to the hotel, we were greeted by the friendly reception staff. The hotel is very cute, tidy and homely. The lifts are tiny (2 people only), but we didn't use them choosing to use the stairs to burn off the enormous amount of foods we ate during our stay! The restaurant next door to the hotel is great. I am not sure whether it was because we were so hungry, or whether it was because we were excited to be in Rome (or a combination of both), but the food was amazing! Of course, not Michelin star, just down to earth real italian food. The tiramisu was amazing. The rooms were very tidy and clean. The bathroom was immaculate. We had a TV in the room and wardrobe and a desk. When the hairdryer in the bathroom broke, they gladly gave us a replacement. The buffet breakfast in the morning was great. The croissants were the best bit. Of course there is the standard cornflakes, yoghurt, fruit and a variety of wafers, crackers and biscuits. A real continental breakfast. There is coffee from a machine or the reception staff can make an expresso for you. The staff were very helpful with our queries on what buses to catch and what metro line to use to visit various monuments and sites around Rome. They also gave us a large easy to use map of Rome, which we used a lot! A wee bit of a downside was that my friend could not use her laptop while we were there. The hotel charges for using the wifi internet. The biggest tip which I can give and which I got from another person's Tripadvisor post about their trip to Rome is this: Get the Roma Pass. You can get it from any tourist related place either at the airport or at Termini. We got outs from the Termini tourist desk (again, very helpful and friendly). It gives you unlimited transport for 3 days and free entry into 2 sites anywhere in Rome. We used it for the most expensive sites we visited, which not only saved us quiet a bit, but also a lot of queuing for tickets etc!!! Of course nothing beats walking Rome's beautiful streets, but after a day of walking and full of food, a quick ride home on the Metro or the bus is bliss.", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "ET-001", "ReviewID": "UR46857105", "Content": "I was there for my 30th birthday with my family.

My recent trip to Rome November 1st thru the 6th was a prelude to boarding a cruise. I found Assisi on this website and the reviews determined my decision n to stay there. I had a budget to work with as I was taking an extended vacation and this was the first leg of it. I would highly recommend this place for anyone in a similar situation. It was a great surprise to find that the old charm and convenient location of Assisi was complimented by the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the room. The outside of the building may throw you off at first, and the neighborhood may leave you wondering if you have picked the right place to stay, but for the money, it was an excellent choice. The rooms have been modernized greatly from the architecture of the building and the d\u00e9cor of the lobby. It had the charm I was hoping for in a stay at an older hotel in Rome. The only thing that I would wish different was the shower stall, it was very small and even though I am a very slim guy, if you moved around in the stall you could hit the knob and turn off the shower. If you are in Rome, are on a budget, want to be near the train station this is a great place for you to stay. They have a continental breakfast in the morning, and although they keep your room key while you are out of the building, it did not present a problem getting into and out of your room. The older caged elevator and worn marble steps of stairway added a romantic charm to the whole appeal of the experience. One other thing to add, there was a pharmacy on the ground floor of the building, which came in handy when I had a headache and aspirin on my journey.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cconvenient, central location, good rate and relaxed atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "sagittarianrealm", "ReviewID": "UR22557018", "Content": "With only a 72-hour stay in Rome we wanted a hotel that was close to the main transport hub for our sightseeing. Hotel Assisi is a small 2-star hotel just a few minutes from Termini- a run of the mill, but generally okay area, to our eyes. We had a 20 euro 3-day Roma Pass and chose the Colosseum and Capitoline Museum for our 2 free sites. Luckily ,we experienced just a five minute queue at the Vatican. December is a great time to visit Rome, apart from the sometimes not so good weather. Regarding the hotel itself, we had a comfortable, pleasant , tranquil , double room with tiled floor, flat screen t.v., mini-bar cum fridge (not stocked), desk, chair and firm double bed . Shower room- not as modern , had strange looking white towels which resembled very large table napkins. Complementary shampoo sachets, soap and shower caps were also provided. There was a small lift (occasionally rather temperamental). For us, the weakest link was definitely the buffet breakfast. Yoghurt one day, none the following day; never any fruit - fresh or otherwise; stale brioches from previous days and if the first few guests had cheese there was no more for anybody else. Alas, all very different from the pictures portrayed on the hotel's websites. And despite this, we feel that we got excellent value and service generally. We paid 162 euro for 3 nights, a saving of 33 euro on either Booking.com or Venere.com, thanks to a previous TripAdvisor post who recommended booking directly with the hotel website. The staff were unfailingly courteous and there was an endearing old-world charm to the place, which we liked very much. Also on our last day they kindly allowed us leave our luggage until evening time. Overall, our stay at Hotel Assisi was a very positive one.

The hotel is only 2 or 3*, so it's not the Ritz, but for what we paid, it was really good. Expecially considering the cost of hotels in Rome. All we were looking for was a decent place, in a good location at a reasonable cost. The Hotel Assissi is all of these! [We booked directly with the hotel website - that was the cheapest we could get it, and believe me we tried plenty of websites!] The rooms are basic, but a good size, the breakfast is continental but it's all you need to get you started for the day.
