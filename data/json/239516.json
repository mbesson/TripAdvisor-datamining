Here are some tips to make it easier. It is located on the second floor of a large building and does not have it's own entrance. Look for the tiny plaque with a buzzer on the outside. Once inside the building, you can take the elevator or stairs to the second floor. The elevator says that it can accomodate up to 3 people, but I barely felt safe riding in it by myself. If you take the stairs, look for the light switches on the walls or you will have to walk in the dark as it is not always lit. Also it is more like walking up 2 stories due to the high ceilings in this building. Although this hotel has an elevator it is not wheelchair accessible. After taking the elevator you still have to walk up a very short flight of stairs to get to the hotel door.Once inside the hotel we were surprised by the size of the room, it was large and there is also a common living room with couches and a beautiful mural. The bathroom had recently been updated, and had a great shower. On the door of the room it indicated that this hotel is a 1 star establishment. You can definately tell that it is when you see the plain, sparce decor in the room. We were awoken both nights that we stayed by noise from outside our window. One night it was a loud argument at 3 am, another night loud music. Needless to say, bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper.The host of the Hotel, Doreen speaks impeccable english and can give directions and suggestions for nearby restaurants and shopping.", "Date": "Mar 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR988359965", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "coffeegirl247"}, {"Content": "Great Location The best thing about Hotel Scoti is its location. Florence may be an easy city to wander around in but I still felt that being based on Via Tornabuoni and closer to the river rather than than near the train station was the way to go. It was so convenient to just skip a few blocks back to my room to drop something off or pick something up and then be back on my way again. I knew I was in for one-star hotel standard but as a solo traveler, staying for 5 nights, the 75 euro a night represented good value. I wasn't in my room much so I was more interested in staying somewhere that would be a good base for me while in the region of Tuscany. To that end, Hotel Scoti didn't disappoint. Doreen and Carmelo were very helpful and made sure my stay was an enjoyable one.

We have actually stayed at Hotel Scoti twice so far, once in October and once in November. My husband and I both absolutely love it. First, you can't beat the price. It was around 105 Euros per night, not bad for Florence. The rooms (we've had two different ones so far) have both been quite large with a standing armoir... closet. The room was quite clean, however, a bit sparse. Our goal was just to have a place to drop our bags while we went to the bars/restaurants of Florence. For that, it was perfect. The bathrooms were pretty spacious as well. (They provide soap but you'll want to have your own shampoo/lotion/etc) The hotel (the reviewer who said hostel was probably correct, although, I've never stayed in one) is a little older read: the place is not bright and shiny). The views over the tile rooftops are really nice. It's on the 3rd floor of a building, so, you can either take the stairs or the lift. There is breakfast for 5 Euro, but, we've never eaten it. The hotel is on an expensive shopping street, but, still very close to the Duomo (7 mins walking), Ponte Vecchio sp? (7 mins walking) and restaurants/bars. In fact, it's right down the street (5 mins?) to the Antinori wine bar. (Which by the way was quite tasty. Get there early or make a reservation) Long review short - not that that's possible at this point - it's a great, minimalist hotel for those who don't need a lot. OH! And the owners are great.

Firstly the name is misleading - its not a hotel at all the place is really a hostel. It was obviously the apartment of a very rich family at one time and the decor has the depressing air of faded grandeur about it. The rooms very basic and are not the kind you would want to spend any time relaxing in.The bed sheets were not changed once during our 4 day stay and neither were the towels Every day we came back to find our used towels which we had left on the floor carefully replaced on the radiators! The first morning we all woke up having been bitten during the night - we searched high and low for mosquitos but did not see or hear any -i have never experienced bed bugs before so I can't be sure what it was that was biting us but it was not mossiesThe location is not great really either -there are no cafes or restaurants on the street but granted there are plenty within a 10 minute walk. The street is all very expensive designer shops and lets face it if you are staying at Hotel Scoti you probably cannot afford to shop here. We stayed in an expensive hotel for 6 days in Rome and decided to economise by staying some where cheaper in Florence - big mistake!!Sure the family who run the place are friendly but we did not see them from the time we checked in til we left 4 days laterFlorence is a beautiful city so do not ruin your experience of it by staying at the Hostel Scoti you could probably find somewhere much better for very little more cash", "Date": "Dec 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR303377348", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "strawberryjellybean"}, {"Content": "Great Stay at Hotel Scoti!

With a strong Euro, we also needed a good value. Unlike many of the less expensive accomodations in Florence, Hotel Scoti is located in a central location on Florence's most fashionable shopping street, Via Tournabuoni. The location put us within not more than a 5 minute walk to most of Florence's attractions on both sides of the Arno, as well as the train station. Located in a 16th century palazzo, the hotel is the only one in its buiding, unlike some buildings that have a pensione on every floor, so the building is a peaceful place. The website reccomends requesting a room on the inner courtyard for a quieter night's sleep, so that is what we got. The hotel has been recently rennovated and our room had a nice bathroom w/shower, very clean. The owners, Doreen and Carmelo, could not have been nicer or more accomodating. They were available whenever we needed them and were helpful in suggesting options for dinner , etc. It has been my experience that Florentine hoteliers have alot of pride in what they offer and standards are overal pretty high, but I think Hotel Scoti was an especially good value.

The common areas of the hotel are charming, the rooms are clean and comfortable (a little spartan, but that's what we expected), the location is great for any first time visitor to Florence who wants to see the main sights, and the breakfast, while more expensive than a capuccino and croissant standing up at an Italian cafe, was cheaper than anywhere else we stayed. The highlight, however, is the proprietor Doreen, who was without a doubt one of the nicest, most helpful people with whom we dealt while in Italy. She gave us directions, made several helpful suggestions about things to see and places to eat, and seemed genuinely interested in making the acquaintance of everyone who stayed at the hotel. Before we arrived she or someone else at the hotel also made us a reservation at the Uffizi, and offered to make dinner reservations if we wanted to eat at an upscale restaurant. All of this for 95 euros per night for two people (with a private bathroom).Two final notes: First, several other reviews mentioned noise in some of the rooms facing out towards the main street. We had one of these rooms, and it was our experience that if we closed the window the noise didn't wake us up in the morning (and the weather was cool enough so that this was not at all uncomfortable). Second, the only qualification I might make is that the neighborhood of the hotel is VERY touristy, even for Florence. Most of the restaurants in the hotel's immediate vicinity cater to foreigners, and the entire experience can start to take on a bit of a theme park quality. Were we to come again, we might try for a slightly more far flung neighborhood in order to get a bit more of a feel for the real city.

My brother and I stayed in a spacious twin room, en-suite, with a view over the back roofs across to a tower (church , we suspect : see below) for 105 Euros a night, which we reckoned was very good value. Breakfast is available, in a rather fine room for (I think) 5 Euros, but it is not compulsory and we did not have it.The Hotel Scoti is located in Via Tornaboun as part of an old palazzo, two floors up. There is a lift, which I recommend you use, at least until you get used to the stairs, which are not always on at night, and you need to know where the switches are.Via Tornabouni is in a rather swanky street. The hotel itself is located next door to Prada and across the street from Cartier. However it never felt busy and we never heard traffic in the room. It is about five to ten minutes walk from Santa Maria Novella railway station,and only a few minutes from Piazza della Republica and the Duomo.Your hosts, Doreen and Carmelo, were most welcoming. My brother and arrived in after 11pm but we had warned them in advance and Doreen was waiting for us. Thereafter they were always happy to see us and to check if there was anything we needed. The beds were perfectly fine. Shower, handbasin, toilet and bidet.The only thing I would warn you about is that the room had no air-conditioning. To be honest I prefer this because the drone keeps me awake, and I woulkd rather use the perfectly good windows and shutters. However the first night, a Saturday night, was a very warm evening so we left the windows open. However this meant we we awoken first of all by the dawn chorus - the Scoti is near the Arno and so not far from the swarming starlings , and then at 7am the church bells started to ring, and not just seven times for 7am, but about 35 sharp peals. Once you know about it you can deal with it, and it is hardly the fault of the hotel, but be aware.If, like us, you want a serviceable place to sleep in safe, friendly surroundings, as opposed to paying for the grander but often faceless hotel experience, then the Hotel Scoti will do you very nicely.
