The hotel is situated in a poor looking area of the former eastern part of Berlin. It\u2019s about 5 minutes walk to the metro station and from there it\u2019s about 15 minutes by metro to the Alexanderplatz. From there you can explore the whole (big) city. A great advantage of this hotel is the fact they offer free parking and you don\u2019t need an Umweltplakette for your car. The hotel itself looks quite modern, as you can expect from a 4 star hotel. We booked our room for 48,00 Euro per night with breakfast included. For a 4 star hotel in Berlin this is an unbeatable price. They have very large rooms and normal rooms. Off course for this price we got a normal room but it was at least as large as a room you get in a luxury hotel in the centre of Berlin. So our room was very comfortable with two large beds, a big cupboard, a large working desk, a flat screen TV and a comfortable bathroom. The only downside of the room and the bathroom was the missing of any mechanical ventilation. This is very poor for a 4 star hotel. The only way to get some ventilation in the bathroom is to open a window. We also missed air-conditioning. When we were there temperatures were very cool but during a hot period the room would be much too warm without mechanical ventilation and any air-conditioning. Breakfast was impressive compared to the price we paid. A large buffet wit fresh eggs, omelets, a lot of fresh fruits, yoghurts and much more. Because it\u2019s a large hotel the breakfast area most of the time was very crowded and noisy. They also serve dinner in this area but it\u2019s not a place for us to have a relaxed dinner after a long day in Berlin. The hotel does not offer free WIFI which was a bad point for us. We think in 2011 every hotel should offer free WIFI at least in the lobby.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "glos", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Staff, Big Breakfast\u201d", "Author": "cbcGlos Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR94831821", "Content": "Booked this hotel the night before, chose it for its easy transport connections, large room size and hearty breakfast.

Only 200m from the Tube, with a 16min connection to Alexanderplatz. The trains are safe and Berlin itself is the friendliest city I have visited.

Good transportation facilities closeby: U-bahn a few minutes away and the tramway is literally across the street. Stores for most needs only 5\" on foot. Bathrooms are a bit short on amenities as the only thing provided - shower gel/shampoo dispenser in the shower and a nail file. Thus no soap for the sink and additionally, no wash cloths. (although many European hotels do not provide them). Genial, helpful reception staff, and most speak English. I cannot comment on the spa or the wellness center as I did not use the facilities nor did I eat any meals at the hotel. Disappointed that the they charged extra for Internet service and that both the maid service and mini-bar personnel entered the room after knocking just twice. This was very annoying the first time it happened for I had just gotten out of the shower and could not get to the door to tell them not to come in. At the time of my visit, there were no 'do not disturb' signs to put on the door. During the course of my stay I was loged in two different rooms (left Berlin mid-trip to travel to another city then returned at the end of the trip) In both rooms, the shower did not drain well nor did the sink drain (efficiently) in the second room.

The hotel is 15 minutes away by tube from Alexanderplatz, in a quiet, safe and residential area. The tube station is not even 5 minutes away walking from the hotel and for 2 days I got back very late to the hotel and did not have any problem. There is a street market in the area as well as a McDonalds, a Netto supermarket, pharmacy and some other shops. The staff is very friendly, although their English is not very good. They gave me a map of Berlin and also some information on all touristic places. I wanted to check in before 3pm and was told that I should pay a fee of \u20ac20, so I just left my suitcase in the luggage room which didn't cost me anything. The room was small but perfect and most importantly clean! I slept very well, it's quiet and nice! Breakfast was not included in my accommodation and a fee of \u20ac10 a day would be added to my bill if I wanted to have a breakfast there. I didn't even ask about dinner as I did one of the walking tours and the guide was so friendly that some of us hanged out with him for the following days and he took us to nice and cheap restaurants and we had good meals.

This place is not a 4 star- I am still amazed at how they were able to recieve such high classification. I think the max you can give this place is 3 stars. It's dingly, oudated by decades, lacking normal amenities you'd expect at a 4 star (like WiFi in your room), and is quite far from the culture, art, and party scenes of Berlin. The service is \"ehh\", you can expect the same or more at most other Berlin hotels.

Positives: + Close to the S-Bahn stop Tierpark (Hint: When arriving, be on the look out for the Abacus hotel signs as you get out from the tram - and follow the signs to that exit - and then walk towards the Tierpark Hotel sign - straight up for about 200 metres and then turn left).

Negatives: - Wifi internet not available in every room, and it's not free unlike a lot of other hotels in Europe. - We asked the staff if the area was safe - and while we had no problems walking in the light towards the S-Bahn station entry - we have heard that there was a robbery in the area recently - The hotel room itself is not the most pleasing to the eye in terms of decore.
