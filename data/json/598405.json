{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Dirty rooms Our room in the Li Shi Hotel was very, very disappointing. The beds were comfortable, and the room was a decent size, but aside from that, everything else was pretty awful. The biggest problem was that the room didn't seem to have been cleaned in about 15 years - the dirt ingrained on the carpet was disgusting, and as for the bathroom - well if you could see anything (which was difficult with one, very dim, light) then you would just be able to make out the large amounts of black mould. I really have never seen a worse bathroom in a hotel, or indeed anything close to as bad.Other problems we experienced- the toilet stopped working twice- the beds were unmade every evening for reasons I'm still not clear on- when we wanted a public taxi to the airport we were directed to a company offering expensive private cars and told that 'taxis don't run at 5.30am', which is of course, not true- the TV remote didn't workAlso bear in mind that the staff do not speak English at all, which isn't a problem as such, but something to be aware of.So plus points, well there are some - the location is good, it's nearish Tian'anmen and Wangfujing, and in a hutong if you want to experience what that is like. Also just five mins walk from Dongsi metro stop. Also the beds were very comfortable as I mentioned earlier, and it was very very cheap.It seems that maybe some of the rooms have been refurbished, and we were just unlucky to get a bad one, but I couldn't really say.Overall, I would just have to say - stay away!", "Date": "Apr 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR330401299", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "John_Lewis"}, {"Content": "Character Location What a great location close to Wanfujing, Tiananmen, the Forbidden City. The food in the neighborhood area is also great, the restaurants are small and authentic and well patronised by office workers at lunch and locals after hours. The hotel has some cheap rooms. We booked over the internet and got a rate of RMB 300 per night . The room we had was fine - not much of a view but clean and serviceable. If you are staying a week or more nag the reception people to upgrade you to a better room.as some rooms seem to have been recently renovated while others are getting a bit tired I used the business centre fro email and fax - cheap and all OK - with high level of service from the lass behind the desk.Reception staff all young, eager and helpful as far as their english permits. Nother too much trouble . Would recommend this hotel for travellers looking to see something of the real Beijing. Not the sort of place to stay if you require Hilton comforts.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR939247204", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "hamishmb"}, {"Content": "Ideally located       Li Shi Hotel", "Date": "Mar 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR553093838", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d598405-r14797242-Li_Shi_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "598405", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
