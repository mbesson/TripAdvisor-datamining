Very nice guy. Also the woman who cleanes the rooms was friendly and tried to do the maximum she could... we are happy that we made no experience with bed bugs like other people wrote. Our room (number 10) for the price was good. Television worked, bathroom was okay (en suite), bed was big, coffe, tea gratis. Negative: LOCATION!!! When i waited alone with the luggage for my boyfriend at the exit of the metro, while he searched the \"hotel\" (not easy to find), I felt directly unsafe and watched by the people living in the area. In the night we felt both uncomfortable to walk the 10/ 15 min back to the hotel. The hotel or better B&B is situated on a mainstreet... in the night it was horrible loud... but like a person before us wrote: You had the choice of sleeping in a sauna, cos the heater was out of control, or trying to sleep with all that noises. When you entered the B&B there was a bad smell of garlic mixed with something else, that came out of the kitchen... fortunately our room was not infected of that smell. But we were not able to enter the kitchen a second time... so we had just one day breakfast. Toast, orange juice, tea, cornflakes... thats it... for the price good... but my cup was for example dirty, you feel like sitting on a bar, cos there are no tables, facing the wall... and this unforgettable smell! The owner was a little bit unpolite. In the end we have to say that London is very expensive and we paid just 50 pounds per night... also the way to the city center is easy. You need 10 min walking and nearly 15 with the train, BUT this are things that you know before. We would not book this hotel again, BUT when you want to save money it is a possibility (when you have room number 10).", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c\"very bad experience\"\u201d", "Author": "sameera186338", "ReviewID": "UR125984218", "Content": "\"Hotel was good value of money.day receptionist was very nice .He was really a professional guy, but night receptionist was very rude, horrible, disgusting, and totally unprofessional.i am sure he was drunk.he told us to come back before 12.00 pm otherwise i won\"t be able to let you guys inn at cost of my own sleep.he was very rude during breakfast and then he asked us to check out before 10; Am.when i ask him that we have been told by day receptionist that check out time is 11;00Am, He said day guy do not know anything, he is my employee .

Located in a not very friendly tourist neighbourhood, we checked in at around 2pm, having just arrived from Belfast that day - we were obviously tired. We were let in by a person that seemed to be the manager, with no smile nor Hello. He confirmed we had a reservation. We booked a Suite. That's what we got. Beds were nothing to write home about in comfort and the bed bugs were horrible. They were easily solved by buying spray desinfectant at a nearby supermarket. The bathroom was OK, water pressure perfect. Breakfast was \"european\" but not very generous. Two toasts, butter (or margarine), jam, and a Coffee Cup. If you decided to refill it you would get a very bad look from the person \"preparing\" breakfast. The only thing to remark was the night clerk that was willing to help, called a taxi for us and woke us up at 5am when our taxi arrived. An experience that I would not repeat and would not recommend to anyone.

We booked the Hollingbury via another website \"Hostelworld\" (who were very very helpful & friendly)!! Our reservation went through fine, a deposit was taken and we were sent a reservation number. Just to confirm our booking (luckily) we emailed the hotel directly to inform them that if there were cancellations that we would prefer a double room rather than a twin. We received a response which stated \"i'm sorry but we are fully booked for this night\". So, if we had just turned up to check in to the hotel, there would have been no room for us!!!! We called the hostelworld customer service team and they informed us that its up to the individual hotel to update their availability. In short, granted we didn't stay there, but if anyone is to book via another online company, please contact the hotel first to ensure that your booking is VALID!! or you might be stuck with nowhere to stay on a very busy Saturday night!!!!

The room I was eventually moved to was no better - stinking sink, broken lamps and this time had a broken lock on the door!! I felt so unsafe in such a sketchy place that I had to wedge a chair against the door. This room also had a shared bathroom and NO HOT WATER for the shower.

Upon arrival we soon realised that most of the shining reviews were probably made up by the manager (who was NOT the most welcoming person) Location: The website mentioned that it was 'an ideal location' which is quite the contrary. At the time of booking, the website also mentioned that Madame Tussauds was a 10 min journey away and that it was close to all other London attractions (I see this has now been changed - perhaps because others who were decieved like us complained.) It is situated in Harlsesden, suburb far from the center of the city, which takes 40 mins to get to via the tube (and another 10 to walk to the station). It is therefore NOT close to London attractions as the website mentioned. Contrary to the website, the journey to Madam Tussauds takes at least 30 mins, not 10! Harlesden is not a pleasent suburb either - I would not have liked to wonder those streets alone at any time of the day. Room: Room was small but clean, as was the bathroom. The room did have some downsides though - firstly the 3 lamps in it did not even have lightbulbs in them, and we had no control over the heating.", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cConverted house in an obscure suburb\u201d", "Author": "BookingNextTrip", "ReviewID": "UR23511202", "Content": "Not what I'd consider a hotel. This is a converted house offering a B&B type service. It's in the London suburb of Harlesden and nowhere near anything. It's a 10 minute walk to the train station which is London Overground and most services require you to change trains for Underground. And don't expect to find taxis at Harlesden station. Upon arriving at hotel and ringing the bell we were \"greeted\" by the receptionist; he opened the door and said nothing (not even hello). We were having serious doubts about the place at this stage, but had come off a long flight and were tired. After we explained that we had a reservation he let us in, and to his credit did let us check in early. There is no lift to the rooms but the receptionist did help us carry our cases up the stairs. Rooms are tiny and there is no fridge or telephone. Our television didn't work and some lamps didn't even have globes. Bathroom is also very small but modern. Bathroom mirror is better suited to a dollhouse. Breakfast consists of cereal and toast and juice, coffee and tea and is the best thing about the hotel. Final straw came when on our second last night, we asked receptionist to arrange a taxi for us for the following morning. When we checked out (different receptionist) I was told nothing had been arranged but he said he'd call one that moment. Instead of a taxi, we were taken by a private car without a meter, and we didn't agree on the price.

Harlesden tube is about 10 minutes walk. The only parking is in residential streets next door, so we did empty the car of belongings and check up on it in the evening. The people working there were friendly and happy to help. Breakfast is chaotic - kind of like a large family breakfast! They only have a small kitchen so you might be asked to wait and they will come and knock at your room when there's space. Perfectly fine though - cereal, toast, fruit and tea/coffee/orange. The room and ensuite were clean and looked recently updated. Beds okay, TV with skybox. No tea making facilities so maybe bring a travel kettle!
