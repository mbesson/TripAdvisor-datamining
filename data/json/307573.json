It is just a few steps to a nice beach, and has a beautiful pool and garden. The breakfast was abundant and delicious, teh service was friendly and professional, and we location was great. It is easy walking to many restaurants and shops. The rooms were spotless and well maintained. We woke to birdsong in the morning and it was very peaceful at night. Good airconditioning helped too!Highly recommended. Thanks for a great stay!", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR514937631", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Corvus47"}, {"Content": "Beautiful Bali The Parigata Resort  Spa is a small hotel in Sanur Bali. It has about 40 rooms, and a delightful garden. The centrepiece is a lovely pool with a small separate area for children and a sparkling waterfall. The area next to the open sided breakfast room has a little pond filled with enormous fish ever attentive for a chunk of melon. Clever design has included other water features scattered around the lounge and lobby.Check in was dealt with quickly. The transfer agent and the hotel expected us to have vouchers to cover their services but we had none. Luckily I had taken the holiday itinerary with me and they were happy to take a photo copy of this in lieu.The rooms were not luxurious but were clean and spacious, beds were firm but comfortable with plenty of pillows, there was hot water 24/7 and the A/C worked perfectly. There was a safe, TV, fridge, hairdryer and kettle with complimentary tea and coffee and two small bottles of water replenished every day. Most overlooked the pool but our friend who travelled with us had a room that didn't so ask at check in. We were given our breakfast coupons and a voucher for a free dinner. The breakfasts were typical hotel buffet fare, delicious eggs cooked exactly as you wanted them and wonderful crispy bacon, pancakes, cereal, juices and as much fruit as you fancied. The free dinner was a fixed meal, bland and quite small, really not worth wasting an evening on. Turn left down the block paved path at the front of the hotel and a 3 to 4 minute walk will take you to the nearest beach which is fairly quiet and not much to write home about but if you like taking sunrise/sunset pictures our early riser friend who traveled with us assured us that it has good vantage points to watch and photograph the sunrise over various islands including Lombok 15 Km away. He certainly got some good shots.The hotel\u9225\u6a9a Beach Club is just a few minutes away by free shuttle bus which runs from 9.00 in the morning until 10.00 at night (it is a bit to far to walk comfortably.) Free sun beds and towels are provided. The beach is not idyllic but adequate with lots of fishermen standing waist high in the sea catching tiny fish and many boats moored there. When you want to go back to the hotel just ask for a lift at the beach bar, you don't have to wait long. The shuttle bus will also drop you at Parigata Villas where the pool has a very private feel to it For lunch and dinner we ate at many places and all were very good however humble they appeared. From the hotel walk up the path to the road and turn right. The first restaurant advertising food on blackboards (can't remember the name but they have an Internet room and a big fish tank) does a great lamb shank. Farther down the road on the opposite side you will find the Swastika Gardens Restaurant (excellent Indonesian). Turn left out of the path onto the road and about a 10 to15 minutes walk (past the Bali Hyat then cross to the opposite side of the road) will bring you to the Apakabar which was the \u9225\u699dind\u9225?of the whole holiday. Sitting at the big square bar is good fun and Sila and Co. will serve you the most delicious local and international food. We tried everything from simple curries to lobster and can recommend them all. Cheapest place to phone home too, just ask. You even get a free lift back to your hotel.Sila was recommended to us as a great taxi driver and that proved to be so. We took three trips with him and covered most of the island (waterfalls, volcanos, lakes, temples, spice gardens, botanical gardens, rice paddies and lots of stopping off places for great photos.) There was no pressure to have a look at my cousins shop etc. but if he offers you to \u9225\u69aeay hello to his Mum\u9225?do go, she\u9225\u6a9a lovely and her home is a true Balinese experience. Sila\u9225\u6a9a English is excellent. He is a font of local knowledge and will tell you all about his forthcoming marriage ceremonies, (yes there are more than one!!) and all aspects of life in the villages. He is fascinating to listen to and a good person. We had a great holiday in every way and we were sorry to leave Bali.We had a stop over in Kuala Lumpur staying at the Istana Hotel which was well placed within the Golden Triangle. I am writing KL review next.  The only bad experience of the whole holiday was the night flight back to Heathrow with Malaysian Airlines. We boarded the plane and sat for well over an hour whilst the electricians tried to sort out a fault. Hot humid air was being pumped around the aircraft, the air con had packed up. After requests for something to help our parched throats we were pointed towards the bulkhead water dispenser, tiny paper cups of tepid water which tasted foul. The lights kept failing, plunging us into darkness and to cap it all the emergency alarm kept telling us to use our oxygen masks (which never appeared) Through all of this the flight attendants were not at all helpful or sympathetic. We were all soaked in perspiration and feeling unwell. I have been told since that this discomfort could have been alleviated if only the Captain had started one of the engines to power the AC but he chose not to. On our return a friend who took the same flight two weeks earlier had been told that this plane never leaves on time anyway because the feeder flights are often delayed and if it did take off on time it would arrive at Heathrow to early in the morning for landing. We won't even consider flying overnight with Malaysian Airlines again.", "Date": "Aug 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR314624333", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "witchone666"}, {"Content": "Very Nice Small Hotel       Bathroom", "Date": "Jun 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR513229562", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MPW_Travels"}, {"Content": "Underated little gem My wife and I just returned from spending 25 great days at this wonderful little resort. This is a small almost boutique like hotel with an amazing courtyard garden area. The standard rooms all face the pool area in the center court and are located in four seperate 9 room buildings. The suites and a few additional rooms are located on the second floor of the main 2 storey hotel building. All enjoy patio/porch areas. The bonzai roof top garden off the second storey suites provides a wonderful relaxing outlook adjacent to a well appointed library area. The hotel amenities include a restaurant, spa/massage, piano lounge,pool area bar,and a pool with its own volcanic rock water fall. The main building lounge area has a 20 foot high waterfall and fish tank stocked with local colourfull fishes and turtles. The restaurant presents a very decent resonably priced menu and deserves more business than what it is getting. We ate several very good meals here. Keep in mind that this hotel is not located directly on the beach but it is only a few steps away. In addition the beach club with restaurant and bar , available for your use, is about five minutes walk away at the Parigata Villas resort (shuttle available). The majority of the guests staying at the hotel had stayed at the hotel prior and felt firmly that this was the only place to be. None had any thing bad to say and were most complimentary of the staff and service. We are in full agreement and would not hesitate to pay another visit.", "Date": "Mar 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR788623422", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bunzi"}, {"Content": "parigata resort and spa I have stayed at the Parigata resort and spa for the last 2 visits to Bali and will be staying here every visit from now on, we love it.
