The hotel itself was very clean and well presented with a marble entrance. It was situated in a good part of the town, away from the touristy bit but close enough to walk into the main parts. There was a high street just round the corner where we found loads of shops to accomodate our ancillery needs, coffee, wine, snacks, gifts, etc. The room was excellent and the solarium was in view of the Vatican (we went there when the Pope popped his clogs, not the intention of the holiday) but served a very relaxing place to sit in late afternoon to early evening with a bottle of wine, excellent. We would definately go back there again, the hotel has a website, just do a google search to find it.", "Date": "January 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, VA", "Title": "\u201cGood, Reasonable Hotel Near the Vatican\u201d", "Author": "sc19", "ReviewID": "UR4015269", "Content": "For the money, this is a good tourist class hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious, and there is a mini-bar. The staff was quite helpful, if not overly friendly. The breakfast room was quite nice, and the food adequate for a quick bite prior to getting out and about for the day. We found it's location to be quite good, because we could tour during the day, have dinner in the center of town, and then walk just 20 minutes back to our hotel. There are also some restaurants in the area of the hotel, if you prefer to eat closer. We didn't visit the shops in the area, but there were a number of them, including a Coin Department store. Hotels in Rome are quite expensive, and given the relatively lower cost and ambience, I would definitely stay at this one again.", "Date": "October 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea, S.
