{"Reviews": [{"Content": "sub-par room we stayed at puri dalem in dec. 2008 and had requested a double (one bed) room for two nights. when we got there they gave us 2 twin beds and said we could MAYBE change to a double. they offered to put the twins together, but who wants to sleep in the middle of the crack. the room was very run down. the wall paint was peeling, the overheard light was broken, the toilet seat was broken in half, and the window had a huge crack. however, the bed was comfortable, they had free wifi in the lobby, and the layout of the hotel is very nice with two swimming pools. the location isn't very good. it was a 10 minute walk to the beach, but you had to cross a very busy intersection. the night manager WAS NOT very helpful, but the morning manager was nice. we decided to check-out in the morning for a place with a double and paid one dollar more to be closer to the beach. overall, not recommended.", "Date": "Dec 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR576361854", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "nomadicwander"}, {"Content": "best holiday yet in bali Andy and Indah This lovely hotel was booked for me and i was not sure what to expect, arrived to a very warm welcome by the wonderfull staff who couldn't do enough for me, thankyou to all of them. Stayed 19 days and the service was top of the range. This is not really a hotel for young people or small children but just right for people who want peace and quite with some romance thrown in. Please go and  enjoy this hotel and great staff. A BIG HELLO TO ALL OF THEM.

Before I was in the top floor bungalow, and the bathroom was really bad, but the room was okay. This time, the cost was obviously more, but I stayed in one of the new rooms, not in the cottage bungalow section near the pool. Bathroom was much nicer, but the room was exactly the same, and so I was left disappointed at this. Breakfast was the same (even after 10 years), and so average. Also the staff were less friendly than before.", "Date": "Feb 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR573205748", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "wanderingbedu"}, {"Content": "Tired rooms, decent grounds, not the greatest location We booked this hotel through one of the travel agents at the arrivals area at the Bali airport since we hadn\u9225\u6a9b made a reservation anywhere in advance. Ended up paying $38 for a \u9225\u6e1fuperior double\u9225?including breakfast. Due to the issues below and the fact that we found a far better place nearby, we only stayed one night. The hotel is located at the north end of Sanur about 250 meters from the beach right next to a busy road, so from many public areas you could hear the noise of traffic. The grounds of the hotel include two pools with a few worn sun lounges and a bit of grassy lawn. Passable for a hotel, but far from the lush and welcoming grounds that most places here in Sanur have. Our room was a bit dated and tired. Dreary fabrics that looked like they were selected in the 1970\u9225\u6a9a, no d\u8305cor, and worn but functional furniture made the room pretty depressing. We are sure that the bathroom mirror and shelf had not been cleaned in a few months. Certainly not charming, romantic, or Balinese in any way. For some reason our hot water didn\u9225\u6a9b work, but we didn\u9225\u6a9b discover this until we were preparing to depart so didn\u9225\u6a9b ask what the issue was. Breakfast was a forlorn buffet table with a few plates of cut fruit and a chafing dish containing very greasy rice and some dodgy looking fried eggs. Not the most palatable spread. The upside was that the staff was very friendly, but it is not a place we wanted to base ourselves to enjoy this wonderful island. There are far better places in Sanur to stay that are more peaceful, better maintained, and closer to the beach for the same price!", "Date": "May 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR475097098", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "globedecker"}, {"Content": "Just love this place! It may not be a 5 star Hotel, if fact it's probably only a 2 star, but we found it to be just the place to wind down after a busy workload, swim in a fantastic pool and taste some of the great cooking. If you want peace and quiet, not to be disrupted by loads of tourists then this is the place. Sanur is much quieter than the humdrum of Kuta etc, and albeit this Hotel is about a 10 minute stroll to the Beach and Markets nearby there are many close by services, eg KFC, Mini Mart, Bakery, Restaurants, Dunkin' Donut etc. The staff are just fantastic and will attend to any of your requests with courtesy and respect.", "Date": "Feb 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR753985258", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "TWISH326"}, {"Content": "y revenir sans hesiter   showReview(16611441, 'full');", "Date": "May 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR835129132", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d566465-r23006727-Puri_Dalem_Hotel-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "566465", "Price": "$45"}}
