That's the test of a good hotel.You keep going back. Il Granduca is a bed and breakfast hotel run with great attention to its customers by its owner. He is there every morning to see that breakfast is served to your satisfaction.There is a sunny court yard which even in November catches the wonderfully clear autumnal light. It's only a 15-20 minute walk into the Duomo and there are at least 4 buses you can take if you are feeling lazy. What I like above all is the sense that I am warmly welcomed and that the proprietor is proud of his establishment and its reputation for cleanliness, tasteful decor and abundant and varied breakfast fare.Staff at reception are courteous and ready to help you out at all times.

We asked for the marital  full bed but got two very old, small and narrow (circa 1960) twin beds, with terribly worn out springs and thin mattresses. Instead of bath towels there were thin towels, hardly enough to cover half of a slim and not too tall person's back. The shower stall was so small one bumped elbows against it (and we are both slim and not very tall--I don't know what a six footer would do!) The ambience was very unsatisfactory--very, very noisy until 2 or 3 a.m. The hotel had evidently booked a large group of Italian high schoolers whose teachers did not control them and they carried on , yelling, slamming doors, all night. The desk clerk when we checked in had told us that the group had been imbibing and very noisy the previous night but that the kids' supervisors had promised to keep them in check from then on. No such luck. The night clerk was kind enough to make us espresso at 5 a.m. when we awaited our early cab to the airport. I wrote to report on our stay and received no response whatsoever.

Having read through the reviews again- I think we may have stayed in a totally different hotel.... On check in the hotel owner couldn't find our booking and was very unfriendly. He first gave us room #18 which was fine as it was a corner room and away from the noisy main street that the hotel in situated on. But to my alarment the bathroom toilet was broken as there was no toilet seat. We went downstairs twice to request for a change of room and the owner was very reluctant to give us a room change. Eventually he did but it was room #11 which was facing the main road and situated at the top of the stairs of the main stairwell of the hotel. The whole hotel is tiled therefore everything echoed and the walls moved when the main door to the hotel slammed and you could hear the staff talking loud in the hotel lobby throughout the night. The new room was not the best as the bathroom-although it now had a toilet seat, the shower was basically just a shower head located on the wall of the bathroom and a shower curtin, which was broken and had just been propped up across the bathroom door. Everything got wet including the toilet paper. The noise from the street was the worst and unbearable. We requested once again for a room change as we couldn't sleep and had 2 more nights in the hotel. The owner gave us hell saying that he had no spare room for us to move too, which I knew was crap as all the room keys were hanging behing the reception desk. We were not impressed wth his service and had to call the company that we booked the hotel through. We only managed to room move on our last night that we were there-once again a choice of another room on the street else it would be room #18- the one without the toilet seat . The owner also rudely insulted and embarrassed us infront of other guests that were staying there-which was VERY uncalled for.Unless we were just the unlucky ones to have stayed here- my advise to others considering to stay in this hotel- unless you are prepared to sqat on the toilet (hence no toilet seat), get zero sleep for 3 nights, be treated like absolute crap by the owner of the hotel and have your holiday ruined because of the lack of service of the hotel- I would recommend you pay a little bit more to get that extra bit of service or a little bit less to stay in a hostel of the same standard as this hotel.", "Date": "Sep 7, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR825408136", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Small but friendly The rooms are pretty small but that's fairly standard for a lot of budget European hotels.
