This hotel provided everything we needed for a relaxing vacation in the San Diego area. The location was perfect for us! It is half way between San Diego and Escondido with easy access to the freeway. We were able to move around the area quite easily. It is also just a short drive to southern CA's beautiful beaches. Our room was spacious and extremely clean. It had two big windows that provided a feeling of \"openness\" which is sometimes lost in a hotel room. We had a fully equipped kitchen and a pull out sofa bed in addition to a comfortable king bed and vanity sink outside the bathroom. The breakfast area had a homey feel and was beautifully maintained by the staff. There is comfortable seating, a big screen TV and free use of a computer and printer. Breakfast consisted of a variety of hot and cold items that changed day to day as well as the ever present large bowls of fresh fruit. We were delighted to find a delicious hot meal of lasagna, garlic bread, crisp salad, soft drinks, beer and wine when we arrived hungry and tired after traveling all day from the East Coast. Guests can enjoy complimentary dinner nightly Monday thru Thursday. All outside areas are clean and well cared for and there is plenty of free parking. There is a large gas grill, tables with umbrellas and a heated pool and hot tub. Right next door is a restaurant/cocktail lounge that serves delicious seafood, salads and sandwiches. Within the complex there is a gas station/convenience store and fast food restaurant. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend this hotel to business travelers as well as family vacationers. It has everything you need at a affordable price.

I have been on an extended business stay in San Diego since September and this hotel is my home away from home. The front desk staff really makes an effort to get to know you and make you feel welcome. It is nice to have a smiling face greet you (by name) after a long day at work. When I return after a weekend or week long trip back home (Florida) I am greeted by name and \"It's so good to have you with us again.\" The morning breakfast is very good and has a variety of items to choose from, the ladies working the dining area always smile and asks if there is anything that I need. I will thank them for their service and many times I am told \"oh no, the pleasure is ours and thank you for choosing to stay with us.\" There is a small dinner that is served Monday - Thursday which is good if you don't feel like going out anywheres. Wednesday night is \"Manager\" night and they always grill out hamburgers, hot dogs and chicken. Trent the General Manager is on hand and walks around to talk to everyone and checks to make sure that you are satisfied or what he or his staff can do to make your stay more enjoyable. The housekeepers do an excellent job as my room is always clean. They have even put my dishes away after being washed in the dishwasher so I don't have to contend with that after working all day.

He was working in San Diego for the week and his company put him up in the Marriott Residence Inn. I came along to spend time with him and to see San Diego. We had a rental car, which was necessary since this hotel's location is not central at all. It is about 20 minutes from downtown San Diego. But driving around San Diego provided that you need a car regardless, and we found cheap/free/plentiful parking everywhere so this was never a problem. In fact, having a hotel further away forced us to explore more which was appreciated. The hotel room was spacious and clean, with a comfortable bed. A full kitchen with necessary supplies, flat screen tvs and standard bathroom complete the setup. I found the desk to be perfect for doing work during the day, with an upgraded office chair. There is a small gym with good equipment, a nice pool and a hot tub. There is also a barbeque that you can use and a working fire pit which the staff set up every night. This was a very cozy touch. I was particularly impressed with the lobby layout and breakfast bar. The choices for breakfast were plentiful, healthy, hearty and tasty. Both American and European tastes were well represented with hard boiled eggs, fresh eggs, hash browns, breakfast meats, yogurts, granola, muffins, oatmeals, fresh fruit, cereal, make your own waffles etc. I think that this is one of the best breakfasts I have ever enjoyed! And a nice touch for travelers staying longer is that every day they varied one or two of the items to keep the selection interesting. It was never too crowded and all the items were really fresh. The coffee was good and they kept it fresh and hot (and available!) all day. The lobby/breakfast area had comfortable varied furniture, including plugs for working (and free wifi), a fireplace and a nice flatscreen tv. It was very cozy and in the evening they had free dinners and drinks for guests to relax with. Most importantly, I found the staff at this hotel to be extremely courteous and friendly. Requests were handled promptly and the hotel had thought of many small details to increase the comfort of their guests. I am very satisfied with my stay.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cClean, county centrally located with a friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "lost_bobcat", "ReviewID": "UR120044970", "Content": "I used a free marriot reward nite at this residence inn.

As we were in the process of moving, we had our pets with us and the fact that they were able to stay here was a big plus. The hotel is located approximately 20 minutes from downtown San Diego and its attractions. We made the trip almost daily and only hit traffic during weekday rush hour. If you can avoid these times, you'll barely notice that you're not in San Diego proper... except for the fact that it is significantly hotter. Temps average 15 degrees higher here, but rooms are climate controlled by the guests with a digital thermostat that kept us sufficiently cool. Additionally, the pool was refreshing and virtually empty during the day. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and were pleasantly surprised by its size. The hotel offers studios and two bedroom suites, but I'd recommend the one bedroom over the studio for extended stay guests using the kitchen. Who wants to cook in their bedroom?! The kitchen was equipped with pots, plates, glasses, and various utentils. Dishwasher with detergent provided. No oven, but a small two-burner electric cooktop and a large microwave, plus a full-sized fridge. Breakfast was substantial (eggs, potatos, breakfast meat, pancakes/french toast, waffle maker, plus the continental breakfast options). Light dinner was served Monday-Thursday and included salad, beer, wine, sodas, and bread plus the \"main course\". During our stay, the main course ranged from buffalo chicken strips to hamburges and hotdogs to spaghetti and meatballs. Service was excellent. All hotel employees were polite and helpful. Parking was generally good; on one occasion we had to park in a lot that seemed to be shared with the other Mariott hotel in this plaza, Springhill Suites. In the plaza there is also a Chilis and a local seafood restaurant as well as a Wendys. There is a grocery store nearby and if you need them to, the hotel staff will shop for you. My main criticisms of this property were the lack of wireless internet in the rooms (they do have ethernet hookups in the rooms and wireless in the lobby/tv area) and the limited TV channels.
