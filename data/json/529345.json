The staff is nice and helpful, rooms are clean and big enough for two. It's only a few metro stops away from downtown and is located in a safe area. Metro stop is less than 5 minutes away on foot (200m - 600ft.). I'd highly recommend you stay there. Staff also speaks a variety of languages, among which are Italian, French, English and German", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cNext time in Rome, I'll stay somewhere else\u201d", "Author": "cloud_traveller", "ReviewID": "UR45871263", "Content": "I spent one night at the Pensionato San Paolo, travelling alone on a business trip. I chose this place just because I was arriving late at night and leaving early in the morning, and it was close to the place I had to go to and to an underground station (which is a plus in Rome). Room and bathroom were small but not tiny, both with a nice window. However, the room was stinking so much that I couldn't sleep: the old carpet smelled of smoke or something like that, and I couldn't breathe. The problem was that you couldn't leave the windows open as there is a huge terrace connecting all the rooms, so anybody could enter. Besides, the bathroom needs a radical renovation and the shower box was so small that I had troubles washing myself (and I'm a young woman, short and thin). Breakfast was not as bad as I expected after such a night, but if you want an espresso and a croissant you have to pay for them and since in Italy everybody drinks espresso rather than American coffee, it's a bit unfair to me. I wouldn't go back to this hotel. I'm sure you can find something better for the same price.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Pensionato San Paolo", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d529345-Reviews-Pensionato_San_Paolo-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Viale F.
