(Tip: get a Telecom Italia TIM prepaid SIM card for free incoming calls and SMS and 30 days free unlimited internet for 12 Euros). We did not get breakfast included with our rate. Buffet breakfast at the hotel was 30 Euros per person. The Hassler is in such a fantastic location above the Spanish Steps. There are so many restaurant and cafes at the bottom of the Steps along Via delle Carrozze and Via della Croce. Every morning we would walk down the Steps and grab breakfast at one of the nearby cafes. Thick strong cappuccino and a pastry, eating while standing at the bar like most Italians. Every evening we would walk around exploring restaurants. Via Condotti is the high end shopping area in Rome and starts at the bottom of the Steps. We walked down Via Condotti to the Fontana di Trevi and then to Piazza Navona. On another day, after a tour of the Coliseum and Forum, we walked from the Monumento Nazionale back to the hotel. The buses are also very convenient and we took the bus back from Castle Sant'Angelo after visiting the Vatican. The Spagna metro is at the bottom of the Steps but we did not use it.

A visiting chef from Moscow collaborated with the current chef to host a two night night special dinner event. Food is always amazing in Italy, but this meal was extraordinary!! Each chef alternated plates and it just so happened we were visiting during truffle season...so you can only imagine our taste bud's happiness. I did experience something strange with the room service. First attempt to contact was unsuccessful, it just rang and rang. Hung up and next call was picked up instantaneously. Happened twice??? Our room was quiet, and I didn't hear any bells, so not sure about that. Prices were expected for this location and type of hotel. Make sure to ask about Breakfast, because I assumed it was a complete buffet for a set price, but rather certain food areas are included in the breakfast price, but others not.

First, the property is lovely! The lobby and sitting areas are decorated very grand and opulent and so was our room. Our room (was more of a suite) consisted of a large sitting area with couch, chair, desk and flat screen TV. Fabric covered all the walls and one wall of our room was covered with mirrors, we had 2 full closets, mini bar and fridge. A hallway and another storage area seperated the bedroom/sitting area from the bathroom. The bathroom was marble and had a separate toilet area. The first night our bed was 2 singles pushed together and we requested it be changed out with a king and the staff accommodated our request. The change in bed made our room perfect! The room was considered a deluxe and was extremely spacious for European standards. We overlooked the street in front of the hotel and the room was very quiet at night. (The windows have shutters internally and externally which when closed shut out any noise that may exist.) Each morning, I would open the shutters and windows and listen to the hustle bustle of the city waking up. We celebrated our first night in Rome with Champagne in our room complimentary of the Hassler! Second, Continental breakfast was included with our room rate and I am glad we choose this option. We had variety of fruits, cheese, specialty meats, croissants, breads, yogurt, cereal and juices. The coffee or cappuccino was delicious! (As it is everywhere in Italy). They also had a hot food section with eggs, bacon, pancakes, etc, but they would add 10 Euros per person for the hot food section. My husband ate the hot items some mornings and said they were very good. The wait staff was very prompt and friendly too. Third, the entire staff at this hotel was extremely helpful and friendly. We spoke to the concierge staff daily and they had great advice no matter what the topic. The reception staff took care of our every request. Every Hassler employee from the cleaning personnel to doorman would great us with bon jour! and a big smile. I read other reviews that the staff was pretentious, but we did not experience this at all. Finally, and most important \u2013 the Location! The location of this hotel cannot be surpassed. Literally top of the Spanish Steps and a view of Rome cannot be surpasses! We explored Rome from this hotel daily and you can walk to most locations very easily. We took a taxi to the Vatican and it was about a 10 minute ride. There is fabulous shopping at the bottom of the Spanish Steps so make sure you have several hours to explore the hustle and bustle of the shopping district and all top quality of the clothing and shoes (everything is made in Italy not China like in the US!!) We ate at several restaurants nearby from a local pizzeria to a fine ristorante\u2019 \u2013 all great experiences. We never planned on where we would eat, just walk and look at the menus and then make our choice. Be sure to some time at the Villa Borghese which is a lovely park that truly takes you away from the busy streets of Rome. We spent half a day there walking and exploring and ate at little caf\u00e9 there. Right next door to the Hassler is the Trinita dei Monti church with classic sculptures and abundant artwork and again, from the church steps, a view of Rome that is unsurpassed. Overall, the Hassler is a classy, 5 star hotel that deserves the respect of those that stay there. Please take note that any negative comments about this hotel or staff should be taken lightly. I would highly recommend this hotel and location to anyone that can afford it.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGrand but not great!\u201d", "Author": "Mary60898", "ReviewID": "UR119563065", "Content": "We have just spent two great weeks in Italy.

We were given a nice room, very chic decor but the window faced the street and the noise was very loud, not good for sleeping. We asked to be moved to a quiet room and they were very nice in doing so. We moved our things and all was great until the bells at the church rang early ever morning. The walls are very thin and you could hear your neighbors as well as the things going on in the hall. We ordered room service one morning as we had an early Vatican tour it never arrived and no apology. Also our room at $900.00 a night included breakfast but charged you extra if you had eggs. Having stayed at many five star hotels in Asia and Europe, we found this surprising. Room service prices were somewhat high, and we did not use it as much as we would have liked. All the reviews talked about the location,but truly we checked out the Westin and the Marriott and some other hotels and for the price and more quiet location I would think twice.

We were proven wrong. Nobody from the familiy showed up to at least say hello, just plenty of very freindly personel running around. The concierges are perfect! They were extremely helpful in suggesting restaurants that made a difference and were really Italian style. The concierge arranged for the best tourguide we ever had, the guide was a walking dictionnary. Wifi worked well and at no charge. We also tried the praised one star Imago restaurant on the roof top. Great view overlooking the city if you catch a window table. But clearly that evening it was no one star cuisine. Macarons filled with somethng fishy as pre starters, I guess macarons are really way out if you await inventive sophisticated cuisine. The pigeon was tasteless and topped with sticky sauce but the sorbettos were lovely. Very expensive view on Rome but exellent service! The room we had was lovely furnitured, spacy, clean with daily change of sheets. Welcome fruit basket, macarons(! again), still and sparkling water on the table on arrival. View from the room onto Rome skyline or Spanish Steps is very lovely in the early morning hours but at midnight (you can put the clock) garbage collecting is quite noisy. Breakfast is either in a lovely outside patio if weather permits or in the bar / library area. Funny to have breakfast sitting on sofas but also funny to find a breakfast buffet that could be anywhere than Rome. We missed the typical cornetto that you normally get in Italian bars. Same kind of fresh fruits and other products everyday - nothing changed at least as long as we stayed. Don\u00b4t ever ask anything exceptional or an early breakfast, the team of girls just cannot cope with this and ignore you, forget about service.

So, I'll start this review by saying that we arrived on the Orient Express and also stayed in the Luna Hotel Baglioni in Venice, the Hotel Relais dell'Orologio in Pisa and Il San Pietro in Positano. All the hotels that we stayed in had free WiFi, which was very nice change from UK hotels! The Hassler is beautiful with an enviable location at the top of the Spanish Steps. Our room was fabulous ... a really good size, with an extremely comfortable bed, a small seating area and desk. It also had a large bathroom, complete with large bottles of good quality products and large cakes of soap that you can actually use (rather than the fiddly pea-sized things that you normally find). One small problem was the nail file, which had been pre-used. Yuk. The terrace at the top of the hotel is the perfect place for room service to come and serve you a drink, whilst you watch the sun set over beautiful Rome. The view is phenomenal. And getting room service to do the drinks is a lot better than going downstairs to the bar, where the waiters are much more interested in chatting with each other rather than serving. They seemed to find it strange that we wanted another round of drinks before dinner ... so strange that we had to send an envoy to walk up to the bar in order to attract anyone's attention. Then the second round of drinks arrived but without the olives and nuts being refreshed. That's pretty poor if you're paying nearly \u20ac100 for six drinks. My other gripe is the paying for breakfast. Not actually having to pay but having to wait for their amazingly antiquated system to print out a bill that I then need to sign. Most hotels simply check you in as you walk into breakfast, rather than worrying about signing bills. Make sure you eat in Imago, the restaurant in the hotel.

The first morning we were woken up at 8am by the housekeeping staff being terribly noisy in the room next door. After complaining we were told it would be resolved but the noise continued on and happened the next morning as well. The food I can't even describe how horrible it is. First off we order a chicken and avocado sandwich to room service which was 20\u20ac and when it comes it's a ham and lettuce sandwich, when we send it back they say \"oh well there was no avocado\". Wouldn't it of then been a good time to call up and ask us if we wanted something else? After bringing us a diff kind of sandwich over 25 mins later they still charged us for it. Not to even mention that it looked like the simple kind of sandwich you would pack in a kids lunch. The buffet in the morning was small and overpriced and to have any kind of drink on the courtyard at night, even a coke it was 10\u20ac for a skinny glass with ice in it. The rooms were not very clean, there was lotion from someone else all along the bathroom wall, and smudges in the glass part of the shower. The walls are so thin you could hear everyone in the halls or rooms next to you. And the lights are difficult to control as most of the switches in our room didn't work. Over all the location is the only great part of the hotel, but there was at least 7 other hotels within a few blocks that I'm sure would be cheaper, friendlier, cleaner and have better food. Don't waste your time.

However if you are looking for a true luxury experience with all the associated amenities, location and service and go out of their way staff this is it! We called this property at 10 pm at night as we were leaving the hotel we had originally checked into due to no AC and mechanical issues and misleading reviews and pictures and zero value for your money. Thankfully Elizabeth at the reception answered my call. She understood our issue, and need to find a suitable room fast for three days. She immediately offered us a room and would stay until we arrived to ensure we were settled and happy in the room. She even offered to show us the room even before we committed. She never asked for cc# or cell #. Just my name and she would take care of us upon arrival. 20 minutes after leaving our bad experience we were taken to a lovely air conditioned room overlooking their palm court. She even called room service and told them to wait for us as we were hungry and she knew the kitchen was almost closing. We ordered food and it arrived in what seemed like minutes along with a lovely fruit tray and champagne tom welcome us. All of this considering we had called out of the blue in one of their busiest times for tourists in Rome. Concierge is great honest and provided us with a private tour guide at short notice at very reasonable rates. Doorman is extremely helpful, nice and welcoming. All staff here smile, and look to please you and are not in your face. This is what service is. Hotel is well located beautifully appointed. The room we were given was renovated spotless and the bed is exceptional. Breakfast buffet in the garden is quiet and perfect for starting your day. A little bit of everything.

They went out of the way to make our stay a pleasant one. The hotel is very exclusive and yes many famous people stay there. The police out the front and the odd viewing of the said famous people reinforce this. It is thoroughly charming and very picturesque. It is also not as super expensive as the best hotels of Paris, New York, Tokyo or London. BUT you really need to choose your room. Lesson 1 - there are rooms that are renovated and rooms that are not! They quickly moved us to a better room from our un-renovated monster which was lovely of them because I was going to cry if I had to stay in room105. They also moved us to an even more modern room on the second day while we were out segwaying! Lesson 2 - don't ask for the view of the Spanish steps. The garden view rooms were all booked out for a reason. Rome is noisy ( we had a car alarm keep us awake for an hour one night) and the road at the top of the Spanish steps/ the base of the hotel is a very busy one, strangely. Go to the restaurant Imago to experience the view! The standard of luxury hotels in Rome is not what I would expect in a major tourist destination. We have stayed in one other on a previous occasion and walking the streets as you do in this city, it becomes pretty clear that there is a certain rustic charm to all of the hotels. You have to accept that you are going to get character. So, what should you get from my review? I really do believe that the Hassler is one of the best that Rome has to offer and the service was flawless, but make sure you ask for what you want. Is a modern bathroom important?

The Hassler is expensive, but the hotel came well-recommended and Virtuoso guests are usually privy to upgrades. The Hassler is a lovely if smallish old property with a prime location near the Spanish Steps. When I arrived, they showed me my upgrade. A tiny room on the second floor overlooking the street. (Nice bedspread and a wall hanging, but subpar in terms of size and amenities. In a word, disappointing.) It was noisy, and I wouldn't have been able to sleep. They then offered me my \"original room\", which they said was one of their new ones. This one was on the first floor and overlooked their restaurant courtyard. I am a world traveler. I have stayed at rooms in luxury hotels all over the world. This was the smallest, saddest room I have ever seen. 225-250 square feet, with adjoining bathroom. Walls painted white. No decorations. Small plasma. Quite simply, an outrage. I was told this was the only other room they had available. They were sold out. But since I was there for four nights, they would try to move me. I took the room because it was quiet. (The woman at the hotel front deskl said \"No one told us you wanted a quiet room.\") I contacted my travel agent. She said she would talk to the hotel. That day, radio silence from the Hassler. Then, the next night -- halfway into my stay -- a bottle of wine and some chocolates appeared with a note: \"Sorry you are unhappy with your room. We will try to move you as soon as something else becomes available.\" And that was the last I heard from the good people at the Hassler. Four nights, 600 plus per night, and a room that would have angered you had you been given it at a Motel 6. All of which left me feeling cynically exploited and ruined my stay. Now, the Hassler does have some very lovely rooms. I know, because I saw them. But perhaps if you are not paying 1000 a night, you don't get them. Nearby, for less money, you can stay at the Sofitel and the Eden, and get fantastic rooms. The apathy, unfortunately, extended to the concierge. When I arrived, I explained that I like eating at Michelin star restaurants. But given the fact that I was exhausted, could he recommend something local? He packs me off to a nearby place that specialized in meat. The place was overrun with Americans. What's worse -- it was so crowded that despite my \"reservation\", I couldn't even get the restaurant to take my name. (A passing waiter said the restaurant was \"on fire\", a reference to how busy it was.) So after fifteen minutes, I walked back to the hotel and got the concierge to make a reservation at another local restaurant. I got a table promptly. But the food was mediocre. On the plus side, they have wireless internet -- for $28/night. My advice is to make damn sure about the room you are getting before you book a reservation. And if you are not a VIP or a dignitary -- or paying a king's ransom --do not expect to be treated well.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOk but nothing special\u201d", "Author": "TexasGal7890", "ReviewID": "UR100053735", "Content": "This hotel was sort of a disappointment.

After reading some of these very negative reviews, I must say that I am regretting suggesting the Hassler to them. I can only hope that they have great accomodations and leave with the unforgettable memories that I have. If that is not the case, I will feel responsible for a their less than acceptable experience. I am so disappointed to hear how once such a desireable Hotel has changed so drastically.

We stayed in 5 star hotels throughout Italy, and 4 out of the 5 hotels that we stayed in were all LHW hotels, and they did not disappoint, until this one!!! The reception when we checked in showed us around the hotel, showed us where breakfast was served, and explained that it was included in our rate, then we were taken to our room, which she told us was also upgraded (if this room was considered an upgrade, then I'd hate to see what our original room would have been like). Our room was filthy- garbage still in the trash can, dusty and overall very dark and small. I'm not sure why they have turn down service, because I am not sure exactly what they do, because the only thing that was done when we had it was that the pillows from on top of the bed were \"thrown\" into a corner of the room, not even put away nicely in the closet. For what this hotel charges, they didn't even provide water at turn down, which EVERY other hotel that we stayed in did. Next problem that we had was the next morning when we went to breakfast. There was a breakfast buffet, (no big deal), which included pastries, salami's, cheeses, and 2 chafing dishes of hot food, 1 eggs, and 1 with bacon (which there was never enough of because every time they filled it, by the time I got to it, it was gone). Again, all throughout our trip, we stayed in 5 star hotels, which included breakfast, with buffets just like this one, and even better. At the end of breakfast we were given a bill, in which we questioned, they said that only the pastries were included in our rate, and since we had \"hot\" food we would be charged an extra 10 euros. DISGUSTING is the first word that comes to mind when I think about this and what happened. Not only were we not told about this, but when we questioned them, they became so rude and argumentative, certainly not what you would expect from a 5 stay Luxury Hotel such as this one. We wound up going to the front, and again, the gentlemen became argumentative, and stated that hot food was not inlcuded, and we should have been told. A hotel of this class, should be ashamed of themselves. 500 euros a night, and to offer a what they call a buffet, and only allow some guest to have hot food is ridiculous!!! And to then argue with customers is even worse in my opinion. We didn't have time to speak to the manager as we had a tour reserved, but when we got back we spoke to the front desk manager, who was already briefed on what had happened, and did do the right thing, by removing the charge, and apologizing, but still that was not the point. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone. A friend of mine warned us not to stay here, and to stay at the DeRussie, but unfortunately we did not listen, as we thought the location of this hotel was great, and thought how bad could it be, as it was LHW, and has been around for a while. All I can say is I wish we had listened!!! I will say I did like the location, but not enough to overcome everything else that happened here.

Yes, the street outside is busy and noisy with cars and people but that's Italy. It's at the top of the Spanish Steps, with spectacular views over the Rome skyline from some rooms. This is not the hotel for you if you want something modern. It's an old-world hotel, in an old-world (wonderful) location. Some of the rooms are very beautiful, with rich colours and lovely textiles. Cleaning was not as good as one expects from this class of hotel - floor in bedroom and hall always had very visible flecks of dirt on them; someone else's short thick hair on a shelf in the bathroom during the whole of a 3 day stay; and tired, slightly grubby paintwork, despite a relatively recent renovation.... The public areas are very disappointing. Some walls have mosaic tiles which must date from the 1930's, which are very attractive, if not everyone's taste. The rest, however, is a jumble of styles and heavy colours - shiny black and white; heavy 1980's reds. The furniture in the lobby and next to the garden restaurant, particularly some yellow sofas, are tired and dirty. Net curtains on the windows in the loos downstairs badly needed cleaning. The garden at the back is potentially gorgeous but the paintwork is faded, the awning dirty and the furniture very tired. The staff at the reception, the concierges and the room staff were charming and incredibly helpful, with one or 2 exceptionally helpful people (the events manager is excellent, charming and unflappable). The indoor and garden restaurants staff at lunchtime were pretty sloppy - very slow in bringing menus. One can be happy to wait for food to be cooked freshly but not to wait for the waiter all the time - even getting a menu took about 10 minutes every time. Rome is not famous among Italians for food but considering how well one can eat in Italy for relatively little, the food is very mediocre. The mark-up on wines is enormous. On a more positive note, contrary to another review, the breakfast was absolutely plentiful and delicious with a lot of choice. Pretty expensive at 31 Euros for the basis breakfast or 52 Euros for the full cooked breakfast. The hotel has a lot of charm, is in a wonderful location but really needs someone to pull it together. The beautiful bedrooms hidden away are let down by the terrible public areas. It would be a tremendous shame if it was completely turned into a shiny new hotel but much more effort needs to be put into making the whole thing look loved and into ensuring that every aspect and every detail, including the food, are impeccable. The overwhelming suspicion is that this is a once-wonderful hotel, that has turned into a cash cow due to its reputation and location with an endless supply of tourists. Other hotel in other cities (like the Bristol in Paris or the Beau-Rivage in Geneva) are also family-owned but are a million miles ahead in terms of cleanliness and standards across every aspect of the hotel.

The suite, with a double view (partial city view and full view towards the gardens of the Villa Medici and the nearby school) was decorated in a very individual style, with silk fabric on the wall and the pattern repeated throughout the room (including on the paper basket!).

All the details, like the quality of the toiletries (own brand, Amorvero), of the towels and of the bed linen, were of the highest level. The bar - where smoking is permitted, which is strange, given Italy's very strict smoking ban - and the communicating Salone Eva are nice for a drink in the evening with the live piano. The breakfast buffet at Salone Eva was very standard for 41 euro and should be improved. On the top floor, there is a terrace with a great view of Rome where they also serve drinks. The hotel has a good fitness room with natural day light, next to a lounge terrace overlooking the Spanish Steps. The sauna and steam room are unfortunately not complimentary (30 euro charge).

Every ten minutes after that for a half hour the same thing occurred, needless to say there would be no more sleep that morning I just feel for the kind of money they charge at the Hassler, this is grossly unfair If going to the Hassler ask for a room on the garden side, the noise level will be much less Other than that the hotel is beautiful, service is ok, location is outstanding.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morristown, NJ", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "MrandMrsCee95", "ReviewID": "UR29839545", "Content": "Unbelievable hotel atop the Spanish Steps.

It remains in private hands which is where it should stay. I would thoroughly recommend that one chooses a Rome city side view, our room overlooked the Spanish Steps which provided an eternal view on the city, watching the comings and goings of the constant activity below. Bed was brilliant, little short though.... Spa was lovely, try the hot stone massage. The Imago restaurant has utterly stunning food with views to match. Surprisingly there are a couple of things that do need addressing. The door isn't terribly well managed, the doormen seem to hide in a vestibule somewhere and aren't all that switched on to arrivals and opening the hotel doors or that of arriving cars. The hotel charges for things that similar standard hotels stopped charging for years ago; e.g. In room films, Internet, Mineral Water.

We had a gorgeous Grand Deluxe double room overlooking the Spanish Steps and the rooftops of Rome. From our room we could actually see the dome of St. Peter's Basilica. What a glorious sight at night! Also, April in Rome was just bursting with color from all of the spring blooms making it that much more spectacular. From the hotel you can walk everywhere: Via Condotti, Piazza de Popolo, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Navona, Via Veneto etc. There is also a beautiful outdoor terrace on the 7th floor where you can just sit and relax and take in the breathtaking views. My husband and I would unwind there with a glass of wine at the end of our day. La Dolce Vita! I would also like to mention the absolutely delicious buffet breakfasts-a definite highlight. One of the other many things we especially loved about the Hassler was the impeccable service. I can't imagine it being any better. You feel like royalty when you are there. The whole staff couldn't have been more accommodating and welcoming. Our special thanks to Roberto Coluccio at Reception and Ricardo at the Concierge desk. They took care of everything. I would also highly recommend the spa. The treatments are so luxurious and once again the service was wonderful.

I booked the hotel directly 8 months in advance, and asked for a room with a view and a king bed. We got both. The concierge was most polite in our email exchange, and reserved tickets for the Borghese Gallery for us, which we would not have been able to get had we waited until we arrived on 17 Nov. He handed the reservation number to me as I checked in. The reception staff welcomed us promptly, no waiting, and showed us to our room on the 5th floor (#506). The bags were brought up shortly thereafter. He explained all the functions of the room, from the bedside buttons that opened the curtains and dimmed the lights to the TV/wireless computer that was personnalized with our name. Then he showed us the balcony. I have to admit, I'm a bit of a romantic, and seeing the view from our small balcony almost made me cry. The bed was comfortable, the shower equipped with both the shower head and a separate spray handle for the tub. The tub was laid out like a lounge chair, and very comfortable. There was a full supply of toilettries - very nice. Hand towels were the size of normal bath sheets and the bath sheets (which were on the heated towel rack) were larger than most of my beach towels. If I wrapped it around me under my arms, they reached my ankels. Water pressure was good. Of course, big fluffy robes and slippers were provided. The maids did a nightly turndown service in addition to the daily cleaning, and folded any clothes we left out. Oh, for my fellow Americans, they had outlets for both Italian and American applicances, so we could charge our cameras and cell phone without adapters. We asked for a deluxe room, 1 step up from the entry room. I did notice some traffic noise on Monday & Tuesday am, but not on Sunday. It's a busy street , so some nosie is to be expected. Never noticed noise from inside the hotel. There were a lot of mirrors in the room, which gave it the appearance of being larger than it actually was. Still, we managed to get all 4 of our luggage from the cruise out from under foot. There was also a small hallway with a separate bedroom door, that we could close if we wanted to keep out noise from the hall. The bathroom was off this small hallway. Overall, not a bad size room for Europe. And the room was beautiful, and not overly feminine. There was a small relief decorating the wall, and lots of little touches to give the room a very elegant feel. Continental breakfast that was included in the price was also exceptional. Sevearl types of juice, bacon, sausage, veggies, scrambled eggs, multiple cereals, 5 types of yogurt, and lots of pastries. The service was spot on. Best coffee my husband had in Europe. I had tea. On 2 occassions, my husband called for ice, and it was borught wihtin 5 minutes along with spare glasses. Contrary to previous posts, we did not feel anyone was rude to us. When we asked for help finding a casual restaurant, the concierge gave us a map to help us find the place. Never had to wait for taxis, as there is a waiting area directly outside the hotel. The maid was nice enough to take a picture of us from the balcony for us. What not to expect - A pool. Large rooms if you book the entry rooms. Patrons tended to dress in what I would call \"business casual\", no T-shirts. It was cold outside, so no shorts of course. Do not expect a \"fun\" or party atmosphere. This hotel is elegant, and patrons act in a reserved, respectful manner towards other guests and the staff. Some may call it \"Stuffy\", but it was just what I wanted. As with most European hotels, no shower curtain - they have a glass wall to block the water. What to expect: World class service. I have stayed at so called \"5-star\" hotels before, but nothing has come close to the level of service I received here. They greated me by name every time we entered the lobby. They even start the revolving door for you. Everyone spoke English very well. Is it expensive - Yes. Is it worth it? That's your call. For me, the stay at the Hassler was the highlight of my European trip. We visited the St. Regis, which was our 2nd choice, just to see the difference, but decided we will stay at the Hassler again.

OK, the location is perfect. We had a room on the 1st Floor overlooking the Spanish Steps - great during the day but a nightmare at night / early mornings due to the noise.

The room and bathroom were very small - not what we expected for over \u00a3400 per night. The staff forgot to replenish the towels twice which was also mildly irritating. Breakfast was VERY average.

It is not possible in Rome to book in a \"nicer\", or \"high end\" hotel for 4 people in one room....this apparently has something to do with strict fire codes and the amount of people that are allowed to \"officially\" cohabitate per sq. meter. While I paid almost $1200 Euros per night for my two rooms at the Hassler, I feel that I easily got my money's worth. The hotel sent a very nice and capable driver to the airport to pick up my family. The cost of this service was $140 Euro, but was well worth it. The fellow was polite, efficient, friendly and very informative. We were aware of the fact that we were staying as guests in a very high-end, exclusive hotel, and that showing up looking like bedraggled riffraff was not acceptable. We were therefore attired smartly, and found the reception at the hotel was warm, friendly, efficient and motivated. We were shown immediately to our beautifully decorated, spacious and very well appointed rooms by a friendly concierge. Tipping in Rome is not like it is in America...the Concierge politely informed me that larger tips were greatly appreciated, but unnecessary. Smaller tips (a Euro or three) were sufficient. This information was greatly appreciated. The concierge was very helpful with providing maps and suggestions on what to see and how to get around. He even provided me with a jogging map of Rome, which was very nice! I probably jogged 10km per morning, and found that to be a beautiful experience! The view from our rooms was breathtaking, to say the least. The hotel is located at the top of the Spanish Steps, and the view is resultingly dramatic and unlike anything you could experience anywhere else in Rome. The streets in Rome (in the walled city)are very clean, and are cleaned daily by street cleaners. Outside of the walled city is a different matter. The beds were surprisingly comfortable, and the sheets were very high-end (800 thread count or higher). The towels were gigantic and very plush! The room was nicely air conditioned and was a welcome respite from the sometimes oppressive heat of Rome! We probably walked at least 20-30 km per day with our kids, enjoying ourselves at various piazzas along the way. When we required a taxi from the hotel, the concierge had one magically appear within 5 minutes of our request. One day, with little warning, the concierge was also able to magically have a tour guide meet us at the hotel to guide us through the Vatican (we still had to hire a taxi, which the concierge was also happy to arrange). The experience was amazing, and easily worth the $60 Euros/hour that the guide charged. Dinner on the rooftop of the hotel was breathtaking, as we were able to experience the setting sun over Rome in the middle of summer while we dined with our kids and our friends. The bill for dinner for the 8 of us (with wine and belini's) was about $700 Euros. The food was good (but could have been quite a bit better for the price we were paying), and the service was attentive, but slow to North American standards (service in Italy at restaurants is usually slow, as dinner is expected to take at least a couple of hours). Overall, it is a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" experience to dine at the Hassler's rooftop restaurant, but I found the food in the piazza restaurants to be quite a bit better. Breakfast was included with our rooms, and was served in a beautiful garden restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. The breakfast was absolutely fantastic (fresh juice selections, pastries, pancetta, eggs, etc., etc.). A great deal of care was taken to provide an excellent breakfast buffet, and it was a great way to start the day. I should note that a computer room with two computers and an unlimited connection to the internet was provided for hotel guests. You can pay half as much to stay at a cheaper hotel outside of the walled city, and waste half of your time and nerve saving a buck by taking the transit into the walled city (where everything is)...but by the time you do all that, half of your day is already gone and you have to ask yourself how much a portion of your vacation day is worth?...my experience is that you're much better off shelling out for a nicer experience and to \"be\" where everyone is trying to get to. We will definitely visit Rome again, and we will not hesitate to stay at the Hassler.

The breakfast buffet on the main floor courtyard has enough selection of fruits, pastries, scrambled eggs and bacon, fresh juices and excellent cappucino to start the day quickly and sufficiently. The location at the top of the Spanish Steps is what I would say is the best part of the hotel.

All the best shopping is at the bottom of the steps, and sights such as the Colosseum and Trevi Fountain are within an easy walking distance.

They accommodated our room move with grace, the concierges made our bookings, and the door men courtious and polite.

I replied that I did and he waved me away. I was proved right when umpteen guides offered us guided tours within minutes of getting off the metro. It just seems as if they just regard us as rich tourists there to extract the most amount of money possible. They pretend to have very limited local knowledge and just charge a fortune to get you on the most expensive trips possible. Not great for concierge staff.

While I had stayed at the Hassler previously, during the past couple of years I had been staying at another of Romes top hotels. This past trip I decided to return to the Hassler - as I sort of missed it. I was extremely glad I did make that return to never stay anywhere else while in Rome. I had made my arrangements directly with the hotels website, my reservation request and all correspondance via email was handled expertly with no problems at all. I was also in touch with the concierge via email to arrange for a car and driver to pick me up upon my arrival at the airport along with a couple of restaurant reservations - again all handled expertly. When I arrived early in the morning at the Hassler my room was ready and I was quickly checked in and brought to my room - as well as being welcomed back. My room in the deluxe category was simply beautiful! Large with tasteful elegant decor - very old world European. I had requested a front room - to which I was given. The room had been recently renovated - updated. From the carpet on the floor being removed and the hardwood floor refinished to their new state of the art televsion that not only allows one to view television but also enables one to view movies, access the internet along with a built-in alarm clock. The bathroom in my room was also very large with lots of space to place ones toiletries and cosmetics. The room and bath were spotless in regard to cleanliness. Breakfast every morning was in the Salon Eva located on the main lobby floor. Wonderful fresh juices, fruit, yogurts and pastries - along with some cooked eggs - and if there was something more you needed they were more than happy to accomodate your request. The concierge staff is tops to say the least - with great restaurant recommendations. Being that I am a regular visitor to Rome I have been to many many of the top places - this trip I ate in restaurants that I have never been to before - all recommendations of the concierge. There were also a few of the concierge staff who were there when I was last at the Hassler - I was simply stunned when they remembered me. I also tried out two dining options at the Hassler - first being dinner at their Wine Academy just across from the hotel. The Wine Academy is owned by the Hassler hotel - when you enter you feel as if you are in a private dining club (which it sort of is). Very quiet, elegant, top food and excellent wines. I had my waiter pair my wines with each course of my meal and he did this perfectly. With dessert they also offer you their homemade digestives that are eclectic and quite good. I also decided to dine at the Wine Academy one day for lunch which was outdoors on their terrace and again just wonderful. My second dining option was at the hotels new(ly) renovated restaurant on the six floor. Forget that the view is simply breathtaking - the food is superb! I was not expecting the food to be as wonderful as it was - I was simply taken aback to how good it was. Each course was just amazing and their service top notch. Lots of interesting dishes to choose from and a very extensive wine list. I can honestly say that the food is definitely Michelin star worthy and I can only guess that in time they just may be added to the Rome list of Michelin star restaurants. All in all my stay at the Hassler was just excellent. One last little note, as I mentioned this is not my first time here, I was pleasantly surprised upon my arrival to find a bowl of fresh fruit along with a note from the general manager (owner) of the hotel to welcome me back.

I've been going to the Hassler for over thirty years, and there are certain things you have to understand. Like with many of the great hotels of the world, paying the rate just gets you in the door. As a guest you are scrutinized as much as you are scrutinizing the hotel. This is arguably the finest hotel in Rome, and it's guests should reflect it. While the Hassler does not require coats and ties in the lobby, it does have a minimum level of decorum, which should match the ambience of the hotel and the location. Remember, this hotel overlooks the Condotti. Americans have a hard time understanding this concept, but that's hardly the hotel's fault. 1. Dress accordingly. 2. Behave accordingly. This is not a hotel for kids or loudmouths. 3. The Hassler is not for price shoppers, so don't gripe about being \"nickeled and dimed.\" 4. The hotel does tend to stick people towards the back. Specifically request a room towards the front and be prepared to pay for it. I've arrived looking like I belonged in a hostel and wound up over the service kitchen someone else mentioned. 5. The Hassler has maybe the best hotel restaurants in Italy. If you want to see Rome and die, the best place to do it may be the rooftop resaurant at sundown. 6. Be a repeat. They do keep track of their guests. I''ve had among the handsomest rooms and the kindest service of anywhere in the world. The last stay was no different. After climbing those Spanish Steps after a morning of walking the piazzas and shopping the Condotti, there's nothing like heading straight for the wonderful, serene bar off the reception and ordering a Bellini made from scratch. And there is nothing like getting dressed up later, then having dinner on the roof while watching the sun go down with the city at your feet.
