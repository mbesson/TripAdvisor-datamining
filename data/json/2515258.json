The room was quite big by European standards, and compared to some of the other hotels we've stayed in before. Nice, bright bathroom that faced the street with a window. Bed was sufficiently comfortable. Even on the second floor, noise was not an issue as the hotel is not on a main street. There is a small elevator in the hotel if you need one. We didn't take the breakfast the hotel offered for an additional fee, instead we went to a near by boulangerie every morning. All of the staff members we've encountered were warm and courteous. You can eat take out food in the breakfast area, which is a bonus. The location is great! in the centre of Le Marais (in the 4th arrondisment), steps away from sights, restaurants, shops.

I would say that during summer, the rooms can get extremely hot as there is no A/C but of course this did not bother us in January. Both times the rooms were on the top floor and both quite large given normal Parisian standards. One in particular had a lovely view over the roof tops of Paris! The rooms have quirky little touches and the hotel as well has a quirky bohemian feel, very relaxing and a nice place to come back to after a long day walking the streets of Paris. We always found the staff very helpful especially given my schoolgirl french and therefore english was mainly used. They helped us out booking restaurants as well as generally assisting with any queries we had. The free WIFI in the hotel is also a bonus, just ask and they will give you the code. I am a very light sleeper and both times I stayed I was woken up with noisy next door neighbours. The lady was so loud on the second visit that when she came in at 12:30am at night she was extremely inconsiderate to her neighbours as I am sure the whole floor would have heard her. And the banging of the doors that is mentioned in previous reviews also rings true. I would suggest if you are a light sleeper to bring ear plugs. Besides these problems, the hotel is in a truly fantastic location in the Marais, with a gorgeous courtyard filled with restaurants a minute away and the wonderful shops of the Marais and St Paul antique markets nearby. St Pauls Metro is only a 5 minute walk. On our second trip the main metro to get to the hotel from Gard Du Nord was being refurbished, so it was a bit of a hike with bags from the other metro line we had to catch , but hopefully this may now be fixed. The atmosphere in the Marais is second to none and I would not bother with breakfast as there are so many great patiserries/cafes to grab some delicious Parisian pastries and a coffee. There are also some great cheese shops about 5 minutes from the hotel as well as a supermarket if you need it. All in all I would definitely stay at Jeanne D'Arc again and again as for the price, the relaxing and welcoming bohemian feel of the hotel, great service & the brilliant location, it is second to none.

The photos on this site of the hotel are spot on, which is why I am not uploading any additional photos. We stayed in room 45 which was equipped with an armoire to store our clothes, a small desk and a TV. The queen size bed was quite comfortable, although it did sag a bit in the middle (noticeable from outside the bed, but once in you couldn't tell at all). The bathroom was small, but it looked recently remodeled and it had a shower (no bathtub, which is preferable for us, although some rooms did have baths). We took multiple showers a day (as it was hot in Paris when we were there and we were doing a lot of walking) and there was always hot water and great water pressure - even by US standards. The view from our room was of the other rooms in the hotel (interior ventilation), which wasn't ideal, but was perfectly fine -- we had no intention of sitting in the hotel room and looking at the sights of Paris, we wanted to get out and really see them. The interior window also cut down on the street noise. I am a light sleeper and I heard no street noise or noise from other rooms or the hallways in the hotel. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, because there were so many great pastry shops in the neighborhood. While this hotel was great, there were a few things I didn't care for. When we dropped our luggage off before our room was ready, the woman at the front desk just left them in the lobby and not in the luggage room - nothing was stolen but it was a bit unsettling. When using the shower the entire bathroom got drenched. The shower curtain didn't quite go all the way to the base of the tub so it was a mess once you were finished showering. The real question: Would I stay here again on my next trip to Paris: WITHOUT A DOUBT. The price was excellent, the beds were comfy, the rooms were adequate and the location was absolutely perfect.

I was also a solo traveller. I stayed in a \"Jeanne d'Arc\" hotel in Marais. I took the RER B train to Chatelet metro station and then Metro #1 to the metro stop close to the hotel. Very simple and convenient and cheap. The only thing is that if you have more luggage that may not work. I had a carry on and a suitcase and I had to lift it up quite a few times on my way back to the airport. No problem for me, but it may be for someone else. The other option is a bus and a cab, or a cab all the way. Hotel was great, relatively cheap for the location and very clean. I suggest you book it early as it was completely full for the time I was there. Staff there was quite helpful..and even when I requested items like a knife, bottle opener, a wine glass, that was no issue as they do have a kitchen as well (you can order a breakfast for 6 euros while there). The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they didn't have internet connection on a computer on the ground floor for all 5 days I was there (they said it should work , but it actually never did and I think they just kept saying so just to get everyone of their back). I ate breakfast at the hotel a few mornings, but really preffered going to the \"Miss Manon\"'s boulangerie on rue Saint-Antoine (just around the corner from the hotel). Lovely pastries, desserts and amazing cafe creme. Hotel is located in a very nice area although close to a little courtyard with a few restaurants. There was a bit of noise outside from time to time, but it didn't prevent me from sleeping. Normally it gets quiet around midnight. Metro station was only a few minutes (3-4) away from the hotel - very convenient. I had walked most of the time, but ended up taking metro a few times just to be able to get to a few places. I didn't have an itinerary and just decided what I'm going to do the day before. Didn't go to Louvre (gasp!!) but did visit a free historical museum of Paris - Carnavalet (Marais) which was very interesting and Musee d'Orsay for all the impressionists' work. Both museums were excellent. My goal was really to walk around and see as much as I can on foot. Wanted to enjoy as much architecture as I can and find a spot to have a cofee and people watch (mind you, I didn't do as much of that as I should have). I did go to some major attractions - Eiffel Tower, Monmartre, Louvre (well, the building, Tuillers Gardens etc), Notre Dame, St-Germain area, Jardin de Luxembourg, Pantheon, Place de la Concorde, Arc de Triomphe, The Champs-Elysees, Opera Garnier, Grand and Petip Palais, Musee Carnavalet & Musee d'Orsay, Place des Vosges, Hotel de Ville (City Hall), Centre Pompidou, both islands of the city and the bridges...:) By total coincidence I came across two restaurants that were recommended in Lonely Planet guide and I ate at both of them: Chez Marianne (jewish, Marais) and Le Petit Marche (Marais). Both were very good. The rest of the places I ate at were OK. (do recommend getting a falafel sandwich at the Chez Marianne...if you're just getting something to go - I ended up having a 'sit down' dinner and a sandwich another day). People and waiters(!) were generally helpful and considerate. If you showed even slight interest in French, the waiters were more than happy to help you. I didn't get too much into conversation with anyone, but generally only had nice experience and found that quite a few people spoke at least a bit of English. I didn't really see any pickpocketing or hassling going on...except for a few bracelet guys that were easily avoidable (but I did talk to a girl who ended up fighting with one of them after she let him put a bracelet on her). A few gypsy women would ask you if you speak English....just saying 'no' would make them go away. I did see signs everywhere in the metro to be aware of pick-pocketing so I'm sure that is an issue when it is really crowded. I didn't experience that.. Overall, it was a great, great experience and I'm definitely planning to go back again to do the rest of the sightseeing...like taking a cruise on Seine at night. Hope this helps a bit... Just be aware that we all have different expectations from our travels when you read the posts. Someone would not even bother picking up suitcase and carry it down a flight of stairs, while some like me...didn't even think twice about it.

The first 2 nights we were put in a room on the 3rd floor. The room had a rustic/charming decor to it and the bathroom was very large. The pillows and bed were comfortable and since we were in a corner room, we had a decent view as well. Then we left Paris for a short trip to Provence and stayed in this hotel again for another 3 nights. This time, we were super lucky. For some reason, we were given their largest & nicest room in the hotel. It's their suite for 4 people. It had a double size bed, a separate room with 2 additional single size bed and a brand new beautiful large modern bathroom. The decor of the room was different from the other rooms as it was more modern too. I was a little confused why we were given that room since there were only the 2 of us so we had asked the person at the front desk if the room was still 89 euro/night for us and it was! If I was to actually book this room, it will cost 170 euro/night! We were very lucky. It is the only room on the ground floor (room #2). Before leaving for Paris, I was a afraid about the noise issue of this hotel from the reviews I was reading. You can definitely hear people outside & inside the hotel talking or the garbage guy collecting all the city garbage. This didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. ALthough for light sleepers, I would recommend a different hotel. Overall, it's a great hotel in the middle of the Marais. The location is fantastic!

Ok this hotel is in Paris and in a very desirable location - in the historic Marais and close to all major attractions and subway. That's where the story ends. For less money we have stayed in equally desirable locations in other cities in the world with complimentary breakfast thrown in. This place seems to be in a perpetual state of home handyman style renovation. The foyer looks good but then the 'fun' begins. First we were given a room on the bottom floor which wasn't too bad but extremely noisy as it faced a side alley so couldn't open the window. The receptionist offered to move us to a 'very good' room on the third floor. This turned out to be worse in several respects than the first room. No mirror at all in the main room, a tiny bathroom with a shower head that we had to tape up with gafa tape to keep from falling down and the bath took over half an hour to drain after the shower. We fared better than our friends upstairs who had to sit in the bath holding the shower hose over their head to have a shower as the water pressure did not want to defy gravity. The bath and shower were clean but tiles above the bath were very grubby and covered in mould as was the ceiling in the bathroom. Friends upstairs on the fifth floor said their whole bathroom was mould covered. Beds were comfortable enough and bedding clean. Decor horrific...but expected for a two star hotel. Generally quite a stingy hotel with nothing extra offered. Asked for an iron as we had been travelling for a long timeand local laundromats did not offer ironing. Asked if there was an ironing room downstairs that we could use. Told by Stefan - one of the receptionts - that the hotel used to have an ironing room but no longer had one. When I asked him if he could provide an iron for guests he said that he would try to find one but 'it would be difficult'. Twenty four hours an iron materialised as did a mirror for the main room which I was told not to break as they like it very much. Dutifully returned the iron on the last day to a female receptionist (Virginie) who was in the company of a friend? employee? She dramatically exclaimed that we should never have had this iron as people had ironed on the carpets previously and caused damage and that the iron should have been used downstairs. She also mentioned dramatically that if the owner found out that the iron had been used in the room she (the owner)would be most upset. Virginie spoke in French to her companion whilst inspecting the underside of the iron (presumably for tell-tale carpet fibres!!). I resisted the urge to comment that no way would I have ironed my clothes on the dirty and stained carpet in the room and that we had wanted to iron our clothes downstairs in the first place. Also resisted the urge at the time to state that this impoliteness to guests was unwarranted given that the problem started initially with an employee. I suggested that she speak to the employee concerned who had given out the precious iron - however she indicated that she did not want to do this (perhaps for fear of upsetting him or the owner) - yes, much better to upset guests instead!! Overall, a dark and uninviting room that needed a total overhaul - OK it is 2 star but still not inexpensive (E116 per night). There are better options and 2 star or not the least that can be expected is a clean bathroom.

I would not really go there with children, young children... this is the gay area - so probably a bit too much explanations to do, when walking in the evening ! The hotel is clean, I think they are refurbishing it (I have a feeling that they are making 6 rooms in each floor where they used to have 4 rooms, but I could be wrong). The bathroom are small, but clean. Showers are ok... The rooms are small, but for what you need to use are ok. The one in the inside of the building (we stayed - nr 45, but all the ending in 5 are the same...not sure abou the other side of the stairs which are the one that have a similar problem) are really small and probably because not much air/light a bit smelly - but once you open the window and turn the fan open it is ok - for short stay eg 3-4 nights. Not for any longer... The hotel is good value for 2 people: 4 people you are probably better off looking for an apartment (160 euro x night and no discount for kids - plus you end up being all in 1 room !!) The breakfast for 6 euro per person is good: fresh baguette, fresh small crossaint, fresh pain choccolate and jam and butter and a cup of coffe - one only of each but in the street you can pay up to 5 euro for 1 cup of coffee.

We were also there while they were renovating so there was scaffolding up which obstructed our view out the window a bit but other than that it had no effect on us at all. We booked almost a year in advance and they had raised the price of a double by 5 euro but honored the price which we booked it at. Because of renovations they offered us free breakfast or a deduction of 6 euro per person so we took the discount for not having breakfast which made what was already a great value even better. We ended up paying 72 Euro a night for a great little room in a fabulous location. The hotel has very few amenities and the towels are a little thin etc, but it is spotless and the location cannot be beat. The staff, while helpful, are not overly friendly, but more than willing to make restaurant reservations or do their best to answer questions. I'm surprised to read reviews saying that there was no street noise though. There is a courtyard that has outdoor seating for a number of restaurants and bars just a few doors down and if we left our front window open, there was definitely noise from people partying most evenings until well after midnight. And there is a motor bike parking area at the top of the street so there was a lot of motorcycle noise too. Fortunately, we had perfect weather, warm during the day and cool enough at night to close the front window. I'm not sure I'd stay here in the warmer months though.

Few things about the room, the windows open but if you are on the front as we were you hear the trash truck each AM about 7. It was no biggie, we'd simply get up and close the window ; ) The room itself was done in bright yellows and oranges and was very \"spring-like\" in appearance (very cheery). The bathroom had a tub with shower and was very big. The sign on the front desk says that wireless hi-speed internet is only available on the ground floor (the lobby is on the ground floor, one floor up, the 1st floor is where the rooms start, we were on the 2nd floor (3rd by US standards). However, we were able to get the internet in our room without difficulty and at 10euros for the whole week, was definitely worth it (considering that Hiltons and Hyatts charge $10 a day, I was ok with about $15US for the week). We had the breakfast twice (6euros each) and included a croissant, a pain du chocolat, a baguette, butter, jam, coffee or hot chocolate. It was yummy and the days we used it (first full morning in Paris and last full morning in Paris) were very convenient. There are tons of patisseries and boulangeries in the area, though the prices were about equal for the same amount of food. The location is INSANE!!! It is near a zillion restaurants, wine stores, chocolate stores, and the neighorhood is beyond fabulous!! The St. Paul Metro is 3 blocks away. Buy having now stayed in the Marais twice, I have decided that I am not going to ever stay in another area, this seems like it gives you the most realistic Paris experience without being overly touristy.

I wanted a clean, safe, and well-located hotel for a week-long holiday with my 18-year-old daughter--and I didn't want to pay a fortune since I knew we wouldn't be spending that much time in the room anyway. He told me he'd \"recommend the Jeanne d'Arc to royalty\", and while I wouldn't necessarily go that far, I would certainly recommend it to sophisticated, budget-minded travelers. We paid 97 Euros a night (an excellent price for this excellent Marais location) for #22, a large room with a double and a single bed and a large bathroom with a shower and tub. The best way I can describe the decor is to say that it's as if the hotel owner went down to the local DIY store and bought wallpaper and chintz fabric and did the job himself. It was a tad kitschy but very cozy--like staying in the guest room at a beloved aunt's house. It's a quirky place: the rooms are all different; the stairs are uneven; the elevator is like stepping into a coffin; the shower water turns scalding when the person in the next room flushes the toilet. But you know, it's also a really charming place: the breakfast and housekeeping staff greeted us warmly every day; the desk staff were professional and indulgent of our atrocious French; the continental breakfast was fairly priced, ample and delicious. (My daughter, who has travelled frequently with me over the years, pointed out how much she liked the fact that the hotel wasn't \"a cookie-cutter hotel\" like many of the four- and five-star business hotels we have stayed at together. \"This hotel could only be this hotel,\" is how she put it.) The hotel is in an upscale residential district, so you get a sense of living in a real Paris neighborhood--not smack in the middle of touristland. There are great cheese and meat shops and bakeries and fruitstands everywhere. The St. Paul Metro stop is a block and a half away, and is right on the main line that takes you to all the tourist sites. But mostly we just walked everywhere. It's definitely noisy in the morning when the garbage trucks roll around the neighborhood, and during the evening rush hour, so I recommend earplugs if you're sensitive to noise. Both my daughter and I used them every night. Trust me, I looked around a lot and you will not find a better price on a hotel of the same quality and location, so book directly with the hotel as soon as you have confirmed dates. Don't rely on the resellers, because a lot of them told me the place was full on my dates, but when I contacted the hotel directly, they had space for us for 7 nights.

The management were always friendly and were able to extend my stay an extra night at late notice, much to my relief. The hotel is in a great location, close to the St Paul metro stop, so an easy walk with luggage, and in an area full of little eateries and quaint shops. I stayed 3 nights in room #31, which is a small single and at EUR58 particularly good value. Yes it was compact, but the bed was a double pushed against the wall, so more than I had expected. It was comfortable and I suspect this was a recently redecorated room from what other reviewers have mentioned. The presentation was outstanding - clean, no smell, a huge window that opens on to the street, basic furnishings in the way of a desk, cupboard and tv. Tiny bathroom. Literally tiny. But then what more do you really need. As a single woman traveling on my own, I felt this to be a safe neighbourhood. I had the EUR6 breakfast each morning and thought it to be good value. The hotel has a small, light-filled breakfast room sitting perhaps a dozen guests. Your choice of tea/coffee/hot chocolate is served up with a spare milk jug, so enough to make at least a couple of cups, plus half baguette, mini croissant and a second mini chocolate crossiant. Delicious French butter and individual serve of jam are included. Yes you can probably buy cheaper by going direct to the bakery, but for the quiet and convenience I liked the hotel breakfast. It gives you a chance to plan your day. Another benefit is that this breakfast can be delivered to your room at no additional charge. I would not hesitate to stay at the Hotel Jeanne d'Arc and can't wait to make my second visit to Paris. Remember to book well in advance or you'll miss out on this gem. The staff were helpful and friendly, even though I could speak no more than a few words in French. There's an internet cafe within 5-10 minutes walk, also a self-service laundromat a couple of blocks away. I'd also recomment the Place des Vosges for a picnic - plently of locals love this park and you'll see it filled with kids and dogs.

I booked this hotel 3 -4 weeks before I was due to arrive there with my husband for a 4 night stay at the beginning of May 2006. I didn't know what to expect because there hadn't been any reviews in Trip advisor and so I based my decision on a brief review in a guide book. I booked a twin room (which was all that was available) but asked for a double if one became available - by the time we arrived they had remembered my request without any mention of it by me and we were put in a double without any problem at all (which is great service in my book)! My husband and I were very happy with this hotel and would definitely recommend it. Although the room was small (most European hotel rooms are small), it was not tiny and it was clean and comfortable and had enough room for bedside tables, a closet and a table and chair. The bathroom was quite roomy, clean and worked well although I thought it could use some new towels (they felt thin and scratchy). I loved the breakfast of breads and croissants and pastries with jams and the hot chocolate was delicious!!! The hotel reception was great because they spoke English, lent us books on Paris and gave us a great recommendation for dinner (Le Impasse was truly a gastronomic experience without the huge price tag)! We also loved the quaint area around the hotel (small streets, interesting shops and things to look at everywhere you turn) and the Marais was just so fantastic for food (the pastries near the train station are excellent) and there was a great train line very close to the hotel which helped us get around (although we were able to walk to a lot of places from the hotel such as Notre Dame, Ste Chappelle etc).

In the U.S. they would not be in business, but this is true of most two star Paris hotels. For Paris, this place is mostly great: A nice, pleasant clean hotel located a block off a major street in the Marais, the Faobourg St. Antoine - not exactly charming, but very functional. It is about four to five blocks from the St. Paul Metro, which is on the convenient #1 line. The hotel is very clean but very basic. For its price range, it\u2019s one of the best hotels you will find in the Marais \u2013 and in Paris in general. This is a great location and very central to everything. If you don\u2019t go with too many expectations, or if you are used to other budget hotels in Paris, you will find this a pleasant place to stay. Having said that, please read on to see some of the issues that may matter to some folks. The rooms are small but typical of Paris. The mattresses are very very firm \u2013 so depending on what you are used to, this could be an issue for some. The hotel walls are thin, so if you have noisy neighbors you may hear them. We certain heard the flushing in the room next door very loudly. Note that these are all things you expect in small Paris hotels. You do not have any control over the temperature in your room, and everything is very basic. A bed, a TV which does get CNN and BBC, a table and chair are about it. The only problem we had was with the bathroom, which as is the case in many hotels in Paris, did not have a shower \u2013 only a tub. The tub was under the attic slanted roof, so one could not stand in it either. Without a shower curtain and no room to stand, bathing was very difficult using the hand held water hose. Although this is typical in much of Paris, most hotels now do have the showers in many rooms as an option. The towels in this hotel are torn and worn and tiny. This is an area that definitely warrants improvement. The breakfast is definitely not worth it, considering the lovely food you can buy at any caf\u00e9 in the area. My recommendation is in the mornings to walk or take the metro to the Place Aligre market, which is simply wonderful. On Sunday mornings, the market at Richard Lenoir, right off Bastille is fabulous for both lunch and breakfast. You can also buy gifts such as great quality foie gras (and don\u2019t start me on the cheese options!)- there are over a hundred stands selling many different kinds of food, and all of it the very best of Paris. Skip the restaurants. I really do find that its very hard to get great food eating out in Paris \u2013 compared to the quality of food you can buy at these markets. Even with a lot of research, multiple books on Paris Bistros, and reading recommendations from many locals and travelers, we were still unimpressed with virtually every mean in Paris except the fresh food we bought in markets. If you want to try some restaurants close to the hotel, the Brasserie Bofinger and a few other famed eateries are on the way from the hotel to the Bastille- just a short walk away. We ate at Chez Paul, based on many recommendations in numerous Paris Bistro books (and later found it featured in Samantha Brown\u2019s travels as well ) - it is also a short walk on the other side of Bastille. We found it adequate, but hardly something as exceptional as we were led to believe. The very best food we had in the area close to the hotel was at a place called Camille\u2019s just a few blocks away in the heart of the Marais. The Place the Vosages was very close to the hotel and has some nice places for coffee and croissants on it. You can walk in minutes to Victor Hugo\u2019s house and the lovely Picasso Museum is also a very short walk away. Altogether, the location of the hotel is fantastic and for Paris it\u2019s a very nice place to stay.", "Date": "April 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cshower trouble\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4626951", "Content": "I was pleased with this hotel overall and it was good value.

I have stayed at the Jeanne d'Arc many times over the past fifteen years or so, and have never been disappointed. It is always my first choice when I am visiting Paris. True, the rooms do vary a bit in size, though every room I have been given has been at least adequate. True, there are some odd decor choices. True, the bathrooms do not meet international luxury hotel standards, but they are clean, functional, and well maintained in my experience. I have always found the rooms comfortable, clean and, yes, charming, in a slightly idiosyncratic way. The hotel's location is outstanding! I love being able to walk a block or so to a choice of excellent cafes for breakfast. (Yes, the hotel breakfast is very good, considering the price, but I prefer a little more Paris with my morning caf\u00e9-cr\u00eame.) The neighborhood shops can supply almost anything you might want, from picnic supplies to fine art or high fashion. You can walk to most places you want to go, and you have good bus and m\u00e9tro options (including the Bastille station) if you are wandering a bit farther. And there are many places well worth visiting - including several excellent museums \u2013 within a quarter mile or so. It would be hard to beat the selection of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel \u2013 everything from the simple, honest little neighborhood bistro, to the finest cuisine in a luxury setting, and with a matching range of prices. Parisian, regional French, Jewish, Corsican, Italian, Japanese and more \u2013 a huge variety. I have ALWAYS found the staff to be friendly, polite, helpful and good-humored. On one occasion we arrived late, around 8:00pm on a Friday evening, and very tired after a horrible weather-delayed trip. I tried to get a table at the Auberge de Jarente (warm, friendly, good hearty Basque food \u2013 highly recommended), only a few yards from the hotel, but was told they were fully booked. When I mentioned this casually to the receptionist, she called the restaurant and, using more Parisian charm than I could have believed possible (and I do find Parisians charming, especially the women!) persuaded the patron to find us a cozy little corner table, with only a half hour wait \u2013 and an ap\u00e9ritif and \"amuse-bouche\" on the house while we waited! The only downside is that the hotel is, deservedly, immensely popular, and often is fully booked months in advance. This has made it necessary for me to stay on different occasions at three other hotels nearby, all of which cost more, and all of which pleased me less. So book early, but if you want cookie-cutter soul-less functionality, this might not be the place for you.

While the rooms and bathrooms are small, its to be expected for such a great location in Paris, and for the low price. We paid 80Euros per night for the two us. Breakfast was an extra 6Euros, but worth the price compared with the local cafes (of course, with the \"street\" ambiance). Our room on the first weekend was on the 2nd floor, and over the street, so somewhat noisy, but it wasn't enough to interfere with our sleep. On the 2nd weekend, our window overlooked the central air shaft for the building...no view, but the smells were incredible coming from a restaurant below. Second, the location is really wonderful, just around the corner from a small square with several restaurants. We found the Bar de Jarente to particularly good, and ate there several times. Patrick, who managed the restaurant, is wonderful, and the food was excellent. Additionally, its very close to the St. Paul Metro line, which makes it very easy to get around Paris.

Who is reviewing this place? The lobby of the hotel consists of a number of rooms including a reception, a breakfast room and a sitting room. They also have a luggage room in case you need to store you bag as you wait for a later departure. The reception area is decorated with a huge funky mirror that is as original as it is artistic. This is where the originality of the hotel begins and this is where it ends. Now the rooms... When I checked in I found I was given a room with a bath only but no shower, although I requested a room with a shower. The room was on the 6th floor and had a nice view over the rooftops of Paris. It was also one of the biggest rooms I have ever had in this price range. The room was decorated with mix and match furniture and an open style closet. It really felt like a attic dorm room. The colors were in shades of orange and yellow, I think the carpet was blue. After using the room for a bit I went down to see if I could get a room with a shower. The girl at the front desk asked me, \u201cdid you use the toilet?\u201d, well that's a bit too personal. Basically because I used the facilities she would not move me because I guess the room would have had to be sanitized. She promised me a room with a bath the next day. On the second day I was moved to a new room which was on the 2nd floor. The room was a lot smaller but it did have a large bathroom and a nice big stand up shower. It was nice to be on the second floor because I could use the stairs to get to my room rather than the slow elevator. The room was decorated in the same shades or orange and yellow but had different furniture including an armour and a desk. Here are my overall notes- 1. The room did not smell very good. Later I when I sat on the floor to put on my shoe I realized it was coming from the carpet. Which smelled fowl. The whole room smelled like \"dirty old man\". 2. Sheets on the bed were paper thin and scratchy. 3. If someone was smoking in a room around you, you will smell it. This was particularry gross at 7am in the morning. 4. If someone was showering in a room next to you you will hear it very clearly. 5. The beds were low to the ground and not comfortable. 6. The bathroom towels were grey and dingy and so worn that they were scratchy and not absorbant. Washcloths are not provided (as they aren't in many European hotels). When traveling in Europe, I always bring my own and discard them on departure. Oddly enough the bathroom did have a heated towel bar which came in handy when I needed to dry some stuff I washed in the sink! 7. While taking a shower you are either scalded or frozen everytime someone flushes a toilet or runs water. Water pressure was good though. 8. The location is fantastic and walkable to many of the shops, restaurants and sights in the Marais area. 9. The front desk staff can have a bit of attitude but was also helpful when necessary. 10. Personal safety and the safety of your belongings are a serious issue here. One night I returned to the hotel and there was no key to my room in the rack. They suggested I never gave it back. Oh yes, I did. The front desk clerk then gave me (yes gave me) the hotel pass key to get into my room. When I went up to my room my hotel key was in the door!!! It seems like they had to do some work in my room and the mechanic left the key in the door. The girl at the front desk admitted that she knew the key was gone when she went home the prior evening. Another night I returned to the hotel to find no clerk at the front desk. Another couple and I waited about 5 minutes but no one showed up. At that point we simply went behind the desk and helped ourself to the keys to our rooms. After I was in my room about 5 minutes, I heard some downstais calling, hello?, hello? Obvioiusly he still had not returned. The luggage room is locked but they will let you into it, unattended, to get your bag. Anyone could pop in and take anything. Truthfully, you get what you pay for. I stayed here because the value of the dollar was so bad. My room was \u20ac80 a night which was a good price for the location. Considering the safety, threadbare towels and smelly room, ity was no bargain. For an additional $20 I could have stayed at any number of respectable budget hotels, such as the Relais du Louvre or the Hotel Castex. I have stayed at both and they were both more respectable. Regardless of the good location and low price, I would pass on this hotel on future trips. It just seems like too much of a crap shoot.
