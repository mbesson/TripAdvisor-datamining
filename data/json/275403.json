I should have guessed that its status as the only hotel for miles around with ANY availability during a major trade show was a clear indication that even the cockroaches would rather stay somewhere else. A few things I hate about this place: * The location - miles from anywhere and with nothing around to see or do * The reception stinks of smoke because nobody closes the door on the 'smoking room'. * The receptionist - young, blonde, arrogant and extraoridinarily rude * Receptionist ignored me for several minutes to finish a heated phone call with what sounded like a friend. * Charged me for two nights full payment on my credit card up front (despite having a card number to guarantee the room) telling me \"That's normal with us\" - normal for you doesn't make it RIGHT or normal in anyone else's standards * After charging us for two nights we got 'fast check out invoices' after one night - clearly expecting us to leave a night early even though we'd paid. * Restaurant menu is very dull * Breakfast buffet with no glasses, no plates, no bowls and coffee that tasted like it had stewed for weeks * We couldn't get into the car park to get the car - took 10 minutes to get them to open the barrier. And the car park is NOT free - it's charged at 15 euros a night. * When we returned the card keys had been deactivated - nasty blonde reception lady claimed it was our fault because 'The key doesn't work if you put it near a phone or metal things' - strange that this is the ONLY hotel in the universe to invent that excuse when they've deactivated the keys because they got your booking wrong.

I selected it from a list of possibilities from the convention's housing bureau. I have been to Amsterdam may times before, and I know that I wanted a hotel that was not in the heart of the tourist area. I also wanted a hotel that was closer to the Rai Convention Center. These are both true for this Bastion hotel. Location: This hotel is between two tram stops (lines 1 and 17, stops Surinameplein and Derkinderenstraat) and about a 15-minute walk from the Lelylaan Metro station. The tram stops are about 10 minutes either way. The location is a little isolated, so if you don't like to walk in a business area, choose another location. I always felt safe, even when walking at night, but I'm a 6' 1\" man. Likewise, if you don't want to walk, this is not the hotel for you. While Amsterdam is a major city, the central area is actually rather compact. Twice during our stay we walked from Centraal Station to the hotel. It takes a while, but it's not impossible. Services: There are no other restaurants next to the hotel. There are some (mostly snack stops) near Surinameplein, but that's at least a 15-minute walk. You can always take a tram to another part of town. The hotel has a restaurant with a short menu. We ate here twice during our stay. The food was good and the portions were larger than I usually see at European hotels. Breakfast is not included in the room charge. My room rate for a double was 101 Euros per night, plus 12 Euros per person for breakfast. The breakfast buffet is typical of those in Europe with breads, rolls, cheeses, sliced meats, fruit, cereal, boiled eggs and scrambled eggs and bacon. I like to send postcards during my trips, and I found a post office just beyond the Lelylaan Metro station. As you leave the hotel and walk toward the Metro station on Schipluidenlaan, walk under the train overpass. The road name changes to Pieter Calandlaan. There is a row of shops on the left side of the street, and behind them is a post office (Post Kantoor). Staff: All of them were mostly helpful. I did not receive any worthwhile restaurant suggestions from the people I asked. They all said to take the tram to the busy areas of town. Except for one person, I felt that they were all at work just to earn a paycheck and not there because they enjoyed working with people. There is a secured parking lot available for a daily fee. Lots of parking is available on the street, although the hotel suggests using the secured lot. I did not see any signs of crime on the street, but the somewhat isolated location makes it a good spot for potential trouble. There is a construction project in progress across the street. I don't know what it being built. The construction vehicles did not interrupt our stay in the evenings and at night. However, at 8 a.m., the pile driver started hammering. We had an early start each morning, so this did not affect us.

I have no complaints regarding the hotel and its services. Everything was adequate. The main problem with Bastion was its location. Its located between 2 tram stops, so its a 10-minute hike to get to a tram stop. This might sound not so bad, but you have to consider how many times per day you ll have to do it ( in our case 4 times ) and in what state. We didnt mind so much the hike when we started our day in the morning, but coming back at the evening or night, dead tired from all the walking and sightseeing, that 10 minute ( 1 km ) hike seemed like a lot! Moreover the area around the hotel is described at best, as boring and uninteresting. There was a HUGE construction site on on side and woods on the other with a canal crossing. The area is not like the absolutely magical centre of Amsterdam with the lovely canals and magnificent buildings. Its pretty boring. Once you got to the tram stop, the actual journey to central Amsterdam lasted only about 10 minutes. Amsterdam is QUITE small. Looking at the location of Bastion on a map, it seems like its out in the suburbs, but in reality its distance from the centre is very small! The hotel is located right next to a flyover road crossing and finding its entrance is trickier than you might expect. If you re traveling with the tram follow these steps.... Get off at Surinameplein station. You ll be able to spot the hotel, about 1 km down the main road. Now its the tricky part..... DONT approach it by walkin on the side of the road where the hotel actually is!!!! You must walk on the opposite side of the road. If you do that, then halfway through, you ll notice that the sidewalk splits up and one can either remain on the street level or follow a path that descends. You must take the path that descends. If you stay on street level, or if you walk on the other side of the road, when you finally approach the hotel you ll discover with horror that the entrance of the hotel is located lower than the street level! You ll find yourself standing on a bridge, overlooking the entrance from about 5 metters altitude! Thats what happened to us, and then we had to walk all the way back towards the station (carrying heavy luggage) and pick the right path this time. This has to be the most frustration i ve ever had to face while trying to get to a hotel. If you re on the right path, you ll end up in the same lower level where the hotel is, and after turning left and passing under the aforementioned bridge you ll reach the hotel at last. I hope this didnt sound too confusing. Maybe it would be a good idea to reach the hotel with a taxi for the first time in order to get your bearings.", "Date": "May 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lancashire, England.", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, shame about the placement.\u201d", "Author": "iSitii", "ReviewID": "UR5876620", "Content": "First things first; the hotel in itself, as a seperate entity, is welcoming and amenable. The staff, in general, are pleasant, fluent in English, and helpful should you need any assistance. The restaurant serves great food (if you're prepared to wait a while) at prices much akin to what you'd pay in central Amsterdam. The bar, however, is awful. 4 Euros for a pint of beer that is some way short of being even satisfactory, and you know there's something wrong when the bar itself is larger than the seating area. More positivley, though, is the free internet next to the bar, which comes in handy for 5 minutes every day to check anything you may need to. We, a group of 4 (18-21 year olds) found the rooms themselves of a high standard, and were cleaned and tidied every day without fail. The TV's had 34 channels, however only about half of which had English speech or subtitles. The wardrobes offered 6 hangers, which, for a room of two people, was a little problematic, but nothing to worry about. Slightly more worrying, however, was the implementation of the card keys used to operate the lifts and hotel doors, as they were often very sporadic and haphazard with regards to their effectiveness, and often (after trying them in the doors/lift about 25 times) had to be reset at reception (which, in fairness, wasn't too much of a problem, but would be if you were on floor 10 for a few weeks..) The minibar in the hotel rooms offered a small but varied selection of snacks, including red wine, pepsi, beer, water, orange juice, salted peanuts, crisps and two types of chocolate (which appeared to be dark and milk, although tasted more like the animal that had produced them). The pricing of the minibar, however, was extraordinary... i.e. 2 euros for a small bar of chocolate, and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.60 for water. To add insult to injury, the receptionist attempted to charge us for two small bottles of wine and a can of beer when we checked out, which we hadn't touched. I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who drink red wine? The situation was simply resolved with \"Erm, no, we haven't had those\". We concluded that the hotel maids must have been alcoholics. The hotel room also had a kettle with complimentary coffee and tea, although the view from our window left a lot to be deisred; a train track, metro tram tunnel, and gangrenous river - but hey, who wants to sight-see in Amsterdam.. unless you're talking about \"those\" sights. The lifts in the hotel were highly effective and fast, although on one occasion we were stood static for about 1 minute before we realised we hadn't pressed the 3rd floor button.. Now, however, comes the bad points. The horrendous points, infact. After finding out to our dismay that the hotel doesn't have any \"shuttles running to and from the airport regularly\" at all, which cost us an extra \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80, we endevoured to find the quickest way into town. Walking into the town centre would take you about 3 hours, in all seriousness. The most effective method is either a taxi or metro tram. It takes 20-25 minuts to walk from the hotel to the train station, and (quite disgustingly) about the same period of time for a taxi to pull up outside the hotel after you've booked one at hotel reception. The taxi costs between 14-22 euros dependant on traffic and time, which, between 4 people isn't too bad. The metro tram will cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.80 (the machines only accept change) per person per trip: to get this price, press \"1 zone\", to \"central station Amsterdam\" at the ticket machine. Once on the metro, which arrives at the station every 9 minutes, it takes about 15 minutes to get to the central station. We found that using the taxi's was our best option, as for about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4 you could get to the town centre in comfort; and I mean comfort. The taxi's were either BMW's, Mercedes Benz's, or Toyota's, all of which were full leather interior and a smooth ride. If you are travelling in a party of 5, a taxi would be the best idea, although if you are in a group of 2-3, the metro would be more effective. In conclusion, this hotel would be ideal had it have been closer to central Amsterdam. As it is, it really isn't. The hotel is, for my money, using false advertising, as it really isn't in Amsterdam as far as i'm concerned. However, our group did get a good deal on our flights and hotel, although the money we saved has been offset by the money we spent travelling to and from the city. P.S. Amsterdam's airport, \"Schipol\", is amazing. We got there at 7-50a.m. for our flight at 10-20am, and could have been at the gate for our flight at 8-15am, because the transition between check-in (all electronic), passport control etc. is so swift.", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cSatisfactory\u201d", "Author": "AJArmstrong", "ReviewID": "UR5773230", "Content": "I recently stayed here to attend a concert in Amsterdam and found it like the other reviews to be ok, nothing special.

The hotel is clean and tidy enough, but this part of town is NOT somewhere you want to return to after a night on the tiles. It resides on an industrial estate surrounded by motorway fly-overs and building sites. The only safe way to return at the end of each day is to hire a taxi - and that's going to cost you 20 Euros each time. The staff were friendly enough but where mostly unobtainable. Whilst staying here I witnessed several complaints from customers and breakfast was frankly a shambles. We couldn't get into our room for two hours because the key\\lock was broken and when we did there was an unpleasant smell coming from the toilet. When you take into account the taxi fares you're better off booking somewhere closer to the centre of Amsterdam.", "Date": "November 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "liverpool", "Title": "\u201cGood quality hotel a little out the way.\u201d", "Author": "royahassett", "ReviewID": "UR4004644", "Content": "We had a more than pleasant stay at the Bastion Zuidwest. A 15 minute tram ride from the centre was not much to endure at the end of a long day. In a fairly quiet office area location, a litle way out of town, but no transport problems whatsoever. Good size spacious, clean rooms with a large bathroom and fantastic power shower. Not the cheapest place but not over expensive like many of the central hotels which can be a bit run down also. No complaints from us, we had a great time and getting around was never a problem.
