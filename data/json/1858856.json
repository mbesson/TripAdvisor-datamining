The flagship KaDeWe store is not far away. - Reasonable-sized, modern rooms, with the two most important things one really needs in a hotel - an excellent bed and an excellent bathroom with a big shower. - Plentiful breakfast included in the rate Less good: - No minibar and no personal safe in the room - One side of the hotel faces a very busy raliway track: double-glazing and soundproofing are pretty good, but one needs to be on Fourth Floor or above. On no account accept First Floor rooms: It is like having a train run across the top of one's head. - In-room Wifi (which is free) was patchy on our IPad, though better on a more powerful portable PC. - The plentiful breakfast includes as a daily staple great lumps of clod-like scrambled egg, which seem to be the product of an artificial egg-powder. Reminiscent of post WW2 rationing days, but here and now in 2012?? Really! And is it vital to offer the use of cheap black plastic trays - they do create a canteen atmosphere. Conclusion: - A superior budget hotel. Functional, convenient, good value, but in the highly competitive Berlin hotel scene, I would try somewhere else on the next visit.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eindhoven, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location and value for money\u201d", "Author": "Peter_Ahouse", "ReviewID": "UR128443191", "Content": "The hotel is walking distance from U Bahn and S Bahn stations so excellent access to the town and it\u2019s surroundings.

I did not really know what to expect and wondered whether this hotel would actually carry the Hilton name properly... well, I got the answer very quickly: YES. Here are some of the highlights: 1. location: the hotel is very close to the subway and bus stop (about 1 min walk) and from the train station (about 5 min), so it is very easy to come from the airport using public transportation. It is also very conveniently located in a nice shopping area (close to KaDeWe for department store style, but also with loads of small designer boutiques in cute little streets close by...). Finally, location wise, there are also many many restaurants of different styles withing walking distance. 2. the room: not too small and very nicely furnished. Very modern and ultra clean bathroom with hairdrier. If I want to be picky, I would say that they should add a small safe in the room, but that's about it. Free internet is the icing on the cake. 3. Food: the Hampton offers a very nice and complete breakfast. We arrived 10 minutes before it closed once, but that was absolutely no problem. The hotel also had a nice little bar which comes in handy when you want to recover from a very long day of walking in Berlin. the Hampton does not have a restaurant for diner, BUT has a list of about 10 recommended restaurants in the vicinity that they recommend (with different styles). We tested two of them and loved it. 4. My Hilton moment - the staff: overall I must say that ALL the staff we interacted with was really nice and helpful. As a Hilton Honors member, I was contacted by email prior to our arrival to see if I needed help to prepare our trip. The email signature did mention that there was a 24-hour guest service, and that was true (I replied to one of the emails at the wee hours of the day and got a reply within 30 minutes....). If I have to mention one staff in particular, it would be Phuong Nguyen Thanh who really made our stay extra nice. He helped with restaurant bookings, but most importantly, when we had to check out at 4.30 am, he helped with booking our airport transfer and ensured that lunch boxes would be ready as well... I am sure I am missing some elements but you get the point... I really recommend this hotel for an enjoyable visit to Berlin.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "italy", "Title": "\u201cHigher calls than Hamptons\u201d", "Author": "ItalyClaudio", "ReviewID": "UR127829182", "Content": "This hotel belongs to the Hilton chain, and usually Hampton are a step below the classical Hilton.

The hotel is great. We drove in and their parking lot was full, but they directed us down the street to one literally a 5 minute drive, and it was only 10 euros a day to park there. We left it there 3 days and it was just fine when we went to pick it up. Its about a 10 minute walk to the train S Bahn (if you're going in the right direction) but also going in the opposite direction led us to a bunch of regular stores, a huge valley of stores which was very necessary as we were all ill prepared for the weather. Its a 15 minute ride to east berlin, and its a very safe place to be walking about, lots of restaraunts close by. A pigeon hit me in the head. Anyways, the breakfast was the best.

If you come \"home\" after a hard night, or if you have a very early flight, then it's good to know that there's a cafe (Schwarzes Cafe, a real institution for decades) around the corner that serves breakfast 24 hrs per day.

This part of town has been forgotten somehow in recent years when all the attention focused on Berlin-Mitte. But with the Waldorf Astoria to open soon this area is likely to get an injection with some new energy. I have stayed at the Hampton Berlin on a number of occasions on business as it caters for everything you need whilst in the city. Beds are extremely comfy, rooms are clean and efficient, there\u2019s a gym in the basement (leaving the road warrior with no excuses for not working out), and on top of that they thrown in a decent breakfast without an additional charge. Except for peak times during trade fairs (Berlin Messe is just three S-Bahn stops away) their rates are normally well below 100 Euros per night. This is one of the best deals you can get around Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. Staff are highly competent, always friendly and helpful. In particular, I\u2019d like to single out Ms Stangl and Mr Gabriel who do a great job at the front desk. While the location is central and public transport is nearby, the \u201csound of city\u201d is all around and in particular the rooms facing the railroads can be noisy, even if the sound insulation is generally good. But if you like to sleep with the windows wide open you\u2019d rather make sure to get a room facing the backyard already when making the booking. I give the hotel a top rating as an inexpensive business hotel. For a romantic weekend, I would rather shop for special deals at one of Berlin\u2019s many five star places.

I\u2019m a frequent guest at the US Hampton Inns and it was nice to find a few familiar things here as well. The central location just metres from the Kurfuerstendamm is unbeatable if you are on a city trip. If you can avoid it don\u2019t bring a car; everything is in walking distance and although the hotel offers parking for a reasonable price the available spots are very limited. Only 15 if I counted right. There are two other parking garages not too far away. The rooms are rather small but furnished very effectively; for example a sliding door either closes the bathroom or the closet. The closet is not big either but worked out fine for me; if you have a lot of luggage the space might become a little cramped. The bathroom could need a bit more storing space but was great other than that: nice shower, lots of towels, powerful hair dryer, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, everything was there. Comfortable queen-size bed; my room also had a sofa and a desk; internet is included which is not that common in Germany. Just before New Year\u2019s the hotel was packed but I didn\u2019t hear anything from other guests in the neighboring rooms or in the hallway; no banging doors or anything like that. With closed windows there is also absolutely no disturbance from the very close railway. Breakfast is included and offers a great selection of everything one could wish for. Extra kudos to the breakfast staff, they really did an amazing job. Seemed that all guests were there at the same time; actually the only time where you realized the hotel was fully booked. But they refilled everything quickly, extra rooms were opened so that everybody could find a seating spot and on top they were super friendly all the time. I wish I could send the breakfast people from my favorite Hampton in Myrtle Beach for training, they could learn so much here! This will be my second home whenever I\u2019m in Berlin from now on.

It is sparkling clean from the moment you walk in, all the way to your room. The rooms are spotless, and very well equipped with power outlets (some hotels in Europe are extremely stingy with power outlets). Reading lights on each side of the queen size beds if you wish to read without blinding your partner. All rooms have a cube radio/clock with alarm. We were initially placed in rooms on the first floor looking directly at a railroad line, and we could see every single train that entered or left Berlin - and there are a LOT of trains every few seconds!. Although the windows are triple glazed, you can still feel the vibration and a mild distant 'light rumble' from trains, so we asked to be changed to rooms not facing the rail line. The front desk changed us with no problem. All of the rooms have showers, so if you're wanting a bath tub, this is not you're hotel. The hot water in the showers is instant and strong, no waiting for the water to warm up. The shower and sink have pumper type soap, shampoo and conditioner with a nice smell, but we still prefer to take our own. The TV's are flat screen HD with a broad selection of channels, and several English channels. You can also select the \"language\" from the menu. The staff at this hotel is remarkably well trained, and very prepared to serve their guests, and every problem is solvable. You don't get a strangle look, or the feeling that you're annoying the staff with ANY question or request you have. We drove to the hotel and parked in their underground parking garage - 12 euros per day (reasonable by Berlin standards, since most charge nearly twice that much). They don't hassle you with the 24hr rule for parking - big asset. There is bike rentals directly outside the door to the hotel. You can rent by paying the front desk - super convenient. We rented the 2 remaining bikes (8 euros per bike for 4hrs) but they don't hassle you or nickle and dime for slight overtime usage. The breakfast buffet at this hotel is incredible for an economy hotel - it far exceeds the breakfast you find at Hampton's stateside. But the breakfast area gets ultra busy at peak times 9am - 10am. Despite the jam packed dining area, the staff was always monitoring the food and replenishing, and also opening up overflow dining areas to accomodate everyone. There is a small fitness center in the basement, with a few pieces of workout equipment and dumbbells. There's a bathroom, sink, and large water bottle w/cups along with fresh apples and towels. Access to the elevator, gym and other facilities requires a room key for control - good feature. The bathrooms near the bar are surprisingly sparkling clean, so someone is doing a great job keeping the place tidy. The bar is almost an extension of the check-in desk, so you can order a drink at anytime. The staff at this hotel is young, ultra friendly, extremely well informed, and know the city to provide directions to sights, or for making recommendations regarding public transportion. The hotel is located near two key subways stops, bus terminals, and tram stops, giving you access to the whole city. This is one of the best economy hotels I've ever stayed in and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants a great night's rest in a large comfortable bed, in a clean, safe environment, good location, and with terrific support from the staff, for a very reasonable price - we payed 80euros for a double.

The Hotel itself is conveniently located close to the Kurf\u00fcrstenstra\u00dfe and fairly close to the highways. By car all parts of downtown Berlin are easy to reach. The only two negatives - if they are negativ at all - would be the lack of a wardrobe in the room. A small shelf or something in addition to the existing cupboard would be great for smaller apparel. And as a second point the obviously limited amount of parking spaces in the Hotel. When I arrived it was already full - at 6 pm.

I arrived in Berlin at Tegel, caught the airport bus and got off at the main station, and then it was an easy 5 minute walk.

On the positive side, this hotel is a new hotel with new bathrooms and other amenities. The service at the hotel is generally excellent and the hotel is exceptionally clean. The hotel has free Internet and breakfast. We had no problems with the Internet. On the negative side, our room was incredibly small. We had a room on the seventh floor with a balcony. It is the smallest room in which we have ever stayed outside of New York City and one hotel in Paris. Although many reviews note the low cost of the Hampton Berlin, our room was actually not that inexpensive, particularly given its size even as compared with other hotels where we have stayed in Berlin and elsewhere in Europe. In addition to being small, our room design was not very functional. Our room had no drawers, no hooks (aside from two hooks in the shower), and only one shelf at the top of the closet area. This meant that we had few options other than hangers for storage of clothing. We stayed at the Hampton Berlin for over one week and found the lack of drawers, hooks and shelves, combined with the small room size, to be a problem. The shower has a half glass enclosure, which meant that the bathroom floor got wet during showers. We also found the water temperature in the shower to be highly variable and had to stay on guard during showers and be prepared to leap out of the way when the water temperature suddenly increased without warning (this happened during most if not all showers that we took). The toilet in our room was also vey high. Breakfast at the Hampton was generally good and included cold meats, cheeses, cereals, yogurt, and juices/coffee. Hot options included pancakes, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, sausage, and bacon. Although my traveling companion enjoyed breakfast, I thought the scrambled eggs tasted like cardboard. However, the breakfast was not bad for a free breakfast. The Hampton Berlin is in an excellent location.

The location is great. On the West side, it's within a ten minute walk of station at the zoo, from where you can get to pretty much anywhere in Berlin. The room was clean and modern, with a comfortable bed and nice bathroom. The only very minor gripe was a lack of drawers/storage space in the room, and slightly more seriously the lack of a safe in the bedroom. The hotel is right next to the train line. As we were on the 5th floor, the noise was minimal and it didn't disturb us in the slightest. I don't know if the same could have been said if we were on the 1st or 2nd floor, all I can say is that it didn't affect us one bit. The breakfast was buffet-style. There was a good selection, including bacon, scrambled eggs, sausages, bread rolls, cereals, muesli, etc...

The check in was friendly and efficient. We were asked whether we required wi-fi access in our room. There are also 3 computers in reception with free internet access. This was really useful for finding good local restaurants and checking opening times of museums, etc. The rooms are clean and modern with excellent sparkling bathrooms. Breakfast is complimentary and a real bonus. Safety deposit boxes are available free of charge at Reception. If you have a late flight it's worth asking whether you can keep your room until later in the day. The hotel were full but they still agreed we could keep it until 2pm at no additional cost, which was very useful. These are our recommendations:- If arriving at Schonefeld airport, buy an ABC ticket for just 3 euros. This takes you to the Zoo Station in about 30 minutes. Remember to validate your ticket before travel!! For sightseeing, buy a 3 or 5 day AB or ABC Welcome card. These can be purchased at the Hotel and can also be used to obtain discounts at attractions and restaurants. The Reisebank at the Zoo Station is perfect for currency exchange (including travellers cheques) as it is open until 9pm.

It is not a five star resort, of course; it's a business traveler and tourist-oriented Hampton, where we found everything as it should be and the employees all on top of their game. I get the impression that the European Hamptons by Hilton are a half-step above most of the US Hamptons (and we know in the US that a recently-constructed, purpose-built Hampton is almost always nicer than a retrofit). The hotel is new, immaculate, and very comfortable -- a quality facility. It fits within the Hampton format, not opulent, but probably physically nicer and of higher quality than most American Hamptons. We were there for four nights and the staff was friendly and efficient, even greeting us by name where they could, when we walked past the desk. The breakfast buffet was extensive and well done, with a far greater selection of hot items than one would expect at a Hampton in the US. They had pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, and a wide selection of cold items. The neighborhood immediately to the south of the hotel is very charming, largely residential with lots of local shops (some cool lamps and home decor) and neighborhoody restaurants, pharmacies, ATMs. It includes Ku'Damm, West Berlin's historic broad shopping boulevard, which is sort of like their Fifth Avenue (if you're from NY). But the rest of the neighborhood reminded me more of NY's Upper East Side, in terms of the character of the shops and restaurants. Ku'Damm is now rivaled by the resurgence of shopping on Unter Den Linden in the former East, but it's still a very nice place to walk, shop or eat, day or evening. The Uhlandstrasse U-Bahn stop is about one block south of the hotel. Continuing south on Uhlandstrasse about four blocks more, there is a new, immaculate laundromat, handy for a family on a long stay. Sevignyplatz and all its restaurants are one block west, just down an alley. The Bahnhof Zoo transit station is a major station that gets you right out to anywhere else in Berlin, and it is an easy 10 minute walk north of the hotel. The Zoo itself is also right there. BZ is a more gritty neighborhood, but that's Berlin, and at no time did we feel unsafe. The Hampton is also on the side of town closest to the airport, making it a relatively quick and affordable taxi ride. One caveat -- there is an elevated train that runs behind the hotel. I did not hear the train whatsoever.

I have to say our review is mixed, although more positive than negative. Highs: - Excellent location. Short walk (or taxi) from the Zoologischer Garten train station; the Zoo station has excellent bus service from Tegel airport via bus X9, an airport express bus. Although we didn\u2019t feel unsafe, note that the Zoo station is very busy and there are some undesirable characters around so for getting around Berlin use the much nicer and closer-to-hotel Savignyplatz train station. The Berlin Hauptbahnhof (main train station) is a just a few train stops from either Zoo or Savignyplatz, with no transfers required. A short walk to Ku\u2019damm (nice shopping and restaurants). Summary \u2013 by using public transport and walking short distances you do NOT need a taxi to get virtually anywhere in Berlin from this hotel. - Great included breakfast. - Fresh, new hotel. - Very friendly staff. Lows: - Small room with no good place to store luggage. - Included wifi did not work, despite much trying. We were told at checkin that they had just switched providers and wifi was unavailable for the first evening. Switching providers didn\u2019t fix it, at least for us. Could not maintain a connection for more than a minute or so \u2013 this was very frustrating, especially since the signal strength always showed as excellent. - Booking our reservation was an absolute disaster. I booked online 5 months in advance, but noticed a significantly lower rate prior to our trip. I called their USA internet help line and asked for the lower rate and was told that it would be no problem to change the rate, but I had to make 4 more calls to this internet help line and never got the lower rate; they cancelled but didn\u2019t rebook; then rebooked for the wrong month; I asked for a supervisor and was placed on permanent hold; I was frankly afraid that I would show up with no valid reservation so once I finally had a new confirmation # I stopped calling, even though I didn\u2019t have the lower rate. Book online but do NOT call their \u201chelp\u201d line.

Negative points: We asked for adjacent rooms with our friends but although we were assured this was the case on arrival, when we went to the rooms later in the day they were some way apart. The guy on reception wasn't interested in sorting this out as the hotel was full & managed a grudging apology.

Probably not great for a very light sleeper but it didn't bother us, we slept well throughout our stay. There is no in room safe but safe deposit boxes are available at reception. There is no drawer space in the room, but not too much or an issue on a short break. Overall I'd recommend this hotel for a short city break in Berlin & would probably stay here again if we came back & could get the same deal with BA (bargain).", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cRequest away from S-bahn could not be granted but...\u201d", "Author": "K_S_Sjogren", "ReviewID": "UR109962056", "Content": "I requested that I get a room away from the S-bahn but upon arrival my request could not be granted for unknown reason.

The location is very good overall, very close to Ku'damm and Uhlandstrasse is a treat for people interested in interior design. Stilwerk, a large shopping center for exclusive homeware, is right up the street and there are plenty of small high-end stores along the street. Towards Kurf\u00fcrstendamm, there's a Zwilling J.A. Henckels store for excellent cutlery from Solingen as well as a Villeroy & Boch store for fine China porcelain. If you are just remotely interested in good coffee then Berliner R\u00f6sterei is a must. Their Portugiesischer Espresso Dunkel is an absolutely stunning blend. In fact, the best I have ever had. The beans are roasted in the store and you need not worry about lack of freshness. They're never more than a few days past roasting date. The breakfast at the hotel is nothing special but fully adequate. The Staff is very professional and friendly but do not seem to engage in chit-chat. They want to keep control. Not that I mind. I stayed two nights and on the day after arrival the sheets were not changed. This might be an environmental decision on behalf of the hotel but not one that I was informed about. This is not a big deal. The bed is very good but most of the pillows are way too thick which means your head will stay in a very awkward tilted position. Again, a minor problem.

The Ulandstrasse U-bahn is the closest station. We had a 72 hour ticket and used this station to get to and from the rest of Berlin. It maybe took about 30 minutes to get the Alexander Platz this way, so that might give you an idea that it isn't completely centralised. It is a good base for seeing all of the sights, though.

They do not necessarily close all the way, and if you are traveling with someone other than a spouse or intimate companion, it can be a bit awkward. Second, is the lack of a 110v outlet anywhere in the room; most Hilton properties in Europe provide at least one outlet (often in the bathroom, labeled as a shaver outlet, but it will most always suffice for cell phone charging etc). This property does not offer that amenity, so please be sure you have your converter and adaptor. Third, this is the only International Hilton property I have ever visited which does NOT offer currency exchange. So, admittedly, these are all ethnocentric issues, however Hilton does largely cater to US tourists. On the flip side, the staff speaks English exceptionally well, are accommodating, and the surroundings pleasant.

This was on the corner of the Ku'damm and Ullandstrasse whcih is the last stop on the U1. We generally walked to either the Zoo U Bahn or Ku'damm on as it was only approx 10 mins walk. RECEPTION/BAR - check in was very efficient and friendly. Free use of desk-top pcs in the hotel reception, bar was much cheaper than other places too! ROOM - Room was great, decent sized room with double bedroom, TV, arm chair, bathroom and wardrobe. Dont bother taking toiletries as they provide them and also a hair-dryer too. The only slight grumble I had was that the pillows were far too soft!!! BREAKFAST - During the whole time we were there we hardly saw any other guests however they all seemed to appear at breakafast! Very very busy. Food was to be expected, not great but consisted of luke warm sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, boiler eggs, pancakes, bread to toast and selection of cold meats and rolls. Tea/coffee and juices also available. All in we would definately stay here again, We paid \u00a3226 for 3 nights accommodation inc breakfast which we felt was a good deal.

I suppose that's a reason to call it Hampton by Hilton rather than a Hampton Inn. To start with, it is a short 10-15 minute walk from the Zoologisher Garten U - S Stop where the X-9 express bus from Tegel Airport terminates. the location is a block from the famous Ku'Damm street with up scale shopping, restaurants and even a BMW showroom on the corner. The staff is simply excellent in every regard from addressing me by name at all times to doing superb bar service. All speak excellent English for those visitors who do not have a command of German. Being right next to a main line of the S-Bahn as well as main line trains was not noticeable. The noise that reached my 7th floor room when a train passed was comparable the hum of a home central air conditioning fan and did not disturb me at all. My corner room was \"the Best of the House\" according to the staff and I would agree being very large and having a wrap around balcony. Since the temperature was between 15 and 30 degrees during my stay, I did not use it much but I venture it is pleasant in the summer. the room was comfortable with a desk, couch, easy chair in addition to the very comfortable bed. The bath was spacious with a shower only (no tub). I would have liked soap bars vs the gels provided but that is a minor issue. My rate of 62 Euros was an outstanding bargain.

The prepaid room rate was E66 per night. Getting there: the hotel website provides great detail on driving but little on public transport. From Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport you would take the RE7 train to Zoologischer Garten station. From Berlin Tegel you take the 109 bus to the corner of Uhlandstrasse and K'damm (at the Uhlandstrasse U bahn (U1) station) and walk 200 metres North past the BMW auto dealership. The hotel is next to the main east-west S bahn line. In terms of getting around Berlin, this hotel is very well placed. It is equidistance to Zoo Garten, Savignyplatz and Uhlandstrasse stations. Decor is modern, accented in places by photographs of Old Berlin. The staff are friendly and multilingual. Wireless internet access was free, there were also terminals in the foyer with Internet access. There is no pool, parking is available downstairs. There is a gym on the lower level - this has treadmills, an eliptical trainer, horizontal bike, free weights, TV screen but no vertical bike or rowing machine - there are toilets but no showers adjacent. There is no outlook from the gym, some may find clautrophobic. i did not eat at the hotel basically because of options in the locale. Several of the top 10 restaurants in the city are within blocks; there are several new restaurants being developed under the arches of the S bahn that would warrant a try. There is Quasimodo's jazz club, small live theater and many buildings with amazing architectural details to look at. The ground floor of the hotel has extensive areas on the ground floor to seat, eat and drink. The rooms are a reasonable size. I had a queen bed and fold out sofa. The bathroom had a good shower but no bathtub. The only issue i had in the room I was on the inside and could not hear the S bahn trains. So what's wrong the the place? Its new and bit sterile - more pictures of old Berlin would help warm it up. In the rooms there is very little storage space - a standard closet with a sliding door and no in room safe. In this neighbourhood there are several options for hotels - Savoy, NH etc. I would stay here again, it was excellent value and I get some Hilton points.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marne-la-Vallee, France", "Title": "\u201cIt has all one needs for a good night (who needs more?)\u201d", "Author": "antan", "ReviewID": "UR86277275", "Content": "If in Berlin for a business or meeting or extensive sightseeing and out of the hotel much of the day this place offers all one needs - good value for money.
