Attracted by its charming lobby, we walked into the Hotel Pantheon, located just a few hundred feet from the Pantheon itself, and were offered a quiet room at the back (as we requested) at an outstanding rate given that it is a four-star hotel - 150 euros a night, or roughly half the usual rate. I start with the price because we couldn't have gotten better value for money. We liked almost everything about the Hotel. It is very small and intimate, around 15 rooms in carved out of a centuries-old building. Restored relatively recently, it is beautifully, tastefully, and expensively decorated. The staff is very helpful and friendly; I single out Roberto perhaps because we happened to see him more than the others at the front desk, but everyone was extemely pleasant, creating a family-like environment. The breakfast was ample, although we preferred going to the famed Tazza d'Oro caffe' across the street from the Hotel. If we could get the same price again, we wouldn't hesitate to return, year after year (since Rome is our favorite city in the world). This said, and the reason I rate it as Very Good rather than Excellent: the Hotel is a bit quirky if you compare it to other four-star hotels in the area (for example, the Hotel Minerva or Albergo del Sole). I'm only pointing out these slight \"quirks\" because people looking for a four-star hotel, and willing to pay full price, may want to know. I'll start with service: Because of the small size, the front desk is staffed by just one person, which occasionally means there are lines for help. We didn't mind at all, but if you're paying 300-400 euros a night, you might. Also perhaps because of the small staff, there always seemed to be cleaning equipment and bags of laundry in the hallway. As for the room: ours was very small, as was the bath, and the latter had some of the usual oddities: awkwardly placed fixtures, etc.. The charming little balcony looked into a lightwell, which sounds worse than it was: I love Rome, and don't mind seeing the neighbors' balconies, service areas, etc., but someone paying 300-400 euros might. (The great advantage to our room was that it was absolutely quiet except for some very noisy pigeons.) Because our room wasn't ready the first night, we were given a junior suite at the same rate: it was lovely, spacious, right up under the eaves, quiet (but no windows: light came in from skylights) and would have been available to us for half-price, at 200 euros, if we had been able to afford that for eight days. One last comment: the lobby and hallways often smelled of cigarette smoke, in part because the staff smoked. Even though they would take their smoke breaks outside the Hotel's front door, the smoke wafted back into the lobby and up the stairwell: again, this detracts slightly from the quality of the hotel and is not what one would expect of a \"four star\" establishment which in other ways was immaculately maintained. To sum up: the Hotel Pantheon was perfect for us in every respect, we would go back in a heartbeat if we could get the same room and same rate, but someone able to pay full price for a four-star hotel should consider carefully what he/she expects.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fishersville, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, helpful staff until billing\u201d", "Author": "Wade C", "ReviewID": "UR120308772", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Pantheon for a week in April for our honeymoon. After a lot of review reading both here and in guidebooks, we settled on it and were not disappointed. The location is perfection, as many have said. It's great to walk about 30 seconds to a great view of the Pantheon (one of my favorite sites in Rome). It's also great for seeing anything in Rome, as the Pantheon is pretty central and most things are in easy walking distance for those who don't mind a stroll; we avoided vehicles the entire time and none of our walks to sites (the forum, the Vatican, the Villa Borghese, etc.) seemed too tiresome. Most of the things people want to see is within a few miles. The room was fine. It was not a luxury suite, but we knew not to expect such a thing. It was a fine room with exposed wooden beams (which I found aesthetically pleasant), a decent bed (we had no trouble sleeping), a GREAT bathroom, a safe for valuables and a window opening onto the street that could be opened or closed depending on noise and temperature. Incidentally, noise can go until the wee hours and start very early, but sometimes this can be a pleasant surprise - we had a lovely solo guitar play us to sleep one night as if in a private concert. It's less pleasant to hear the start of the business day when you're trying to sleep in a bit, but it's a crowded city, so what can you expect? There was no view except of the building across the narrow street, but we didn't come to Rome to look out our hotel window. My wife and I both thought breakfast was actually great. In Italy I expected a less generous spread; there were cereals, breads, pastries, meats, cheeses, fruits, yogurts, and even eggs were available to order if desired (I can't say how they were prepared, as we did not try them). The nicest part was having someone take a coffee order for us; it was great to start the day with a cappuccino. I don't know what anyone has to complain about; we always got a table even though the hotel was full, and we always went out feeling like we'd had a good breakfast. The front desk staff was great to work with... up to a point. All of our needs were met, and the staff were very helpful with any concerns we had while we were staying there. They also arranged transport from and to the airport (for an extra fee, but worth it for me; I did not want to deal with the hassle of a taxi the week before Easter after a long flight), and the drivers both ways proved capable and helpful. The problem came after I returned to the USA and found that they had in fact billed my credit card twice for the stay. I got in touch via email and was told that they needed specific information about my bank (rather than refunding to my credit card account), so I sent what they asked for and was told they would be in touch when they had worked out a refund with my bank. It has been about seven months and no reimbursement has come, nor has any communication from the hotel. I have emailed about it again, but have not gotten a reply. This reluctance to rectify a billing issue tells me two things. The first of these is that the hotel staff can be careless with the billing, which is not reassuring (a week-long stay just before Easter, while not bank-breaking, was by no means cheap), but I can understand and sympathize; we're all human, we all make mistakes. But the second and more serious message to take from my experience is that, after being alerted to a customer service problem - a problem, in fact, caused by hotel staff, not a guest - the staff gave me assurance of resolution but failed to follow through. This is not the way to treat a customer in a service industry. It is with regret that I have to rate this hotel less than five stars, which I certainly would have given it if not for the unfortunate billing situation. I have given up hope of satisfactory resolution.

The rooms are cooled by air conditioners by the window and unfortunately when you pull the curtains to keep out light, you block the AC's ability to cool the room.

However, upon actually arriving at the hotel, we were unbelieveably surprised! First of all, the hotel is LITERALLY FOOTSTEPS from the Pantheon. Maybe a 20 second walk. The Piazza de la Rotonda is full of life at all times of the day. In fact, in the evenings, we would typically walk right out of the hotel to go to the Piazza for a light evening drink and to just watch the people. The location was outright AMAZING. Our friends stayed at a five-star hotel on Via de Giulia and were a little bit away from the center of the center of Rome. We were right there--great restaurants, nightlife, shopping EVERYTHING. Piazza Navona is a 3 minute walk, Fontana de Trevi is about 6 min. walk and Collessum is about 12-15 min. All is within walking distance, even the Vatican (but it was raining so we took a cab which cost us 6 euro, great price. Anyway, enough about the Pantheon, we all know it's great. Back to the hotel! The rooms were quite spacious given Rome standards. My husband and I are both very tall and \"big boned\" as we like to say, so we were able to walk about freely throughout the room and had spaced to our two large suitcases. The bathroom was HUGE. The shower-head was HUGE it felt like my whole body was covered in wonderful warm water upon a longgggg day of sightseeing. Also, the bathrooms had TOWEL HEATERS. How much more meticulous than towel heaters can you get at this great price? Also, the bathroom had Versace tiles. So, for a snob like me, that's something I appreciate ;o) As for the SERVICE! There is this one guy named Roberto. He recommended FANTASTIC restaurants to us both nights AND made reservations for us (Alfredo's and De Buffetto Pizzaria). Also, at some point the TV wasn't working quite well so one of the other guys (who was working the night shift) popped right upstairs to help! EXCELLENT. Ok, so what's not so great? Ok well...the breakfast was decent, could be a bit better. However how can something so simple as a breakfast deter you from staying at this amazing establishment? Furthermore, almost all channels were in Italian, except BBC. If you're going to Rome to sit in a hotel room and watch tv, then you really should save your money and stay home!

The hotel is located on a pedestrian street and is about a 30 second walk to the Pantheon square. I had previously stayed in the Spanish Steps area and found the Pantheon location to be much quieter and more charming (and less expensive!). There were excellent restaurants around this area too. We thoroughly enjoyed both a long lunch and dinner at Antonio's which was right across the street from Hotel Pantheon. We also enjoyed a meal at a nearby trattoria recommended in the NY Times. While the hotel is not a luxurious 5 star property, it IS an excellent value. It is an older boutique hotel with great Italian ambience. The lobby area had lovely wooden beamed ceilings with Venetian chandeliers, as did our room. Our room was very small, even by European standards. However, we had changed our reservation from four nights to two so we considered this acceptable. They also offered to move us the second night to a larger room. We did take a look at one of the larger rooms and it was more than adequate. The furniture could use some updating in the rooms we saw but the bathrooms were modernized and even had Versace tiling. There is a limited bar service for the lobby area (where we wanted to have a cocktail while watching part of the World Cup). You have to ask at the front desk to be served. Breakfast was included and a nice way to start the day. There was also a small store close by where you could purchase drinks and snacks.

Bathroom was roomy enough, new and modern, heated marble floor, heated towel rack, strong hot water in shower. Don\u2019t expect a great view from the room. Rooms on street side face a building across the narrow street. One negative is the amount of street noise until early morning hours. I think that\u2019s unavoidable given the amount of tourist traffic in the Pantheon area. Breakfast was ok. Breakfast room is pleasant. The gentleman overseeing was cordial as were all of staff, and made good, fresh-brewed coffee to your liking. Will also make scambled eggs, if you desire. Four kinds of cereal available, toast and jelly, good yogurt, sometimes fresh fruit, etc. However, croissants and coffee cake were stale, probably left over is my guess. Also, it\u2019s not the fault of the hotel of course, but the food in this area is the worst I\u2019ve ever had in my life, not to mention overpriced. Don\u2019t expect Molto Mario. Why we travelers continue to participate in our own bilking is beyond me. My advice regarding eating in the Pantheon area: 1) If you have lots of money and don\u2019t mind spending it, eat at one of the nicer restaurants and expect to pay way over $200 for a meal for two. 2) Eat at McDonald\u2019s across the street from the Pantheon. 3) Eat take-out pizza by the slice, or grab a sandwich from a street vendor or one of the groceries or delis in the area. 4) Wait until you get home to have an authentic Italian meal, home-cooked or otherwise. Our experience on food included the following: --A charge of $9 to sit at a table and have a basket of bread which we did not request, --lasagna that was literally slop on a plate, --rubbery and tasteless gnocchi, --spaghetti with tiny, tiny shrimp and tough, chewy clams, all way too salty and fishy and obviously canned or frozen, with some kind of commercial flavoring added to the mix, --radicchio gratin, bitter and with no \u201cgratin,\u201d --artichokes, absolutely ruined. Hotel Pantheon is in a great central location in old Rome. Good walking distance from most everything. The area is filled with tourists, however, so expect this. Food is terrible.

The room had one large window with soundproof glass and shutters on the outside which you could open and close. (I made sure the hotel had soundproof windows before I booked (I have been to Rome before). When we checked in the room was very warm and stuffy so we opened the window and shutters. The fresh air was perfect however the deafening noise was not. The front of the hotel faces a narrow alley which has many, many restaurants and shops and is the main pathway to go to many of the sights in Rome so you have tour groups coming and going all the time. That was fine during the day because after all this is Rome. At night however the noise level increases with all the people eating and drinking at the restaurants which have tables and chairs sitting outside in the alley way. And, to make matters worse all the cooking smells come right up and into the room along with all the cigarette smoke from the diners. Also, the people who stay and work at the hotel and smoke, go outside and stand in front of the hotel to smoke and the smoke comes straight up and into the room. The restaurant noise goes until about 1:30 am and then they start to clean up and move all the tables and chairs inside scooting them along the cobblestones making a huge racket. The workers talk, smoke and listen to music while they are closing up. The noise finally stops around 3:30 AM. About 5 AM the street sweepers/garbage trucks/delivery trucks wake you and your day begins. We tried shutting the window at night but it was too hot and stuffy and we could not sleep. After the first night I went down to talk to the woman at the front desk to ask her how to turn on just the fan (I knew the heat or a/c would not be turned on during this part of the season). Even though there is a control for FAN, Speed 1,2, 3 and an On and Off switch, you cannot use the fan because it is only turned on during the specific periods in the summer when they turn on the a/c or the specific period in the winter when they turn on the heat.

The size was that of an apartment and the lovely ecclectic mix of antiques and traditonal furnishings and large screen tv made for a comfortable stay for the 3 of us. This unit holds 4 but an additional bed could be added to the master with no problem or discomfort. The bathrooms were gorgeous. HUGE with marble floors and tile ala Versace! Everything you could ask for..heated towel racks in both bathrooms, blow-dryers, huge tubs with plenty of hot water and large garden shower heads, large mirrors and bidets. And, of course the basket of lotions and shampoos were well stocked. The main bedroom has a mini-fridge and a large flat-screen tv. The rooms have an old-world ambiance with beamed, sloped ceilings and tile. The breakfast was well-done and scrambled eggs with bacon could be requested if one desires. There was an ample array of fresh fruit, juices, coffe and tea, meats, cheeses, fruit tarts and fresh baked goods, along with cereal and oatmeal, and hard-boiled eggs and yogurt. The server was more than happy to accomodate when I asked for a latte... All in all, this place is a gem, and the location is incredible...just a one-minute walk to the majestic Pantheon, and 5-8 minute walk to Trevi, and less than 5 minutes to Piazza Navona. We even walked to the Colloseum and the Forum and Palatine Hill, which took no more than 15 minutes...In addition, a wonderful gelateria, restaurants and supermarket and pharmacy and little shops are all on the same block or in the Piazza near the Pantheon...I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to make the most of their time in Rome.

Unable to bear more than a night at the apartment we decamped to The Pantheon Hotel. We had Room 101 at 200 euros a night and found it to be very small and dark, rather miserably decorated in hues of brown and yellow and with a well-worn carpet. It was, though, extremely clean. The bathroom was large by comparison and had a great shower. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful at all times, and the breakfast was nice. The hotel is absolutely ideally situated for walking to almost all the historical sites and museums. Our main problem was the almost unrelenting noise - the room is on the first floor overlooking the street where there are several restaurants, shops, etc. The noise of people talking, laughing and shouting was constant and went on well into the night and on two occasions until 4 in the morning. When we did finally get to sleep the noise would start again with the refuse collection and street cleaning vehicles roaring slowly up and down, and the staff in the restaurants dragging chairs and tables around endlessly. The building is in a very narrow street and with tall buildings on either side, so the noise is contained. However, even though it was impossible to have the window open because of the noise, the air-conditioning was very efficient. I am not saying the Pantheon is not a good hotel in many ways - but do avoid room 101 or any on the first floor overlooking the street if you value some peace!", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesterfield, MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, a little pricey\u201d", "Author": "jlsjls87", "ReviewID": "UR7246095", "Content": "I researched hotels for hours before deciding to book the Hotel Pantheon.
