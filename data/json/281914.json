When we were able to finally visit Montreal I tried to save a few dollars and booked 5 nights at Hotel Visitel around the corner from Auberge Le Pomerol. That was a huge mistake. That was an awful hotel and I will write a review for them separately. So I noticed that Auberge Le Pomerol was right around the corner and I took a chance and stopped in to see if they had any rooms available. I explained the situation and they remembered we had booked for our Anniversary in January and that we were unable to make it. They were so accommodating, they had a room available for the rest of our stay and they offered it to us for a discounted rate. I asked to look at a room before I confirmed and although they couldn't show me the room we would be staying in they showed me another room. The minute I walked into the Auberge Le Pomerol I got a very warm feeling, the room I saw was beautiful, but I booked an Executive room. We came back with our things later in the day and they helped us to our room (#201). it was absolutely gorgeous. The attention to detail was unbelievable. They had an anniversary card for us on the desk along with a bottle of sparkling apple cider. There was soft music playing, which we never turned off throughout our stay. They were extremely helpful in giving us directions for places we wanted to go, the basket breakfast left on our door each morning was very cute.

We stayed for two nights at the Auberge Le Pomerol. First the good things. Every employee was very warm, friendly, and helpful. The hotel was very clean and the towels, linens and bath items were very nice. There is a wonderful Italian restaurant attached to the hotel that has wonderful food with fantastic service. There is a major bus station one block from the hotel and the underground metro station is across the street. This makes travel very easy. It is within walking distance to the old town, but it is at least 15-20 minutes each way. Now the not-so-good things. Since the hotel is situated between bus and metro station, the whole area is filled with homeless, panhandling people. The park that is one block away appears to be the sleeping area for a large contingent of homeless people. This is especially concerning at night. There are also a lot of police in that area which, I assume, is due to the problems that I have mentioned. Walking in this neighborhood after dark is scary. I would not stay here if I was a single woman. A minor inconvenience is that the elevator is not on the reception level. If you have a lot of luggage, this can be a problem. Actually, if you have a lot of luggage, the rooms are not very large and that is problematic. We will not be staying here again because we did not like the neighborhood.

The desk clerk did allow me to sleep in another room that was away from the noise one night but I wasn't able to move to it because it was booked the rest of the time I was there. Breakfast was in a basket that was hung outside our room. The basket contained a number of items but most were not very tasty. I was there four nights and every morning the piece of fruit in the basket was a tangerine and the juice was orange juice. Two mornings there was a square of Philadelphia cream cheese and two mornings there was a Baby Bell cheese. There was a croissant in the basket each day but it was rather tough. Sometimes there was a muffin and sometimes there was a packaged sweet roll. Overall, I wasn't impressed by the breakfast basket. I would probably never stay in this hotel again.

The hotel also offers free snacks in the afternoon, but we were never around to take advantage of this. The only complaint I would have (although it did not really concern us - so it is more like a warning) is that the twin beds are arranged so they are touching and you can't move them apart. This could be awkward if you were sharing with someone you didn't know very well. Other than that, our stay was pretty much perfect. Only 2 blocks from St Denis, very close to Ste Catherine and right across the street from 3 metro lines (Berri UQAM Metro station).

We were not approached or hassled once.

But the greatest surprise was when we opened our bedroom's door; our superior room decoration was just perfect. So far away from a lot of kitsch hotel and inn that I have seen before. Everything is very modern and custom made for the Pomerol. I even threatened the staff that I would have to steal their painting because I wouldn't be able to find it anywhere else! We went back to the front desk and the receptionist offered me to visit the other rooms, what I did (I work for a kind of travel agency). To be honest, the economic rooms are a bit small but look good anyway. But the regular and superior rooms are worth the 20 or 40 bucks more. And the executive are just mind-blowing. Most of the rooms have a little fridge and plasma television with a DVD player where you can also listen to music. After a free snack offered by the hotel until late in the evening in the guest kitchen (including cookies, cheese, coffee, tea and other) we went to a comfy night of sleep.

The price was great. Granted, it was in the middle of winter and over Easter weekend, but this room was a steal. Furthermore, if you are on a tight budget, you could EASILY save money on breakfast and lunch by eating the hotel breakfast and snacks. The breakfast consists of a croissant, another type of pastry (muffin or danish), a yogurt, a piece of fruit, a package of cheese and a drink -- PER PERSON. The snacks that appear around 3pm include several types of cookies, a cheese platter, crackers and dried fruits. Plus, they have bread and peanut butter and jelly in the kitchen at all times of the day. Now, hopefully you get to sample the delicious food in Montreal, but if you really wanted to save money on food, this would be a good choice to stay. The location was perfect. It's a block from St. Denis which is covered in restaurants. And it's right across the street from the Metro. One of the reviews here said it was a block away -- not true. It's directly across the street. The staff was friendly but only somewhat helpful. They did not offer many recommendations like one of the reviews said. I also got the \"go to st. Denis for food\" recommendation that someone else mentioned. Also, it seems like the package they offer for the Botanical Gardens and Biodome is $5 more than what you can buy if you actually go to the Biodome to purchase tickets. We stayed in an executive suite and it was pretty nice. I travel quite frequently and, frankly, a room is a room to me unless it's a really BAD room. This room was probably above average because of the jacuzzi tub we had that we used every night. The bathroom is pretty small but not a big deal to me. The room was a decent enough size for my tastes. Compared to a room at, say a Fairmont hotel, it's much smaller (and we got the big room), but like I said, it's just a place to sleep, really.

A large jetted-tub in the modest-size bathroom and remote for the AC capped off the feeling of small-space luxury. The inn provides some nice touches.

Free use of an off-site gym was included, but we declined. Parking is available in a private lot right behind the hotel at $14/night. For us the biggest, but not too bad, negative was the location. Although there are stores and restaurants close to the hotel, Old Montreal is not. It took these two seniors about 25 minutes to walk to Old Montreal, passing a scruffy panhandler along the way. Brisk walkers could cut that time in half. A desk clerk advised us not to walk too far towards the left out of the hotel because there is not too much good to see. Being native New Yorkers, we accept local \"good sense\" restrictions as part of life in any large city. A subway is very close, and taxis are always an option. A very minor inconvenience is the few steps down from the tiny lobby to the elevator. The staff willingly helps with your bags if you ask.

We complained about the noise in the morning and was told that our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153neighbor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had checked out and we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t face that problem again. 2nd day, we came back at night. The Jacuzzi still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixed so we thought we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a rebate. But the water noise was still there. It seems we had a NEW neighbor. Good thing they slept early. Check out. I asked about the rebate and was told that she was not informed of such arrangements and said that we were already taking the special deal and so it was not possible a further discount. Good point?

I replied that he and his staff were running a dormitory and not a hotel. Although tastefully decorated, I would never give these people my money again.

We loved our luxury room, though it was on the pricy side considering the lack of \"extras\" at the hotel. For my husband & I we really wanted to have romantic surroundings which definitely was the case. We loved the contemporary decor! On that point, this hotel won hands down - it's very well styled. BUT given the price we paid, I had to pick \"AVERAGE\" for its review. This hotel is like a boutique hotel, and though there is wireless internet available for all the rooms, I would think that this hotel would be better suited for couples over business travellers. The hotel is ideally situated - close enough to walk to a LOT of interesting places (restaurants, bars & Old Montreal) not to mention that the METRO is right across the street from the hotel. If you don't need the hotel extras and enjoy being in the right location, then this is the hotel for you. A big downside to the hotel (as one of the other reviews mentioned) is that there are no services available other than basic maid service. I would also have to agree that given the nightly rate we paid, our expectations were not quite met either. Still, it is a large city hotel and the price was \"reasonable\" considering, but for the same amount of money I'll stay elsewhere next time, without the pretty decor perhaps, but WITH all the extras that one enjoys of a hotel.", "Date": "August 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cAn experience to remember!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3512747", "Content": "I have been coming to Montreal many times on business trips and tried many hotels.
