After booking the deal we became a little concerned over the reviews, but we didn\u2019t need to worry. Our Friends arrived in the UK and spent two very pleasant nights in London before travelling to stay with us in Brighton. The room was small but not as bad as expected, our Maltese friend is rather large and found that he and his wife were comfortable in their room, which was small but offered sufficient space for them and their luggage together with all the shopping they did. The room is adequate for a sleep over visit and offers most basic requirements with a clean bathroom and clean linen on the beds. There was some noise from outside even though the room was located towards the rear. London is a busy city so you can expect to hear some background noise. Breakfast was enjoyable with an optional English breakfast that was offered at a good price alongside the included continental breakfast. As mentioned our visitors took advantage of the cheaper prices in the UK to those in Europe and made the best of the shopping opportunity. The hotel is located ideally for shopping and sightseeing. Staff were mostly helpful and pleasant to our visitors who had no complaints during their stay.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cSmall room\u201d", "Author": "GoMarshy", "ReviewID": "UR118894697", "Content": "We were warned that the room we were in was small by the girl on checkout and we were offered a basement room but this was at the front of the hotel next to the road.

You really do get what you pay for because the room was tiny, with a small bathroom you could barely move in, and for some strange reason, there was a cupboard with a sink, fridge and microwave inside it. It had all the right facilities, with toiletries, coffee, sugar, TV, towel and hairdryer but oh my, they were all so cheap and nasty. Breakfast is two houses up in a sister hotel and don't be fooled, when you book on-line, you are only paying for the continental breakfast, not the full English. When you go to order the full English in the sister hotel up the road, you are told you have to pay extra. Which in my opinion, wasn't worth it as it was all really cheap ingredients. I stayed in the Portland because of a work function in the evening, so the next day, I was back in the office and have to say, I felt itchy the whole time and couldn't wait to get home to put everything from my suitcase and on me, into the wash.

When we arrived at the Portland around 11.30 AM they told us that our room is not yet ready and we had to wait until 2 PM. They also told us that it is room no. 06 at the \"lower ground floor\" which means basement(!) at the Portland. I asked for the manager (the receptionist was not really able to speak English) to show me the room because I read before that these rooms are not apropriate. He showed me the room, it was dark and had low ceilings and only two little windows. I said that I would not accept the room and so he showed me another, telling me that this was the only room they had instead. It was a very (!) small room with a very (!) small bed for two persons, merely a single room. The manager told us that we had to accept this before this was the standard we booked (which was not true). It was clear to us that he was not at all interested in us. When we got back to the reception there was another couple with a baby who had booked directly at the htel, they too should stay at the basement. There were from New York and found it total unacceptable like us. Because we had book over Expedia we had no chance to leave the hotel so we stayed in the small room. When we got up there (at 2 PM) there were dirty towls hanging in the room. When we told this to the receptionist he looked at the towels and said: Well I will tell it to the housekeeping. As you can clearly see, they are total uninterested at the Portland. The next morning we had breakfast (which you have to take at the Clarendon because the Portland has no Breakfastroom of its own) which was included in our rate and costs normalely 13 English Pound for Continental Breakfast. That, too, was very poor. The second day my wife found some dark stuff in the juice dispenser, the staff reacted nearly uninterested. On Saturday and Sunday we had to wait about 10-15 minutes until we could get a table for breakfast because it was so crowded.

The room was decent-sized, with a nice kitchenette (very large refrig for oversized bottled waters). The bathroom looked brand-new and had excellent fixtures and water pressure. I had a room that looked out the back (over the gardens) and it was a lovely view. At that point they had no A/C and they were very limited on their portable fan supply, so unfortunately I did not get any relief from the heat. But it wasn't a sweltering heat - just a little unpleasant. The room was very clean and the furniture/bedding seemed pretty new too.

On the final day of our stay, the front desk staff neglected to follow through with our requested wake-up call and also neglected to arrange our requested taxi to the airport.

While my room was lovely, and the housekeeping service kept it impeccable, the hotel\u2019s front desk staff and management were sloppy and inefficient. For this price, and the reputation of the Grange Hotels, travellers deserve better. My problems began on reserving the room. I had requested a personal confirmation by e-mail on making my reservation, as I was coming with a baby and needed particular assurances, but I never received it. On calling the day before arrival to confirm, the desk clerk at the Portland told me that he would transfer me to the main office, and then I was cut off. On calling back, I had to talk fast to keep from being cut off again. The hotel evidently has considerable diificulties with either its telephone hardware or the competence of its staff in dealing with calls (I suspect the latter). I had booked a babysitter through a London agency to take care of my daughter during the day. I received a written message in my room the evening before the first day (the phone never rang through to me), stating that the sitter had called to confirm the booking. Lovely, I thought, and emerged from my room, baby packed up and ready to go, at the appointed 9 a.m. No sitter. However, the desk clerk informed me, with an air of bovine unconcern, that the sitter had called three times and the agency once that morning wanting me to reconfirm the booking to them as well (he had neglected to note this on the message the evening before), and that he had put her through to the room each time--the phone had never rung, and, as she told him the second and third times, she (and the agency) had simply been cut off, which did not seem to bother him, nor to deter him from continually connecting her to nowhere nor, evidently, to inspire him to take a written message or knock on the door instead. I wasted an expensive hour of my and the babysitter\u2019s time. On complaining to the general manager about the unprofessional behavior of the desk clerk in the matter of the phone calls, she told me she would look into the matter and get back to me that evening--she never did. This was the most egregious example of the sort during my stay, but, unfortunately, far from the only one. For example, on returning to the room one afternoon with the sitter, we found that the coding for the lock had evidently become faulty and neither of our keys would work--the front desk clerk told me that it must be my fault, because I'd held the key close to a magnet. This was not the case (and even if so it would have been highly unlikely that the sitter had somehow managed to do the same), but even if it had been, his job was to recode the key, not rebuke the client. And so on\u2014the full list of petty incompetence would be tedious. No one incident was really dreadful (except the one with the sitter), but all together, they made staying at the Portland a continually irritating hassle rather than a pleasure. I complained again to the general manager when I checked out (she told me that she had checked into the phone problems as promised, but that since everything was fine with the lines, she didn\u2019t get back to me\u2014that this meant that the problem was with her employee instead, and that I still wanted her report, didn\u2019t seem to have occurred to her). She told me that someone from Grange Hotels management would be contacting me within a week and offering me a discount on further stays\u2014though, obviously, a discount on the unsatisfactory one I had already had would have been preferable. I received a perfunctory e-mail two weeks later, regretting any \u201cembarrassment\u201d I might have suffered in the matter of the phone calls (rather than my wasted time and money), observing that there was no problem with the line (and thus implying it had all been in my head, presumably), making no mention of employee incompetence, and offering no recompense, retroactive or future. I doubt that I will be staying at any Grange hotel again, particularly given the partial, lackadaisical, and inadequate response of the management staff to poor service when it was brought to their attention.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cOK, but not fantastic\u201d", "Author": "kathy535", "ReviewID": "UR5007392", "Content": "I stay in hotels a lot, and in a previous decade worked in several 3* and 4* hotels so I was rather disappointed in The Portland.

There is no restaurant at the Portland so you will need to go to the Clarendon or the Lancaster to eat. The coffee is terrible and there was very little choice at the time we were there. The touches that make a 4* hotel were lacking, there was no welcome information or information on how to use the facilities, no room service information or offers of newspapers, wake-up calls etc Although you get a microwave, we had no crockery or cultery to go with it. The road noise was very intrusive and the doors to rooms slammed shut very loudly. Finally, there were no foam pillows in the hotel.
