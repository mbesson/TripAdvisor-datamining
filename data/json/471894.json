With it being a weekend they could only only accomodate me for 1 of my 2 nights, but very quickly made arrangements for me elsewhere . I had not been in the room more than 5 minutes when reception called to say they had made arrangemed my second nights accomodation at Hotel 26 ( just accross the rodad-very nice & also reviewed ). It was more expensive, but Junckers would pay the difference. Excellent service! Junckers is in a good location it a funky part of town with lots of good bars and places to eat. You are never far from the bus/train/tram in Berlin but buses stop right outside, trams stop at the end of the road and the U-Bahn is only a few minutes walk. The hotel itself is OK for the price, but you don't get breakfast included. My room ( a single ) was on the small side, but had everything I was going to need. Bathroom, also on the small side, but everything worked and was very clean. Recepetion was quite modern and the breakfast/bar area behind was well kept, but other areas of the hotel looked a bit more old fashioned, but everywhere was clean and well kept. The real highlight here though are the staff who were always helpful. All in all, I would stay at Junckers again if travelling alone. I would just double check direct with them they had my booking confirmed.

For some 25 euro per person in a single room, you should not expect luxury. Indeed, the part of the entire establishment I got accomodated in, was located in the backyard and called \"pension\", not the \"hotel\", which seemed more upgraded and cultivated. The room I was given was very small and basic (just a sink) with shared WC&bath facilities. It was something of a one star spot standard. Adequate for 25 euro, but obviously disappointing, if you would still have hoped to stay in a real hotel for that price. The good thing about the hotel was an unlimited coffee and tee usage at the reception during the day (at least, that is was I was told). Another positive issue is its proximity to the Ostbahnhof train station, as well as to the U-Bahn line: 2 and 1 tram stops, respectively.

The double room where I stayed as a solo traveller was rather small and even more so was the bath room. The rather unattractive furniture fulfilled its purpose and was in good condition. Couples may be dissatisfied by the two single beds instead of a double bed, whereas for me this was, of course, irrelevant. Although I like firm beds, even by my standards the bed in my room was much too rigid. What I appreciated, on the other hand, was the desk equipped with a decent lamp, which rendered working in the evening quite comfortable. There were a few minor shortcomings. First, when stretching out the legs under the desk the feet got entangled in the maze of cables lying on the floor. Second, there was nothing where I could put the soap and the shampoo in the shower. Since my room (as most others of this hotel) was directed to the inner court, it was perfectly silent at night. In the morning I could even hear the birds twitter. This quietness may rather have had to do with the fact that the adjacent rooms were either empty or that the guests staying there produced virtually no noise than with the sound insulation of the building, because in the evening I could once hear a guest in a neighbouring room snoring. In contrast to most hotels nowadays there is self-service only for coffee, tea and cereals, but no buffet breakfast. Instead, a plate with meat, cheese and some vegetables is served along with butter, jam, honey, different kinds of bread and a glass of orange juice. In addition, the staff offers freshly boiled eggs as well as yoghurt, and tries to fulfil any special withes. This is the characteristic of Juncker's Hotel Garni: Its owners and the staff are always helpful and friendly and try to make the stay as convenient as possible. This creates the hospitable atmosphere that is the hallmark of this hotel. As a drawback to be mentioned it is a bit pricey compared to other hotels of a similar standard. It is situated in an area that is neither pretty not ugly but in between. According to some locals, safety would sometimes be an issue there. However, I did not experience any problem of that kind. A favourable feature of the area is the wide variety of bars and restaurants in particular in Simon-Dach-Strasse. Furthermore, this hotel is well suited for users of public transport due to the large number of connections available at the near U-Bahn and S-Bahn station Warschauer Strasse.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town", "Title": "\u201cPrime location and best value.

I really liked how the hotel was decorated -- the walls weren't bare, but they weren't covered in dreadful \"hotel art\" either.

The hotel is basic but clean & well equipped. Their service is excellent, all the people I spoke to had good English, which is nice as my German is basic. I stayed for 4 nights while motorcycle touring, the hotel secured the bike in their yard for me. It's in the old east Berlin, about 20 minutes by walking/ metro from central bits or 20 minutes by bus to Ostbahnhof & the S Bahn, the bus literally stops outside hotel. The hotel will sell you an all day travel ticket for \u20ac6.10. If you want a 15 minute walk you can also pick up the S Bahn at the other end of the adjacent main road, which is at the end of the East Side Gallery, the longest remaining section of the wall.

It is not definitely a luxury hotel, neither a \"design\" hotel, but the room was big, exceptionally clean and very quiet. The bathroom was big enough and also very clean. The hotel has no elevator, I had no problem taking the luggage to the third floor but maybe you must take it into account. There was no air conditioned in the room, nothing important in May, but maybe to consider if you go in summer. Staff is very friendly. The owner, Mr. Juncker, will be happy to help any guest in the morning telling the best way to go to anywhere. The breakfast was good and enough to walk around Berlin until lunch time. The hotel is not in the city centre, but is very well communicated by public tranport. There is the Frankfurter Tor station (U-Bahn n\u00ba 5) at a 5 minutes walk, ideal to go to the city centre. There is also a tram line just beside the hotel, the M10, to go to the Warschauer Strasse S-bahn station, with 4 different U and S bahns. If you arrive to Tegel airport, you can take bus TXL to Alexander Platz and then U5 to Frankfurter Tor. If you arrive to Schonefeld, take S9 to Warschauer Strasse and the the tram M10 and step down at Bernauer Strasse. There is also a bus line that stops just in front the hotel but we didn't use it. I recommend to take every morning a daily pass for the public transport (6.1 euros) that allows you to visit Berlin without caring about costs. You can take it at the front desk.

Not luxurious by any stretch, but extremely clean and in good repair, it makes for a very pleasant base from which to explore the large and rapidly changing city of Berlin. Everyone behind the desk was eager to help us even to doing an internet search and printing the results for us. The foyer is small with a comfortable sitting area. There is tea and coffee available to guests 24/7. The breakfast rooms are cozy and attractive. The waitress searving breakfast was efficient and friendly. Beverages and muesli were self-seve; delicious bread and rolls with cheese and meats, a soft boiled egg if you wanted, were served to your table. Much nicer than many more luxurious places we've stayed at and all inclusive. We saw two rooms. They all have single beds. In some, like the first one the beds are fixed so if if you want a double with the beds together, specifically ask at the time of reservation. Despite the presence of a hostel and several clubs adjacent to our hotel it was very quiet at night. (There are a lot of drinking establishments in Berlin but only a few are really busy at any given time, it seems). There was lots of hot water and an excellent shower. If the owners upgrade only the ubiquitous indoor/outdoor carpet in this hotel they could probably charge 50% more. Berlin is fascinating. Many of the neighbourhoods which were in the east zone are reinventing themselves and undergoing rapid renovation. The neighbourhood around this hotel had some seedy looking spots with some unsavoury looking characters but there were mostly normal working people and recent immigrants.
