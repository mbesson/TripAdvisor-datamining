Delighted with 2 bedroomed apartment in Calle Della Vestre;very convenient for everything. Just off the main shoppoing street but quiet and an easy walk to St Mark's Square. They replied quickly to various email queries before we went. Anna from the company met us at the vaporetto stop (they had monitored our flight which was delayed), took us to the apartment and gave us lots of information. Apartment was more than adequate for our needs and was excellent value for such central accommodation. Would certainly use them again.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nassau, New Providence Island", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, Clean and Comfortable & Great Location\u201d", "Author": "JimboBerlin", "ReviewID": "UR121550900", "Content": "In Venice finding an affordable and comfortable place stay is a challenge to say the very least. It was in fact my third trip to Venice and on this occasion I stayed at the Grimaldi Apartment Hotel, which is a small property with about 15 apartments a few minutes walk from both St Marco Square as well as the Rialto Bridge. The bed and the apartment were clean and comfortable and there is even a washing machine for your dirty clothing , if you end up staying there long enough to need it. The managers of the hotel are quite friendly and helpful even recommending some nice restaurants, trattoria and places of interest. One shortcoming though is the fact that the hotel charges you 50 Euros for your stay if you use the kitchen to cook as they seem to wish to recover the cost of cleaning the kitchen in this way. One other small issue is the early check-out time of 10AM, however in some instances the hotel can give you an extra hour or so. All in all this is a good place with friendly and helpful staff and will help make your stay in Venice all the more pleasant.

It was literally 2 blocks away! Venice is not the most accessible city- so there were lots of stairs and bridges between the taxi boat and the apartment! Then there were 4 flights of stairs to the apartment! So it wasn't so awesome getting all our stuff from 2 weeks abroad there, but it was fine once we were all settled. The staff member gave us a map and told us where things were. We tried a couple of times to find the grocery store (eventually with success) but the streets of Venice are not easily mapped! But they tried- we just failed to read the map correctly! The apartment was very clean and spacious- we opened the windows at night but the pigeons made too much noise for my mom... she was afraid they'd come in. We got some groceries for breakfast and kept them in the fridge. Most hotels in Venice are really expensive, so this was a great alternative.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alhama de Murcia, Spain", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location just off Strada Nova\u201d", "Author": "arcoiris644", "ReviewID": "UR78226053", "Content": "We were met as arranged at the vaporetto stop Ca D'Oro by a charming lady who escorted us to our apartment just a few minutes walk away.

Last year we booked the place for 2 nights for four people. We arrived in Venice 30min later than planned, due to the train delays and made contact with the organizer who insured they were waiting for us which was a lie. As soon as we got the meeting point no one was there all the phones were switched off and we waited until 3am in the middle of the street with no address, no hotel and no person to meet. They kept their phones off the next morning still as we tried to call many times. Be careful as they are very tricky - there is no address of the apartments mentioned on booking.com website or via email confirmation from them. So there was no chance to find them in Venice. They had the nerve to charge us the full 2 days stay, one week prior to our vacation. Since then, we have been in contact with them almost a year to at least refund half of our money which they originally agreed to do. They keep lying that they will refund one nights stay and they asked us 100 different papers which we kindly provided but still no results, just frustration and ignorance. The final conversation was with the financial director who mentioned that because we put their names in Trip Advisor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the owner is fuming and will not pay anything because the damage is done, which infact was another lie because we only put this in trip advisor after suffering so many difficulties and lies from them. They are just very lucky that something more serious didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen to one of us from being left alone in the dark streets of Venice. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame on this company to ruin the names of Italians. We were a group of 4 from 4 different countries and had a meeting with another 6 international people from different places in Venice. Unfortunately the memories and thoughts about Italian hospitality is ruined for everyone.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cexcellent\u201d", "Author": "gbaket", "ReviewID": "UR53155187", "Content": "Quiet, easy to get to.

It was like home! My daughters and I had a wonderful stay in one of the Grimaldi Apartments. The name of it was Lionello.
