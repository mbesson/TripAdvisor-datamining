The room served it's purpose really and gave us a comfortable bed and a breakfast (of sorts). The price was quite good for London, though this is no luxary hotel. The bathroom was tiny and the place could seriously do with a referb. The breakfast consisted of toast, 1 rasher of bacon, 2 fried eggs and a desert spoonfull of beans... pretty skimpy, but set us up til lunch. I would only stay here again if I was on a tight budget and wasn't bothered about staying somewhere nice.

As soon as we entered our room we were met by a strong scent of washing detergents. This was not surprising considering that outside one of the windows there was a clear view into the hotels laundry facilities. Moreover there was a pipe right outside the window that spewed out clouds of steam from the washing machines inside the washing facilities. Since people in our family have allergies for these type of things, we asked for another room. The answer was that this was the best room in the hotel and was the only three man room at the time. As a result of that we ended up in a two man room, however there was none of the smell we had encountered in the other room. The only thing to complain about in this room was the view we had from the windows. There were huge stock piles of old mattresses laying on the floor outside. Sure we were living below ground floor, but I would like to expect something of a better view rather than seeing old mattresses and other rubbish outside my window. The location of the hotel is the only good thing I can come up with now. We had good access to the tube and the National Rail service. It took about 3-4 minutes to walk to Paddington station. From Paddington you could take the Bakerloo, Circle or District line to were you needed to go. The Hotel is also located quite close to Hyde Park, but we did not have the time to pay a visit during our trip, unfortunately. The food experience in the hotel was amongst the worse we have had. Every morning for breakfast you were given two strips of beacon, a fried egg and some baked beans, with little other choice. The portions that were served were also quite small.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cIf you don't need sleep this hotel is an excellent choice\u201d", "Author": "HMT59nl", "ReviewID": "UR114594025", "Content": "To cut a long story short: the people are friendly, the traffic noise is terrible and goes on all night.

My husband and I are very hardened travellers and stayed in many places all round the world but this hotel is by far the worse. In fact this is the first review I have ever written and this is because I have never felt so strongly disgusted about accomodation before, other travellers need to be aware! The worst part however, is that we never even booked into this hotel, we had booked into the Normandie Hotel about 30 metres down the road, but when we arrived there, they said our room had been allocated in this rather downgraded disgusting place. Apparently it is owned by the same owners. I complained about this too, but once again the owners of the Normandie hotel did not care. We had also booked 2 rooms, as we were travelling with another couple and they too were put into another hotel again, meaning that we had all separated. Unfortunately we had pre-paid for the hotel because we booked it through expedia, so we were unable to get our money back and go somewhere else.
