We didn't realize that the Encore had a separate lobby/desk from the Wynn. But the Wynn staff had no problems checking us in there and had our bags taken to our room in the encore. It is a very short walk between the two hotels. Lobby and entire first floor is very pretty with friendly staff. Our room was on the 54th floor. It had great views of the Wynn/Encore property and the strip. The room was very spacious with two queen beds, an office desk, large \"L\" shaped couch. Bathroom had plenty of space and towels. Snacks and drinks were available as well. One of my favorite things in the room was the remote on the night stand. It controlled lighting, \"Do not disturb\" light by the room door, and window shades. The alarm clock/stereo was Iphone/Ipod compatible for music and charging. Cell signal was weak up on the 54th floor, but this issue is not related to the hotel. Wifi was $15/day. Even though we were on the 54th floor, we almost never waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator. There is a small shop with food and drinks near the elevators. We had drinks at the Parasol Down, and enjoyed the free show at the waterfall. I recommend this bar if you want drinks and to be able to relax. The adult area of the pool was very nice and quiet. Server was very friendly and checking in with us. Pool furniture was comfortable. Family pool had a similar setup. Guests staying at the Encore have access to the Wynn pools. we went over to the Wynn pools but liked the Encore pools better. We walked by the spa area on the way to the pools but did not use the spa services. I have two complaints with the hotel. There is a sign posted at the lobby elevator that no food or drinks from outside of the Wynn resorts is allowed. Later in the evening, there was a security guard by the elevator, but never saw him checking people's bags for food or drinks. We had a bag of leftovers from dinner from a restaurant off the strip, but was never searched. The other is noise from the outdoor club. Although it wasn't loud enough to keep me up at night, there was noise from the outdoor club that I could hear on the 54th floor. I would definitely stay here again unless I wanted to be closer to the middle of the strip. Cabs to/from the airport were about $15-20 depending on traffic.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cElegant, but Expensive\u201d", "Author": "red0125", "ReviewID": "UR128990305", "Content": "This hotel is quite expensive but beautiful!

On our second day at the Encore, I returned from a visit to the spa to find that my purse had been rifled through and $200 stolen from my wallet. I contacted security who put me through a rediculously long interview process and asked me to complete several forms to start their \"investigation\". I recieved a phone call 3 days later from their \"investigator\" who said they concluded that there was no employee misconduct and I must have misplaced the money. She also apologized for the length of time it took to get feedback as their department was very very busy with other crimes throughout the hotel. I'm certain I didn't misplace the money and I'm certain their staff stole it. I think this can also be evidenced by the volume of claims their security team was busy working on. All we got was an \"I'm sorry this happened.\" In addition, our air conditioning unit was not functioning the entire trip, even after visits from the maintenance team. And upon check-out, I noticed $116 in room service charges that were added to my bill and were not mine.

Hotel competition, especially on The Strip in Vegas is very tough. So although the room was very nice, as was the Casino, Hotel meeting facilities, bars and restaurants, the service was only indifferent in all but a few of the restaurants at the Encore (better luck at the Wynn on that front). Room service was on time and the food was still warm - I never take that for granted. The Wynn and Encore complex have the disadvantage of also being on the north end of the Strip (there are a few other hotels further north heading to downtown Vegas, but for the Strip proper, the Wynn and Encore are on the northern edge), but for the shopping wives out there, you are closer to one of the main and probably nicest Vegas shopping hubs outside of the big luxury brand places you'll see at all the top hotels in Vegas which include the Encore and Wynn - the Fashion Park Mall - across the street from the Encore (a busy multi-lane Las Vegas Boulevard street - but there is a pedestrian bridge). Don't get me wrong - the Encore and the Wynn are \"wow - you\" experiences, and you can get from one to the other easily, although they both cover a lot of ground. Once at the Wynn, you are in easy reach of the Pallazo/Venetian complex. So although you have the drawback of being are at one end of The Strip as I noted - you aren't isolated from other properties completely. Also, I've been to Vegas many times and stayed at many properties, so I am pretty jaded on the wow factor. If it is your first time, you'll be impressed. The whole Strip scene in Vegas is like an adult fantasyland - and you get a little numbed eventually. Plus there is always a newer, cooler place every year - in 2011, it was the Cosmopolitan - near the Bellagio and City Center. Might still be in 2012 - I haven't gotten back this year so far. Another highlight and an outstandingly good exception to the indifferent general casino floor service at the Encore was the Switch restaurant, where the restaurant structure entertains you but transforming itself every so often with moving walls and other decor complete with new coordinated color and lighting schemes. Another highlight that would make this a 4.5 if Trip Advisor allowed half-points was the spa and gym facilities - first rate all the way - but extra $$s per day, if you aren't an invited high roller. The highlight of my last visit in terms of the property was the pool complex. Once again, service was only fair, but I am a middle aged white guy with only a middling average bet size and time spent at the tables. If I was the same guy with a few hotties on my arm (spell, \"loaded\", or acting loaded), or had the young celeb look, the service would have been super, because I saw it all around me for those prototypes. And people views at the pool area were a clear, clear highlight (there were the glance-away quickly exceptions)- it was a great setting. The best deal was an iced bucket of beers at your side. My closing tip is to take your lady on a walk over to the Wynn and over cocktails or wine and appetizers at the Parasol Down bar while you chat and periodically get treated without an extra cost for once to the cool little shows (there must be at least six or more different ones) that are automated and quite varied. The are integrated into your backdrop there of a vegetated man-made mini-lake, with stone face waterfall and more and the themed colorful upside down parasols of every rainbow color and design you could dream up. Allow at least an hour there or more to see a couple of the choreographed, music, light and sound and moving projections with animatronics mini-shows. Even between the engaging shows, something about looking out over and hearing the water, albeit man-made, but very well man-made, is relaxing and refreshing. Check out when it is opened.

I liked the quieter Encore Pool and the European pool option (no children), and the hotel common areas seemed a little more quiet than Wynn. I also enjoyed the slightly larger room and layout of the Encore panorama suite. In-suite dining was excellent, just like at the Wynn. Encore's gym is larger than at the Wynn, and is less 'public' (at Wynn, you can watch the people on the treadmills when walking to the pool) and Encore's gym has more equipment. I haven't tried the Wynn Spa, but the Encore Spa is tremendous, and worth a trip over even if you're staying elsewhere. But I have to say, the extra five minute walk to Encore starts to take its toll after several trips a day.

On my first trip, I was just out of college and we stayed at the MGM. My friends and I decided to \"upgrade\" and spring for a weekend at Encore. I didn't like going from the south end of the Strip to the north end, but figured we could stay in the middle of the Strip for our next trip. It was also convenient for them since they wanted to party at XS, Tryst and Tao (at the Venetian). Oh the compromises we make when we travel in a group! Overall, it was a very enjoyable, luxurious stay, exactly what you expect from a 5-star hotel. I won't go on and on about the helpful staff, beautiful decorating, and comfortable beds (I think when you pay $300+/night these things are mandatory!). Just a warning - we stayed on the 29th floor with a Strip view and could hear the thumping bass from XS until 4 in the morning. I guess no one comes to Vegas for a good night's sleep, but does the music have to be so loud? Also note that all the food and drinks are on sensors, and you get charged if you remove an item for more than 60 seconds. I will say that I liked the MGM's pool a lot more. MGM had a lazy river and lot more space for their pool area. At Encore, there isn't too much - a small pool for European sunbathing and another pool for everyone else. I think it's because most of their outdoor space is dedicated to the Beach Club ($30 cover, like a daytime version of a nightclub - will wonders ever cease). The resort fee includes internet and use of the gym, but keep in mind that another 12% tax is levied on the resort fee. On a $25 fee, this winds up costing only an extra $3/nt, but just something to keep in mind. Not the biggest fan of the location, since we did not rent a car and had to take a cab to mid-Strip destinations (ARIA, the Zumanity show at NYNY).

The Rooms: Rooms at the Encore are much larger than the Wynn. Approximately 700 square feet and can have stunning views. TIP: Make sure that your room is not situated near their world famous night club XS. We were on the 39th floor, right under this club and could still hear the party all night long. We asked to move rooms, and they upgraded us to the 59th floor. Great service. BOOKING YOUR RESERVATIONS It really is better to talk to the front desk department than the reservation department if you have special requests: ie (adjoining rooms, high floor, quiet etc) We mentioned that our Mother was celebrating her birthday when making our reservation with the front desk department and delivered a whole cake to her room when we checked in so we could celebrate. AMAZING!! They also fulled our requests of adjoining rooms, high floor and strip views. SPA The Encore spa here is unquestionably much better than the Wynn Spa. If you are looking to get pampered in an unforgettable setting, then the Encore Spa is the place to be! FOOD The Encore and the Wynn have a variety of restaurants. The can be very pricy and they are not equally good. So here is a quick summary Le Cave (Wynn) - Very good food, nice price point, tapas, Delicious!! Can't go wrong The Buffet (Wynn) - A little pricy but the setting is beautiful and a really nice variety of food. Worth a visit Lakeside Grill (Wynn) Big let down. Beautiful restaurant, but inconsistent food and service. Did NOT enjoy it. The Pizza Place (Wynn) A lot of fun. Great snack place. Sit outside near the waterfall! Terrace Point Cafe - (Wynn) - My favorite spot to have lunch. Sitting outside overlooking the Wynn pools in the sun. The food is average, but setting and price point are fantastic! Society Cafe (Encore) Great spot to get some breakfast in the morning. THE SHOWS Le Reve - This Cirque du Soleil show may be on the expensive side, but it is truly amazing.

This is my second time in two weeks to the Encore and so this review is based on my two experiences (because they were very consistent :)). Check-in: the checking was longer than most mainly due to the review of the resort fee requirement. Just include the resort fee in with the price :). But many hotels in Vegas do this so it is not specific to the Encore. The front desk were helpful in getting you a good room based on your preferences. Rooms: one word - \"massive\". The first time we had two queens and I personally liked the layout better than the king room, but both were nice. The two queen room had a better bathroom with the toilt in a separate area. The sizes of the toiletries were above average and a full size hair dryer was provided. Read the mini bar instructions if you take something out of its spot for more than 60 seconds ou will be charged. The TV was a little challenging to operate at first. The room safe is small. The robes are lovely. The beds are comfy Restaurants: a lot of variety, separate reviews will be written on those. Would suggest booking before our arrival to have choice of times and special requests. Casino: not a big gambler but having to walk through everyday, I appreciated the fact that it was not smokey. Pools: the main pool has the most sun, service was attentive....get there early to get prime seating. Staff will tell you the prime spots. The european pool was more party-like and I did not feel it was as relaxing and the sun exposure was limited in the afternoon. My only constructive feedback is that when I called to advise the hotel of our delay, they told us they could not do anything and Expedia had to contact them...it seems odd that they we unable to help me directly. Also, when requesting late checkout over the phone the day of checkout we were first told the late checkout would be free until 3pm, when I asked for an extension I was told that they could extend for 100 dollars until 6 (\"half day rate\"), and Then i went to the front desk and asked for 9pm and they said they could extend to 7 at the half day rate, but it would be full day rate until 9pm or later...half day is 12 hours so the math did not make sense.

Immediately there was an Encore staff member rendering assistance and calling for an ambulance, which the gentleman declined, but it was great to see the staff quickly attending to guests in need and also seemed genuinely concerned. We stayed on the 12th floor. Keeping in mind the other reviewers in stating that they heard noise from the clubs, we opted for the quiet side.

Food there is rediculous. The only good thing is that the location of the resort allows you to go to the fashion mall to eat or next door there are restaurants and a Dennys. I did eat at Red 8, which is essentially decent chinese food, but the price was just rediculous. A bowl of noodle soup, two order of dumplings (7 pieces all together) and stirfried beef, and soda cost with tip around $70. Living in New York with tremendous takeout chinese, it was stupid how much it cost. Zoozacrackers is a deli and the pizza place serves, well, pizza and ice cream. Both had inflated prices.

The only bad things I can say about this hotel at all is that the only food options in both the Wynn and Encore are quite pricey and there are no vending machines to be found so you are forced to use the mini bar in your room, which is outrageously priced. There is a food court in the Fashion Show Mall right across the street, it's still a walk to get out of the hotel and over there, but at least that was an option. Also it is on the end of the main part of the strip so it is a walk to get anywhere. But with those negatives being said, I would still stay here again.

We reserved a panoramic suite and loved not only the layout of the room and the amenities, but the view was spectacular from the 58th floor. The furnishings were high end and exquisite; couch and bedding were luxurious and tasteful, and the remote by the bed to close and open sheers and/or drapes was a thoughtful touch. The bathrom was nice--very much outfitted like the one at Four Seasons without the nice L'Occtaine bath products. Most importantly, the room was quiet with a capital Q. We felt like we were alone on the floor with ni neighbors. The casino and walkways were gorgeous, and each restaurant was decorated in such stunning fabrics and colors that they rate as the most beautiful I've experienced in any LV hotel. So why the average rating? My title sums it up. If money isn't a factor, and you're not bothered by fees that should be included in the very high room charge, then you'll probably love the Encore. For us, the additional fees on top of the resort fees, were unwarranted. A tasteful hotel should treat its guests tastefully, not nickel and dime them like they're at a carnival arcade. However, that's how we felt on too many occasions during our five day stay. First, we paid for internet service which was not working from our room abut 3/4 of the time. No big deal unless you need to conduct business or acess the internet! Second, the health club/spa fee of $40 a day was absurd to us when we only wanted to use the steam room. Seriously, $40 a day, on top of a $400 room, to use a steam room? Third, it's the small details that make for luxury. Standing in a 25 minute line to check in and standing in a 40 minute line to check out at a luxury hotel is not a luxurious feeling. Being greeted by an unsmiling, unfriendly receptionist is not a luxurious feeing. Not making the daily newspaper available at the guest's room door or at breakfast restaurants (Terrace Point Cafe, Tableau), but charging $1.50 in the Sundries store is nickel and diming the guest. Charging $21 (Stratta) for one cup of from-the-box pasta, drowning in brown colored oil and topped with (count them) two green beans (\"pasta primavera\") isn't merely pricey. It's price gouging. Stop in at the Drugstore Cafe (quaint name with not so quaint prices) and you can get a lovely little latte at their counter for just $6 plus tax. Six dollars. Seriously?! For counter service latte?! Finally, to play slots for any length of time at Encore is an exercise in learning to tune out the constant voice coming from every machine asking you to get a red player's card. When you've already been issued one automatically at check in, the constant come-on is more than annoying. In sum, if you want an over-the-top luxurious, very quiet room with an unbeatable view, the Encore panoramic hotel room is the place to stay. If you want to feel like a valued guest, LV offers a better value and comparable luxury at other hotels.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel.

The Asian restaurant off of the casino floor was very good. So, the problem for us you ask? This hotel is overwhelmingly popular with the 20 something, very hip crowd..and I do mean crowd. Having 5 20- something year olds myself, I have no idea how these young adults have the money to stay, eat and gamble at a 5 star hotel ...but, ok, that's really not here nor there, anyway...this is what accounts for the LOUD, LATE pounding music you will hear from the pool (and we were very high up)....and the LOUD, LATE partying in the halls... I called security twice but to no avail. Eventually, they did quiet down, which was a relief.

To make matters worse, the brutally honest manager/supervisor (I unfortunately lost his card) Jason explained that there is nothing that he can do. I asked for some form of restitution. His only recourse was a $150 credit for food and drinks. This is a slap across the face to me. The cherry on top: I called 10 days before when I booked the room to request a room in one of the higher floors (55th and up). Sure enough, I was put in a smoking room, and it was on the 30th floor.

I expressed concern about sitting outside, the host dismissed my concern by explaining that there are heaters outside. We were put in the middle of that section and that area had overhead heaters that when turned on we felt like we were in an oven. Several of the other diners in the center area complained that it was too hot and they were quickly turned off. I then was very cold.

When I concluded my stay they assisted immediately as well which was perfect. The room was exceptional and the bathroom was magnificent, I really wanted to take the shower with me. Taxis were always available so there was no problem traveling around. Clubs at night were always packed and full of people. Room service breakfast for two people was expensive but delicious. I really only stayed here to sleep and have a quick room to get to if I was partying here. Only problem is that is kind of off the main strip but most people came here anyway for the club scene.

We complained about this, but the only other rooms are the ones facing the Encore's own nightclub. Essentially our choice was to be on the side that is loud til 1am or the side that is loud til 5am. We did pay for an upgraded room and were on the 59th floor, but the noise still came right in. The hotel is very nice and well decorated, but if you are light sleepers like us look elsewhere.

Add a glass of champagne and some of the delicious treats waiting for you in your mini bar and your golden. The bed is quite gigantic, and from it you can basically order anything in your room to do it's job by using the switches next to you. Ultimately lazy! The TV is huge, with a great selection of movies. We had our own in-room massage room. It literally blew my mind. My parent's suite was about triple the size! It had it's own bar! Wow! And thats just the room. The hotel itself is so wonderful. For Vegas standards it is chic, elegant and beautiful in it's decor. The staff are discreet and helpful. I believe they have the best selection of shops out of any of the other hotels in Vegas. When my Dad checked in, they upgraded all of our suites due to him being a black Amex owner. I was a bit nervous about this hotel before we came as you only need read a couple of the pretty bad comments on trip advisor. But I can honestly say. I never couldn't sleep, I could never hear the nightclub, the staff were never rude, and I never saw any disgusting or Lewd behaviour from patrons. We brought my young brother and he had a great time. We were never once worried about what he may be exposed to. However, do remember I went at Christmas, a time when they are quiet. The hotel was hardly full. Perhaps just a week later (New Years) the behaviour seen in the hotel is a bit more disgusting (like the worrying stories I have read on here from past customers)!

The rooms are opulently appointed and there is a panel at your bedside to operate the curtains, lights and even the privacy option on your door. Very cool. The room is a compact suite and very well designed - but it is not large for a suite. The bathtub is a standard size soaking tub for one person. Again, nice but small. My main issue with the room is that despite the opulence, the walls were thin and I could hear my neighbor's t.v. Also, even though I was 21 floors up, I still heard the traffic on the strip late at night. The staff at Encore is the best on the strip. This would also push me to five stars. However, my issues with Encore are these: I sat down at a lobby bar and began playing video poker and was asked for my drink order. Anywhere else I have been in Vegas - including Caesars (at least on my last visit), you are comped while playing video poker at a bar. Not at the Encore. My Absolute on the rocks - although plentiful and strong - was $15.00 w/ tip. Later in my trip, I went to Society Cafe for breakfast and the menu items were $18.00 and above. We're talking breakfast folks. Onto the spa and fitness center. There is about a $15.00 fee to use the fitness center. I believe this price is reasonable and in-line with other Vegas properties if you're not paying a resort fee. However, beware that if you want to use the locker room or showers - that bumps up your visit to $55.00. This facility is very nice - but $55 to take a steam and shower is ridiculous. So, obviously, who goes to the Wynn/Encore and complains about the prices? A valid point. However, regardless of the price you pay for your lodging in Las Vegas - we as customers should expect a decent value. High end properties should deliver high end value and so forth. My issue, is that I thought Wynn/Encore would be above the nickel and diming that takes place all over Vegas. It is not.

Read a lot of reviews first and club noise and value were the two that concerned me. So first the pros. Steve Wynn has surely built one of the most glamorous hotel resorts anywhere. Just high end luxury abounds around every corner. Like most of the new mega hotel/resorts, this place is a sprawling Utopia with lavish decor, basically a mega mall with hotel, swimming, night clubs, fancy restaurants, and casinos. Encore (and Wynn) is basically a high end very upscale resort fit for the well off One percenters if you will. Its a white collar wonderland but if you happen to be blue collar, you better plan ahead because there are better value options. The staff was absolutely gracious, accomodating. I was concerned about the staff based on other reviews but quite honestly, they could not have been better, however when the safe wouldnt open it took 1 hour for security to help and that is just unacceptable. Upon arrival, I requested a high floor away from the strip as sleep is important to me/us. The request resulted in a $20 per night \"upgrade\" to a 61st floor panoramic view of north and west Vegas which was decent. Unless there is an ocean, the view matters little to me. How long you gonna stand there and look? The rooms are very very nice, huge bathroom. The bed was absolutely without a doubt the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom was not sufficiently clean when we went in, as I was looking to substantiate reports of mediocre housekeeping. In particular, they sink counter had splash residue from previous guests that a simple wipe down could have taken care of. Not enough for a complaint to the staff though. The bell boy who brought our bags up took time to explain the technology in the room which was quite helpful and garnered him a worthy tip. Housekeeping the remainder of the trip was timely and there were no issues. DO NOT tough the in room bar or snacks, unless your rich. You can get water and snacks downstairs at the shop by the elevators at still high but more affordable prices. This is NOT a place to take your children, and I would suggest this is an adult resort. So the rooms are nice, the staff was great as expected for a five star. The cons: Value. Be it a bottle of beer, water, coffee, a snack or meal, you are going to pay a premium. For a blue collar guy, this will hurt, but it is common on the strip to pay $7.00 for a bottle of beer. Double that for the clubs you pay to get into. Same for food. Its $50 foir the lunch/breakfast buffets, and over $80 for dinner that is basically that same with slight variation. THere are better values on the strip and the food was medicre for a pricey buffet. The SOciety Restaurant we had breakfast and still pricey for the quality. Service is good, but value no so much. Gaming. I am an avid blackjack player. I did not play one hand at Encore or Wynn and I probably never will. I searched for a mid limit table where dealer stands on soft 17s. Found one at $50 and one at $100. The rest were all dealer hits on soft 17s and that is a big house advantage. So I gambled at more player friendly places. Sad how some expensive Casinos are totally taking advantage of the small bettors. Should be the same for all. So Encore to me is all about the luxury resort itself, something to see, but for value and gaming there are better value options. I will never stay again because I refuse to pay high end prices for mediocre food and I refuse to play a game where house edge is double vs other places. THe one other negative which might be positive for some is location. Its far north end of strip so plan on walking or paying a lot of cab fares to see the rest of the strip. If you are wealthy this place was made for you and thats probably what Mr Wynn intended anyways when he spend 4 billion $ to create it so more power to him and those that can afford it.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous, but expensive\u201d", "Author": "MachThree", "ReviewID": "UR126047719", "Content": "Stayed here 3 nights in March 2012.

The entire property (including the adjoining Wynn), in general, is just gorgeous, including the casino, spa, pool area and all the public spaces. Lots of shops but mostly high end. The only bad things I can mention is that the entire place is very expensive. We received a promotion offer for the room and I believe the cost was fair for the room itself considering its quality. A resort fee of $25/day was added on which included use of the fitness center, wi-fi (normally $14/day) and boarding pass printing for the flight home. There are a wide array of restaurants, both casual and fine dining, in the Encore and the adjoining Wynn, but none of them are cheap. $14 or $16 for a sandwich in most instances. Probably to be expected for a hotel of this caliber in Vegas but Location-wise, its on the northern edge of the happening part of the strip - the only hotels further north are Circus Circus, Stratosphere and Riviera I believe - pretty much no foot traffic to the north.

It appears that the Wynn/Encore does not seem to have any bad views at all. Because of the way they're positioned and designed the views you get feels like they are all panoramic x10. The room is contemporary/elegant style and very spacious. The room itself exceeded our expectations! The pictures/videos we saw on Trip Advisor and YouTube just didn't do it any justice! In-Room Dining- Because we were so exhausted from traveling on the first day, we opted for in-room dining. We both ordered turkey burgers and french fries and it was delicious, fresh and hot! This was somewhat to our surprise because in our previous experiences with in-room dining, the food is usually not that great. Quick and Casual Dining/drinks- Terrace Pointe Cafe, Society Cafe, and Parasol Up, ZoozaCrackers were all phenomenal! Special touches- The Happy Birthday Chocolate tray was so nice and extra special...I will never forget that. Spa- The best! I loved the \"Good Luck Ritual\" and plunge pool. Overall we were glad to have finally found our new love and home away from home in Las Vegas! The Encore/Wynn are the only resorts on the strip that seem to have that all around IT factor! We will surely be anticipating our next stay!

My husband and I had a 10 night stay in Las Vegas. We stayed in 3 different hotels during our stay. First 2 nights we stayed at the MGM Grand (have stayed here over 5 times). Next 3 nights were at the New York New York Hotel (have stayed here over 5 times). Our last 5 nights were at the Encore (have stayed here 3 times). The encore has far nicer rooms than the MGM and New York New York. The Encore is at the complete opposite end of the strip from the first two hotels. We enjoy changing hotels and getting a different vibe from the different hotels. MGM has fairly large rooms but the views are always terrible. The casino is HUGE. The foodcourt is lively and very busy. There is a nice stroll to shopping facilities as well as many restaurants. When we checked out all we had to do was walk across the bridge to get to New York New York. New York has a younger crowd vibe (we are in our early 50's). The rooms are a little smaller than MGM however compared with other hotels in the U.S.A they would be classified as high end. We have always had good views from our stays at New York. Given a choice I would stay at the New York hotel over the MGM hotel. Casino is smaller and during our Friday Saturday night stay very lively. There is a dual ling piano bar that is very popular and fun. There is also a Irish Pub that is a great place to get a Guinness. Food is reasonably priced at the food court and very good. The deli sandwiches, fish and chips and deserts were particular favorites. We planned our trip that we would not walk any farther than halfway down the strip (we used the Flamingo as our stopping point. When we checked out of New York New York we decided to walk to the Encore (we have made this walk many times on previous holidays so we did know how long it was). Our intention originally was to take a cab but we were energized that day and had no problem pulling our 1 suitcase and carrying our 1 back pack. If you do decide to do this there are many places to stop and sit for a minute if your feet get tired. The vibe at the Encore is immediately so different from the first two hotels. Much more staff attends to you and they really do make checking in and checking out a delight. Much more efficient than the first two hotels. The grandeur of the encore immediately takes you aback. Beautiful, beautiful red decor. Rooms have floor to ceiling windows so views are great. We were on the 28th floor and were offered a upgrade to a higher floor for 20.00 more. We declined the offer and we were very satisfied with the view that came with our room. We ate at the Wynn buffet twice during our stay and upgraded the meal to 10.00 each for all you can drink champagne (there are some other drinks available at that price but we chose the champagne). Someone in another review stated that some of the food was not fresh. I would have to disagree with that statement. Everything was great and all was fresh. We intended to try some of the other restaurants at the Encore but it did not work out for us with the shows we were going to see. In this order my favorites are Encore - Classy New York - Fun MGM - Has everything I would stay at any of these properties again.

The walk from Encore to Fashion Show Mall is a hike and will take you about 20 mins walking at a brisk pace. Luckily there's a pedestrian bridge over Las Vegas Blvd so you can easily cross over to the mall. The first shops on the end of the bridge include Neiman Marcus, Macy's and Half-Price Tickets.

We were offered to upgrade our room to a 63rd floor suite with view of the strip for $20 a night. Without hesitation we upgraded and so pleased that we did. It was huge, desk and massive corner sofa area. Huge bathroom with seperate shower and bath, double sinks etc. The adult only 'euro' pool was perfect, with excellent pool side service and extensive cocktail list. You can also sunbathe top-less (should you wish). No photo's can be taken here. It loses the sun at 2.30pm for an hour as it disappears behind the wynn buillding. (guess this depends on the time of year) There is a beach club also there, which we just missed the end of season closing, but it looks amazing. One of the night clubs in the hotel, Surrender opens out on to it. Had an amazing time in there. The night club XS also in the hotel was another good night. Have a look at the resort video on the TV when you get the room as there are some amazing restaurants and bars in the resort that are worth seeing even just for photo opportunities. The dualing piano's in the east bar at the encore is a fun way to start the evening. One more thing, take comfy shoes there's a lot of walking. There's also a mono rail that runs for most of the strip. Nearest stop to encore is in the Flamingo, by Harrahs. (There's a good live music bar outside by Harrahs that is worth a visit).

I've been fortunate/blessed to travel the world and experience 5 star resorts in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. and I must say this is worthy of all 5 stars. I've stayed here both as a couple's trip and an all-guys trip with success; the resort is fairly versatile. My significant other doesn't even like Vegas but she actually enjoys the Encore. You can easily escape the party-goers and gamblers by going to the spa/gym or do some high-end shopping (window-shopping in my case) in the mall area. The two pools are divided into two sections; you can pick the family-friendly regular pool or the not so family friendly European-pool where clothing is optional. The Euro-pool is very relaxing and setup beautifully with the option to either layback and enjoy the eye-candy or shoot some outdoor craps. The restaurants all serve top-notch food but if I'm in the mood to gorge myself I\u2019ll head to the Wynn buffet. I went there last weekend with my vegan buddy who was pleasantly surprised to find an enormous variety acceptable to his strict gluten-free / vegan diet. Some people seem to think the Venetian is comparable so I'll go ahead and give you my thoughts. I used to think the Venetian was nice. Sure, the replication of Venice indoors is unique but over time it becomes less and less impressive. If you haven't been to Vegas before I suggest you drop by to see it...but that's about it. The decor overall appears rich and detailed, I'll give it that. But stare at it closely and physically knock on something that appears to be stone, it's actually plaster. Tap on something that appears to be wood, it's really laminate. You get my point. Encore/Wynn is the complete opposite...you can tell the place was constructed with uber-deep pockets. The only synthetic material I want to see on vacation is silicone...just kidding. Last I stayed at the Venetian I booked a larger suite which to me still doesn't compare to a standard room at the Encore in terms of fit and finish, Encore is just on another level. COMPLAINTS: Let me start by saying some of the negative reviews I've read here are quite laughable! One review left 3 stars because their room lacked a coffee maker? No offense to the poster but that is no reason to deduct a star or two unless, of course, your last name is Folgers. There are a few things I can nitpick at but I can assure you the positives GREATLY outweigh the negatives. Here goes: 1) Our service at the Wazuzu restaurant was not so good. We found this a bit out-of-place as service EVERYWHERE else in the hotel is top-notch. The waiter was nice BUT very inattentive; my friend specifically asked for no tofu but his dish came with...tofu. He never checked on us a single time to see how we were doing; we had to waive the manager down for assistance, water, etc. The restaurant manager was very pleasant and listened to what we had to say about our service. Not sure what the reasoning was behind the bad service but perhaps the waiter was new? Either way this was unacceptable and a complaint was filed with Encore, however, this did not ruin our day. Hopefully this was just an isolated incident and we are now waiting on response from management to see how they will resolve. 2) Trying to grab a seat at the pool can be tedious especially if you're with a group of friends. I guess it really depends on the time of day you go...but go early and you should be fine. Any decent pool in Vegas will be the same way. 3) Rooms aren't cheap but they\u2019re well worth the price. Probably not the place you want to stay if you're on a budget but then again, who goes to Vegas to save money?! If you really want something low-cost stay at Hooters hotel for $29 but I wouldn't recommend stepping in the shower barefooted.

We picked the Encore property as they had sent us a special offer. Wow -- just amazing in so many ways. From the large to the small, it was nearly perfection. The lobby is gorgeous, the staff -- professional and efficient, and smiling. The food, the bars, the casino, the whimsy -- just delightful. And then the room -- I just loved loved loved the room. We paid a bit extra at check in for a high floor, and it was freaking huge -- clean, well appointed beyond most hotels I've been in, and I've been in thousands. Floor to ceiling windows, automated sheers and drapes, a separate sitting area, a flat screen TV that swivels to either the giant, comfy bed -- with perfectly made linens, and big, fluffy pillows -- or to the sitting area. Ok, so the mini bar is expensive -- who cares? Make $50 or $500 or $5000 on the tables, you can afford an $8 bottle of Fiji Water -- lol. The bed was so comfortable, we are actually thinking about buying one -- they sell everything at the Home Store on property. These Steve Wynn, he's genius. I loved the promotional video that he narrates about the various restaurants and the things that he considered when designing his hotels. I am a forever fan. I even ordered room service coffee every day (expensive, I don't care!) and the coffee was even great -- I mean great, as in Peet's or Italian Roast great...and room service told me how long it would take and that's when it showed up -- how often does THAT happen? We also hung out at the adjoining property (Wynn) pool a couple days, and that was fun too. Good bloody mary's and delightful servers poolside. Geez, I'm ready to go back! But then there's my liver to consider....hahaha. Trust me, you'll love this place. Oh, and go see Vinny Favorito -- this crazy comedian at the Flamingo (now there's a trippy place, don't stay there unless you're broke or desperate) but the comedian was hilarious, and worth $75/ticket!

I asked about this at the front desk and they said that because it was a full service hotel, they didn't need to put a coffee maker in the room. I would suggest that this be an option for guests.

The suite itself, is exactly as you see on the website...which is a pleasant surprise. Large, sumptious and with an extremely comfortable bed & linens. The whole hotel is just so impressive. Totally OTT decor but it works and is tasteful rather than tacky. The casino was small compared to some of the other hotels, but that was perfect for us, and all the common areas from casino to esplanade, even the restrooms were spotlessly clean and a constant but discreet army of cleaning/maintenace personal were always busy keeping it that way. The location was perfect too. Across the road from the Fashion Show Mall and within walking distance of all the other famous strip landmarks, but far enough away not to be too busy or hectic.

Having looked around all the other hotels we were very pleased with the choice we made. It is one of the newer hotels and it definitely showed. Great location (next to the Venetian and near Caesers Palace and the Ballagio) and great value for money (all rooms are actually suites and they are HUGE!). When we arrived we were offered a room upgrade for $20 per night - well worth it as the view was to die for - panoramic views of the strip! The suite was fab - as I said, HUGE and very luxurious. We also used the gym and spa facilities while we were there and they are one of the best we have seen. The spa is expensive, but my massage was one of the best i've had and the facilities are wonderful. This hotel is ajoined to the Wynn via a walkway with lots of nice shops and cafes/restaurants. I would recommend Cafe Society for something fairly casual, and Wazuzu (Japanese) for something more special. There is also a great little bar that overlooked a gorgeous waterfall, which has light shows at night, and great cocktails. The casinos in Vegas are pretty unpleasant in all of the hotels, as they are very smokey, however the Wynn/Encore seemed the best out of them all in this respect. This hotel also has a theatre (Le Reve and Garth Brooks were both on when we stayed) which we didn't visit, but from the outside it looked superb and again comparing against other hotels, it looked the most modern. I would recommend going to see some of the many shows out in Vegas - particularly LOVE by Cirque Du Soleil. It is a Beatles inspired show, and truely beathtaking.

We booked a two night trip on a special offer that was too good to pass up. I've stayed at alot of vegas hotels and Encore has the best rooms in vegas as far as I'm concerned. Everything here was immaculate from check-in to check-out. The check in agent had me in and up to the room within 5 minutes. We were offered a higher room with a strip view for $50 more a night and declined. We ended up on the nineteenth floor and the view from there was not too bad.We had golf course views and overlooked the pool. After seeing the layout of the hotel I'm not sure that even a room on the highest floor would offer much of a strip view.For the most part the Wynn would block most strip view from any floor just because of the positioning of the two hotels. If I can be critical at all it would be the cost of everything here is very high. We had drinks in a few of the lounges and were surprised at the cost although the drinks were good. We ordered sliders, soup and a diet coke via room service one night and it was close to $50. Both items ordered were marginal at best. For the cost I would expect the food to be exceptional and it was not.No big deal.The high quality of rooms and level of service here is why you pay a bit more for everything else and I'd gladly do it again. I would have loved to have golfed because the golf course from my room looked immaculate but I cannot justify $500 for a round of golf anywhere on the planet.That is probably why I only saw 3 or four people on the golf course over the course of my two day stay.For $500 a round I'd want a professional to hit my shots for me and be able to use the score for my handicap index.

It didn't really matter though - how much time do you spend in your room admiring the view? The room itself was very plush and trendy, and the bed was extremely comfortable. Very well done. The hotel itself had an enormous number of quality restaurants to choose from, as it is connected to the Wynn and easy to walk back and forth.

He was profoundly anti-Vegas yet after five nights at this place I could not get him to leave. The whole place is just dripping in crystals and silver and gold and silk. Everywhere you look is weird and interesting and fabulous. I thought the red butterflies were flocked with red glitter; upon closer inspection I found they were encrusted with thousands of crystals. Tacky? Nope. Authentically, unapologetically VEGAS? Yep that's it.... maybe some traditionalists or uber-modern types might want to hate it because it's all so gorgeously over-the-top; so if you can't stand whimsical, \"I've-never-seen-this-before\" opulence then go somewhere else. The Encore is not trying to be ancient Rome, or Venice, or New York, or anything but Las Vegas done right. You see millionaires and billionaires around the casino yet you don't ever feel excluded if you aren't one of them. Although this place is expensive, you get a true resort 5-star experience for less money than most other true 5-star resorts in the world. Food can be expensive but there are a lot of options (Lobby Bar, Cafe Society, Poolside service) that do great food and drinks for milder prices. However, if you are in town to blow a little cash I can think of no place more worthy than Wynn-Encore; we ate like hipster-kings at Bottega, Stratta, and Lakeside Grill. The food was world-class and unique. I remember reading almost every single review on Tripadvisor to plan my stay and it really helped me. I'll reiterate the biggest tips: arrive on a Wednesday or Thursday to avoid check-in / check-out lines. Bring earplugs if you want a lower-floor strip view to avoid the night club noise or face away from the strip. Get to the pool early if you want an umbrella seat. Hit wallgreens or the ABC store across the street in the mall for water purchases. Don't get caught up in the mini-bar (although it's not as outrageous as every other 5-star resort out there). Do buy Day-Passes for those incredible spa pools. You don't have to get a massage (although i did and it was incredible) but you must just check that spa facility out. Go to the gym there (it's great for trying to spot celebrities and Cirque acrobats!) then take a long, leisurely steam / sauna and shower in the spa pools / rooms at least once. CLUBS: OK let me indulge myself a bit and make a comparison between two similar \"epic, club-themed\" hotels in the US - the Fontainbleu Hotel in Miami and the Enocre: last year I went to the Fontainbleu in Miami which boasts one of the world's best nightclubs called \"LIV\". I felt like getting into that club at the Fountainbleu was the most miserable, dehumanizing experience and the bouncers treated people like complete garbage. The lines getting into that hole were 200 people deep screaming to get in the door. As an older gentleman pleaded with the LIV bouncer to get him and his wife in as it was her birthday, the bouncer yelled at him that he had to be patient and that both he and his wife weren't really the type of people they would care to let in anyway. All in all a horrible-yet-extremely-expensive experience. Guess who also boasts some of the world's best nightclubs with \"XS\", \"Tryst\", and \"Surrender\"? Yep it's Encore-Wynn. My husband and I were feeling a little bit dressed-up and we walked by Tryst (although I was still gun-shy about ever getting let into any place like that); the CLUB MANAGER asked us if we would like to go in and then escorted us right to a beautiful banquette where we ordered champagne, listened to the house music, and felt like a million bucks. It was so fun!! What a difference! I don't think they could know how much I appreciated their efforts to envelop us into the Encore experience. So at the risk of sounding evangelical, I would highly suggest you check this place out.

The hotel room itself was spacious, very clean, and included add-ons that many hotels don't provide. Having said that, I was taken aback by the charges that the Wynn added to each room when I checked in. When you're already paying around $300 a night for the room, you really shouldn't expect to see an additional $45 a night tacked on for things like resort fees and charges for the view out your window. This is all in addtion to the normal taxes that travelers are accustomed to paying. Airlines are now required to disclose all their charges when you book your flight. Someone really needs to pass a law forcing hotels to do the same thing. The last thing a frequent traveler wants to find out about is one or more additional hotel charges after a taxi ride from the airport and a long wait in the registration line. This brings me to my next comment, focusing on the registration process. The registration desk is located in an incredibly small space for a hotel of this size. I stood in a line similar to the ones we all encounter at the security checkpoint at the airport, winding my way back and forth. I must have been in line for 20 minutes. Again, not what I would have expected from an upscale property like this one. When it came time to check out, the billing was a disaster. Because of a change in plans, I had to add a day on to my trip. Therefore, I ended up with two different registration records. The hotel supposedly couldn't combine them because one had been made by my travel agency and one by myself. i could have lived with this, but then each bill was divided with two separate entries, and therefore four separate charges were made to my credit card. While the charges totaled correctly, I never could get an explanation as to why the bill was split and charged this way. I spent nearly two hoiurs trying to balance the charges in my web-based expense account program (Concur). I do get to Vegas several times a year for both business and pleasure. While this was my first experince with the Wynn, it will also be my last. There are a number of other hotels on or near the strip that may not have electric drapes in the room, or fancy shower heads in the shower, but that also won't charge you undisclosed fees for things you'll never use. All in all, it was a very negative experience. I just hope that what happened to me in Vegas, doesn't stay in Vegas, but gets communicated to those who might be thinking about staying at the Wynn.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Decatur, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNicest place on the strip\u201d", "Author": "nrawlins", "ReviewID": "UR124354440", "Content": "Very open and luxorious.

We were booking 2 rooms for 3 nights for us and our family. After a drive from Phoenix, upon arrival no bell hop or valet parking greeter to meet us at the hotel entrance so we parked and went in. Like another reviewer we had booked through Booking.com a few weeks in advance. We had altered the reservation three days before arrival to receive a lower non refundable rate ($50/night less). The Booking.com agent called the hotel directly (with me on the line) to confirm that the reservation was changed. The agent at the hotel confirmed that the reservation was in fact changed & that since the hotel had already charged a $400 deposit on my credit card, that would just be deducted from my final bill. I was sent a new email confirmation with the new rate and particulars. Upon arrival the hotel check in agent could not find any record of the revised rate. I showed her the confirmation that I had received but she said they could not honor it unless the reservation dept put it in the system. They had not done so. She went to speak with her manager twice but still insisted it could not be honored. Finally I asked that she bring her manager to speak with me. The front desk manager Katrenia Dupree was not only less than helpful she was rude. She said she could not honor the rate because reservations had no record of it in the system. When I showed her the confirmation of the booking with lower rate she said there was nothing she could do. She said it would take at least an hour to get the issue sorted out with the reservations dept. I asked them to call Booking.com and sort it out with them right now and she said she could not do that either. The agent who checked us in then also mentioned that the pool was closed at the hotel. Not just one pool, all of them. She said they have been closed for quite a while and were not sure when they would be opening. I said that it would have been nice to notify guests of that when making reservations. She said \"that is not our policy\". (Of course not) I later found out after talking with one of the cleaners that the beach club pool was actually filled and functional they just had it closed. Nice cost cutting. After 45 minutes of checking in we finally received our keys. When I went back to get luggage out of the car I was met by the valet attendant who said \"is this your car, I was about to have it towed\". When I said to him \"perhaps if you were here when we got here and perhaps if your check in staff did their jobs properly it would not have been here for 45 mins\". He just took off. Finally a bell hop came to take our bags after we had unloaded them ourselves and asked a hotel cleaner for some help. When we got into the room we had a so called \"strip view\". The strip view consists of a view of the Wynn hotel and the corner of Treasure Island. Inside the room the large mirrors were badly streaked. This was not even cleaned the following day when housekeeping came. It took until the second housekeeping visit (the following day) for them to clean them. I also received an unfriendly voicemail from Katrenia saying that she would not honor the new rate for the room and that I would have to take it up with Booking.com. She then called me directly an hour later saying that they had been able to contact Booking.com and they could now honor the rate. I explained to her the encounter with the valet and she said \"that should never have happened\". I said \"this is what you call exceptional service?\" Katrenia said she would have the hotel manager contact me directly. So far no call from the hotel manager. Of course not. Needless to say my gambling/dining is all going to other hotels. Steve Wynn needs to tell his staff the economy is very different from 10 years ago. The idea of keeping your guests at your hotel for as much of their stay as possible is more important than ever. There are at least 10 other great hotel options in Vegas who actually do care about service & actually serve their customers well (not just talk about it). Steve may want to go \"undercover boss\" to see what is actually going on in his hotels. Otherwise keep it up Steve. Soon your hotels will just be just another average Vegas hotel amongst many other better options.

It was well worth the cost. Our room was comfortably furnished, full of \"designer\" accoutrements, and best of all, clean and quiet. A lot of hotels in Las Vegas have really unpleasant high noise and smoke levels in their casinos, but not the Encore. The hotel exudes \"high end\" and maybe their ventilation system is super-powerful. This hotel is a good choice, therefore, for people who are not comfortable with smoke or allergic to it. This is the first hotel I've found in Vegas that didn't make my hair and clothing stink. A high level of cleanliness seemed to be the rule. We were often out and about early in the morning, and Wynn staff seemed to be everywhere, vacuuming and shampooing rugs, polishing railings, etc. Our room was pretty much spotless. The restaurants in the hotel served decent large meals, though they were certainly not cheap, and the buffet was wonderful. The only negative was the rather high cost of internet access. Charges are levied per computer/device, not per room, if you don't pay the \"resort fee\" up front. Check on that before you decline that resort fee. It seems to be optional for some room rates. Oh, yeah, be sure to check the rather punitive prices for the minibar and snacks to avoid a really unpleasant surprise when you check out.

Due to the curve of the building our room was the closest to the strip in the Resort side of the floor and we had a fantastic view down the strip including Treasure Island, Mirage and Caesars. We could watch the Mirage volcano from our room. The room was large with a comfortable couch and lovely bed. The bathroom was enormous. The pool was pretty quiet but had excellent service with waitresses constantly coming around with complimentary fruit bowls and taking drinks orders. Service was excellent and all members of staff that we dealt with, from receptionists to dealers to cleaners were all very friendly. We got turn-down service one night even though we didnt request it and then someone else tried to do it on the same night!! The room was cleaned everyday and all common areas of the hotel were very clean at all times. The casino is fairly small and quiet compared to some other resorts but the dealers were excellent. The casino is also pretty light which is a nice change from some of the dark ones elsewhere on the strip. The hotel is located to the north of the strip next door to Wynn across from Fashion Show Mall and close to Venetian/Palazzo, Treasure Island and Mirage.

This occured in Spring 2010. I was there for a conference and was placed in a room facing the pool/club. I can't remember which floor I was on but I was able to hear the music outside. Not a big deal to me, it is Vegas after all. I'm the lame one that's sleeping at 11pm. At 1am someone started sliding their key card to open the door. It woke me up but I just ignored it. Drunk people... again, IT IS VEGAS. The shaking of the door and numerous attempts with the key turned into banging on the door. I just waited. At some point these guys should realize it's NOT THEIR ROOM!! The banging went on for 15 minutes with pauses in between making me believe they've left. Finally they got really loud and I got really pissed out. I looked through the peep hole and it was 4 Asian adults, sober, not drunk I oped the door (I know stupid move but I was so pissed) They looked shocked to see me and said \"you're in our room\" I was baffled by THAT response and said, \"no, I\"m in here, you're out there, this is MY room\" They showed me their key card and they were right! The receptionist downstairs had written my room number on their card. Still, I don't bang at a door for 15 minutes when my key doesn't work. I go down and ask for a new one! I told them the lobby made a mistake, you'll have to ask them for a different room. They couldn't understand, so I stood there explaining how an error has been made and just go downstairs. I proceeded to close the door then the guy tried to push it open. That freaked me out, I quickly slammed it and called the lobby. What the hell did that guy think he was going to accopmlish by entering an occupied room at 1am? Now, this is the part that pissed me off. I call the lobby telling them that a stranger banged on my door for 15 minutes because they gave them the wrong room number and that put me in danger.

It was nice to be able to spend time at the different pools although at times it was tricky to get some rays due to the shading of the hotels themselves. One downside was being unable to get a late checkout despite being will to pay for this. We were told we could get a shower in the spa area before leaving but when we got there they wanted to charge us $40+ each to take a shower....eh no! BTW Steve Wynn was right about the Pizza in the Wynn..it was spot on, shame it took us till the last day to get round to trying this!

Usually stay at the Wynn but the prices for the Encore were much better and I like that the casino is much quieter there. Going to bed the first night at 1 AM I could hear people partying in the next room loudly, eventually they quieted or went out for the night. The sound seemed to come through the windows room to room on the 60-something floor and it was nothing I had experienced at any other Vegas hotel. At 7 AM the room that backed up to my bed (a different room) was blasting electronic dance music that I thought I was at a rave. The people were screaming and dancing and jumping on the beds. I called hotel security who quieted them briefly before they started up again. I called to complain again and was told my the operator that this is Vegas and I should expect noise. Yeah, maybe in the hallway baby, not a crackhead rave party in my room, especially not at that hour! Later that day I went to the front desk and my room was moved. First of all, the Encore is a nice, high-end hotel (for Vegas). I expect both higher-end guests and higher-end treatment. Secondly, I don't understand why I had to be inconvenienced and move when the guests on both sides of my room where clearly inappropriate. For this inconvenience the hotel gave me a $75 credit, they should've comped the room for the night or at the very least given a major upgrade when I moved. The reason I am giving the hotel 4 instead of 3 stars is that all the restaurants serve Vegan food which is delicious and a treat when you can get it without complaint in high-end restaurants. Also, the hotel and the hotel rooms are very nice.

They decided to stay at one of the newest hotels in Las Vegas, the Cosmopolitan. We received a promotion at the Encore, which included an upgrade to the Resort king suite, so we opted to take advantage of it. The promo also included 2 tickets to La Reve(brilliant by the way) and complimentary buffet at the Wynn for 2(we've eaten at many buffets in Vegas, this is the best one so far. We had the lunch buffet and the champagne brunch). The reviews on here are all correct regarding the size and comfort of the rooms and beds. So, let me talk about the atmosphere of the hotel itself. We've stayed at many Las Vegas hotels during the years including Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage, TI, etc. Staying at Wynn/Encore, you definitely get a different type of atmosphere(although Bellagio has the same atmosphere as well). If you've ever been to Monte Carlo Grand Casino(in Monaco, not the Monte Carlo hotel in LV), you get the same feeling here at the Encore/Wynn . There's definitely more class with Encore than many of the hotels on the strip, without it being snobbish. The staff also treats all their guests with excellent service, from the valet, bell service, housekeeping, front desk, restaurant staff, etc, without it being too over the top. Back to my friends who did stay at the Cosmopolitan. It's a beautiful hotel, yes.. But you get a different type of people staying there compared to the Wynn/Encore. There's a couple of times, I would hear college kids running in the hallway getting drunk at the Cosmopolitan, when visiting our friends there. Wynn/Encore is definitely more refined, and I'll have to say, staying at Encore was one of the most relaxing stays we've had staying in Vegas. I'm also beginning to like the new image of Las Vegas getting more into boutique hotels, focusing on the guest, services, and uniqueness, instead of theme hotels. One negative especially for this class and type of hotel-are the abundance groups of women at night hanging out trying to get business inside the hotel, although this happens inside all of the hotels on the strip it seems(it's not like they vocally solicit business, but with the next to nothing they're wearing, it's a little obvious).

I'd been in the casino before while staying at a cheap hotel and wanted to get the full Las Vegas experience. I stayed in a standard suite, while my friends stayed up on a higher floor as a $20/night upgrade. What an amazing difference it made in how much I enjoyed my trip! The staff was friendly and accommodating, especially Joanne at the front desk. The housekeeping staff folded my discarded clothes and placed them all together. My friends, celebrating an anniversary, received a giant fruit basket and chocolates in their room. The rooms are spacious, and some have a nice southerly view of the Strip, depending on where in the hotel they are located (ask the front desk or book appropriately), with floor-to-ceiling windows. The bedroom area is separated from the living room area by a dividing wall with a rotating TV in the middle. The restaurants and especially the spa are downright opulent. Even if you are not interested in the spa services, it's worth just asking the spa staff if you can take a quick peek around the facilities to take it all in. The food is on the expensive side, but is delicious without exception. If you are on a bit of a budget, skip lunch, visit the Wynn buffet (the Wynn is connected to the Encore) at the end of lunch hours to get the lunch rate, and stay until they put out the fresh dinner entrees. Seriously, the buffet is not to be missed. I ate enough creme brulee alone to make the price of admission worth it. When my friend mentioned her food allergies to the buffet staff, one of the actual chefs came out and spent literally 15 minutes walking her through each of the dishes and telling her which ones were safe for her to eat! The Encore casino does a good job of keeping the air smelling fresh, rather than smoky. Part of the reason behind that is that it is quite a bit less crowded than other casinos - the Wynn is noticeably smokier/more crowded but still does a pretty good job. The dealers and pit staff were all friendly, and one of the supervisors recognized me instantly even though it had been over a month since my first visit. The table minimums tend to be higher than average, especially during peak hours, but $10 blackjack with decent rules (3:2 payout, surrender) is doable most of the time. The loyalty program (Red Card) is pretty weak for table game players. Unless you play slots or bet $150+/hand, don't expect much in the way of freebies. The night life is quite active at the Wynn/Encore. XS and Surrender, the two major night clubs there, attract the hottest and richest around - so be prepared to dress nice and fork out some dough if you're interested (I wasn't). On the hotel's lower floors, you'll get some bass from the clubs in your room in the wee hours - especially in the Strip view rooms. Prepare/book accordingly. There's a nice little sundries shop by the guest room elevators that sells stuff at a somewhat reasonable markup. There's also a Walgreens across the street to the north, along with a Peppermill restaurant that's not too bad if the Wynn/Encore joints give you sticker shock, plus the Fashion Show Mall with a nice food court across the pedestrian walkway over Las Vegas Blvd just outside the hotel. The location is not too bad, on the northern edge of the Strip. There are some massive empty lots to the north, where new casino construction has been halted because of the economy. There's also the Riviera, and, further north, Circus Circus (stay away) and the Stratosphere. So, basically no reason to go north - everything cool is to the south. If you're catching a show at the MGM Grand or thereabouts, you'll have a LOOOOONG walk. Take a taxi instead.

We enjoyed immensely both the breakfast and dinner buffet. You could add champange or all you can drink Bloody Mary's with an added $10 each cost for breakfast. Plenty of choices, with our favorite Lox and Bagel, choose your own omelettes, a plethora of seafood, with the most popular being snow crab.

We felt like privileged guests, and hope we get to share another wonderful experience at this resort, perhaps in the late sping, summer or fall with warmer weather, because the pools looked so inviting!

The rooms are nice, the SPA is very nice and everything is still looking quite new. But when we decided to book the most expensive hotel on the strip which only offered \"Suites\", we were thinking of something else. The rooms are by no means \"Suites\" as they call them. I have stayed at the Palms and the Venetian before and both have bigger regular rooms than the \"Suites\" at the Encore. Also there is an air condition in the mirror on the side of the room which cannot be turned off. The main AC can be turned off but this one not. And I even heard voices through this one, and no, I am not mental. lol Also the windows dont seem to be very well isolated. You can hear traffic outside, although we were in the 25th floor. What was especially bad was, that while checking in we had to pay another extra $20 per day (the room was prepaid already) for services such as internet and free long distance calls. I think such amenities should be included in the most expensive resort on the strip. As for the SPA, as I already said it is very nice with several pools, showers, steam bath and sauna. But for $40 extra per day it better be. I have stayed in many 5 Stars resorts around the globe and most of them had one thing in common. They were special. In a good way. Encore is not special. Its not better than any of the other resorts I have been in Vegas. So I dont think the higher price is justified and therefore cannot recommend it.

We were travelling with our two children - 14 & 17yrs. We chose the Encore after lots of feedback from friends and people who have stayed in LV and we were not disappointed. The Hotel is beautifully decorated throughout and the grounds/pools were immaculate. It has a slightly quieter, relaxed atmostphere than some of the mid strip hotels, but that suited us. When we checked in we were offered an upgrade for small cost, to a Panoramic room but as it was on the 60th floor (daughter not keen on lifts), we declined. We had a Queen room on the 22nd floor which was some 700+ sq ft and gorgeous. Beds were amazingly comfortable. Bathroom had good size bath, large shower with a double vanity area with all manner of extras! The complimentary silk bathrobes were so lovely to wear I was tempted to buy one! We ate at the Society Cafe which does amazing burgers and at the Wazuzu restaurant (Asian) which was also lovely. A couple of mornings we had breakfast at the buffet in the Wynn which although it was around $86 (\u00a355) for the 4 of us - with the vast selection, high quality and 'eat as much as you like' it was still really good value! The only 'hiccup' we experienced was the noise factor from the XS nightclub (which other reviewers have commented on). The reason for this in that the DJ set is open plan to the European pool area so rooms on the lower floors over looking the pools get affected and it is loud - not only could we hear the base but every song in detail and consequently our first night was not a good one. The next morning we phoned reception and were immedaitely moved to a higher floor with out any fuss and very slick service from the bellboy. We were also given a compimentary upgrade to the Tower Suites which is located at the opposite end of the building to the European Pool area. After this we heard nothing more from the nightclub. This hasn't put us off the Encore and would definitely stay there again but we would ask for a high floor that is towards the Tower Suites end of the buiding and would advise anyone else contemplating a visit to do the same, Rooms on the opposite side of the building are not affected by the nightclub, but they do not have the views of the strip. All in all we loved the Encore.

If we were to return, having looked about the Strip and other hotels if you are going to Vegas and you want to be in the thick of it all I'd choose another hotel next time like the Aria, Cosmopolitan or Venetian, they seem to be more lively, more fun and a little more relaxed. There are loads of great places to eat, two that I'd recommend would be the The Sugar Factory if you want a bite during the day, and The Eiffel Tower restaurant overlooking the Ballagio Fountains for something a little more special. I wouldn't worry about bookng airport transfers unless you want to travel in a Limo as airport taxis are plentiful & reasonably priced. The resort fee felt unneccesary considering the price we paid for the holiday and some hotels are now waiving this additional expense. One word of warning - your room key is also a charge card for the Hotel Casino!

The two resorts (Wynn and Encore) are joined by shopping strips, and both are immaculate! The staff are fantastic; so friendly and helpful without being over the top. The restaurants and bars are plentiful with loads of variety; Terrace Point cafe had the perfect selection of breakfast choices (try the buttermilk pancakes!!), the Loby Bar at Encore is nice, and makes a bloody great martini (also, try the calamari here!!), Zoozacrackers make awesome deli sandwiches, and there is a pretty impressive looking buffet (if thats your thing). The two casinos are nice as well; my preference was the Encore casino, as it felt more calm and a little bit more high-end!! The room... WOW! We upgraded at check in to a Panoramic King Suite on the 59th floor for only $30 extra. The view was to die for, looking down over the strip. The bed is quite possibly the best feature of the room, and the bathroom was enormous! What surprised me the most about the room was how quiet it was! I was worried about noise from the clubs (having read other reviews) but we heard NOTHING. Not sure what rooms further down can hear, but for $30 extra a night it was nice to have that oasis of calm to come back to at the end of a busy day in LV! Having walked around and visited nearly all the main hotels in LV, I am 110% sure we made the best decision by staying at Encore. A lot of the other hotels and casinos were a bit rough around the edges, full of people (and screaming kids!), smoke (yuck!!) and noise. It might be a bit more a night to spend, but if you want a nice, relaxing, safe, friendly and clean place to lay your head after a hectic day in LV, you can go wrong with Encore!

Unfortunately, there were issue this time around! When checking in they had us down for the wrong room type, which they seemed to be able to fix. The problems occurred with the room itself! When checking in I let the hotel know that the mini bar was half empty, they reassured me that although the mini bars are not always restocked, they are billed so I would not be charged upon check out. I even spoke to the manager about this issue at one point due to a phone issue we also had with the room. When check out time came I had over $100.00 dollars billed to me for mini-bar charges that were not mine. When I pointed this out the clerk at check out was rude and non-responsive but did remove the charges. An apology or some recognition of their error would have been appreciated NOT attitude!

When I explained the the front desk and manager about our problems they did give us a credit for buffet but honestly for the inconvenience and rudeness i experienced later on at check out it was not worth it! Despite all this I have to point out that the concierge was amazingly helpful. The hotel is new and rooms are amazing and the casinos are light and bright and amazingly well ventilated!

Arrival time was about 1 pm with the reception desk being staffed with 4 very welcoming employees. There was one couple ahead of us and nobody behind us so check in was very check. Our luggage was already taken from the arrival area by the bell captain's team. Room would be available for occupancy at 3pm (normal as per Encore website). That staff would call me on my cellular phone to let me know when we could pick up the keys. The also made sure you understood the policy on the resort fee, room refrigerator and room snacks. (Check the Encore website for FAQ's). Off to the casino. Plenty of multi-denomination slot machines with various max plays. Table minimums of $10 (but that could go up based up time of day and level of crowd. The casino is smaller that the Wynn's but it is also less hectic and noisy. We learned Pai Gow poker and the dealers were all friendly, conversant, and professional. Their bosses always came by to thank us for coming to the Encore. What a fantastic experience. Time to go to the room. We were there during the National Finals Rodeo so our request for an upgrade was out of the question, but be sure to ask. I did request a room away from the club. Our room was on the 16th floor on the side of downtown (same side as entry way). The room was located near the end of the hallway, but the walk didn't take long at all. Not a very long trek. The ice machine was located nearby. Elevators to the guest rooms are near the check in desk, but in a small hallway that the hotel makes you show your Encore room key to take an elevator during evening hours. It's nice the elevators don't open up to the casino and you don't have to walk through the casino. Very nice. Descriptions of the rooms have been posted before so I'll just describe some small things. The hallway and bathroom have marble floors. Bring something to wear on your feet if you don't want them to get too cold when in the room. Night lights available in the bathroom (nice and unobtrusive). The towels are big and nicely appointed, but not too fluffy. The bathrobes are big, comfortable and very absorbent. We brought a single cup heater for coffee and tea (see Encore FAQ's regarding coffee makers) and we brought our own snacks purchased offsite so room service prices were not a concern. (See Encore FAQ's for menus, etc, regarding your room). We had neighbors but we never heard door closings, conversations, or traffic to the ice machine. The room was spotless and in good working order. No calls to fix/replace or clean anything were ever needed. The room was service about 2 to 3 pm but we were out of the room so it wasn't a concern. The closed was big enough to stow everything and included a small set of drawers, iron and ironing board, safe, pillow and extra blanket. The wall safe is very easy to program, but it is wall mounted so it has about 1 foot of height and only about 5 inches of depth. All in all the trip was fantastic. No gripes, hidden surprises or anything else. We did our homework before we arrived and enjoyed our stay.

My last stays were at New York New York and Paris. This time I was here for a medical conference. The room at the Tower Suite is by far the best I've ever been in. I especially liked the bedside console that controlled everything from the lights to the drapes with a touch of a button. I also liked the privacy button which I used quite often. The room itself was roomy and it's not just all the walled mirrors making it appear that way. The bathroom was spacious and nicely proportioned. The hotel is meticulously clean. I also like the fact that someone stands by the elevators and checks to make sure you're staying there before riding. It just made me feel secure. Location was also a plus for us. It was relatively close to a lot of shopping venues including the Grand Canal Shops and the Fashion Show Mall. Now for the cons. For an expensive hotel you would think they'd have softer towels. I mistook the bath towel as the one you placed on the floor the first night I was there only to realize that all the towels felt that hard. I was there for a conference and apparently that meant I didn't have to pay a resort fee. Thus anything extra cost money including the fitness center and internet access. Okay, I get that. The room was discounted for the conference but when I tried to call and pay for the resort fee so that everything won't be ala carte, they wouldn't let me. That meant there was a charge every 24 hours for my laptop but if I wanted to use my kindle and download a book that was another separate charge even on the same 24 hour period of time. I thought that was just ridiculous. Forget about working out. The food at the conference was mediocre. I've had better with more variety at other hotels. We ate at \"Society\" for lunch. Again somewhat mediocre. The fried calamari wasn't fresh and the serving portions were small but pricey. The vegetable pizza was dripping olive oil. The mac cheese bites were okay. Now, I had my 11 year old daughter with me and believe me, she's an expert on macaroni. The lobby bar overlooking the casino also served food and I did have a good Egg mozzarella and chorizo wrap there but I have a hard time paying 9 bucks for a breakfast sandwich but I hear that's typical in vegas.

Seriously, the rooms are a little bigger, more contemporary and more comfortable. Wynn is nice too, but a little more old fashioned. Never a wait. Unlike most of the other Las Vegas casinos the Encore has enough staff to run the desk, valet, concierge, bell desk, etc. So you never wait long for anything. Enough elevators so you never have to wait for that either. Clean. Everything is spotless in and out of your room. They clean constantly. Quiet. Never heard a sound in my room, but I always stay on a high floor. Classy casino. Good looking crowd, everything is expensive which kind of keeps the bargain hunters away. There are cheaper buffets than the Wynn which drives away the all you can eat crowd. Tends to be very quiet on weeknights, fills up on weekends, but never too loud or nasty. Good ventilation. Good food. Not cheap but we've never had a bad meal anywhere in Wynn or Encore. What we don't like.... Temperature. All public areas are kept in the upper 70s (I'm guessing 76-78) which is way too hot for Las Vegas, but just perfect for Tokyo.

We arrived the day of the Las Vegas marathon. The strip was closed to all traffic and we were trying to get to the Encore from the west. After trying several avenues, we called the hotel which gave us a route which was also closed. Finally, we asked a police officer manning one of the side street roadblocks who advised us to park in the mall and walk to the hotel (1/4 to 1/2 mile including the interior of the casino) as it would be another 6 hours before we could get across Las Vegas Boulevard. This was after trying for about an hour to drive 1/4 mile. Why doesn't a hotel that purports to be as classy as the Encore notify arriving guests to expect this problem and suggest ways around it or at least warn you?

In retrospect I think the smell was caused by dust in the air ducts burning in a room that had not had the heat turned on in a while, especially since it didn't happen again but for the hotel to ignore a guest who smells something burning is inexplicable. I tried to get ice a couple of times over an hour and a half from the ice machine and it was either not working or empty so I called the front desk. A bucket of ice was promptly delivered which was in line with what I have experienced in the past from this hotel and it's sister the Wynn where I have also stayed. But for the remainder of our stay, there was no ice available and I didn't bother to call any more. On another day I was away from the room most of one day and returned about 4 pm. Our room had not been cleaned but someone had left a spray bottle of a cleaning liquid on an end table and thrown a couple of clean sheets over the bed. Puzzled, I walked out into the hallway, found a member of the hotel staff who promptly arranged to have the room made up. I asked them to wait a half hour so I could shower but the door bell rang twice, once before I could even get in the shower and again while I was in the shower. On one trip to the lobby our elevator acted erratically. We got in and pushed the lobby/casino button and nothing happened. I tried it several times and with no movement, I pushed the \"open door\" button and we got out. I waited a while and pushed the \"call\" button again and the same car opened. Reluctantly we entered and pushed the lobby/casino button. A maintenance man had joined us so we felt a little more comfortable. He asked us how our stay was and we said fine. He got off 2 floors lower and then the elevator went back up to our original floor where we got off and waited quite a while before pushing the elevator call button again. On subsequent trips I realized that one of the \"lobby/casino\" buttons was inoperative, resulting in nothing happening unless you pushed the other button. Except for ignoring our report of the smell of something burning, these are not huge issues but cumulatively I would expect more from a hotel that likes to make itself out as one of the best on the Las Vegas strip. Clearly these maintenance and other issues are not consistent with that status.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cNot Conducive for a Good Nights Rest!

The hostesses and wait staff are great. The managers actually help out too instead of just dropping by your table to ask how things were. Wonderful experience and the menu are great and have something for everyone. The sliders of any flavor are recommended. ROOM SERVICE. Very good. Food was set up for us and presented, served and most of all warm and delicious. SPA. Simply the best compared to any around. Trust me on this one. GAMING. Tight slots. Gambled 1k on Double Diamond $1 and $5 dollar slots and Wheel of Fortune $1 and $5. The largest pay out was $20 on one spin. I am not looking to win every time but a pay out of at least $100 or $50 would have made us feel better at least once. It would have been spent back anyway. I would recommend doing your gambling elsewhere. If you are looking a good night\u2019s rest, yes sometimes people do want to sleep in Vegas, DO NOT STAY HERE! Or request a room on the North side of the Encore. The music from the XS nightclub is ridiculous. I mean disgusting. We were on the 39th floor and could hear the thumping all night until 4am each night. The 39th floor! Called to express concern in the morning and spoke with Kirsten, as others have mentioned in their reviews and received the same lip service as they did. She is an expert at answering this complaint as she receives it often I assume. We asked to be moved to another room on the same floor but the opposite side. They couldn't accommodate our request but could have moved us to another floor on the opposite side. We had already unpacked so we asked for ear plugs instead (which were brought up) and a late checkout of 4pm the next day which they granted immediately. Sober this evening and with ear plugs, we were woken up again multiple times to the music. Shame on us we should have moved rooms even though it doesn\u2019t make it right. I get it. It\u2019s Vegas. Sleep at home or consume so much that you pass out or just ask for a room on the North side. However, every individual should be entitled to a good night\u2019s rest if that is your thing or even not for that matter. I am quite disappointed with my stay because of this reason and will not be staying here again. I have received the same experiences at other hotels in Vegas (Caesars, MGM Grand, and Flamingo) and never had to listen to music until 4am each night. I am not a chronic complainer with a holier than though attitude. I am 41 year old, middle class, white collar business professional that travels for business 50 nights a year. However, I will not tolerate a poor nights rest at other hotels across the world due to hotel negligence, I shouldn\u2019t have to accept it from a \"5 Star\" hotel in Vegas. Vegas shouldn\u2019t be an excuse and tolerance for loud music interrupting your sleep. If that were case, escorts roaming in the hotel hallways should be tolerated as well, which it is not. It's Vegas right? Thanks but no thanks! Stay home, stay elsewhere or go the XS club.

Hassle-free. She offered up a bellman, and was very accommodating, and understanding. Encore is clean, gorgeous, and love the property, the fabulous selection of outstanding restaurants.

Outstanding filet, and exceptional dining experience. Society was exceptional, as always, and ordered in-suite dining at 3am, after a late night downstairs. The food was fantastic, and delicious. Encore is always consistent about following up with email guest surveys to ensure that if there was anything that was not up to standard, you can advise them, and appreciate their follow-up.

The hotel was very 'swanky', bathed in oriental themed lamps, flowers, rugs, furniture, chandeliers, etc, etc. If you like the color red, this is the place for you! It was all tall ceilings, opulent drapes, tassels, artwork, prints,and furniture seatings throughout. Many restaurants to choose from inside...we liked Society Cafe for breakfast.

The bathroom was very large with two vanities, a large sit in tub and a shower with built in shelf/seat. The toilet itself had it's own little room. The closets were spacious...the bed was sumptuous and so were the linens! The suite had a terrific living area to sit down and take in the view. It was so great! Two little nit picky things...The first is, the room did not come with a coffee pot. That would be a nice touch, although I realize the casinos want you to depend upon them for your every need. This should be in all rooms! The second is the tacky note attached to the snack bar that says if you lift an item to inspect and do not put back in a 60 second time interval, you will be charged.

I enjoyed my first stay a lot, it is definitely one of the most impressive hotels on Las Vegas Blvd. The real quality of a hotel only shows in times of complains (if justified or not) and how they deal with it. And in this regard the Encore it definitely one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in and it seems as if the General Management is in absolutely no contact with its department heads and does not control its actions afterwards in any way. What has happened? I stayed at the Encore in August 2011 for 4 nights. On the morning of the second day I placed my dirty laundry (estimated value $ 300 \u2013 one pair of jeans, one sweater and some socks) in the hotel\u2019s laundry bag and placed that bag on my suitcase next to the trash can and to the room\u2019s desk. After returning to our room in the afternoon, I recognized the disappearance of my laundry bag. Following my first intention I called the room service and asked them if they have taken my laundry for cleaning. But they denied and put me trough to the security department. After a while, two security ladies knocked at my door and recorded a file. I told them what has happened and they handed me out a telephone number were I should call after 7 days. I didn\u2019t call after 7 days. 2 days later at the day of my departure I gave them a call and they told me that they were not successful in finding my laundry till now and I should call again next week. What else can you do in such a situation than to check out, continue your trip and hope for the best. But it came worse. I called the next week and after being placed on hold for a very long time they informed me that my file has been closed as my laundry was not found neither in the laundry nor anywhere else. So I asked if they have checked the video surveillance. They answer was that they can not give me any information on such details. So I asked them if there is any proof that someone has broken in my room. Again they denied to give me any information on that. So I asked to talk to the head of the security department. The head was out of office but after 2 hours I got a call back. The answer remained the same: it is not possible to get access to the video footage, they could find it and it is not their fault that my laundry disappeared.. From the perspective of the hotel guest a very unsatisfying situation. I don\u2019t want to blame anyone but the only way it could have happened is that the housekeeping lady thought my dirty laundry to be trash and threw it away. Or, but definitely less likely, someone broke in my room and the only thing he did steal was my dirty laundry. I shared both theories with the conversational partner of the security department of the Encore \u2013 without success. However, in such a situation as a paying hotel guest you expect by far more information and cooperation by a hotel than to tell you to call them and be then left alone with the fact that the file has been closed. What I expect from a good hotel management in such a situation would at first be to go for an apology. Not the Encore. During the phone call they always emphasized that it was not their fault. Not a word of apology, not a bit of an attempt to work on a solution. The next step taken by a good management, independent of who\u2019s right or not, would be to find a solution for the customer to compensate him for his loss. Not so the Encore. I had to ask for a compensation for my lost/stolen/disappeared clothing. They denied and said they do not compensate in cases of loss of guests property. So if things disappear from your room at the Encore, be aware of that you do not get a compensation! So I at least asked if they could offer me a discount on my next stay or what else they do suggest to offer me as compensation for my clothing. A good management would offer you a good deal and hope to keep you as a customer. A stupid management would deny any compensation. But if you really want to provoke a guest and make him write an article about his stay on tripadvisor, you gonna tell him that you can not offer him any compensation BUT would \u2018try to get him a fruit basket to his room at his next stay. But you can not promise\u2019. End of citation. Dear Management of Encore. I know that a General Manager can not be everywhere all the time. But he has to ensure a certain quality standard and coach and instruct his employees to follow certain guidelines and some kind of a company culture. If you promise best service and quality at your hotel, you also have to follow these rules regarding your complaint policy. As I still don\u2019t know what has happened to the property that did disappear from my room and have experienced absolutely no cooperation neither regarding research nor compensation, I can not recommend to stay at the Encore Hotel", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding!\u201d", "Author": "Carli C", "ReviewID": "UR121383658", "Content": "I have just stayed in The Encore Nov 2011 as a couple.

But having stayed in Encore at Wynn is truly a royal experience. Opulent. Excessive. It's Vegas. Would they do it any other way? The Encore's lobby is decorated with $150k hand-blown glass chandeliers from Murano, Italy. And they're beautiful. My husband and I stayed here for two nights courtesy of a promotional offer that included two show tickets to Le Reve and a free upgrade to a king suite. The king suite is beautiful--floor to ceiling windows that open to a view of the Wynn, the golf course, the strip, and overlooks the hotel pools below. We had a spacious bathroom with a separate shower and tub and a tv built into the side wall. Because you have to watch TV when you brush your teeth, right? Our living area had a comfortable sofa with a chaise. The master remote on my nightstand controlled the lights in the room and the shades. So if you're too lazy or hungover, no need to get up. There's no coffee pot to make your own coffee in the room and there's a 24-hour little market downstairs for late-night or early morning munchies. The hotel has two nightclubs (XS and Surrender--supposedly very nice clubs) and according to the concierge, the line usually begins around 9 p.m. and there's a 2-3 hour wait! Entrance fees for guys at the time of this review was $45/55 and for women $25/35 and can go up from there as the night wears on. We didn't go to either club but did witness the super long lines in the hotel casino. The casino is fairly-sized and plenty of slots to choose from also. We ate at Botero on our last night and it was really good. Standard prices for a steakhouse. If you go, it'd be criminal if you didn't order the truffle mac n cheese. Just my opinion.

I'm definitely conflicted on the hotel but for those who want to just cut to the chase, the bottom line is next time I'm in Las Vegas I'd stay somewhere else. The Pro's: Very well kept property. It's Vegas, but it's not over-the-top cheesy. It's got a classier look to it. Everything is very clean, all the staff are very polite. For the money (assuming you're not paying full price), it's a very good looking hotel. The rooms are big, modern and nicely decorated and the views are fantastic. The Con's: First, nickle and diming and silly policies. $15 a day per PERSON in your room to use the fitness center. $13 a day for internet in your room. Want to just pay the $20 a day resort fee instead? \"I'm sorry sir, your rate doesn't include the resort fee.\" So I want to pay you money and you won't take it? End result, we went for a run instead and skipped the gym and used internet on our phones. Encore loses $20 a day...for what? Inconveniencing your \"valued guest\"s? Second, I don't understand this but the rooms pick up the music from the clubs FAR below. I was on the \"50th\" floor (really around the 40th due to their floor numbering system). Beginning at midnight and lasting until 4 AM we were treated to the thumping music of the nightclubs. The beachclub was closed for the season, so this was NOT due to that. I could sleep through it, but it drove my wife crazy. The clubs at the Wynn/Encore are all at ground level, so I'm at a loss to explain how the music travels that far but bottom line is you can hear it pretty clearly. Third, the service is good on the surface. The staff is polite. They say the right things, but then there's no follow-through. Examples: On our last day I visited the casino host to see what type of comps I had qualified for. I was a net winner (which they knew) but I figured asking wouldn't hurt and anything was better than nothing. They offered me a modest credit off my bill due to the time I spent at the tables and the amount we had spent at the resort restaurants. Fair enough. \"Don't worry, Mr. Stocki, I'll take care of everything\". Guess what? No credit on the bill. Another: They didn't have the King bedroom I requested on my reservation. Kindly upgraded my room to a panoramic view suite (with 2 queens) and said I could switch after my first night - they'd put in the request and contact me the next day when it was ready. Didn't contact me. Never put in the request. Front desk person I spoke with the next day \"said\" all the right things but there was an underlying attitude that was very annoying to interact with. It's hard to describe other than I felt like I was being spoken to like a child... I could relate several other instances of similar situations that occurred over the 5 days we were there but the bottom line is they say the right things but there's no follow through or not enough attention to detail.

I immediately went to the front desk and spoke to a Duty Manager and explained the situation. I know its only $50 BUT it would have been nice to have been informed. The matter was rectified we were given the room upgrade for free. The pool at the Encore is fabulous. The \"European\" pool is adult only and you could sunbathe topless. The service was really good and the poolside snacks/meals are reasonably priced and of good portion. This is actually my favorite part of the hotel. Cocktail service at the casino was good. Not very good but good enough. If you fancy nice lunch I recommend the Society Cafe. The Kobe burger was delish, my husband had the wagyu beef which he enjoyed a lot.

There are no suites at the Encore that have two beds. Unfortunately, because I was staying with my sister, we had to get a roll-away bed. The suites are huge, we had the smaller one and it was about 700 square feet. The bed is very comfortable, and the amenities are excellent. The housekeeping staff does a wonderful job, which is good because there are no ice machines, meaning they need to deliver ice. Fortunately, they bring it around when the come by to turn down the beds. The fitness center offers classes, which is excellent. I took the Pilates class which uses the reformer. The teacher was very professional and really knew what she was doing. I took a class on Tuesday and Thursday at the cost of $20 per class plus tip, and it was worth every penny. There are Zumba classes, spinning classes, yoga and pilates. The classes are held in well equipped studios. Book early for the classes, they are limited in size. My Pilates classes were not full, most likely because they were at 8:30 a.m. The pros of this property are the location, comfortable beds, great staff and wonderful amenities, the cons of this property are no ice machines, no coffee makers, and only one bed.

It is so vibrant that it makes many other Vegas properties dull, and that\u2019s not easy to do. \u2022 It lacks a grand entry, like its big brother Wynn, but that does not matter. The sense of arrival happens as soon as you hit the check in area. \u2022 The walk from check-in to room elevator takes less than a minute. Imagine that. No map needed. \u2022 The rooms are big, beautiful, super comfortable, and full of gadgets. Their size is enhanced with a wall of mirrors. \u2022 Thru-out this property there are fantastic details that are super cool. Its almost unfair for other \u201cnormal hotels\u201d, who don\u2019t benefit from gambling revenue. How much does it cost to imbed butterfly mosaics into marble floors? Or install curved escalators? \u2022 We took in Le Reve, which is simply an amazing show. \u2022 We dined at many of the hotel\u2019s options: Botero, Wynn Buffet, Lobby Caf\u00e9, Spa Caf\u00e9 (wheat germ shot anyone?)and Caf\u00e9 Society. Each experience was great. Though not the priciest meal we had, Caf\u00e9 Society was our favorite. The grilled artichokes are amazing. \u2022 We checked out Surrender, the indoor / outdoor pool-themed night club. What an electric club experience that is \u2013 even if just to see the lighting show. \u2022 We did use the \u201cspa\u201d, which is another architecturally amazing space \u2013 and its one where the treatments are given with the greatest of expertise. \u2022 Directly across from the Fashion Mall is handy. \u2022 The only negative: many of the bartenders in the various casino bars are \u201cgruff\u201d. I am not sure why, but their collective lack of personality / service stood out in a hotel full of professional staff. \u2022 The room rate went from $250 for the person who booked early to $500 for the person who booked 2 weeks out. Book early. \u2022 F&B, Spa services, etc are all very expensive, but you get more \u201cexperience\u201d for those dollars. \u2022 There is not a true sports book in Encore, so if that is important for you, you might want to consider Wynn.

Not pushy, trying to sell you a million different products, just did their job and did it well. I decided one day to go to Canyon Ranch Spa at the Venetian just to compare....no comparison it was like a meat market in there and the clients were cattle. My first turnoff was when I was handed my bathrobe from the assigned locker and it was filthy, covered in woman's face makeup. YUCK! Don't hesitate to book at the En ore/Wynn.

I personally would not pay extra for a strip view as I don't feel it is worth the money. The suite was incredible, very spacious and well set out. Even though the bedroom is not separated from the living area with a door it does feel like you are in a separate room. The bedside controls for the lights and curtains is a good touch as are the floor to ceiling windows and mirrors. I think the only way the room could be improved is to have a jacuzzi in the bathroom. I also liked that the mini bar was on a timed weighted system so you could actually have a look at the products for up to 60 seconds and if you decided not to buy it you could replace it and not be charged. The hotel itself is reasonably compact (on a Vegas scale) , the casino in the Encore seemed smaller and quieter that many of the others, which I personally liked, however it is directly connected to the Wynn which has a considerably larger gaming floor if you wanted that atmosphere.

Wait a minute, I had to pay more to stay at a suite which I didn't really need or wait for few hours? No way. I decided to wait for one hour for the room. When I returned to lobby at 4pm, they still didn't have a room and asked for upgrade again. I was very upset and let the lady know that I wasn't going to upgrade unless the hotel absorbs the fee.

Pools were good, we can always find suntanning beds and the pools are not too crowded. They provide iced water nearby. We had a massage at the spa and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. You've got to splurge because it's the best massage I've ever had. We ended up being at the spa all afternoon because we couldn't bear to leave. Only a couple of downsides: Location is far from everything else as it's at the end of the strip. Also service is not very personal. I was there with a few friends to celebrate us turning 30 this year, I had emailed Encore in advance to see if they would make our special trip more special (usually hotels offer upgrades etc) but they never responded nor did they do anything special. My friends who stayed at Mandarin Oriental at the same trip was treated with birthday cake, fruits and personal cards. Not huge problem though as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

Met some people staying on the lower floors and they could here the nightclub music into the night. The hotel facilites are fabulous with a choice of many restaurants, nightclubs and shops, and if you are into Gambling of course a Casino. You also have access to all the facilites within the Wynn Hotel and Casino. There are two pools an Adults only and a family pool, which seemed more popular as this pool was in the sun for a longer period, and you can access the pool at the Wynn also. Pool service was great, with complimentary iced water available and complimentary grapes were offered throughout the day. The Poolside Menu has a great choice of snacks, smoothies and drinks. All the staff at the encore are polite, friendly and at your service so please remember to tip them. We were here for a work conference and the facilities for this were wonderful. Yes you are charged the resort fees and you do have to pay for internet. The location of this complex is great just far enough from the mayhem at the centre of the strip, and just close enough to take part if you wish. Located directly across from the Fashion Show Mall for great shopping, and more restaurants, I recommend Maggiano's and Segundo's. And a close taxi ride to the northern Premium Outlets for really good shopping and a visit to Downtown Vegas a must at night to see the Freemont Street Lights!

Floor to ceiling windows, a large corner sofa, TV's in room and bathroom. But no tea/coffee maker and DO NOT EVEN MOVE ANYTHING FROM THE MINI BAR OR THE SNACKS ON TOP, you incur an immediate charge. If you leave the hotel by the Encore exit and turn left there is a strip with a small liquor store (and a Denny's). Noise: We had a 20th floor strip view.

We had great sunset views as well. Casino: I am a real cheapskate gambler. But the drinks were provided even for the likes of me on the 50c Blackjack machines with good grace. The casino decor is really gorgeous, both in the Encore and the Wynn. I did not visit the Aria to compare, but no other hotel that I visited was as visually stunning.

There is no personal attention here because of the sheer number of people passing through. You are been herd just like the rest of the strip hotels, like a bunch of cows. Case in point: 1. Checking in: I booked two rooms. My first priority is to have connecting rooms, second is to have quieter room in higher floor. I am not even interest in the view, just want quietness. I asked for higher floor (using AMX Platinum Card Fine Hotel Program) but the agent seems to just trying to get thru the booking and get me going. Sure enough, as I walked into the 35th floor, I can hear the music and the windows vibrating from the Beach Club. Called the supervisor, took him 10 minutes, moved me to 54th floor on the opposite side - quiet. His attitude is exactly what I expected, very apologetic, he did all the work, I just sit there and wait for the result. He even comp us with a small in-room fridge, and it showed up the same time I get to the room \u2013 fast. So they do have a great recovery procedure, but why can\u2019t the front desk agent do the same thing? maybe because he wants to be fast and move me along? 2. Checking out: As I was standing in line waiting to check out and the line was getting longer. A supervisor came out, stand in front of me (literately up against me), and ask me to walk around the line and chained off in front of me \u2013 no apology or even a \u201cplease\u201d. I looked at him in disbelieve, shake my head and walked away, Not worth the argument. A simple \u201cI am so sorry for the trouble but can you please help me by moving to the other side?\u201d would do. But to him, I am just another tourist in a long line, nothing personal. 3. There is a line to get to buffet, there is a line to a sit down breakfast, there is a long line to get coffee, there are lines everywhere. You are in a tourist hotel, not resort. By the way, I asked for non-smoking rooms, yet one of the room smell like someone just smoked in there. In fact, I can see cigarette butts at the trash can in front of elevators, and occasionally smell smoking in the hallway, proving some people ignore the non-smoking rule. I guess it\u2019s not the hotel\u2019s fault, you are in Vegas. And no coffee or tea maker in the room? I had never been in a resort without a coffee maker.

The Room(#5348) was good with a great View of the Mountains and downtown old Las Vegas. King Bed was a little bit smaller than our King at home but comfortable with an array of Pillows. The Bath was large and very modern. We had trouble with the Air Conditioning the first night but maintenance cleared things up the next day. They did not have a turn down service at night. We were always short of a few Towels. We ate at Switch, in the Hotel, a Great experience with the Interior changing every 30 minutes and probably our best dinner in Vegas. The Staff were very pleasant and helpful. I wish they had a Coffee Pot in the room. I wasted a lot of time going down stairs each morning and standing in line for a Cup!! What I did not like was the Pool. My wife and I enjoy a Pool but these were a little over the Top for us!! The music was too loud at the two big Pools. The third pool I believe was a European Pool. Did not care to visit there. I could not read my book for the pounding beat. I would have prefered an Adult only Tranquil atmosphere Pool for folks like us. I did like the Hertz Rental Car at the Hotel. We rented a Car and visited Red Rock Canyon about 15 miles West of Vegas. You should do that one day and take a Picnic basket. Beautiful!! In closing, Smoke is everywhere, even in the Lobby. Someone should catch on and build a Non Smoking resort in Las Vegas. Overall a good stay at a good Hotel.

No difficulty finding a spot near the entrance and so do not use the common parking garage for Wynn and Encore. Rooms in encore are spacious and starts with at least tower suite I believe. Try to look for special rate from Wynn's website for advanced reservation, special offers and reservation through credit card program etc. When I checked online for reservation, rate for a regular room at Wynn and tower suite at Encore are the same and so I chose suite. Since it's a suite, there is an extra living room with great view to Wynn, green golf course and strip. It's definitely bigger than rooms from Wynn since Encore is built later. It's well decorated for 5 stars standard but I think suite from Palazzo is a bit larger. Still no complaint from me because I paid same amount of money for non-suite room at Bellagio or even smaller room at Wynn which could be the smallest room for 5 stars in Vegas. Positives: - Beautiful suite room as described above. Instead of wasting 2 flat screen TVs in my suite, Encore installed a rotating TV so that you can either watch from bedroom or from living room. - Dedicated staff who are willing to help all the time. I lost my telephone on Casino floor but very honest cleaning staff sent it to lost and found department and when I inquired about my lost phone at security department next morning, it's there. I really could not believe it. - Availability of prime time show, La Reve is a big, big plus in this place. Only other 5 stars place in town (i.e. Bellagio) can host unique cirque du soleil shows in water. - Self parking behind the elevator, wow, I like it. Don't even think about using valet. - Good size swimming pool (more than 25 meters but smaller than gigantic Roman pool from Bellagio) is good enough unless you are swimming for London Olympics. Adult only pool is a plus too. Neutral: - Waiting time at elevators is quite long and I've seen much faster, \"right-away\" elevators at all MGM hotels, Palazzo and Planet Hollywood in Vegas. There are many people waiting at lobby level and more than one elevators need to be sent down at a time. - Encore/Wynn might try to limit window shopping visitors which really is not a bad idea but less visitors mean less revenues to shops and restaurants. Nightly light show at waterfall is nothing compared to free things at Bellagio fountain, Caesars' Palace etc. Negatives: - Resort fees of up to 22$/day a day is included in total bill and Encore still try to charge extra 14$ for internet (yes, 14$ per computer per day, not per room). That's why \"Total Rewards\" group hotels including Caesars' Palace, Paris are claiming they are good guys because they don't charge those ridiculous fees. - Food overall is very expensive inside Encore or Wynn. Even Bellagio has several places for reasonable pastries, coffee. So please try to take time and doing research for better deal if you are too tired to go outside Encore. Since I did not do my home work, I missed some good deal at Wazuzu, which is fine dining per Wynn's classification. I tried semi-fine dining food at Society Cafe and Red 8 and I'm sad to see the direction Vegas eatery industry is going. If they keep increasing the price for indifferent food, I'll just go to Wynn buffet for good food.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cThe Place to Stay in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "Henry C", "ReviewID": "UR118856270", "Content": "I've stayed at all the top hotels in Vegas and the Encore is by far my favorite (I prefer it to the older Wynn).

On the 28 floor we had a great view of the 2 pools, golf course, Wynn and the strip. Im a clean freak and even to my standards the room was spot on. They work very hard through out the whole hotel to keep it tidy, you wont see rubbish anywhere! They give you plenty of towels and shampoo and al the little extra even down to polish and a shoe buff. The pools are lovely. Im an early bird so always got a good chair. I would say if going to the pool over the weekend try and get down early as i noticed the pool was busier on sat and sun. The food and drinks served at the pool are not too expensive either i thought they were a good price compared to the mini bar prices wich are a killer! Also i have to mention that there is ice cold water machines pool side so you dont need to bring any down and its free and also the bring round fresh grapes each day and cold bottled water all free as well. Just nice little touchse. The shops in the Encore and Wynn are beautiful! Im a big shopper so having 2 Chanels in 1 hotel was perfect! The are special stores not really the everyday shop but great to look at and always made to feel welcome. I ate in the buffet for breakfast and dinner both where fantastic!! The choice was endless and its all so fresh. Breakfast have ceras, fry up, rolls, toast, pizza, cakes, nachos, noodles, omelettes made to order, fruit, porridge and even toffe apples!! And dinner was turkey, ribs, lamb, salad bar, soup, cheese and breads, veg, potatoes, chinese section, pizza, pasta.......it really does go on and on. I even heard a chef say to a lady he would make he something she asked for that some how they didnt have out. I also ate at the steak restaurant Botero in the Encore AMAZING!!! This restaurant was a high standard and the price does reflects that but i have never had the nicest most juciest steak, it was perfect. They come as plain or fancy as you like and its situated next to the pool so in the evening its lovely to look out over while eating dinner.

Before going to the property we got help from Magen with our limo, show tickets. She was AWESOME. I felt like I was bugging her so much but she was always so helpful.

The slower pool is still fine but the \"beautiful\" people aren't over on that side as much which is probably good for us normal folk LOL The \"Beach Club\" was $100 to get into the holiday weekend so we avoided it at all cost.

This hotel is stunning! My boyfriend and I make an annual trip to Las Vegas. This year we booked our room at the Wynn, but upon check-in, were upgraded to a suite in the Encore. As Steve Wynn describes on the website, the hotel is filled with little surprises. The decor is brilliant, with exciting things to look at from floor to ceiling, and the arrangement of the rooms, pools, restaurants, lounges, etc. seem to be very carefully thought out. They have a handful of different pools, we spent our time at the main Encore pool and the main Wynn pool. The Wynn pool is by far my favorite pool that I have ever been to. The design (a long lane connecting two large circular pools) is very unique and intimate. Lots of great places to sit in and around the pool. All lounge chairs are very comfortable, pool staff is very attentive. We had lunch at Botero one day - the veggie wraps were delicious. The Parasol up/down cafe is fun and whismical - we sat outside one night on their patio overlooking the lake of dreams, and enjoyed the light show that takes place every half hour. We also dined at the SW Steakhouse for dinner - delicious (the 6oz. fillet is not on the menu but you can get it if you ask), great staff, but pricey. Dined at Society Cafe for breakfast - loved the oatmeal pancakes! We only tried out the buffet for breakfast one morning, but it was the best breakfast buffet I have eaten at in Vegas! Would love to go back another time and check out the dessert room! Beds were very comfortable. The service was excellent everywhere.

This was my first trip to Vegas and I wasn't sure what to expect but when landing we could already see the hotel from the plane which was a lovely feeling. Upon arrival myself and my group were overwhelmed. Check in was quick, we were politely and pleasantly greeted and we were told that we had rooms together (as requested). We were offered the choice to upgrade rooms ($20pppn) then we'd be able to go to one of the higher floors, we decided to upgrade and we weren't disappointed. The views from the 50th floor were all across the strip and well worth upgrading for - especially at night. I must stress to you that the hotel is stunning. No attention to detail is missed and the butterfly theme follows you everywhere. The hotel is beautiful everywhere you go; outside too - and no area is plain or run-down, its the ultimate luxury. We walked all over the hotel and were pleasantly surprised at every corner all different kind of arty things around the hotel. I walked around to many of the big, well known hotels: The Mirage, Bellagio, Paris Las Vegas, New York New York, The Cosmopolitan, Venetian, Stratosphere and I can honestly say that the Encore/Wynn trumped them all in terms of design where some others looked slightly run down in places. The rooms are incredible - and the design was amazing, lots of space and it lacked that 'hotel vibe' that most rooms come with - you feel like the room is yours and not just one of many. I can't even describe how lovely the design of the room is! The room comes furnished and its all well kept. The bed is so comfortable and the bathroom is lovely. I never had any water problems heat and pressure adjustable. Lots of mirror space and good lighting - the window is floor to ceiling and you have an incredible view. One of my friends who travelled with us had already stayed in Vegas at the MGM Grand and he said the rooms didn't compare - that the Encore was much better. I must stress that ALL staff at the hotel, are incredibly helpful, friendly, courteous and polite. We encountered lots of different staff and you were always made to feel that your request was no problem and they genuinely wanted to help you. I've stayed at alot of hotels and its rare to come across such fantastic customer service. Staff are a credit to the hotel and part of the fantastic service when you stay here. The conceriege helped us checking in online, enquiring with information with other hotels and various bookings. Breakfast here is incredible! I had already been told before I came here that I must eat at the Wynn (the hotels are merged so you have access to both facilities) and I wasn't disappointed there is a wide and varied choice of possibly everything you could want. There are chefs waiting by preparing fresh food and there to see your specifications. To give you a rough idea there is fruit, yoghurts, freshly cooked meats, egg, eggs Benedict and there is even a choice of Japanese, Thai food and a few others. There is lots of space and I would advise you get down earlyish on weekends as locals and people from other hotels come here. Club XS - again we were told about this club before we came - one of the most expensive club refurbishments in the world. The club itself is big and spacious and there was always a queue to get in. TIP: the dress code is strictly smart; women must wear heels (it makes the point of saying no sandals) and men must be wearing smart clothing. This is pretty much the same throughout Vegas so I would recommend you pack some dressy things for evenings! SW Steakhouse my sister got married in Vegas and she decided to come here for her wedding breakfast. This restaurant does not disappoint myself any some members of our party agreed we'd had the best steak we'd ever had here. We ate so much we couldn't manage dessert or any of the sides we'd ordered! It was the most incredible meal and I thoroughly recommend it. Tips: For cheap gambling the stratosphere (the only downside to the Wynn is that gambling is expensive). Clubbing wise the best clubs are: Ghost Bar - Palms Hotel (nice view point and fairly busy for a Sunday) XS - Wynn (absolute must - this is one of the nicest clubs) Tryst - Wynn Pure - Caesar's Palace Marquee - Cosmopolitan Tao - Venetian Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone and its one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.

I prefer this as I found the middle of the strip near the Bellagio to be manic and very busy a bit like Blackpool. The check in was quick and efficent I requested a room that did not face the strip above the busy nighclubs which are very noisy at the weekends. The room was clean and very well appointed the bathrobes were lovely. We ordered a number of times from the in room dining and the service and quality were faultless, they always arranged a time to collect the dishes once we had finished. The pool area was lovely with free water and fruit bought around regularly, always plently of waitresses to take your drink orders. It would have been nice if there were some shaded ideas near the pool where you could sit for drinks and lunch. The pool menu was very limited considering the amount of diferent restuarants there are in the hotel. The hotel caters for the younger end of the market and there are lots of people off to the clubs and the beach club in the afternoon at weekends. The Beach club is a good idea for the young hip crowd very Ibiza, but should be situated a bit farther from the main hotel it is a 5 star hotel and the most pleasant experience to be accosted by alot of drunk half naked people trying to get into the hotel. I think Mr Wynn needs to make his mind up about what age/type he wants to market the Encore too. If he wants the young hip crowd only then target that market and let people know.

The pool area is beautiful and staff bring round free bottles of water and bowls of fresh fruit to keep you hydrated. There are plenty of sun beds and all are free of charge ( unlike Mandalay Bay). There are plenty of bars and restaurants, and we enjoyed some lovely meals. Also, whilst gambling, waitresses keep up a steady supply of drinks and even playing slot machines you can quickly accumulate enough credit for free buffets etc. if you join the Red Card program. On the down side, some of the restaurants are extremely pricey - even for a luxury resort. Switch Steak is a prime example. Great food - but way overpriced. We split a salad as an appetiser and each had a steak and shared three sides and a bottle of wine. This cost the same amount as the five course parallel tasting menu WITH wine pairings at Aureole in Mandalay Bay. Also, the rooms are described as suites: they are not. The rooms are similar to the Wynn, where the bed is positioned to face the floor-to-ceiling windows, but in the Encore there is a stud wall between the bed and the window which has an aperture for the TV which swivels so it can be viewed from the bed or the \" living room\". This does not constitute a suite and in fact just spoils the view. That said, the rooms are big, clean, comfy and the views are great. The biggest issue we found, and the one which would make us think twice before booking here again, is the noise. Encore caters for a quite young crowd. There are several well-attended clubs in the hotel and they can be heard from the guest rooms - even on the 37th floor. Loud music and very enthusiastic DJs can be clearly heard until dawn. We had a strip view room, and perhaps a room on the other side of the hall would have been quieter.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel - but expensive.\u201d", "Author": "p3eps", "ReviewID": "UR118535572", "Content": "As the third and final instalment of our honeymoon we decided to spend a week in Vegas.\u00a0 We've been before, staying in the Paris hotel - but as it was a special occasion, Encore was the hotel of choice.\u00a0 We flew in from Hawaii and got to the hotel at about 1am Vegas time. There were 3 staff on the reception desk, and no queue. The girl was very nice, and when she read 'honeymoon' on the paperwork, she upgraded us to a suite on the 58th floor.\u00a0 The room was stunning, and the view down the strip at night was amazing from so high up. It wasn't until the morning I could see a huge empty golf course on the left, and numerous swimming pools! It was a huge room, beautifully decorated and even had remote control curtains! \u00a0The TV in the bathroom didn't work, but as we didn't spend much time in the room we didn't care.\u00a0 Once we'd unpacked, we decided to have a brief 'explore' as we were hungry. We found a small shop in the hotel that sold sandwiches and drinks - so bought some stuff. A sandwich, 2 bags of crisps, 2 bottles of juice, a bottle of water and an ice cream mars bar - $38! At that point we decided to avoid the hotel shop and get 'supplies' elsewhere! We went to the pool on a couple of occasions. It was really nice and had plenty of loungers available. They gave you towels, and often handed out bottles of water. There were also water dispensers around the pool too. \u00a0With the 115degreesF temperature at the time, I guess they wanted to keep everyone hydrated.\u00a0 We ate in Switch restaurant in the hotel which was one of the best meals I've ever had. The food was divine and the setting is amazing. It was probably the most expensive meal we ate in Vegas, but it was worth every penny. (approx $240 for 2 mains, 2 deserts and a few drinks).\u00a0 We also ate at the pizza cafe in the hotel which was lovely and pretty cheap.\u00a0 The duelling pianos bar was really cool, but you HAD TO purchase at least a drink each before they'd let you in! $30+ for a beer and a cosmo! \u00a0We discovered the best way to drink in the hotel was to play slot machines - as you don't have to pay (just a tip to the waitress). That way, the $30+ rounds cost $5 each! Our plane had a huge delay on it, and we ended up staying an extra night (which BA paid for - thanks!). The staff were really helpful when sorting it out, and even gave us our better room at the standard rate.\u00a0 As we'd originally booked a package we didn't know about the 'resort fee' - but on our extra night we had to pay it. The benefit of paying the 'resort fee' is that you get free wifi.\u00a0 Although the hotel is on the strip, it's maybe a bit far away from most things. It's a fair walk to some of the other hotels since it's located quite far up the strip. It's good for the Fashion Show Mall - which is a 5 min walk. If I return to Vegas I'd probably try and stay somewhere nearer the middle of the strip so that I have easy access to all the hotels / casinos. \u00a0 On certain days they have a Beach Club - which is essentially a night club during the day. We never attended - but it was a nightmare trying to get a taxi at 6pm as there were hundreds of drunk youngsters trying to get home. We stood in line for about 25mins - which made us late for our restaurant reservation. We also went to get a taxi at 4am to go home... just as the Surrender nightclub had come out. Thankfully the doormen had the sense to let us skip the queue since we had 4 suitcases! Although we were on the 58th floor, we could hear the music from Surrender when in bed. In summary, Encore is an stunning hotel. It's beautiful both inside and out, and the staff are brilliant. It does come at a price though! Would I go back - probably not. I'd rather try somewhere else a bit more central...

We booked our room thru whatahotel.com. They offered some extra perks with a good rate. We were to receive an upgrade at check in if available, $50 credit at the spa and breakfast daily. Check-in: We arrived early afternoon on a Saturday. There was practically no line at check in which was a pleasant surprise compared to other hotels. The front desk told us about the spa and breakfast credit. Whatahotel had told us room service was included in the breakfast choices. The front desk told us it was not but gave us a long list of restaurants where we could use the credit. Not sure who is right as we did not push the issue. We had to remind the front desk of the upgrade and it was available. From the standard suite, the upgrade is to a panoramic suite. All that means is the room is on a higher floor. Room: Our room faced downtown. It was a nice view. The room looked just like the pictures on the website. Loved the couch next to the windows. Only once did we hear bass from the club. Bed and shower were wonderful. Loved the swivel TV. The room was always clean when we returned late afternoon. Housekeeping did a good job. Breakfast: We ate at Society Cafe one day which was good. Then we found Tableau! The food and especially the service were outstanding. Loved being able to eat outside. We ate here for breakfast the rest of our trip. Pool: Part of the reason we stayed here was the European pool. We spent most of our days here. Just loved not having any kids around...very relaxing. The service as everywhere at the hotel was great. Casino: The casino is on the small side and quiet compared to other hotels. The cocktail service is the best. My new favorite drink is an espresso martini. Spa: We never made it to the spa.

Had previosuly stayed at the tower suites in the Wynn and booked into the tower suites at Encore as the Wynn was sold out. Service at the hotel is comparable to the Wynn. However, poor planning and poor management policies made our stay not all that it could be. Because the hotel recetnly built the Encore Beach Club that has a DJ in afternoons as well as at night until the early morning hours, even numbered rooms in the tower suites which are on the pool side of the building get to hear the heavy bass of the music at all hours. Forget napping or getting any sleep at night unless you are heavy sleepier or a llittle inebriated or both. Ask for an odd number room on the ciry side of the bulding. We requested to be moved which the hotel did without any questions. It was apparant from talkign to the front desk and bellmen, moving rooms because of the noise is a common occurence. Poor planning by the hotel designer. The casino is smaller than at the Wynn and does not include a sports book area. You can make your sports bets at a teller but you have limited access to all lines and prop bets. Other than that the casino seemed to have all the same action as the Wynn. There is no tower suites pool at the Encore like at the Wynn. The two pools are too small for the crowds and more bothersome is the policy to close out your check after every drink if you are charging to your room. This clearly slows down service and is a pain. Several guests that we were around complained about this and reflected their displeasure in their tips. Keep in mind that teh Encore is at the far end of the strip away from the airport.

The Encore at the Wynn is truly a great property committed to providing the best of every aspect of your experience. Incredible service and staff, very nice rooms, great restaurants and popular nightclubs define this experience. The only negative I have to say about the property are the cheap hidden costs. This is a top end property, no doubt, and I don't mind paying for that experience. What I do mind are charges that are not communicated upfront. I make my reservations with an agreed upon price, but on top of that price is another charge - the resort fee - that you only find out about when you actually arrive for the reservation. It is $25 a day to be able to use the pool and their facilities, and this is a non-optional charge (based on our itinerary for Vegas we were not going to use those facilities, but we had to pay anyway). It is not that $25 a day is so egregious...we were already paying several hundred dollars a night for the room which I was fine with and had agreed upon...it was the nature of \"slipping it in\" after you had already agreed upon the price, and making it non-optional, that bothers me. This is an uncharacteristically cheap and unfriendly tactic the Wynn uses when everything else is so committed to an amazing experience for the guest. Similarly there were cheap charges for room service. A breakfast order for 1 person (eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) was $30, to which they added on a $5 'service charge' as well as a mandatory 18% gratuity. If there is a 18% gratuity, what is the $5 service charge about? It was over $40 for a simple breakfast for one. It is not the amount of these charges that bothers me...our party literally spent thousands of dollars at the Wynn for the rooms, restaurants and at the nightclubs, but those were all charges we agreed upon. Cheap little charges like the mandatory resort fee that they don't tell you about upfront and the nickel-and-dime charges for room service are decidedly out of character with the rest of the experience, and why I only give this great hotel and staff 4 stars instead of a resounding 5 star rating.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Jolla, CA", "Title": "\u201cTop Drawer\u201d", "Author": "ThePinkCar", "ReviewID": "UR118243980", "Content": "Open letter to Steve Wynn- You nailed it baby!

Not only do these hotels have excellent service, but their feel is modern, open and airy. Unlike the new hotels in the city center (Aria, Mandarin Oriental, etc..), The Encore is modern and warm (not stark) and has tons of natural light that make it look open and inviting unlike any other casino you have ever been to. Pros: - Excellent food in all their restaurants. Some of the best bread and desserts you have ever had, and, did I mention that their Pinapple/blackberry infused Vodka is to die for? These hotels have definitely some of the best restaurants in town! No need to leave the resort for a great dinner. - Speaking of dinners, my wife is vegetarian and she loved the Vegan/Vegetarian menus available in every single restaurant. - Tryst and Xcess are some of the best clubs in Vegas. Beautiful people and very exclusive, just bring your wallet! lol The Encore Beach club is great for hanging out during the day too! - Excellent shopping - Great gym/workout area - $10.00 cab ride from pretty much anywhere worth going to in Vegas. Tips: - Choose the Encore Tower Suites for extra privacy. They have a special entrance with far less people than the regular hotel and special elevators too. No waiting here. - Your Suite key also affords you VIP access to the buffet line, free gym access and other perks like a private concierge, etc... - Choose a room in the higher floors for fantastic views of the strip and less noise from the pool below. - Do use the concierge services to make reservations for all your shows and dinners the moment you arrive. - Do tell the hotel if you are celebrating a special event. The offered us complementary champagne and chocolate strawberries for my birthday and a free dessert in every restaurant we dined in. - For things to do, we recommend: Ka & \"O\" (CIrque Du Solei), Some of the adult shows and A helicopter trip with lunch to the grand Canyon (this was an activity that I did not originally wanted to do, but turned out to be one of the best funnest things I have ever done. Tip Seat at the front of the way over). Cons: - If you are facing the pool/clubs and are in one of the lower levels, they music may be a bit annoying on Fridays and Saturdays. Choose a room in a higer floor to prevent this. - Some of the rooms are beggining to show a bit of wear and tear.

Initially, walking into the hotel and through the lobby, it reminded me of the Bellagio with a red theme. It is light and airy rather than dark and smoky as some of the Vegas hotels can be. Check in was quick, however, they put the wrong room number on my card when I checked in. Naturally, I couldn't get in but housekeeping was next door and immediately called security and they corrected the mistake very quickly. Mistakes happen but everyone rushed to correct. The rooms are on par wth The Hotel/Mandalay and the Venetian with the \"suite\" concept of a separate sitting area and grand bathroom with soaking tub, large shower, and two sinks. (Seems like these Vegas Hotels have a template and they customize only the style and color) The beds, what can I say about the beds. They were the ultimate in comfort. They sell the bedding in one of the stores in the shopping pavilion and I was actually tempted to go buy them. The Esplanade shopping area boasts some of the finest brands I've seen, even in Vegas. We ate at Switch, which was a bit kitchy (the walls and lighting changes every 30 minutes or so) but true to Las Vegas was great food and great service. I didn't have the opportunity to use the pool area but did walk through and it was beautiful as were all of the grounds...simply immaculately kept.

We didn't have an issue with check in or finding a good room. We didn't experience the severe noise issue that so many others complained about -- but there is a fair amount of \"white\" noise which can be distracting. Simply put, riding in a Mercedes is a quieter experience. On the plus, you do not have to drag yourself through a \"casino maze\" to get to the elevator bank from the check in desk. Security @ the Encore was good -- and we appreciated this. We've stayed at other places in Vegas (i.e - Venetian) where the elevators become a mob scene and staying there becomes a total and complete nightmare. For this reason, we appreciated the Encore's security efforts. Le Reve - amazing. Highly recommend seeing this production. This was the highlight of our stay at Encore. I can not say enough good things about this show and the cast. It is certainly a lot less frenetic to stay at the same property where you see a show (and not have to cab and run around like a bunch of headless chickens trying to get there on time). Pet Peeves - If one pays a premium price, I would hope that the \"royal\" treatment be thought through in the details -- so here's the short list: Food options - limited. For this reason, we hopped in a cab to get to the great food -- it added another $30 to each and every one of our meals. Bathroom products: the bathroom is well stocked with a fair number of products, but...as a frequent traveler, I am kind of picky about the \"stock\" bathroom products in better hotels - and these ones were \"ok\" but not great. They certainly did not compel me to want to purchase them in the store downstairs to take home. The stock conditioner left my hair in a tangled mess, so I was less than happy... Mini-Bar: the mini bar has a 60 second timer (not unusual), so you really don't want to take anything off the sensor unless you plan to pay for it -- including the $8 Fiji water (which is $2.50 everywhere else). My personal gripe about the hotel is that there is no complimentary \"downscale\" drinking water - which is offered at a fair amount of other hotels. Valet Parking - is located on a lower floor. You have to haul all of your stuff and go down one floor to get to the valet, which sort of defeats the purpose of \"valet\" by definition. In short, competition is tough in Vegas -- esp. with all of the City Center properties which have opened up. Overall, a nice stay - however, with a lot of competition around which has raised the bar considerably, I would think twice before returning for the following reasons: (1) this place is SO remote for *great* food options (2) there are better first class hotels that I like better, and (3) the fact that the Encore is not pet friendly. We stay in Vegas several times a year, so we don't often bother to submit Trip Advisor reviews for Vegas hotels where we stay -- unless they are unusual (good or bad); I think after all of the rave reviews that our friends' had mentioned about Wynn/Encore - I would want to know the details so that I could make an informed decision on where to spend my money.

As a highly seasoned business traveler (approx. 30 weeks per year for 15 years) I do not agree with this assessment. The reality is that pricing logic for food and lodging no longer exists; if you feel value has been imparted based on your personal experience then it merits the cost.

The staff are friendly and polite, but they don't really go out of their way to help you. For example, I was unlucky enough to get a room next to the elevator, which would wake me up every time it arrived on our floor. When I called the front desk about this, they apologized for the noise but refused to let me switch rooms, saying that since I had paid in advance they were unable to make any changes to my reservation. Even if that was true, which I have a hard time believing, they could have at least offered me a set of earplugs or something. Even without the noise, the rooms themselves didn't really wow me.

Even though I was in a top-floor room, the view wasn't the best - I was at an odd angle that mostly just allowed me to watch the construction site below. Some of my friends got stuck with a connecting door and very loud guests in the next room, and although the front desk promised to do something about the noise, nothing happened. The resort has a decent selection of restaurants, but once again demanded high prices for average (by Vegas standards) food. The casino is also nice, but has higher table limits, tighter slots, and the dealers don't seem as friendly or helpful as other places on the Strip.

It was the first impression of walking through the doors that truly affected me the most. The Encore Las Vegas is a 5 star hotel by Steve Wynn and appeared to go above and beyond in terms of customer satisfaction and amenities. When I first arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by immense, solid mahogany doors, which in a sense, seemed like a symbol of greatness. As I stepped through the door, I was greeted by large floor to ceiling windows that gave out a subtle dosage of sunlight, which helped emphasize and bring about the warm red and gold ambiance throughout the room. It literally felt as though I entered a new majestic world because I've never experienced anything as amazing as this, in terms of architecture. As I continued to walk forward, I noticed the plush and soft red carpet that essentially massaged my every step. When I looked left and right, I couldn't help but notice the great amounts of detail of the walls and ceilings from the elegant art work and chandeliers that complimented the soft yet vibrant colors, all the way to the extensive use of decorative crown molding and trim. It was a room that made me feel extremely comfortable since it was exceptionally spacious and quiet for a casino hotel, all complimented by a beautiful fragrance that virtually eliminated all hints of cigarette smoke. I don\u2019t know why, but entering the hotel was amazing. The overall property of the Encore feels very comfortable and intimate. It didn\u2019t feel like I was being suffocated by a low ceiling and slot machines at every corner. I remember once going to the Treasure Island and I just felt that I was rubbing elbows with every person in the casino and lobby. However, my experience at the Encore was more pleasant since the overall property felt roomy. Another thing I truly appreciated about the Encore was the service. Everyone at the concierge desk or check in desk greeted me with a smile and appeared to be very patient when I asked questions about shows and dining. A great touch to the trip was when the kind woman at the check in desk comped our roll-in bed during our 5 night stay. The one thing that really stood out at the Encore was the guests. The guest seemed to dress fairly nice and their appearance seemed a little high class. What I mean is that you rarely saw someone walking around the hotel with a tank top or raggedy attire. In terms of dining and shopping, it seemed like the Encore had the best of the best. The shopping esplanade was very high class- a little out of my price range! I didn\u2019t eat at any of the restaurants but I feel that they are probably good anyway. I honestly found myself walking over to the Wynn Buffet and eating most of my meals there. My only complaint about the Encore is the location.

The sheets were hot and there is no air vent in the sleeping area. We had to crank down the air to 64 to get it as cool as we like in the sleeping area. View - only a mountain view was available when we checkin in. I would select a room that faces at angle furthest away from the unfinished construction across the street. It's not pretty. That's what we did and we enjoyed the view. Noise - room noise was minimal, the doors are very heavy and they block out almost all the noise the hallways. Never heard any noise from the rooms next door. We checkin in Tuesday and checked out on Saturday. The Beach Club only runs Friday to Monday so we only had one night to be concerned about regarding club noise. Being on the mountain side we never heard any club noise while in our room. Pool Scene - very clean, plenty of chairs, attentive service. What turned me off was the scene in the afternoon felt like a Hollywood pool movie scene with lots of foul mouthed drunk people that gave it a trashy feel. We found the best time to go was in the morning, it was very relazing and had a nice cool breeze blowing through the pool area. Restaurants - Decor is absolutely stunning, no other casino can match the quality fo the decor. Society Cafe was okay, the in room video tour of the hotel raved on the fish and chips but for $22.00 the fish and chips were very bland. And the \"Chips\" were Pomme Frits, not traditional Chips. The Buffet was decent but other than the Asian selections there is not much different than I would find on a Casino Buffet at a four star hotel/casino. SW was good as well but not great, we had the Porterhouse for Two and it was a bit fatty and hard to cut. For $108 for one steak, I was expecting better quality. The bread with dinner could of been more inventive, very bland. The atmosphere was very enjoyable, we sat outside. Service was cordial and attentive. Overall vibe at night - a bit too trashy for my likes, lots of women dressed in impossibly short dresses in high heels, many looked like hookers. Lots of drunk people using foul language, lots of people dressed in appropriately, gym shorts, t-shirts etc. This place could be absolutely amazing if the clientele matched the quality of the hotel. I visited the Four Seasons and found it to be a totally different vibe very classy and very nice decor, it had too much of a corporate feel for me but I would consider staying there next time, the pool ther was quite small but seemed very relaxing. Location - being at the end of the strip was not an issue. We were able to walk to almost all the nicer casino's (Ceasar's, Bellagio, Paris, Venetian) without getting too tired or sweaty. We took the RTS bus to Mandalay Bay. If you can catch an Express Bus, it's an easy ride. If you have to take the Duwce bus (makes lots of stops) it's a pain the rear and quite frustrating. We found Express buses very hard to find, they were never on tie and the drivers were quite surley. If you can afford it, take a taxi. The mall across the street (Fashion Mall) is awesome. We enjoyed our stay at Encore and would possibly return. We visited almost every hotel in Vegas in this class and found Enore to have the most beautiful restaurants.

I had a king bed which was nicely separated from a sitting area & desk with floor to ceiling windows.

The only negative things I can say about the room is I was intimidated by the optional snack & beverage options because you get automatically billed if you remove an item for over 60 seconds and how slow the TV was to power up. It would take about 15-20 seconds for it to come alive after pressing the power button. The hotel lobby is small but you can check in at the Wynn which is what I did when walking over from the Sands Expo center. I arrived early and went to the bigger pool at the Wynn (as a guest you can use any of the facilities at Encore or Wynn) until they sent me a text saying my room was ready. I also discovered that you can walk from the Sands to the Encore with only having to exit air conditioning to briefly cross a sky bridge.

The unique floor plan made us feel we had a much bigger room because not an inch of space was wasted. The closet was spacious and well-planned to accommodate lots and lots of clothes and suitcases. Loved the swivel TV/drawer chest because it divided the area into two distinct rooms. After a long hike, my husband napped in the bedroom while I channel surfed, then read a book in the utter calm and quiet of the living room. We easily adjusted lights and sound accordingly in each space. (Sometimes a \"suite\" doesn't provide truly separate living/sleeping rooms.) We experienced no hiccups in the level of customer service. Every contact with the staff was appropriate and friendly. It was what I expected from a luxury hotel. (On a side note, the wait staff at each restaurant was impeccable.) One of the biggest benefits was the close proximity of the self-parking lot to the lobby entrance.

The location at the end of the Strip made it part of the town yet one step removed, which i felt was a plus. The twin towers of the Encore and the Wynn had a strong presence on the skyline without shouting, unlike some of the neighbors. I was new to Vegas and was there for two nights with my wife who was working at a convention, so had time on my hands during the day. I explored pretty much all the hotels/casinos/malls on the Strip and felt that only The Bellagio and The Cosmopolitan came close to the level of the Encore in sophistication. I'm not a gambling man but the casino appeared less gloomy than the rest, more inviting. The shops were the likes of Alexander McQueen and Dior, which added to the hotel's five star appeal, although I suspect they were largely empty because of the extortionate prices. The one thing you could question was the lack of wow factor as you enter the reception, when it's competitors have that area covered. We had a king suite for about $200 which I felt was fantastic value, although the taxi drivers informed me that prices can vary depending on whether the town was busy or not. It might be worth shopping around and haggling for the best deals. It seems the hotels factor in the extra money you will spend on extras such as live events, food and drink and gambling, which subsidizes the rooms. The one think I felt let them down was the price of breakfast. $9 for a small orange juice, for example, was just plain greedy. What made it easier to swallow was the sensational view when you eat it in the room. We were on the 38th out of 60 floors and facing the Strip. Panoramic doesn't do it justice.

Encore is everything I could dream a hotel to be. Uber-luxurious, fantastic service, amazing food, great drinks, awesome pool scene, fabulous nightclub, gorgeous spa, etc, etc. I just can't recommend a nicer hotel. I usually stay at the Tower Suites at Encore which I only do to avoid the check-in line. The one downside is usually dealing with a line at check-in but if you pony up an extra 50-75 bucks for a Tower Suite, you'll have a private entrance and no line at check-in. The rooms are nearly identical but you just feel a little bit like a VIP. Every room at Encore is gorgeous... no need to ask for a special room. I ate at Lakeside and SW during my most recent trip with my wife. Five stars for both, although I liked SW a bit more. Go and enjoy.

As a person who has stayed in numerous \"5 star\" hotels, I can honestly say that this 5 star hotel's attention to detail is far superior than any other hotel I have ever stayed at. It's truly in the little things, such as: 1. Knowledgable, kind, friendly concierge personnel who will go above & beyond, trust me even I was amazed at the sheer hospitality of the place 2. Housekeeping that will clean your room within 10 minutes from your request (if you had the do-not-distub sign illuminated); they're \"green,\" so if you want your sheets changed, be sure to ask them when calling (otherwise they won't to conserve water, etc.) 3. Doorbells in each room, electronic window shades & sheers that work at a touch of a button, honest housekeeping (never had an issue leaving Boise noise-canceling headphones, iPod, iPhone, Apple computer unattended in room), and a wonderful iHome system to dock your phone into in case you want to turn up some music and invite some people over 4. All of the lights in the room are computerized, meaning one touch turns on or off all of the lamps, really convenient and kind of neat... there's a little \"control panel\" thing next to the bed 5. Not one blemish on the furniture, walls, ceilings, fixtures, etc. Attention to interior decor detail is amazing compared to other bland, run-of-the-mill Vegas hotels. Although the rooms aren't as large as at the Palazzo or some other hotels, the attention to detail really makes you not sweat the smaller square footage 6. The pool area is amazingly lush (although, if you have kids... see my comment below) 7. Free wifi internet upon payment of daily \"resort fee\" 8. They engrave your name onto your room key, and your room key can be used to not only buy anything anywhere inside of the casino, but you can use it as a players card when gambling... very convenient 9. EVERYONE, and I mean EVERYONE, I have encountered (okay, with one exception... see below) was beyond kind, beyond hospitable, and beyond anything I've ever experienced in a very, very good way. It's like everyone at this hotel is on happy pills... for example, my ironing board was stuck and wouldn't close... I call downstairs... less than 5 minutes, sha-bam... there's a man delivering me a new ironing board with a big smile and asking if I need anything else. Can life always be like this? 10. Although I know this might not appeal to everyone, but as a gay couple, I found the staff and environment very open and accepting... not all vegas hotels are that way with the gay crowd, so props to Encore for realizing a paying customer is a paying customer, regardless of lifestyle... The only problems I experienced during my stay was a rude employee at the Pizza Place restaurant (but after complaining to the manager, she refunded my money and even called the next morning to check up on everything.... like I said, it's in the details!). Also, the European Pool is DEFINITELY NOT a place to take your kids, and it's kind of in the eyesight of the regular pool. Okay, we all know European pool = topless women, but what you don't realize is that it's simply a party pool-- thumping music, craps tables... muscle guys drooling over the women with probably 5 too-many cocktails in their system... abandoned alcohol cups galore scattered among the place... oh and sexually explicit things such as motor-boating, dry humping, and a bunch of fondling among guests with no shame in sight (viva las vegas). I thought it was hilarious and a great time, I would tell you this just as a warning for those of you with kids.... make sure your kids don't wonder over to the other pool, otherwise you might have some explaining to do. If you want the best Vegas has to offer, book a room in their Tower Suites, but even if you don't... you will really enjoy your stay at this place, it was great!", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice quiet hotel on the strip!\u201d", "Author": "soccerbandit10", "ReviewID": "UR117052867", "Content": "This hotel was very nice and very quiet compared to the other hotels.

The fitness center has some of the best machines. The spa is absolutely beautiful inside and the masseuses know what they are doing. We saw Le Reve, and the show is stunning.

In 2009 we wandered through the Wynn/Encore and decided we would definitely stay there on our next trip. In August 2011 we stayed at Encore for a weekend. It wasn't as perfect as I thought it would be, but we will definitely stay there again next time. Positives: Encore/Wynn just seems more grown up some how. I'm certain that it just seem more calm because it really is the end of the north end of the strip, so not as many people visit, as compared to the beautiful but way too crowded Bellagio, where we stayed last time. We loved the rooms at Encore, but seemed to spend our eating and casino time mostly in the Wynn; they are close enough so it wasn't a problem. Negatives: We've stayed at many wonderful (expensive) hotels all over the world, so I had an expectation of what service would be, based on what I'd heard about the Encore. Most of the wait staff was very average, while a few were downright surly. The restaurants were OK. We attempted to go to the buffet at the Wynn one night, but gave up when we had moved about 15 feet in the line in 45 minutes. Maybe that is typical for a buffet, I'm not sure, but that was disappointing and frustrating. We also ate at La Cave, which advertised they were open until 2 or 3 am. We saw a show one night and went to dinner here around 1pm. The staff wasn't terribly pleasant, and seemed like they weren't really prepared for guests this time of night. We ordered a selection of appetizers that was very good. We enjoyed one dish so much we ordered a second dish and it was nothing like the first. My biggest complaint about Encore is the Beach Club. While I realize that the beach club was not designed for our group (all in our 30's and 40's), but the Encore to me seems like a more adult hotel. One afternoon when we walked backed to our hotel, we went in the Encore entrance right off the street. To get to this entrance you have to walk by the entrance of the Beach Club, where twenty somethings were being told they have to put their clothes on before going into the casino, and literally throwing up in the bushes. I've stayed at Planet Hollywood before, and I didn't like it, so it's disappointing that Mr. Wynn would create an atmosphere to lure the kids. I get it, it's all about making money, but it was disappointing. Negatives aside, I will stay at Encore again. I just expected my stay to be the best hotel experience I've ever had, and it wasn't.

I could even tell you what song was playing! It seems no one thought that the sound might make its way into the guest rooms, or maybe no one cared. It ruined the room. I one thoughtless change, it went from being the best room in Vegas to being unsleepable. (The music went past am!). The club also ruins Switch restaurant, which is victim to the loud thumping and cheap looking led lighting effects. We were not the only people talking about the gross miscalculation -- a honeymoon couple was angry and a taxi driver on the way home volunteered that his pickups from the Encore had all been complaining.

From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. The valet was so courteous and welcoming, you'd have thought we were driving a Rolls, rather than a rental. Registration was just inside, so no hike through the casino to check in. The line was long, but moved fairly steadily---gave my husband time to check his voicemail, so got that out of the way while we waited. The guy who checked us in was so nice, welcomed us to the Encore, and made small talk about where we were from while he searched for our room. He told us we were upgraded to a Panorama Suite, high floor, and Strip View, and it was ready, so we went on up to the room to call for our bags, which arrived in mere minutes. BTW--they do charge a daily resort fee. The room was fantastic! Amazing view---floor-to-ceiling windows, partial south Strip view, and the Wynn golf course/country club. Remote control window coverings were pretty cool, and you could raise/lower/open/close from the sitting room area or the bedroom. The living room area had a desk, a desk chair and guest chair, a sectional sofa/chaise and big round ottoman in place of a cocktail table. The wall separating the living area and bedroom held a large flat-panel HDTV that could be viewed in the living area, or turned around to be viewed in the bedroom. One wall in the living area (and bedroom) is completely mirrored, making the spaces seem larger. The desk area had plenty of electrical outlets for charging phones, GPS, laptop, etc. Wireless internet connection was complimentary (although that may have been covered by the resort fee, or maybe part of our room offer--not sure, so ask before you assume so you won't get a surprise daily charge for i-net usage.) The bedroom had a King bed, with twin bedside chests on either side. The wall separating the living room and bedroom, besides holding the HDTV, had 4 drawers, like a built-in dresser. There was also a console holding the refreshment center and over-priced snacks/drinks, ice bucket and stemware. The bed was very comfortable, firm but not too firm. I liked the pillows, too, some sort of goose-down alternative I imagine. The hallway into the room had large mirrors, and a closet. The closet had space for hanging clothes, three drawers, a shelf, ironing board/iron, and room safe with digital lock. Staying a week, there are never enough hangers in any hotel rooms for everything I need to hang---I probably pack way too much. The bathroom had a separate glass shower and deep bathtub. The tub was not jetted, unfortunately, but was deep enough to enjoy a nice soak. The lights were on dimmers,. There was a double vanity, with an ottoman to sit on to apply makeup, and a makeup mirror. The toilet was in it's separate closet. Other features, a bathroom scale (on vacation, that's torture.) And two of the most wonderful robes--not the usual terry-cloth most hotels have. Love those robes! Amenities were the usual shampoo/conditioner, mouthwash, bath soap, face soap, shower cap, lotion, and shower gel. The smell was fine--not too sweet or overpowering. There were glasses in the bathroom, in addition to the ones in the refreshment console in the bedroom area. The hotel was very quiet. We never heard another person in either room next to us, or in the hallways. Or even housekeeping in the mornings, so I guess it's pretty well insulated for noise. Or maybe the guests here are more courteous than some of the other hotels where we've stayed. Housekeeping kept the room spotless, plenty of towels, etc. We would definitely stay here again, and would certainly recommend this hotel to all.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay At Encore\u201d", "Author": "louismfried", "ReviewID": "UR116546762", "Content": "Stayed here July 30-August 3 for my birthday.

The normal rates for the Wynn or Encore are out of our Las Vegas traveling budget so we were thrilled with the offer. Would I stay again, free or not, probably not? I suppose the pros and cons will intermingle here. The casino d\u00e9cor is really, really red and somewhat gaudy. It is very different from the Wynn or the Bellagio that Steve Wynn built. The room is nice with plenty of space for personal belongings but not as big as it appears on the website. The beds and pillows were comfortable. Although there are outlets by the bed they are taken by the rooms \u201cgadgets\u201d so I just unplugged the lamps. Speaking of gadgets, the control for the curtains is on the bedside table, is not illuminated, so when I wanted to open the curtains in the morning for a just bit of light I had to stumble around with the control and subsequently woke my husband. The honor bar had a variety of choices that I personally found to be exorbitant e.g. 5$ for a 12 oz can of soda and 8$ for a tin of Reese's Pieces. The wifi is included in the 20$ a night resort fee and there was a printer/fax machine in the suite; the fax has a cost to it but I do not know about the printer itself. The bathroom is spacious and the amenities very nice such as shoe polish, cotton balls, q-tips. The shampoo, shower gel etc. was much larger than the standard hotel and is lemon grass fragranced. The towels were very thick and plentiful and there are robes too. There is a ledge that allows plenty of room for personal items without cluttering the counter top. On the down side the bathroom does not have much room to hang anything including a hand towel and the bathtub is short! My husband, who is 6\u20191 and can stretch out comfortably in our normal size home tub, had to scrunch his knees up in the Encore room tub. I also found it weird that the water controls are on the back not to the side or front of tub. The line at check in wasn\u2019t long and there was plenty of staff but still took longer than it should have in my experience. The staff we encountered were all very courteous and would actually hold/start a conversation. Housekeeping during our stay was excellent everything was put back in order just as the moment we arrived; although with being in a hotel of this caliber right after we checked in I was shocked to find a hairball behind the bathroom door (which was cleaned up the next day). We did use one of the pools at the Encore and had a good time; it was not the one with the bar or the beach club. This pool was easy to access from the elevators just off the casino floor and was a mix of people. We brought in our own drinks in a non-breakable cup they also had ice water readily available throughout the pool area. There were limited shaded areas. Ok after all this rambling why would I not stay there again. I suppose it is all location and incidental costs for me. I felt very disconnected from the rest of the strip; it is an easy walk to the Venetian but not much else. I like to be more centralized where I have more options for gambling and food choices. Perhaps for many who may stay at this property this is not a huge issue but there was nowhere that I found to \u201cgrab a quick (inexpensive) bite\u201d or table games less than a 25$ minimum.

Whenever I can, I try to stay in the Tower Suites -- both at Wynn and Encore -- because the experience is wonderful. I know a lot of people say \"why would I pay $75 more a night (or whatever it is) just to have a separate check-in?\". Here are all of the benfits, as I see it: -- separate check-in. Not only are the staff all over you as soon as your limo pulls up, they give you refreshing water, cold towels, and get you up to your room in very quick order. While in the resort side you pay a premium for high floors, in the Tower Suites there is no supplemental fee. We stayed on the 61st floor, looking south over the strip. -- The Encore Tower Suites are closest to Las Vegas Blvd, which means that the view is not blocked by Wynn. If stayin gin the Resort side, depending on where your room is, your view is heavily obstructed by the Wynn Tower -- No Resort Fee in the Tower Suites (that will save you $20 a night) -- Complimentary Coffee in the morning at the lobby bar -- Complimentary pressing of your garments (2/day) -- free line passes for the buffett -- never have to wait for a cab at the valet -- exceptional service. For example, every time I walked by the front desk, I received a bottle of water. The conceirge got us the best tables at all of the restaurants, etc. -- There are only 5 rooms per floor, which means you have a very short walk to your room once you get off on your floor. -- The elevators are fast, and because there are so few rooms in this part of the hotel, they very rarely ever stop between where you get on and the lobby. -- Access to the Tower Suites poll at Wynn -- a far walk but a nice change of scenery --Upgraded (or at least slightly different) room decor --More amenities (shaving kit, toothbrush kit, etc) The Tower Suites give you all of the excitement and thrill of being in Las Vegas, but the service and luxury of a small, boutique hotel. I'd highly recommend it! My only complaint was that we missed turndown service twice. If you're in the room when they come, they're not always the best at remembering to come back once you've left. But that was the only problem the entire stay. Big deal. Also, I think you get less club noise being in the Tower Suites section of the hotel because it's a little further from XS, although I suppose you get more Surrender Noise. Who knows.

Check in was very quick. We arrived after 9pm on a Friday and were offered either the 17th floor strip side or the 37 floor on the quiet side. We chose quiet, the view was high enough that you could avoid looking at the partial construction site and look at the mountains or Wynn golf course. At night we had a view of the city lights, Stratosphere, Circus Circus. Our room looked very much like the website pictures, except that I believe our room was an accessable room. There was not a private toilet room, so having this big giant bathroom was pointless for those of us who like a little privacy. The towels were a bit grungy (looked like someone had mopped up mud with them and it didn't all come out in the wash), hair in the tub, dust on the crooked lamps in the bathroom, hearing neighboring room's noise - is not a five star hotel in my opinion. Details like a second box of kleenex outside of the bathroom, a second set of hooks to hang things in the bathroom (as ours were maybe 3 feet from the floor, and our closet had low shelves, so there was no place to hang anything longer than a shirt) were also missed. The bed was pure comfort. Each morning we went to the adult pool and pressed the button as we left for housekeeping. Our room was always ready when we returned. We ate at several of the casual restaurants for breakfast and lunch. For small meals, the pizza place on the Wynn side was great to grab a slice from (lovely to eat outside by the waterfalls) or the lobby bar at Encore. We tried Stratta before LeReve. The meal was fantastic, but too much food. I must have mentioned when I purchased tickets for LeReve that is was for my husband's birthday; because our server at Stratta brought out a georgeous little dessert cake and candle at the end of our meal. We are not gamblers. We visit Vegas for relaxing, shows, restaurants and shopping. We'd spend a little at the quarter slots before heading to our room each night. The drink service was quick. I enjoyed the wine they served in the casino more than the glass I had at Stratta. We enjoyed our stay at Encore, the casino, pool, restaurants and shops are luxury. I was a bit disappointed with our room; perhaps my expectations were too high, but there were details that they missed.

From the moment you sink into the plush carpet, you know it's going to be a luxury trip. Check in lines were pretty short, and the attendant who checked us in was really friendly, talking to both of us, making some suggestions for where to eat and what to do. The room was great - it was just a standard room, but was really spacious, and the space was very well used - it almost felt like a suite. The bathrooms are massive, double sink, huge shower. There's also lots of wardrobe space. We ate in Switch one of the nights, which was a real treat - I would recommend it to anyone staying in the hotel. Great steak, great service, great atmosphere. We also went to the duelling pianos one night. There's a two drink minimum, which I was pretty unhappy with as they took a break five minutes after we sat down, so ended up getting more than two rounds. The pianists also didn't have a great range of songs. They seemed to know a lot of American artists, but not too many European ones. They also seemed really annoyed by people requesting Piano Man. We hung out at the pool for a day - if you get the opportunity to do this, you should do it! It's really relaxing, there are two pools and a pool bar. It's a really great place to just lie back and relax. We didn't gamble at all in Encore, and it didn't seem to matter. The casino is less intrusive than it is in several other hotels. The volume on the gaming machines is turned way down so it's not as annoying. it feels more like a spa hotel (which it is) than a traditional Vegas gambling spot. The Encore is in a good location on the strip, with a shopping mall across the road, and the golf course out the back. It's a bit far from some of the other hotels, if you're travelling with others staying in different locations.

We had previously stayed at the Wynn Resort and loved it. Staying at Encore gives you the best of both worlds. As Encore is smaller - Encore guests are allowed to use Wynn facilites but Wynn guests are not able to use the pool at Encore. Encore has a lovely butterfly theme. As it is further up the strip the hotel it is also much quieter and therefore a more relaxing experience. We stayed in a deluxe room on a higher floor - we paid a little extra for this room and were not disappointed. The rooms are similar to that of the Wynn (see my review of the Wynn), roomy modern and with a good deal of storage. My husband organised a few treats for me and the service he received was exceptional. The only little complaint I would have is the pool area at Encore is quite small and really quiet. There were lily pads and loungers in the pool which were reserved all day everyday. We were there for two weeks and didnt see one guest on these. Whilst I appreciate these would be reserved for VIP guests I think the hotel needs to be more flexible. I was told off when I sat on a chair in the pool (which in actual fact wasnt reserved). If you want a little more atmosphere I would recommend using the pool facilities at the Wynn. I would recommend any of the restaurant in Encore and there are some great choices for lunch, but if you want a special treat eat at SW in Wynn - probably one of the nicest dining experiences that I have ever had.

Adding the draw are the Vegas shows the scale and spectacle of which only possible in this incomparable oasis in the Nevada dessert.

Sooo much space and it\u2019s not just the size of the rooms but also the first class interiors, amenities, furniture, bed, pillows, carpet, enormous bathrooms...every detail reflective of Steve Wynn's quest to make his second flagship property like no other and setting yet again the bar of how to build a super resort hotel so high that it would require anyone to wear oxygen masks to reach such a high plateau of excellence and pockets deeper that the Marianas Trench. It's mind boggling that anyone could afford the privilege of staying at this masterpiece yet, the Encore IS affordable.

So I opted for a panoramic view with a king bed and they gave me a roll away bed that was sooooooooooo comfortable!!! We were on the 59th floor facing the mountains and the golf course. Was very quiet and I had no problem with noise the whole time we were there. The room was very nice, the air worked well, the water pressure in the shower was good. I was very happy with our room. We did have a $100 credit and used it at the pizza place in the Wynn, ate breakfast in Society Cafe. The frosted flake caramelized banana french toast was sooo good!!!! Also had 2 drinks at the adult pool and it tasted like there was not a drop of alcohol in it. My one issue I had was the waitress at the pool. I think she was profiling people, there was a couple next to us on the right and a couple next to us on the left. She asked the couple to the right if they would like something and I was sitting right there looking at her and she went right to the couple to the left. The lady to the left said oh they wanted a drink and the waitress was like oh..... Sorry we are an aunt and niece on vacation. Or if we looked like we had no money or something. I dont know what it was, but it was very rude!!!! Anyway I gave her a good tip and then she was being nice and coming around.

I have to say the Encore does feel like a top class hotel, and is lavishly appointed. We were disappointed as we found our room to be quite small, but the clever use of mirrors does give you a spacious feeling. Having been to Vegas previously and stayed at the Bellagio and Venetian both my wife and I felt the Encore was no better than either of those properties. In fact we both felt the rooms at the Bellagio and Venetian were far larger and felt significantly more spacious. As we were on our honeymoon we assumed we\u2019d be treated a little more special, than the \u201crun of the mill\u201d patron, but we were wrong to make that assumption, whilst our booking highlighted that we were on honeymoon, at no point were we made to feel special. The food in the hotel is excellent, plenty of good quality restaurants, but we want to make particular note to the 4am room service breakfast, OK, it was $100+, but it was exceptional! The food in Lakeside if truly fantastic and I personally had the best steak I\u2019ve ever had, well done!!! We were disappointed to find the staff weren\u2019t too friendly either, we didn\u2019t expect a hotel which purports to operate at such high levels of service to feel this unwelcoming.

Have been to Vegas many times and have stayed at various hotels from mid level to high end and Id have to say that the Encore was fantastic albeit a bit pricey. Check in and check out were without a hitch. We had a $100 credit thru the package we booked and they pleasantly explained how that worked. The casino area is a bit smaller than ive experienced in a larger hotel in vegas but i like the way they have things set up. Never seemed overly crowded. Seems to be the quieter side of the Wynn/Encore complex. Service is outstanding. The thing that struck me about the place was how absolutely spotless the place was, the floors, public bathrooms, casino areas etc. I was really impressed with that and the overall attention to detail throughout the property. Just a very comfortable and pleasing place to stay. Its is pricey however, esp the food. And the lesser priced options are somewhat limited. If im anywhere on vacation for a week i really dont want to have a sit down fancy type meal for every meal of the day. Even the places they tout as casual are really not that casual. For comparisons sake since its right next door and weve stayed there in the past, at the Venetian/Pallazo if you want to grab a quick relatively inexpensive bite to eat, you have several options. You really dont here. But i will say this, every place we did try at the Wynn/Encore was really good. Pizza place, La Cave, Society Cafe, Lakeside Grill, Country Club. We satisfied with them all. Really liked La Cave. Great place for wine and a bite to eat. Bartenders were fantastic. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Probably the nicest hotel room ive experienced. Dealers were very friendly and professional. Not a big gambler so its not a big deal to me but when i was at a table the dealers were all great. Limits were more reasonable that i had expected so that was a nice surprise. They were quick to drop limits if things were going a bit slow. The shops are basically all high high end. My wife is a big shopper but it is a waste of time to look in some of those stores because its just out of our league. The fashion show mall is right across the street and more our speed. The fitness ctr and spa were very nice. The wives loved the spa. The are spa pros and said this was one of the best. I hit the fitness ctr every morning and really enjoyed it. Staff was great. The size of the fitness ctr is fine. Treadmills seemed to get full quickly but crowd was never a problem. We didnt hit the pools. It was still a bit on the cool side when we were there so i cant comment on that. Overall great stay.

We stayed at The Encore, but it is connected to the Wynn, and from what I could tell the amenities are the same. It is 5 star service all the way. You feel like a celebrity or royalty when you are there. And you will probably see a few while you are there. I highly recommend spending some extra bucks if you are attending the night clubs or pool party and get table service, or a cabana. It is much more enjoyable this way... and hey your in Vegas. For dining, there are many options and all of the restarants are fabulous. My favorite place, and if you are in the mood for a steak, get a reservation at Botero. Get a few side's to share around the table, as these are not your normal side dishes. Get the Mac n Cheese, and trust me this is no box stuff. The staff at the hotel was beyond expectations. The rooms are large, and immaculate. Beds are very comfortable, and when you go home, you are going to want to redo your bathroom to mimic your stay at Encore.

One thing, get ready to pay for the luxury. A small bottle of vodka in the fridge in the room is $29. My husband went to the liquor store (3 minute walk) and got the same thing $12.

I decided to stay at the Encore after reading hundreds of reviews and checking out all the different hotels. I don\u2019t even know where to start with the Encore \u2013 this place is truly 5 star ultra luxury. I get goose bumps just thinking about this place! Check in \u2013 Check in was a breeze. I didn\u2019t have to wait longer than 2 minutes. They guy helping us was super friendly. I mentioned I was getting married the following day and the Encore surprised us with chocolate candies and a nice card in our room the next day (super nice touch). I was also told during check in that I had a $100 resort credit. I was a little hesitant because when I booked the trip through Orbitz I thought I could either get 20% off my stay or the $100 resort credit \u2013 I didn\u2019t know I got both (another big plus)!!! The resort does charge $20 per day as a daily fee. I knew before arriving that I would be paying this fee and it didn\u2019t bother me at all, especially after seeing this resort- it is so beautiful. Our Room/View\u2013 I think I paid about $30 more per night through Orbitz for a \u201cpanoramic\u201d room \u2013 let me tell you \u2013 it was worth $100!! We were placed on the 56th floor and the view was amazing!! I was a little bummed that our room wasn\u2019t facing the busy strip side but then when night came around and I saw Vegas all lit up and the mountains in the background- it was just breathtaking. I read reviews about people complaining about club noise at night but I didn\u2019t hear a thing being up so high (another reason I recommend the panoramic room). Our Room \u2013 The room itself was gorgeous and beautifully decorated. The Encore didn\u2019t skip an inch when decorating this entire resort and I\u2019m not exaggerating! The room had a bedroom area along with a sitting area and desk. The room does have food and drinks for sale but if you pick up the item longer than 60 seconds than you\u2019re charged- so don\u2019t let kids play with anything in the refrigerator.. lol The Bed \u2013 The bed and sheets were so comfortable. I thought for sure my back or neck work hurt after traveling but this bed was pure luxury. I think my husband looked up all the prices for the mattress, sheets, etc. because the Encore claimed you could buy it all and the prices were outrageous. I wasn\u2019t surprised by the prices after sleeping in the bed. There is also a switchboard next to the bed that controls the lights and the drapes that cover the windows (another 5 star luxury perk). Once the sunset then I would press a button and the drapes would open and the view was spectacular. The Bathroom \u2013 Again, pure luxury. There were 2 sinks, a nice tub and a very nice all glass shower (and lets not forget the private toilet area). I was spoiled after leaving this place. I want a new shower now back at home!! There is marble everywhere\u2026. Casino \u2013 Let me just say that this was my first trip to Vegas and my whole point was to get married. I didn\u2019t use the Casino so I can\u2019t really comment. All I can say is the Casino is beautifully decorated. I walked through a couple of other hotel casinos (Venetian, Luxor and Caesars Palace) and the other hotel casinos were dark and looked out-gated. The Encore on the other hand was vibrant and new. Food \u2013 The Encore does claim its 5 star and I totally agree so you\u2019re not going to find a McDonalds or Burger King inside this place. There are a ton of places to eat at the Wynn (right next door) but the Encore offers places to eat as well. I ate at Wazuzu (sushi) 2 or 3 times and it was delicious. It was a little pricey but not out of this world. I think I spent about $70 bucks each time but I got a lot of sushi. I also used my $100 resort credit to eat \u2013 that was a nice perk. Location \u2013 The Encore and Wynn are located right past the heart of the strip. I consider Caesars Palace and Bellagio to be right dab in the center of the Vegas Strip. Where as the MGM and Mandalay Bay are near the entrance of the strip (by the Las Vegas welcome sign). The Encore is on the other end. I loved the location because I didn\u2019t want to be where all the chaos was. Don\u2019t get me wrong- there are people everywhere but the Encore wasn\u2019t as busy as some of the other hotels that are in the center of the strip. Valet Parking \u2013 It was free if you were staying at the Encore \u2013 I loved the service \u2013 it was great and fast! (We did rent a car but only used it a few times.) Overall \u2013 I LOVE THIS PLACE AND CAN\u2019T WAIT TO GO BACK!! I thought before arriving that next time to Vegas I would try a different resort but after staying at the Encore \u2013 I wont stay anywhere else. I love the location, service, the rooms, the bed and Wazuzu!!!! Some people may complain that this place is expensive but after walking through other hotels- nothing else compares and I can\u2019t complain about a $20 resort fee because the Encore is truly a 5 star resort. Every wall, floor tile, elevator, room, restaurant, bathroom, etc is decorated perfectly. I don\u2019t even want to know how much this place cost to build\u2026.

Overall it felt luxurious with only two major flaws: 1) The music noise from the outdoor nightclub drones on well past 2 or 3am and it could easily be heard in our 29th floor room. If you want to avoid the noise, request \"mountain views\". The \"strip view\" rooms face the club, and thus get the noise. 2) the bathroom ventilation picks up cigarette smoke from somewhere else on the property. It was not constant, but frequently the bathroom had a very strong cigarette smell. It was contained to the bathroom, but quite unpleasant in an otherwise generally low-smoke hotel (for Las Vegas). I would stay here again for the luxury. The nightlife is fairly low-key, with two less popular clubs and a sleepy casino. The table minimum bets are kept high despite the low casino traffic. $25 was the lowest minimum for blackjack on a slow Sunday night! And there were tables of dealers twiddling their thumbs for lack of players!

The Encore allowed me to pay my deposit by cash ($150 per night). I never charge to my rooms anyway so minus the (arg!) resort fee it was just money in the bank for my pocket on the way home and no annoying credit card hassles. The bell boy had my bag up promptly and took the time to show me the room. After he got the $20 tip he would have gone for ice, tuned the TV to my favorite channel, re-arranged the pillows and drawn me a bath! I think there must be a lot of people being cheap on tips, as everywhere here from the front door to the waitress, once they knew I was good for a tip to reward their effort I never had to open a door for myself or wait too long for a drink ever again.

Stayed Monday through Thursday in an Encore Resort Suite on the 22nd floor. We faced the north end of the strip with a partial view of the golf course. Except for the desolation of the defunct Echelon Place, the view was quite lovely, especially at night. We liked the layout of the room. The sitting area was comfortable and had plenty of space for a the room service cart which opened into a small table for in-room dining. The bed was comfortable the room was very quiet. For dinner, we took advantage of the fact that several of the Wynn/Encore restaurants offered \"Taste of Wynn\" menu options where, for a set price, you could enjoy a three course meal. We did this at Lakeside for $59/pp, and at Bartolotta for $69/pp. Both meals were delicious although each had a few misses. The surprise of our dining experience at Wynn/Encore was La Cave. We really enjoy dining the small plate style of dining, and since one tends to overeat while on vacation anyway, it was the perfect spot for us. Our meal consisted of diver sea scallops, a lovely gorgonzola salad, a beet salad, diver sea scallops, and a ham, egg and cheese flatbread. Add a bottle of wine, dessert, tax and tip, we left feeling that we got a great meal for $155. Perhaps the best part of our stay was the Encore adult only pool. A nice pool is a major factor in where we decide to stay. The Encore adult only pool, was just perfect. There were plenty of chairs to choose from, and the atmosphere seemed surprisingly laid-back. Background music was served up from a diverse playlist and the volume was appropriate. Poolside drink service was attentive, and there is a nice bar that provides an opportunity to get out of the sun to enjoy a drink or a sandwich. I would have liked the water to be a bit cooler as it was well in the 100s while we were there. The regular pool at the Encore had chairs jammed together, although it was never really that crowded either. The most disappointing aspect of Wynn/Encore is their policy of not comping drinks at the video poker bars. We knew this going in, so we had already adjusted our mindset to this reality. however it may be the one aspect of staying there that may keep us from returning. And it's not just the comped drinks, but, because of the bars are now mainly for grabbing a drink, most of them were not open until evening. So off to the casino floor we ventured where the drink service was excellent. We never had to wait long for a cocktail waitress and could still get just about anything we wanted. We probably split our time between the casino at Encore and the one at Wynn. It was good to have easy access to both since they have dramatically different \"vibes\", but are both very comfortable. At the end of our stay we checked at the Red Card desk only to find that, since we were there on a special offer (2 free nights, 1 night at $129, and $150 in free play) there were no additional complimentaries that they could offer us. Grade B+ Customer service throughout both hotels was excellent. We were greeted warmly by every employee we encountered. Housekeeping was adequate although I was a bit surprised that there was no evening turn-down service. We were able to check-in early (around 1:00 p.m.) the day of arrival but there was no separate line for check-out at the front desk on the day of departure.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jslondon85", "ReviewID": "UR115756166", "Content": "Stayed 4 nights at Encore last week, had a fantastic time, great room on the 11th floor facing the north strip, no club noise problems at all.

We settled on the Palazzo with a view of the Pirate Show right across the street. As soon as we walked in we noticed some pretty obvious problems. #1, the window looking out from all the rooms were much smaller than we are used to at the Encore where the whole wall is glass making no matter what your looking at very cool and giving the room a more open feel to it. The other thing we noticed was the finger print smudges all over the dresser and chairs. Gross! The nail in the coffin was the hair in the toilet and sink. Maybe it was from housekeeping but we didn't bother to stick around and find out. We checked out as soon as we checked in and went next door to the Encore where we are always satisfied and enjoyed the rest of our trip. The thing about the Encore that I really love is its not a zoo. The valet is next to the front desk which is next to the elevators to my room so checking in is fast and getting to my room is easy. The Palazzo like the other places we visited were jammed packed and the walk to the front desk and eventual elevators to our room from the valet was a hike through a casino which isn't easy if your lugging your own luggage. I know they offer to bring it up but when your packing light enough to carry yourself, we prefer to do it ourself. We noticed the small pools at the Palazzo. I don't think they had an adult pool which is nice when you don't want kids around you. Anyway the adult pool at the Encore is awesome. It's big, there are no kids and it has a full bar with food. Again, it's never packed unless your there on a Sunday when they open the club XS and create a pool party all night. Awesome! Anyway.

I have another one planned in a month or so. No, I am not a compulsive gambler. My job brings me to Vegas every so often and I sprinkle in a personal trip here and there for a weekend. I am your average person. I gamble a little bit. I am not a club-goer, and I sit by the pool for a little while. I enjoy nice restaurants. For someone like me, Encore is a perfect fit. It is obvious that Steve Wynn and his crew have paid attention to every detail. Nothing goes unnoticed. I notice new things and pick up on some operational efficiencies each time I go. The staff and management have it all down to a science. It's a classy joint overall. Check-in: Smooth as silk. I am always welcomed back with a friendly smile when they pull up my profile. Spa: Haven't used it, but my spouse said it is incredible. Staff: With the rare exception, every employee I have encountered at the Wynn/Encore has been friendly and accommodating. Many do their jobs well and aren't even noticed. Restaurants: All are very good. I have been to a selection of the many restaurants at both Wynn and Encore. Wynn has more to choose from, Encore being the smaller of the two has fewer options. Yes, better bargains can be had on the strip, but each meal I have had at all restaurants has been above average. I enjoy Society Cafe for any meal. Service is top-notch. Casino: Clean, beautiful and actually bright. Not as crowded as the Wynn casino but the minimums tend to be slightly higher. Standard games. Wynn gears things toward the Asian gambler so there are a lot of Pai Gow games and things like that. A lot of Asian dealers as well. But everyone is generally friendly and helpful. Red Card: Same program as the Wynn. It's not entirely transparent. I've gotten a few basic things comped...food and drink mainly, nothing too elaborate. I'm not a high roller, but I gamble my fair share when I am there. Pool: Nice pool area. Smaller than the Wynn. Free water. Cocktail service is good. Slightly slower when busy, but not bad at all. There is a Beach Club separate from the main pool area for the Rehab types. Wynn was smart to separate the two so you can choose which atmosphere you want. Stores: All high-end. I've never seen anyone purchase anything in them, but if they can make money, more power to them. Worth a look if passing through. Overall ambience is great. I find the Wynn/Encore to be peaceful compared to other strip properties. I venture off property quite often when I am in town and always say \"I can't wait to get back to my hotel so I can get away from this madness.\" The bad: Yes, it's expensive. But you are paying for the entire experience. Everything is just a step above. Sometimes it is difficult to find a lower-minimum table especially on weekend evenings where they will start at $25. It's not uncommon to see a crowd at the $50 or $100 blackjack table, but there are plenty of low-rollers as well. More diverse food options would be great. There are a lot of restaurants so I think most of the bases are covered. However a lot of Asian restaurants that seem to all serve the same food at different price points. I look forward to my trip each time I go. When I go to Vegas, I price out multiple properties and always land at Encore paying more in the process but getting slightly more.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cVery nice with a couple of missteps\u201d", "Author": "totallye", "ReviewID": "UR115552642", "Content": "The Encore is exactly as expected, a \"lifestyle\" hotel.

Hey, it's not how most of us actually live, but this town is made for big dreamers so why not indulge? The rooms are quite large at more than 700 square feet and nicely appointed with floor to ceiling windows complete with remote control window covering at your fingertips. NIce furnishing and particularly high quality bedding. It was the nicest I have found on the Strip and this includes the Palazzo, and tHE hOTEL at Mandalay Bay. The bathroom itself was large, bright, and very clean. The towels plentiful and the robes were great. My complaint would be that the there is a odd musky scent emanating from the water closet room and the bath products seemed inferior to those at comparably priced properties along the strip. Check in was quick for our arrival albeit very noisy in the lobby. The hotel itself seems to have issues with noise as our first night was spent on the 29th floor which was no where near as quiet as the nights spent on the 51st floor subsequently. The noise we encountered was mostly due to guests volume and thin walls. Our biggest complaints on our three nights at the Encore was the fact that we were told to request a late check out if needed upon check in, it was denied to us however which was a disappointment as it was offered earlier. Secondly, following our first night we left our room by 10:00 am only to return at 5:45 pm to find it had not been attended to by housekeeping. After a call to the front desk we were offered another room immediately but no assistance to move our luggage or ensure that the room key-cards would open the new room. So one of us had to high-tail up two separate elevators to check that our card key would open the new room while the other stayed back, packing furiously, waiting for the okay that the switch could happen. The back down and up another elevator to pick up the luggage. It was unnecessary and an inconvenience to us and is the main reason it rated a four with us. One pays more to stay here, and that includes everything throughout the property so with that extra expense, I for one, expected a higher level of service when requested. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't handled to my satisfaction.

I could hear the bass/thumping from the night club on the 61st floor! If you are not used to noise when you are trying to sleep then this may not be the place for you. The bed was very comfortable. I wished the room had a coffee maker as well as a small fridge (it did say you could call to get one delivered). The snacks to purchase were dusty and the mini bar had expired beer - founds that out after I took a drank and thought it didn't taste very good.

The room was lovely, comfortable bed, massive bathroom and nice seating area. The Internet is free but you do have to accept the charges that are refunded at checkout. The pools were spacious but did get busy and you need to get down there before 11am to get a lounger. The overall vibe of the hotel is relaxed. Compared to other resorts we visited it was quieter and cleaner. We enjoyed this as it gave us a break from the hustle of the strip. Location itself was excellent. Across the road from the mall and about 10 minutes to the centre of the strip. Negatives Although it's common place the 20 dollar resort fee does seem excessive especially as you get very little for it. Also despite staying at the encore/Wynn you don't get any queue jumps or preferential treatment at the hotel as in at the buffet or nightclub. This does seem a little odd from my point of view surely as a hotel guest you should receive this. Only bad experience whilst attempting to enter a small cafe in the bar was told I could not enter wearing a vest. Again minor but considering it's 44 degree I am unlikely to be wearing a shirt.

Each time we stayed at a different hotel and this 8th trip we stayed at the Encore which by far was our best Vegas luxury hotel experience to date, hands down. Encore is expensive, yes, but for a good reason. Also, there's a popular school of thought for hotel choices: why pay more for a hotel if you're going to be spending most of your time outside the hotel anyway? While there is alot of basis for this school of thought, it might not necessarily hold true in Vegas. In Vegas, all the attractions are the hotels itself which means that you will be spending alot of your time in hotels: pool, meals, casino, shows, and other attractions. Guests at the Encore and Wynn have access to amenities on either side. It seems like for every great thing that was first built at the Wynn, they made it better at the Encore. If you are looking for excellent customer service, modern and gorgeous and high tech rooms, and wonderful amenities, then this place is for you. Vegas has a ton of hotel competition but Encore knows how to stand out. When we requested for more toiletries, they called us up within the next 15 mins to check if they had been delivered to our room. Some other standouts at the Encore: 1. They have a European-style pool (i.e. topless optional). Best time/least crowded time to go is on late mornings early in the week. 2. Beautiful pool area without the spring breakers crowd. If you don't want drinks and food service, they have multiple complimentary ice drinking water stations to keep you hydrated during those hot summer days. 2. Fighting over which tv channel to watch in the room? No worries. There's a tv in the room and another tv in the bathroom. 3. Automated control for lights, drapes, and room privacy from your bedside. 4. Touchscreen room phone. 5. Personal customer service: Whenever we called up housekeeping or the service desk, they picked up the phone and straightaway addressed us by name without us informing which room we're in. The last time we got this type of personal experience was when we stayed at the Four Seasons in Singapore. Great award-winning restaurants and shopping at the esplanade. The location is also fantastic being really close to the Palazzo, Venetian, and Fashion Show Mall. Need something from Walgreens?

I have read the reviews and several people have complained about check in. I can only tell you how wonderful our experience was. We were horrendously delayed in getting to the hotel. I had read some horror stories on trip advisor as to what happened when you arrived late, so we braced ourselves for the worst. Nothing could be further from the reviews on here! We arrived at 3am, tired and upset at the plane delays. We were met with sympathetic and very understanding staff. We were told there were no rooms in the class we had booked and that they would sort something out. The check in staff phoned someone and two minutes later she told us we had a free upgrade to the 59th floor with full strip view. Not only that but they brought up extra towels and gave us additional toiletries (toothbrush, toothpaste etc), I can only assume to save us unpacking at the late hour. Truly wonderful! The rooms are out of this world! Comfortable beds, plush pillows, great tvs, tv in bathroom, which is huge by the way! I cannot complain about one thing. The pool area was wonderful as well, never overcrowded, we always got a poolside lounged whenever we went down. The Internet is very good, and very fast. It is included in the resort fee, I know lots of people complain on here about the resort fee, but it is fairly standard, not just in Vegas. All the staff were great and friendly and very helpful.

A 5-star review for a 5-star hotel means everything went perfectly throughout. I have given 5-star reviews to other 5-star hotels (for example, in Vegas, to the Four Seasons and to the Wynn itself). The Encore fell short upon check-in on a recent stay so, sorry Encore, you lose a star for that and this is a 4-star review for a 5-star hotel. We arrived at 3:30PM (30 minutes after check-in officially opened) in a VERY quiet week in Vegas (no large conventions, casinos mostly empty, never had to wait for a taxi or game or restaurant table). In our past stay at the Wynn we did find the main pool area a bit crowded so we asked the desk clerk about upgrading to a tower room that has use of a special pool just for tower rooms. We found out the special pool is over at the Wynn (about 7-10 minutes walk away) and it was an extra $75 per night to upgrade to the tower room so we didn't bother with the upgrade, and the clerk tried to upsell us to 3 or 4 different kinds of upgrade rooms (which is fine in my opinion). Then the desk clerk tells us that, sorry, there are no rooms ready in the room class we had booked. While I will tolerate this in a 3* or maybe even a 4* hotel, I have little tolerance for this in a 5* hotel - I see it as a management failure, either an accidental underestimation of the number of guests in the hotel (unlikely with computerized reservation systems) or an intentional understaffing of the housekeeping department to try to save cost. I see this as the hotel telling me, \"We don't value your custom enough to err on the side of caution when staffing our housekeeping department with people earning $8/hr.\" Here is the correct way a 5-star hotel should handle this: \"I'm sorry sir, we don't have any rooms left in the room class that you booked, so I am going to upgrade you to (whatever room class is clean and ready at that moment) at no extra charge.\" In the very rare instance that there are no rooms at all open (maybe there really was a rash of people who checked out 2 hours late) then a barely-acceptable 5-star answer is: \"I'm sorry sir, there are no rooms at all available at this moment because of (whatever). I will call a bellman over for you to store your bags and they'll be waiting in your room when you get there; meanwhile, here are a couple of drink coupons, please have a drink in the bar with our compliments and I will bring you your room keys as soon as your room is ready, and it will be ready in (an accurate estimate).\" Here's what actually happened: Like I said, we were shown all the upgrade rooms but then told that our room was unavailable. It was pretty matter-of-fact, if it was an apology I don't remember it being apologetic, more like \"I don't know when your room will be ready, please give me your cellphone number and someone will call you when it's ready and you can come back to the desk and wait in another line to pick up your keys. You can take your own bags down to the bell stand if you want the bellman to store them for you, and then when you get your room number you can call the bell stand from your room (and wait) to have your bags delivered.\" That would be acceptable in a 3-star place and barely acceptable in a 4-star, but the lack of service there is not at all acceptable in a 5-star hotel. Anyway, we did store 3 of our bags but still opted to lug one bag with all our valuables in it around the casino. We did get the phone call eventually after about 30 minutes, not a big deal but again not knowing how long it was going to be meant we couldn't really plan an activity to fill the time (didn't want to sit down and gamble if I was going to have to leave after 15 minutes) so we were just kind-of wandering around waiting for the call. Yeah I could have pitched a hissy fit and probably gotten some or all of the 5-star response I was expecting, but the fact is, I shouldn't have to. The only other thing that irked me was a big sign outside the elevators saying, \"No food or drink from outside the premises allowed in rooms\". I don't think I've seen one of those in any hotel in a long time... what does that say about what you think of your guests or your restaurants? If you offer quality food at a price your guests are willing to pay then people will rarely bring in food items. But I'll tell you what, if I have that Big Mac attack at 3AM I don't want any sign telling me I can't bring it back to my room. So - enough of that - other than that the Encore was pretty good. Hotel in general: Nicely decorated, very contemporary (which we like), everything in excellent condition with a lot of attention to detail. Room - Excellent as expected. Bed comfortable, layout very functional, nice sitting area for entertaining if desired. We were able to hear the Surrender nightclub from our room (low floor but near the elevators and relatively far from the club area) but it wasn't too bad. Restaurants - Wazuzu was very good (try the soup if you are hung over) and the Buffet (in the Wynn) was good for breakfast. Excellent coffee and pastries from the Cafe over in the Wynn. Casino - Small, quiet, nice ambience, relatively non-smoky. Note there are no Blackjack tables under $25 in the evenings even mid-week (my Wife is just learning and $25 is a bit high for a beginner). My Wife's game is Craps and we had a craps table all to to ourselves for about an hour one afternoon where I learned craps from the staff who were all helpful and friendly. The Wynn casino is a bit more lively. Bars: Most of the bars around the casino were shut. The advertised \"Dueling pianos\" show in the Eastside bar was more like \"Agreeable pianos\" and not the fun-times dueling piano shows that I am used to. Pool: Very nicely decorated, good service, but all the \"good\" spots to sit (padded lounges etc) are reserved for the Cabana rentals. Regular deckchairs for everyone else. Overall: Very nice hotel and we had returned to the Encore because of our previous good experience at the Wynn. But there are other great 5* hotels out there (4 Seasons) and perhaps it's time to try something new for next time.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington state", "Title": "\u201cFirst Class Experience\u201d", "Author": "CBE&LME", "ReviewID": "UR115139930", "Content": "Check in was efficient and gracious.

Our stay did not start off well as there was little organization at the front desk, and we got stuck behind a rude party that wanted to haggle over a last-minute booking. However, once we were finally checked in the service was 5 star at every turn. The resort itself is beautiful and you could spend hours just crushing around marveling at all the high-quality materials that went into a design that is nearly flawless in its execution. Our room was huge considering the price we paid. We were on the 52nd floor with an amazing view of the city, complete with a massive bathroom and sitting room. A note for light sleepers: at the 52nd floor I could still hear the bass from the club and the DJ yelling over tracks. If you are a party animal then you wont mind a bit, but I think some of the more conservative travelers might want the room to be a complete sanctuary. It is not. People are screaming in the halls, and well, it\u2019s Vegas. I was not really bothered because I\u2019m there to party too, but I can see why someone else might be put out. Everyone on the staff is very friendly and professional. Aside from the front desk, I really have no negative comments about any of the service I received at this resort. The food on-site is pricey (of course) and most of it is presented in an \u2018overdone\u2019 fancy fashion when such treatment is completely unnecessary. It seems like many of the chefs are working under the assumption the even American comfort food must be drizzled in truffle oil and jammed into a souffl\u00e9 cup. I can understand what they are going for, but many times over-the-top becomes yet another camp clich\u00e9. More about the food: room service is really remarkable in being able to deliver a well cooked meal to your door hot and well prepared. When you order a cup of coffee, expect the person to try to \u2018upsell\u2019 you at every turn. Again, I get it, but the pressure gets old. That said, on my last night I enjoyed a perfectly grilled ribeye while looking over the strip and planning that night\u2019s foray into the casino. \u2013 One last kudos on the food: the buffet is really remarkable and pretty good deal at 23 a head. Of course the casino beautiful and expensive. Personally, I prefer to stay somewhere nice and gamble on the strip. But if you don\u2019t mind high minimums, Both the Encore and the Wynn casinos will meet or exceed your expectations for a good time. For a larger selection of games and a more lively crowd, I would say your best bet is the Wynn Casino as it has more action. The Encore Casino is much more intimate, but I was not feeling it there.

Never the less there are many things they can improve. Here\u00b4s our point of view. The line at the front desk to be able to check in is tooooo long, the same for the day we checked out. It takes you about an hour to get to the front desk. Our first disappointment the room, we had booked for a panoramic suite with view to the strip, well we had a panoramic view but certainly we didn\u00b4t had a view to the strip. Our room had a view to Vegas down town. But we were so tired form the flight and the one hour line to check in that we decided not to call the front desk, just in case we had to wait one more hour to finally get our room. (That if they changed our room). The decoration of the room is very beautiful, the bed is heavenly confortable, and the bathroom is perfect. The only downsides of the room were the view, the light inside the closet was out and the scale in the bathroom didn\u00b4t worked. The casino is really quiet. And honestly I liked it to be that way during day hours, but at night. I like casinos to be a little more loud with a little more of life. On my birthday we were playing at a blackjack table up to 3 am and by the time we were done of playing black jack we were the last one\u00b4s playing in the casino. (Maybe it is because the drink ladies don\u2019t come too often to your table.) And the only complain we had during our stay was that we booked with more than one week in advance to celebrate my birthday dinning at the Bartollota (that is the Italian fine dine restaurant at the Wynn). We wanted to be a special night so we booked a private cabana in the outside lake of the restaurant. Ones you call to make your reservation they send you a contract for you to sign it and agree that in order to have a private cabana you have to consume more than $130.00 per person (that was fine with us). But they never let you know that in some weather conditions the cabanas services are not available. What was our surprise? When we arrived that night the hostess informed us that due to the weather was so hot that day, they decided not to give service at the cabanas. What!!!!!!!

Hotel is in great shape and nice because it is in the strip but far away from the noise. The staff however was non-attentive and did not aknowledge you or check on you at the pools. Very modern decor and disco ambiance music throughout the hotel property. It was a great hotel and very recommended, I would say on the top 5 in Las Vegas.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bengaluru", "Title": "\u201cSUPER\u201d", "Author": "loki_knows", "ReviewID": "UR114826144", "Content": "The hotel was extremely good.

The staff is gracious without being patronizing, helpful without being imposing, and friendly without being familiar. TIP - Get a \"north facing room\" if you think you will be bothered by any club noise. I had a room on the 5th floor & couldn't hear a peep - or a thump. The room is very plush, as are all the amenities in the room. Granted the view in a north room isn't great but that's the fault of the economy not Mr. Wynn - the view is of the skeletal remains of the abandoned Echelon and Fountain Bleu projects. I imagine a higher up room would be a better view but I wasn't there to stare out the window. I felt very secure there - something very important to a solo traveler.

The Encore hotel was excellent from start to finish. Reception, pool, casino, waiting and restaurant staff were all extremely polite, genuine and welcoming. High quality and luxury were paramount across the Encore on all levels. I have just two complaints .... noise from Encore Beach Club/outside clubs and lack of sunbeds at the pool area. We were on the 63rd floor (the highest floor of the hotel) and still had to buy earplugs and sleeping tablets for the noise. My suggestion is that if you aren't fussed on a strip view and value your sleep more, get a room on the non strip view side of the hotel. In terms of sunbeds, hit the pool early, especially Thursday through to Sunday. This aside, our stay at the Encore was thoroughly enjoyable and we thought it was much more fitting for us as a young couple than our stay at the Wynn a few years ago. Couple of tips for those staying at the hotel in the near future - Check out the Peppermill Diner which is literally a 5 minute walk from the entrance of the hotel to the right. You get a huge and awesome breakfast which sets you up for the day. Walgreens is again a few feet away from the entrance, just a 5 minute walk and you'll get water for the room, suncream etc rather than pay big prices at the Encore shop. RA Sushi at Fashion Show Mall is excellent and they do a Happy Hour at the wekends which means big discount prices on drink and selected food. Again this is literally across the street from the Wynn which you can gain access direct from the Encore. We didn't get to see La Reve as the show was dark but after speaking to a few people at the hotel who had managed to catch it before we arrived, the feedback was excellent. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Encore again but I will be requesting the \"quiet\" side of the hotel next time.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cFive Star all the way!!\u201d", "Author": "PinkBonBon", "ReviewID": "UR114773402", "Content": "This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at!!!

We noticed that most of the casinos now are not kept up. Very dirty and VERY SMOKY. Not so with the Encore. It is spotless and no smoke smell ever. They must have some type of special filters because there is always a pleasant smell in the casino. The cocktail waitresses come by quickly and the drinks are fantastic. They have some of the best mojitos I've ever had. I also visited the spa during my last trip. Gorgeous decor and great masseuse. Every amenity you could want at the spa.

I can handle $14 mai tais for a long weekend in return for a terrific pool scene - especially at the Euro pool. It's important to point out the best view is to the south side (the main strip) but the club music from Surrender/Encore Beach Club is audible in the rooms throughout the night on the weekend at some level. It didn't bother us one bit but it might some. Encore caters their social scene to a younger crowd but they need a restaurant or two like Lavo (at Palazzo) to match. All the restaurants just seem a little to mature (although very nice) and just a tad overpriced. In back to back years my wife and I went next door to Venetian/Palazzo for Lavo, Delmonico and Carnevino. If the rooms are reasonable, this is my default choice for a weekend with my wife and other couples. I might stay elsewhere for a guy's weekend.

Wanted a upscale place that would take care of us and the Encore staff did just that. Decided that I wanted a little more exclusivity and went with the Encore Tower Suites. **If you have the money to spare there is absolutely no reason not to go with the Tower Suites. They are worth every single penny!!** Separate entrance, private check-in, private elevators, and only 6 rooms to a floor. Room: The room lay-out is great. I stayed in the Encore just because I liked the room layout better than Wynn. The mirrors make the room seem bigger and the decorations are chic. The floor-to-ceiling windows are fantastic. We were placed on the 38th floor and had a Strip view room. Having a strip view room means that this side deals with the noise at Surrender Nightclub and Encore Beach Club. At check-in our attendant made sure we were aware of the possible noise. It really isn't anything to freak out about if you are high up enough. Pool(s): The best pools in Vegas. If you are a Tower Suites guest then you have access to two private pools. There are two problems with these two private pools. There is no Tower Suites pool at Encore, only at Wynn so be prepared for a little trek. Two-Being that the Tower Suites pools are at Wynn simply means SHADE. Once the sun starts to set in the West the pools are covered by the shadow the Wynn casts. We ended up using the European pool. Best choice ever! Good music, great atmosphere, and good drinks.. Clubs: Only checked out XS and Marquee at Cosmopolitan. In my opinion XS out did Marquee. The crowd at XS felt much more sophisticated. Both are mega-clubs where much fun can be had. For a great host at XS use Ryan Perrings. Restaurants: Ate at SW Steakhouse, The Buffet @ Wynn, and Stratta. The best meal we had was at Stratta. SW seemed to be way to busy and more of business meeting spot. The buffet @ Wynn is well....A BUFFET. I was not overly impressed, although they had a wide variety of food. BOTTOM LINE: Encore Tower Suites are the place to be in my opinion. A hotel within a hotel. Stay here if you are looking for great service, selection, shopping, and things to do.

Arrived for a well earned three-day with my bride getaway (from the kids). We booked 9 months in advance...after we purchase Celine Dion tickets. We planned and saved and talked about our upcoming romantic adventure. We researched all the hotels because we wanted a great 'total experience package.' Bottom Line: We slept in a top hotel and the experience was cheap, unless we were to reach into our wallet. Everything at The Encore seemed to be after my hard-earned dollars. Even a drink of non-tasting water has to come from a bottle which set me back 400% over retail. I know this because my wife and I went across the street to fill her prescription and found the same exact same Fiji water. I felt like I burned my money for the hotel\u2019s greed. Like I said, even a dime costs a quarter when you step foot inside the hotel. Even a normal cup of coffee costs $4. Cleverly, there is no coffee available in the room unless you go to the lobby or have it delivered. It is kind of like Disney, when you set foot in the park they got you...I did not want my experience to feel that way. It really is awful, but I understand it and it is in fact capitalism at its finest. That is why we learned to buy a couple bottles of water from across the street and bring them into the room. However, the hotel thought about that as well and keenly prevents the renter from using the hotel\u2019s mini-fridge to keep the water cold. Now, I could have called housekeeping and coordinated somehow to have one delivered, and I am not sure but there probably would have been a charge for that as well. While the room was a value, everything else is just the opposite making the value non-existent, at best. My wife and I started our trip from Louisiana. We long-needed a romantic get away. We planned the trip after buying Celine tickets in August of last year...In other words, we have been looking forward to this trip for several months. Additionally, we bought Le Reve tickets upon our arrival in your lobby...When we checked in, we were convinced to purchase a room up-grade for a panoramic view of the strip from a higher floor. As we wanted our experience to be memorable, we were excited to see the night scene...only to get to our room and look out at the Circus Circus. I called down to the front desk and complain that our second-to-none view was of the back-side of the strip and that was not explained to us. It was explained that it was \u2018of the strip\u2019 and if we wanted the \u2018other\u2019 side it would cost additional.

I wonder how many would have said lets un-pack, re-pack, un-pack, and then re-pack for a two night stay? Not worth the hassle. Very poor explanations of the room\u2019s views. We were also told from the desk personnel that the bass from the club would have shook the windows until 4am. This was not true, we talked with clients across the hall on the same floor in the elevator. Did you know that there is a pass you can get to by-pass a buffet line? We had no idea so we waited an hour. The facilities were beautiful, and great to explore however, the price of staying was only the tip of the iceberg.

Service on the telephone reservation line was excellent: they forwarded me to the concierge to make reservations for the show, dinner, etc. Service at the front desk when we arrived was oddly incongenial, but perfectly efficient (it almost seems as if they train the front desk staff to seem indifferent and unfriendly). We enjoyed the room itself immensely - the bellman was particularly helpful when he brought up our bags, pointing out where we could go nearby to pick up sundries, water, etc., and suggesting a couple of breakfast spots, and showing us landmarks from our windows. I opted for the upgrade to a panoramic room (top ten floors), and I consider that money well spent, as it's far quieter on the higher floors (the nightclubs can be quite loud, but I heard not a thump or a peep up on the 61st floor). I chose a north view, which at this time is largely of half-finished construction projects, but on the high floors, you get a decent view of downtown and the mountains. The south view, the Strip view, is much more dramatic, but I'm told those rooms do hear more nightclub noise, and since I was there over a Friday-Saturday, that was a consideration. The rooms are well-laid out, with many comforts and conveniences such as the power drape controls by the bed, a decent iPod player, easy connection to wi-fi, which makes the minor irritants just all that much more irritating. I really dislike the lack of a refrigerator and coffeemaker in the room. There IS a refrigerator, but if you touch anything in it (the honor bar items are motion-sensitive), you will generate a charge to your bill, and the cost for the items is extremely high. You cannot add your own items to the refrigerator without generating charges, due to the motion sensor. And NO coffee. Good luck getting coffee in any of the Wynn/Encore restaurants in the morning without waiting in a half-hour line. I wasn't willing to wait that long, so we went elsewhere for our coffee and breakfasts. Definitely buy some of the bath products in the Wynn home store while you're there if you like them (I loved them); they're very hard to get hold of via the Internet. The robes are lovely: I actually considered buying one, but they're over $100. The resort fee of $20/night entitles you to \"free\" wi-fi and use of the exercise room. It's annoying, but it's also pretty standard for most of the Vegas resorts anymore. Buy your own water - they only provide a single, small bottle for the first night, and after that, the bottled water is an absurd fee. There's a Walgreens pretty much across the street to the north, and a liquor/beverage store, so there's no reason to pay the room bar prices. The lines to pick up the show tickets never seemed to get any shorter, so I finally just bit the bullet and went and got in the line. Service was very efficient, and La Reve was worth every penny of the stay. Getting that as a comp makes it a stellar deal; it's an astonishing show, not a bad seat in the house. If you haven't seen it, definitely consider it. It's stunning. The buffet was enjoyable: I've heard people complain about a lack of variety, but I frankly don't see where they're coming from on that. I found seafood of every type, from crab legs to whole fish, to sushi. My husband enjoyed the prime rib and ham. We both experimented with the extensive Asian food and pasta selections. The one place we were a little disappointed was with the desserts: they were extensive and elaborate, but we found them TOO elaborate for our tastes. We probably should have stuck with the house-made ice cream. I used both the Encore and Wynn pools while I was there. The pool at Encore is very small and gets extremely crowded. The adult pool is better, but most of the seating is reserved for the cabana renters. It takes quite a long time to get a drink from a server if you're seated around the pool, but for the adult pool, just go up to the central bar island. Neither pool at Encore is really suitable for a serious swim; they're much too small. You can, however, use the Wynn pools, and you can make a decent swim out of it by swimming from one pool to the other via their connecting \"canal\" pool. Wynn had far more seating available near the pools, but that might have been because it was cooler the day I went down there. I did not use the spa or exercise equipment. Checkout was utterly painless - I reviewed my bill on the television in the room, verified the charges, and selected the express checkout, which is basically dropping an envelope in a box on your way to the taxi stand. The charges were accurate, and I would certainly consider the Encore again, with a special offer such as I took advantage of. Be aware, though, that many of the core Strip attractions are a LONG walk away. Everything is walking distance, IF you brought really comfortable walking shoes. Don't try to take the regular bus; it takes quite literally 45 minutes to get to the MGM Grand from the Encore. Take a taxi, walk over to the light rail stations, or walk; the bus is awful. Just don't try to do it in your stiletto heels. You'll be unable to walk by the second day. I do prefer the rooms at the MGM Grand Signature, where I stayed last fall. Those rooms provide a full kitchenette, more separation between sleeping and sitting areas, and have an even more sybaritic bath. However, it's an even longer walk from the Signature to the Strip than it is from the Encore.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan Beach", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel but just average for meetings\u201d", "Author": "travelerkl", "ReviewID": "UR113131835", "Content": "Overall hotel and room product is great.

Everything from the driveway, to the building and the ornate waterfall, are meticulously designed to emit an atmosphere of class and luxury. The opulent rooms are each adorned with the finest of details and amenities, and include everything from a marvellous (albeit expensive) minibar, to complimentary dressing gowns for the duration of stay. The bedding and linen are of the finest, luxurious quality, and the entire property, in terms of cleanliness, is simply impeccable. Behind this seemingly faultless fa\u00e7ade, however, lies many inconspicuous, underlying issues; all of which had a detrimental influence regarding the quality of my own stay. I had originally made a reservation at another hotel casino, but had decided to make the most of my first stay in Las Vegas by cancelling, and rebooking at Encore due its status amongst Las Vegas hotels. Upon making my reservation, as I do with every other, I requested a higher floor, in a quiet room with a view of The Strip. Such note was attached to my reservation, and I was informed of such. My stay in Las Vegas was the one of which I was looking forward to most of all, consequential to the reputation preceding the hotel. Such excitement was short lived; at the very least, for the time being. The line at check-in was shorter than I had anticipated, and it moved along at a steady pace. Upon approach to the check-in desk, the Guest Service Agent greeted me, somewhat impersonally. It wasn\u2019t until I had observed the other staff members that I had noticed that this was commonplace. The member of staff assisting my check-in acknowledged my requests, but informed me that there were no rooms accommodating all of my requests. Each available room only accommodated one of these requests, and not the others, at best. I simply requested that he place me in the room he thought best, and I was allocated room E1910; the nineteenth floor. Entering the hotel room is most certainly an experience. The rooms themselves are phenomenally designed and presented upon first glance. It isn\u2019t until very close examination that many faults, however small they may be, present themselves; particularly in the case of room E1910. The room features an adjoining door, through which the neighbour\u2019s door is clearly audible with each and every movement. There are times when conversation can clearly be heard, even should that conversation involve no shouting, screaming or yelling. Further, the shower screen of the bathroom made a loud \u2018clicking\u2019 noise with each movement. Flaws in addition to these included, but was not limited to; a missing aesthetic display pillow; a missing breakfast room service card; an item on the minibar appearing to have been opened and resealed; an inoperable bathroom scale; a television featuring a chip in the screen, leading to an obtrusive black line spread across the entire width of the panel; and most disappointingly, I was hoping for a higher floor. These flaws may appear petty, however when involving such significant room rates, these things are made all the more disappointing. Such to my disappointment, I contacted the front desk, and the following day the front office manager, Andrew, happily had me relocate to room 6220; on the sixty-second floor (although not physically the sixty second floor, this is of the highest floors of the property, as the hotel does not feature floors 13, 40-49). This made for a considerably comfortable stay; up until the very last night. As I had what could be considered an early flight the following morning, I called to make wake up call arrangements for 6am. As it was an earlier flight, I had planned to go to sleep at approximately 11:30pm. Before I could get there, I could hear droning, reverberating sounds of the nightclub music constantly exploding up at me from approximately fifty floors below! As I had read about the noise prior to my stay, I thought I would give it time. It wasn't until 1:30am that I called the front desk and asked when the music would stop, only to be informed (following five minutes on hold. Presumably due to an influx of noise complaints) that it would be at 4:30am!! I was presented with two options. The first; have some earplugs delivered to my room. I decided against this, as (a) I already had my own, and (b) I had a wake up call I needed to be able to hear in order to receive it. For this reason, I declined. The second option was a room change, however this would be quite the inconvenience, considering it was almost 2am, and a room change at that hour (and for a second time - a third room - during a 5 night stay) would be almost unheard of! I declined this also, and decided that I would try to sleep through it. It may be worth noting that it was at this time that I could hear what sounded as though my neighbour was relocating, however this I am unable to confirm. It wasn't until almost 4am that I could no longer stand not being able to sleep. I will clarify: I had had absolutely no sleep during the entire night up until that point! I decided to put some earplugs in, and fell asleep at approximately 4am. As I had feared, I had missed my wake up call due to the earplugs. Luckily, a second wake up call woke me up at approximately 6:05am. This was extremely lucky!! I could have very easily had missed my flight that morning. In summation, I had what was no more than 2 hours of sleep. 2 hours sleep in a \"luxurious\", \"classy\" five star establishment! 2 hours! This is not acceptable for a five star establishment. What I did not expect was to be able to hear the music from the sixty-second floor, some fifty-odd floors above the action! This made for a very uncomfortable and dissatisfying final experience of this upscale hotel. I would also like to add that I believe the resort fee, although I was well aware of it prior to my stay, is an unnecessary, classless add-on that should be incorporated into rates, and not used as a tool to extract more funds from the guest upon check out. Check-out itself also left much to be desired. The Guest Service Agent at check-out, the only one on duty at that time, was quite impersonal, and did not bother asking about my stay. It appeared as though she simply did not wish to be there. When I asked for a hotel manager\u2019s contact, she brought to me a business card featuring an email address. I later tried this email twice to no avail; the email address was seemingly invalid. I then attempted to call to obtain the relevant contact, and was accidentally hung up on when placed on hold. It is for the reasons that I have outlined above that I will choose not to stay at Encore in future. Not only does a guest pay for service when selecting a hotel, they are paying for the privilege to sleep. This privilege is therefore earned, and then an exclusive right. Having paid significantly more to stay in a premium hotel, this is what was expected. It is quite a shame that, what should have been a memorable and pleasant stay, was overshadowed by these flaws, however minor they may appear.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cWe loved this great hotel\u201d", "Author": "igolfCA", "ReviewID": "UR111841755", "Content": "Have been to Vegas many times and have stayed at most of the nice hotels.

On one trip where I brought my daughter, they took her doll and blanket and tucked it in like it was taking a nap. So cute!! They offer so many great quality toiletries (q-tips, sewing kits, Aveda products, ect.). The television can turn and face the living room area or the bedroom area, which allows you to watch tv, comfortably, no matter where you are (but who watches tv when in Vegas???). They also program your name on the television, so that you see \"Hello, Mrs. Thompson\" every time you turn on on the tv. In addition, they offer television check-outs, which is AWESOME and so convenient. The beds are SO comfortable and the curtains can be controlled from your bed!

Also loved the pools and the services at the pools. With all of this good stuff going on at the Encore there is still room for improvement. First and foremost there was no turndown service at night and no goodies left on the beds such as guests would normally see at a five star place. Thus, there was always a need for more towels. This was important if you are using the pool and/or are out in the Las Vegas heat. Also there was no opportunity for a late checkout - even for one hour. Don't even get close to the minibar or you will be charged for something. As for the overall facility, it is quite beautiful but the casino like all others in Vegas contains a lot of smoke. Don't know if the Encore can do anything about this, but some of the other high end hotels have their shopping malls on a higher floor or in a completely separate area so that there isn't too much smoke. Another pet peeve is the resort fee. A high end hotel should not be charging this unless the guest gets something substantial in return such as a free gym. Not the case here.

My husband had a conference at the hotel, so knowing it's reputation, I was looking forward to it. We spent a week at the hotel, which I know is a long time for Vegas, but between the few days we tacked on at the end, and his board meeting, we needed the time. The worst part was the extremely loud music, and the disco sound that lasted until the middle of the night. We were in the Tower Suites, on the 39th floor, which is only 1 floor below the 50th. There are no floors numbered 40-49 because apparently this is bad luck in Chinese. That section of rooms is above both the disco that they have at the Beach Club, and Surrender, one of their other discos. The suite itself is nice enough, but who designed this place didn't seem to know what they were doing. The \"suite\" is a very large room with 2 sections, with a rotating flat screen TV on the divider. The biggest problem is that the airconditioning is not sufficient to cool the bedroom area. If one person want to wake up earlier, or stay up later, than the other, there is no way to not hear the TV while in the bed. Also, their is neither an air conditioning vent or an exhaust in the bathroom. Thankfully it was not a very hot week, but still . . . . The Encore and Wynn are connected by an esplanade, so that allows convenient access to restaurants at both. Although one of the bars at the Encore serves coffee in the morning, other than a major sit-down breakfast, you have to go to the Wynn for a \"starbucks\" type of place. Other hotels have a variety of counter/cafe type locations for either breakfast or a snack during the day. That is lacking here. There noise level from the music is everywhere. It seems that what the Encore is looking to attract is the 20 somethings who frequent their discos. There is also a disco/nightclub called Xs that provides quite a show for those who are not used to seeing the type of people who go to these kind of things. My kids are this age, and now I know why my son loved spring break in Vegas last year. I had also hear raves about the spa. One day I decided to take a look at it to see whether it was worth the exorbitant cost of services. I found it very uninviting, and decided against it.

I would definitely recommend this hotel, however, they definitely lack the proper service you get in most 5* hotels in Europe of a similar cost when it comes to anything reomotely out of the ordinary. One major tip, is don't let them fool you into getting a different room. All the room types are exactly the same - a panoramic suite only has a mirror on one wall to make it look bigger.

We found ourselves going around in circles, following the signs. Take a compass!! Expecting the usuall express checkout on the TV, we check our bill. There are charges that are not ours. we call the front desk and are told we have to fill out a form at the front desk. The charges were made at 1:00 on our check in day. We didn't even check in till 5:30. We didn't even have a room yet (to charge to the room). Back to the script again (I apologize sir). Maam, it's common sense that the charges are not ours, can't you just fix it without us. I'm sorry sir, but you'll have to come and wait in line and fill out the form. Yes, there are lines to check in and out. I see signs of too many cutbacks. Room is very nice, show was very good. For around $200 a night, this hotel is not worth the money. The bugs not worked out yet. Even calling the front desk is cordial at best! For this money, I'd take Ceaser's or the Venetion. Not ready from prime time. Oh yeah, the black jack games at the bar do not comp drinks, Period! Doesn't matter how much you play. gym? yes, but if you want to shower, that's extra! not kidding. funky mattress??

The actuall Wynn/Encore facility is vast, well maintained, mid to lower high end and impressive however not without its flaws which include but not limited to - exceptional waiting times for service inc. breakfast that takes 45 minutes (not surprising I guess in a facility with that many rooms). You need to add time to everything you would be accustomed to from a 5* star hotel from check in to check out and everything in between - the restaurants are generally booked in advanced with no real 'fast track' for hotel guests - both pools are totally insufficient for the number of guests, there were more guests looking for seats at 11am than there were guests seated in the pool area - if you are an early morning gym'er like I am the gym at the encore is small and hardly built to match the potential number of guests Dont get me wrong the Wynn/Encore facility is great but you would be better off expecting that mid to high end 'first come/first serve' resort experience rather than the 5* hotel experience.

The SPA at Encore is vasty superior in both customer service, features etc to that at the Wynn hotel.. but the treatments are expensive around $220 for 60min service etc. The only downside I can see with the property is that it's located at the other end of the strip.. (next to Fashion mall shops) away from MGM, Ceasar's palace etc. and it's quite a walk (advise getting a monorail 3day pass) This might be good for some people to get away from the \"average joe\" class in vegas ...also I was shocked Unlike most other cities..

I noticed there was a hospitality suite with coffee, etc. I called to ask if we could use this and was told we could.

There is no in-room coffee, and you must get downstairs by 8:30am in order to use the benefit of your ONE cup of coffee. No extras, no refills. I inquired if we could have a coffee maker brought up and was told \"no\". I later saw a coffee maker on the maid cart for another room.

The Encore blows all three away. The attention to detail, cleanliness and rooms are unmatched. First off, check-in and check-out were totally painless and quick. Our room was on a low floor and had probably one of the less desirable views (North to the riviera and hilton) and was still amazing. The rooms with a single king bed I liked much more than the two-beds rooms. the king room had a nice divider that created two rooms and just a more homey feel to them. Bathrooms are standard luxury vegas, although the shower was much nicer than the Venetian/Palazzo's with a seat and hand-held shower head. There is also no shortage of mirrors in the room, with one whole wall of the room entirely mirrors, and three full-length paneled mirrors across from bathroom. All very good when you are trying to get ready to go out. As for the hotel itself, we had coffee from the lobby bar directly at the entrance to the elevators (very convenient) each morning. They have also have good tapas type food for the middle of the day. Used the pool each day, the European pool which is nicer and has BJ tables, a nice bar with TVs and topless women( I counted 3). We got a cabana there which was beautiful, but definitely not necessary. It also gets shade much sooner than the main pool. The main pool had more kids, but for tanning is definitely the better spot. Lastly, for meals, ate only at Society Cafe (also hit up Lakeside Grill at the Wynn, which was excellent), which we did each morning. Food is very good, service was hit or miss each day, our one waitress thought it was amusing when she forgot to bring us things, but its a good place to start the day. The casino is small, never crowded and fairly smoke free. It also has huge floor to ceiling windows which look out at the pool. A nice touch I havent seen anywhere else. The comps process was relatively painless and the pit bosses were tremendously friendly and excited to see us each day. Drink service was standard, but I never found myself looking for a waitress, which to me is excellent service. I will say that the one gripe is the location of the hotel. Its at one end of the strip, and it is a hike to get to the main part of the strip. Having been to Vegas many times, that didnt bother me and when I was at the Bellagio one night I realized just how choked with people the main strip places are, but by the end of the trip I was so over the walk between the Encore and Wynn...You pretty much have to walk through the Wynn to get anywhere. The European pool turns into XS at night, which if you can handle it, is an amazing club. We got a table which worked out well, but I think you can probably get in decently fast by staying at the hotel, and even if you are not into nightclubs, its worth a visit. Its so vast, that you can hang away from crowds, hit the dance floor or even gamble, with relative ease. Also got a cabana at Encore Beach, which if you are into pool parties is a MUST. So much better than any other I have been to, and while packed, the pool never gets gross (see Rehab/Tao Beach). If you have a big group(it holds 12, although the girls next to us had 18), the cabana is amazing and even looks out on the strip and the service was perfection. I will be returning to the Encore in a few months for a wedding.

They claim you can't request a non-smoking room and that it's just whatever they have available so we had to take a smoking room the first night and move the next day to a non-smoking.

The woman I dealt with was pleasant and made good small talk while she did her thing. i bought into the $20 upgrade to a higher floor - but they only had mountain-view rooms available. She promised to contact me the next day when a higher-floor strip view opened up, which would be no additional cost (just the $20 they were already charging me for the upgrade). We also had the dreaded $20 resort fee explained to us, which essentially covers access to the gym, Wifi, and printing of your boarding pass. Sure enough, we had a message waiting for us the next day and we were changed to a room on the 55th floor, strip view. No fuss, no muss. I was really happy with how effortless it was. It was mid-week so it was a bit quieter, but there were still quite a few people strolling around. The only good pool day we had was the first day, as Wednesday and Thursday were cold (and windy). However, there were lots of chairs out on a Tuesday and service was prompt. If you're looking for less crowding, mid-week is definitely a good way to go. We ate dinner at other hotels, which I have covered in my other reviews (Jaleo, Sushi Samba, Mesa Grill, Lavo). Nothing against the restaurants at the Wynn/Encore, but we used those dinners as reasons for getting out and seeing other hotels. We did pick up croissants and coffee one morning at the Lobby Bar at the bottom of the elevators - very good. We also had breakfast one morning at the Terrace Cafe at the Wynn, which was also great. Portions were huge and the 2 of us easily shared an omelette and yogurt/granola. We played a bit - blackjack tables, I played some slots. We didn't really lose very much, but it also didn't seem like there was a lot of 'winning' going on around us. It wasn't too busy, but I guess I expected more ringing from the machines. Regardless, I got a few hours of amusement out of it. My big celebrity sighting - Kelsey Grammer and his new wife! I saw them a couple of times, and played next to them for a bit. It's really close to the mall, where we stocked up on munchies for the room (ABC Stores). The shopping through the Esplanades was jaw-dropping, but it was nice to look at what I'll never be able to afford.... We booked through Expedia, and I had a call from one of their local concierges the week before we left. She mentioned that she could get me access to the clubs, which I took her up on. It would have cost us $50 to get into the Surrender Nightclub on Wednesday, but we got in for free, and through a VIP line - no waiting! Score one for Expedia. If you go through them - make sure you ask about these people as they are local, included in what you already paid, and may be able to provide similar benefits. Surrender was pretty good. No real room to dance (and the area where you could was WAY too packed). So there was just a lot of standing around and gawking outside by the pools. Music was great, it's always fun to people-watch at those places. When we got back upstairs, the club was still going around 3am. I had read about the noise complaints but it was non-existent on the 55th floor. I might have heard faint thumping if I was up against the window but there was nothing that kept me from sleeping (except maybe the snoring on the other side of the bed). Beds were really comfy, room was well-appointed. Housekeeping was thorough. I have never liked in-room coffee makers so the fact that there wasn't one was not an issue. We had a massage one chilly morning, which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Think of it as using the money you would have lost through gambling. The spa facilities are amazing and really helped us to unwind. The heated lounge chairs, steam room, rainshowers and saunas... opulence. I've tried to keep this brief but I can't go on enough about what a great time I had and how much I loved the hotel. I will definitely stay here again, it has everything you need in one giant complex (and everything else is a short walk or cab ride away). We picked it because of the luxury and amenities and were not disappointed. The location didn't matter to us, we've seen the strip before and didn't need to check everything out (just the select restaurants I mentioned).

We called the front desk about three hours ago who informed us that the nightclub closes at 4:30, so we're just waiting for it to end. They said all their rooms are booked, and there was no other room they could move us to. They offered a $200 credit for food as compensation, but the girl was very vague about it and just told me to go ahead and charge it all to my room, and then she'll see about having it taken off when we check out. Uhhhh, very reassuring, right? Trouble is, my husband is here for a conference and now hasn't been able to sleep in two nights. We were supposed to stay one more night, but we just used our sleepless night to change our flight home to a day earlier so we don't have to deal with this again. As long as I'm awake anyway, I might as well review the rest of the hotel... The rooms are nice, but don't feel quite as nice as the room that we stayed at in the Wynn previously. They're bigger in the encore, but somehow feel more cramped. Our room was clean & tidy, so no complaints with housekeeping. Aside from my noise complaint about the nightclub, the soundproofing between rooms also leaves something to be desired. We can hear our neighbors doors open and close, and when I was taking a bath earlier, I could hear our neighbor in their bathroom doing their, uhh, business on the toilet, if you get my drift. Pretty disgusting. We ordered room service while we were here. I told the girl that I have a dairy allergy and just asked her for a mixed green salad with no cheese or dairy, no croutons, no meat... just mixed greens. They sent up a salad alright.. with chicken, cheese, a bunch of bread, etc. Especially disappointing since the Wynn claims to be sensitive to allergens. I had them remove the food, and asked them not to charge me, but I am guessing we'll see it on our final bill. Maybe I can use that suspicious sounding $200 credit to pay for it, ha! The casino is nothing special. I do like that the air filtration is good, so the smoke isn't as obnoxious. But I played their slot machines for some time, and got zilch.. nuthin! Just dumped my money in and that was it. So I'd say to head elsewhere for fun slots. Oh look, it's almost 4:30am... going to wrap up this review in hopes that we can get some sleep soon.

Since the Wynn has renovated their rooms, I would suggest staying there for the larger pool area and closer walk to the main part of the strip.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201c100%\u201d", "Author": "winequaffer", "ReviewID": "UR102483863", "Content": "I can't even say 1 complaint about this hotel.. from the moment we checked in. 15 years we have visited LV... we always heard the Bellagio was 'the' destination... see my review of Bellagio this year...

The room is larger than the Wynn. The design with the semi-seperate sitting area with the swivel TV is a nice touch. It made the room feel very large and very comfortable for 2 people. The room at the Wynn is nice, but this room feels more spacious. I would say the bathrooms appear to be about the same size. The common areas of the hotel are nice as well. The casino is much smaller than the Wynn and you don't get the crowds that the wynn gets so it is a bit quieter. We enjoyed going over to the wynn to gamble then retreating to the quiet of the Encore. We might have lucked out with our neighbors, but I commented to my friend that I could barely hear a sound in our room. There are 2 different sides to the hotels, one facing the XS nightclub. If you are a light sleeper request the one that is not on the XS side facing the strip. You want the moutain view. Just let the front desk know. We used the spa, which is one of the nicest I have visited and the most expensive. I would highly recommend. The gym is included with your $20 a day resort fee.....Great place to stock up on free bottled water....FYI. We visited both Encore pools, the european one with the casino in the center island is a bit more fun. Just keep walking past the first pool, you will see it on the right side. We actually preferred the Wynn pools and returned to that side for one pool day. Overall, I liked the Encore room, but I think I prefer the Wynn facilities and restaurants. I love being able to go back and forth between the Wynn and Encore. You get the best of both worlds. As you should know, the Wynn/Encore is located on the very far north of the strip. It is tough to walk to a ton of places, but I think the hotel makes up for it. Once you leave and see the other hotel options, you will understand.

We wanted to stay in a clean, \"higher end\" hotel and this place delivered. The entire property is beautiful. The rooms are very nice and recently updated (even though the place is still very very new). The pool area is very nice and overall, the service is very solid. We stayed in the regular suites (not the tower suite) portion of the hotel. I liked the fact that all the rooms are the same size and layout. The rooms are good size with floor to ceiling windows which offer nice views. The rooms have a modern design. They have very high ceilings and well placed mirrors to give the feel of more space. The bathrooms are beautiful with a large glass shower and separate, large tub. Lots of marble tile. Bed and linens were of very high quality and the electronic lighting control is slick. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Every staff member I made eye contact with greeted me warmly except for what was noted below. We wanted to see \"O\" at the Bellagio. I called the concierge desk a couple of weeks before my arrival and Brendon scored us some excellent seats at the base price which was very cool. During our stay, he got us some great reservations at Le Cirque on a very busy night. Every time I called, he remembered me and got things lined out for us very quickly. I am sure the other concierge staff is as good but you cant go wrong asking him for assistance. There was a huge convention (140k people) while we were there and we were very appreciative that we could get such great service. Ok.. so why just 4 stars rather than 5? For me, a hotel or resturant will need to hit a home run for me to give them a 5. Encore did well but they did stumble a couple of times. Upon arrival, our check in experience was cold. Fast, efficient, but cold. We knew about the resort fee prior to our arrival (it wasn't included in our package). We were told coldly it was mandatory, however it was either removed from our account later or was never added. We had a conflict with the staff when we wanted to go work out one morning which was uncomfortable. Who wants to argue with a gym attendant at 8 am over a $15 user fee? When it was corrected, it was added back and forward on our account for a mystery amount that needed to be corrected at check out. We also rented a fridge and had it removed the next day. We were charged for 4 nights use. Again, it was corrected upon check out but I felt like I had to explain all the corrections and it literally took 20 mins to get us out of the hotel. Finally, I know this is vegas and I stay in a lot of urban hotels for business so I am a little more used to all the little fees hotels charge you but this property takes it to the extreme. These fees, to me, is more of an annoyance than anything. I am not an expert on hotel pricing but I would rather pay a little more and not have to deal with silly charges. We were charged the following during our stay: Room at a higher floor - $20 per night. When that room had a funny smell, I took it as an opprotunity to change to a room facing the other direction (toward the strip). That upgrade fee kept me at a high floor but added $5 per night to the fee for a total of $25 per night. Really? In room Fridge - $25 per day In room internet - $18 per day (unless you get the resort fee). The internet did not work at the pool or gaming areas. Receiving a package while at the hotel - $15. Yes, just to receive a package plus we had to ask to have it delivered to the room and tipped accordingly (not knowing about the fee). Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and enjoyed the property.

The 1/2 price tickets place is also right across the road.

Upon arrival, check-in went very smoothly and quickly and received a room on the 38th floor facing the Strip to the southwest. The view was spectacular and was better than the same from the Wynn. The room at Encore was large and the bed was extremely comfortable, unlike the Wynn the room is divided into a bedroom area and a sitting area with a flat screen TV that swivels so it can be seen from either side. However the TV blocked the view from the bed to the floor-to ceiling window of the room. Personally I preferred the Wynn floor plan that gave me an unobstructed view. The bathroom was large with separate tub and shower, but once again I preferred the Wynn bathroom that had the toilet in a separate room off the main bathroom. The Encore bathroom did have a couple of problems, such as a loose shower head and the remote for the TV in the bathroom was missing, but these problems were very quickly remedied with a call to the front desk. The casino was nicely lit during the day by natural sunlight and was enjoyable to gamble in (although slightly smokey, but all the casinos are.) The spa was spectacular according to my wife that had the desert stone massage there. Really the only drawback to both Wynn and Encore are they are located on the north end of the strip and its a long trip if you have any activities planned on the mid or south end of the Strip. The staff for the most part were very attentive and helpful, but there were some waitresses at various restaurants and lounges that should have been more attentive, but with as much service personnel that are attached to these mega resorts you will get the mediocre mixed in with the superb.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Room\u201d", "Author": "alexsndiego", "ReviewID": "UR100495402", "Content": "What a great hotel room at the Encore! Everything was so clean and comfortable. We got a really good package for $480 which included: 1) Three Nights 2) Three Buffets for two people 3) Two tickets to Le Reve. The economy must be rough in Las Vegas to offer us such a great deal. We paid the extra $20 per night to be upgraded to the Panorama Suite. Awesome view! The Panorama Suites are on the top 10 floors of the Encore. We had a view to the north which is not as nice as the view to the south which included the strip. Being the on the north side avoids have to hear the noise from the club. I asked the check in agent and they confirmed that if you are on the lower floors and face the strip, you will hear and feel the club. If quiet is important to you, you should politely ask the check in agent to place you facing north especially if you are on the lower floors and desire some quiet at 2 am in the morning. The rooms were really comfortable and clean. The bathroom was amazing. Having a nice bathroom really makes your stay enjoyable. Dual sinks, separate tub and shower, water closet. TV next to the sink. Water pressure in the shower was good. Toiletries were just okay. Felt \"watered\" down. Another victim of the economy? The $20 per day resort fee includes internet service and access to the gym. The gym had really nice NEW equipment with state of the art options to plug in your iPod. Plenty of towels and water. The buffet was just okay. We went for breakfast/lunch and then dinner. The economy has really taken its toll on Las Vegas. This was once the premier buffet on the strip. Not so much anymore. We ended up not using our 3rd buffet meal because the food was boring. We decided it was better to pay for breakfast somewhere rather than subject ourselves to the bland food. We dont gamble so we cannot comment much on the casino and other gaming action. Le Reve was horribly boring. I would NOT pay $150 for that show. Our tickets were included in our package. Go see \"O\" at the Bellagio. I love shows etc but I felt the music was inspirational and the show forgettable. Which brings to the point about the Wynn/Encore vs Bellagio. Steve Wynn was the original mastermind of the Bellagio. Unfortunately, Wynn/Encore does fails to measure up to the Bellagio. The Bellagio Buffet was so much better. \"O\" is much better. The fountain show at the Bellagio is so much better.

The gaming area is lacking in atmosphere but we found that with a lot of places because of the size and choice available. The food is unbelievable and we would thoroughly recommend the breakfast and evening buffet. Small trays ensure the freshest, finest prepared food not found at any other buffet I've been to. And the food matches the price with prime cuts of meet and culinary genres to suit most tastes. The clubs are fantastic, just make sure you get concierge to put you on the guest lists. XS was pretty awesome, definitely check it out on a Monday which is industry night. The pools are chilled out with a great atmosphere. We looked enviably into the beach party pool and wish we had enough $ to have gone there too. Service is subtle but everywhere and very helpful and friendly. Fresh flower displays are also pretty amazing but easily missed in all the glitz and glamour. The only negative is it is quite north on the strip and a good 20 minute / half hour walk to MGM (the centre). That said buses and cabs are everywhere so it's no issue.

The encore cost a little bit more than most but we thought this is one trip that can't be done on a budget! We were greeted by friendly valet staff and an even friendlier check-in lady who offered us a nice little upgrade which worked out about the same as the resort fee ($25 per night) and in return she'd cancel the resort fee and boy was it worth it! The room was amazing, we stayed on the 57th floor and had wonderful views of the strip it was truly breathtaking! The room was immaculate and very big, the bed was super comfy and I loved being able to control the curtains and lights from my bedside table! The t.v in the bathroom was a nice touch and housekeeping did a fantastic job keeping the room nice and tidy during our stay ( don't forget to leave a tip out for housekeeping when you leave) If you want to see just how good these rooms are go onto youtube and search for encore room tour there's plenty of vids on there) The hotel casino was very swish with friendly dealers and valet girls who served you drinks very quickly. The ventilation system was the best, lots of people smoking but you couldn't smell any smoke at all. The cleanliness was top notch, such attention to detail I didn't see one piece of litter, one empty glass or one piece of dirt. To give an example of the lengths they go to we were up early one day and they had a team of people cleaning the leaves of the plants in the lobby!! I had a few concerns after reading another review about people looking down their noses at you as it's a posh hotel with people wandering around in suits and cocktail dresses. Yes there were people dressed smart but I didn't feel out of place in shorts and a baseball cap, not once did I feel looked down upon everyone was just so friendly and accommodating! We didn't eat at the Wynn or Encore as it was a bit pricey for us but the restaurants looked very posh and nice. The shops were the cr\u00e8me de le cr\u00e8me with Luis vuitton, Chanel, Cartier, Dior, Rolex and even a ferrari/maserati dealership next door in the Wynn! Talking of the Wynn, both hotels are linked via a shopping esplanade and the Wynn is a mirror image of the Encore with a bigger casino and a sports book. We loved the hotel and Vegas so much we plan to return later on this year but will stay at the Wynn this time as it's a little closer to getting out onto the strip. All in all it was the best holiday of our lives and the best hotel we've ever stayed in. If you can afford it BOOK IT! You will not be disappointed and if you can't quite afford it then save a bit longer it's worth every penny! The only bad thing about the Encore is that we've ruined it for ourselves as now we can no longer stay anywhere else as it just won't compare and we went in every single hotel on the strip and downtown. Sure, some of the new resorts are very nice (in particular the Aria, Venetian, Cosmopolitan and palazzo) but they just haven't got that final piece of excellence and attention to detail you find and the Encore and Wynn Tips for Vegas... 1 - Take plenty of moisturiser and more importantly lip balm, yes you heard right, I'm a guy and I used tons of this stuff, the air con in each hotel and then the warn air outside dries you out big time! 2 - Drink plenty of water even if you're not thirsty 3 - Don't use taxis to get about, there are so many sets of traffic lights on the strip the traffic moves very slow. A taxi ride from the airport should be $15-$20 + tip (10%-20%) A taxi from the stratosphere to treasure island will be around $12. To get around take the express bus or the deuce. Walk through the shopping esplanade into the Wynn and then out of the Wynn and down onto the strip. Turn left and 100yds up is the bus stop for heading down town. If you want to go south up the strip which you'll want to most days then cross over the road and the stop is in front of the fashion show mall near starbucks. The Deuce double decker bus stops at every hotel on the strip where as the express only stops 2 or 3 times on the strip. The express is a lot better and quicker it is a single decker 'bendy bus'. Both buses use the same tickets, its $5 for one trip, $7 for a 24hr pass or there's a 7 day pass which I think is $20 you buy your tickets at the bus stops from a machine. If you get on the deuce you must enter through the front door and swipe your ticket. If you use the express you can get on at any door and only have to show your ticket if an inspector is on the bus or if one gets on at one of the stops which they almost always do! 4 - If the food at the Encore is too pricey then there is a food court on the top floor of the fashion show mall across the road with the usual suspects, macdonalds, subway etc You can also find food courts at a lot of the hotels like montecarlo and flamingos. A good cheap buffet can be found at monte carlo, it's $20 per person for dinner, lunch and breakfast are only $15 bargain! 5 - Shopping, if you love to shop then there are 3 good places you need to go....Las Vegas shopping outlet centre, just get on an express or deuce heading south up the strip it is the penultimate stop on the bus before it turns round and comes back down the strip. Tons of cheap shops there including a levis factory shop and nike factory shop. Next is the town centre square it think it was called, again lots of shops it's the stop before the Las Vegas shopping outlet centre, get off after Mandalay bay. The last place is the premium shopping outlet, lots more discount stores here, it can be found heading northbound and is the last stop on the bus just after freemont street. The last tip is duty free, buy it at the airport when you leave! I paid $50+tax for 200 Marlboro on the strip only to find they are $36+tax at the airport! Think that's about it, if you haven't been to Vegas you'll soon become addicted like we have there is so much to see and do it's a non stop party town! Once you've checked into the Encore and had a look at the other hotels you'll soon realise you've picked the best hotel on the strip it really is THAT good!", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cSpacious rooms but we had issues you won't expect at a luxury hotel.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR99705718", "Content": "Our room on the 17th floor was spacious and clean.

This was a splurge and I probably would not stay there again unless I was able to get the room at a significant discount. However, I don't go to Vegas much and do not know how the value of this hotel compares with other hotels on the strip.

Even after reading some very negative reviews - especially with references to terrible service - I was a little nervous but willing to give Encore a chance especially for the price. The positive experience started when I drove up to the entrance and the staff checked my luggage and said to call when I got to my room. The good things continued when I arrived at the front desk and found no line - at about 4 PM on a Tuesday. I asked about using the minibar for some medication and was offered a separate frig for no extra cost. The bellman who delivered my bags - within about 5 minutes of my call - gave me instructions on how everything in the room worked - drapes, lights, etc. Which was a good thing since there weren't any written instructions in the room. The room was comfortable and nicely furnished. I liked having a separate sitting area. I was offered a room with a panoramic view for $20 more - glad I didn't take them up on that offer. I had a nice view of the strip, the pool, and golf course from my south facing room on the 15th floor. Bottom line I had a great stay at a great price. I do think the $20 daily resort fee was excessive but it did include wifi in the room and some other not very useful services. Oh well, so I was paying $139 for the room not $119.

The Bad: If you like to go to sleep early you are likely going to be annoyed by the constant nightclub noise. You can hear it in the rooms up to 4am.

So you can walk over (although it's sort of a long walk) and enjoy the shopping (all in a corridor which attaches the Encore to the Wynn) and \"big\" casino at the Wynn. The rooms were gorgeous -- very spacious. They were all suites with separate bedroom and seating areas. Large bathrooms. The pricing was reasonable, although certainly not cheap compared to the myriad of less expensive options in Vegas.

Service at this hotel is top-notch. I experienced quite a bit of personal drama during my trip and I deferred to some of the staff for some help. They went above and beyond the call of duty. Very friendly people work here. Some of my highlights from my stay at the hotel including my manicure service at the spa. Attentive and well-trained staff helped put my mind at ease while I relaxed during the treatment. Food at the hotel is very tasty. There are many different restaurants to choose from so you don't have to go to the same place everyday. Typically I would go down to the restaurant near the elevators for breakfast. Sorry, I don't recall what the name is. The shopping is luxurious- retail therapy at its finest. If you are a shoe lover like I am, be sure to check out the Manolo Blahnik boutique in the Wynn. I think I might have bought too many pairs of shoes! The hotel doesn't have that stinky casino (re: smoky) smell. The carpets are regularly cleaned so no need to worry about having a hard time breathing in the casino. If you like the nightlife, XS is one of the hottest clubs right now. It's located right in the Encore so be sure to check it out if that is your scene. For any of your event needs go to the concierge desk. I got 2nd row, center tickets to see Blue Man Group. The woman at the desk was extremely accommodating and helped me decide what to do with my night. My room was very comfy. The design reminded me of a posh loft with a bedroom and sitting room area. The bathroom was well-kept and there are no complaints in that area. Now for the negative: the Encore is at the end of the Strip. You can obviously take a cab wherever you want to go but if you are hoping to walk everywhere, expect to walk at least 15 minutes to get to the most populated parts of the Strip. For me this wasn't a big deal but I could see why this is a drawback for some. Note: there is no coffeemaker in the room and the mini-fridge is stocked with mini-bar items and no room for your own goods. Don't pick up with and inspect the mini-bar stuff- you will be charged for anything that is lifted off the sensor for more than maybe 30 seconds. The Encore is a good option if you want to be on the Strip and have the action close by, but not right in your face.

The rooms at the Encore are very nice. There are lots of extra touches even most nice hotels don't have--like a flatscreen TV and scale in the huge bathroom (this was a \"Deluxe Suite\"). They're also relatively quiet beyond people making noise in the hallway. The bed is great, the linens and toiletries are great, and housekeeping does a good job. My one gripe about the room is the safe is about 3\" deep and impossible to put even a small laptop in. Le Reve, in the Wynn theater, is an above average show. It's probably most similar to the Cirque show \"O\" and is well done. The fitness center is fairly well equipped for a hotel, very clean and wasn't crowded. More good news is this hotel doesn't really have some cheesy theme like many. It's not trying to be something else. So that's nice. There are butterflies everywhere, however. Then there's the bad news. Check in took over a half hour--the longest by far I've ever spent at a strip hotel. There were lots of empty positions at the reception counter but apparently no employees to staff them. The hotel is also designed for profit rather than ease of getting around. For example, you pretty much have to walk through or by the casino to get much of anywhere. And, inexplicably, they bury the room elevators *behind* a cafe and force you to walk all the way around 3 sides of the cafe just to get to your room. It's stupid and annoying. There's more bad news depending on your tastes, how you want to spend your time in Vegas, your budget, and perhaps your age. For being a relatively new hotel, the Encore and Wynn are seriously old school in some ways. They have the same ugly gold oval signs everywhere that you see in hotels that are 20+ years old. The Encore uses the same old-school layout of putting most of the restaurants around the main casino instead of off by themselves. It would appear Steve Wynn is rather set in some of his ways. If you like his older properties, you'll feel right at home here. And speaking of Steve Wynn he's everywhere. You call for reservations and listen to him on hold. You turn on the TV and he starts talking to you. His name is plastered all over the hotel, all over billboards, and on ads throughout Vegas. I've never met the man but apparently he likes to indulge his ego and he never stops selling. If you don't plan on leaving the hotel much, it's not an issue, but the Encore/Wynn is located towards the north end of the strip. There's very little anyone staying at the Encore would want to visit north of the hotel--a huge piece of land under construction, some small seedy strip malls, and further north, the tired Circus Circus and Stratosphere. Most of the action is south of the Encore/Wynn. So, whether you're walking, driving, or taking a cab, it can take a long time to get to say City Center (home of the new Aria hotel). Traffic on the strip is horrible much of the day and night and it can be a 30+ minute cab ride from say the Luxor to the Encore. So if you plan to check out other things on the strip you might want to be more centrally located. Almost everything in the Encore/Wynn is seriously overpriced. Just a very basic light breakfast with coffee will easily set you back $25 or $30 per person with tax and tip. A beer can be $8. Unlike many strip hotels, there are very few reasonably priced places here. So, depending on your budget, you may find yourself wanting to leave just not to get ripped off eating your meals. Beware they also charge a daily \"Resort Fee\" on top of your room/package rate. But at least it includes free internet and access to the fitness center (gym). Finally, there's a certain \"attitude\" among many of the guests and even some of the staff towards catering to the wealthy. This place is a good fit for those who wear $1000+ outfits.

We found the other hotels to be somewhat overcrowded, frenzied, gaudy and loud. Even the casino areas at Encore and Wynn are uncrowded and less noisy. As stated earlier, Encore IS pricey ($300 per night or more). Now, if those rates are too high for you, check out RUMOR BOUTIQUE HOTEL (directly across from the Hard Rock Hotel). Rumor is beautiful and on par, comfort wise, to Encore. It's king-sized beds are plushy and delicious to sleep in. We stayed there for 1 night and LOVED it! It's ultra sleek and modern (no casino on premise) but 24hr outside pool (beautiful) and jacuzzi, on premise restaurant, bar and in-house parties. We had a gorgeous suite with king bed, jacuzzi tub, balcony overlooking the pool courtyard and living room, for $140 per night. They also provide free adult channel TV. We would DEFINITELY stay again at either of (or both) of these hotels again.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "WannaBNomad", "ReviewID": "UR93920067", "Content": "The Encore Hotel, part of the Wynn is a GREAT place to stay. Our original room was 2 queen beds, strip view, on the 19th floor (1924). The front desk agent had warned us that the nightclub might keep us awake if we were light sleepers. We didn't think it would be a problem and took the room anyway. Room 1924, the room we were given, is the room closest to the elevator. Even though it was a non-smoking floor the room smelled funny. My friend and I couldn't decide if it was a smoke smell or a burnt toast smell, but either way, not good. The room size for 2Q layout is the same as the 1K layout with the exception of the dividing wall. So essentially, all the furniture in the 2Q room is pushed up against one wall. There is a huge open space on the TV side of the room. I feel like the Queen room is a definite step down from the King room. It's almost like they knew they needed it, but didn't want to spend one second thinking about it. Go for the King room if at all possible. The view from the 19th floor wasn't that great. All I remember was the lights of the McDonald's sign. Because of the smell and everything else, we decided to wait for the bellman and move to the 15th floor. Our room, #1547 was at the end of the hallway, just down from the requisite ice machine. We never heard or saw anyone use the ice machine, so our proximity wasn't an issue. Our new view was the \"mountain view.\" Just a few more hotels and a big church. Not too bad though. I didn't feel like we missed out on the view at all. Our room didn't smell which was more important to us. Other people have mentioned the sensor-based accounting system for the fridge. You can pick an item up to look at it, but after 60 seconds you'll be charged for it. No big deal if you know about it. Our check-in guy was really good and told us about it. Our room, although on the other side of the building, did have some noise. We heard the people from the floor above or below us through the ventilation system. It wasn't really loud, just tinny sounding. Next to the right side of the bed is the controller for the lights and drapes. There are small icons on each side of the button, so while you can just push the button, you may not get the desired outcome. For instance, if you're going to open the blinds, look for the button that looks like the open elevator door button. This is REALLY important for the lights. One wrong push of the button and your partner will be rudely awakened. The All Off button is really nice, when you go to bed, but pushing this button and then walking to the door can be hazardous to your health! If you're looking for plugs to recharge your phone, plug in the computer, etc. There aren't many. On at least one lamp there is a plug on the base of the bed-side lamps. The only other easily accessible plug is near the desk. We had to move the sofa to get to the plug behind it. Strangely, there is a fax machine in the room. The bathrooms are great, just like other luxury hotels in Vegas. The lighting is great! Some other hotels are too dark, this one was just right! It even had a night light! Housekeeping was varied. On one hand, they were great. We called down for a lint roller and they were packaged so nicely when they were delivered we had to call and see if we were charged for them! When they were delivered, we were out, so they left them on the bar. Afterwards, they called to make sure they were satisfactory. On the other hand, we used the iron and left it on the floor near the windows. They never put it away, which leads me to believe they never went to that side of the room. It sat there for 3 days, until we put it away. Now for the public areas: Overall the Encore is more modern than the Wynn. The primarily red color scheme is bright and cheery. The colorful butterflies are Asian inspired and not child-like at all. In short, inviting while still being elegant. The casino is nice, of course. It's not smoky, like other hotels. Minimums are higher than some places - what else would you expect? Thursday night we got in late and ate at Stratta (see my review for that). We ate at the buffet Sunday morning (I'll do a fully review at some point), but it was just good, not great. It had an amazing array of desserts. The sundries store is great and has most of what you need. I specifically needed things to keep me from continually stepping out of my shoes. They have those! I needed hair mousse - they had that too, but only in a gigantic bottle - they did have hair gel in a small bottle though. My only issue was that none of the sodas had a price on them. If you're staying in the hotel you get VIP access to the nightclubs - and the lines get really really long. I can't imagine any club that is that important to get into! Checkout lines get a bit long. Either grab yourself a champagne at the lobby bar, like I did, or do the express checkout!", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cMy review will not do it justice, stunning hotel/resort.\u201d", "Author": "Pay74", "ReviewID": "UR93885511", "Content": "Ok where do I begin on this one? Firstly after reading the reviews on the Encore on here with most being favourable we booked up for 11 nights back in March to arrive in November, we were slightly dubious over a fair amount of reviews that mentioned at checkout they have cards swiped for large depositis and also were offered room upgrades for about $20. We never got any of that which was good as it was a 3rd party type booking in fact this we agreed was best check in we have ever had, the girl on reception was very helpful. On check in we were given our room key-cards which double up us your bonus cards for casino play (more on this later) we were also delighted to be given $75 resort credit which basically meant we got a nice meal one night. Room is top class, ours faced to north strip but is still a great view, bed, bathroom and TV all excellent the room is perhaps best I have stayed in. One thing is the mini bar which is weighted so if you pick up an item you have 60secs to put it back or you will be charged, the room should come with its own fridge and tea/coffee making facilities, that is only dissapointing room aspect. We played the 1c machines not spending a lot but we earned 2 free buffets, a meal in the society caf\u00e9 and $10 with a water bottle. Once you have checked in and go out for first time to to Red card desk and ask about the benefits of the card (room key). You will not be let down by this stunning hotel, when we go back to Vegas we probably will try another Hotel maybe one at City Centre but that is purely to stay in another nice hotel. I would stay at Encore again in a heartbeat. As usual drinks are free at the machines and are served very quickly with superb service, in the bars you will pay about $14 for a cocktail and $6 or $7 for a bottle of beer, all the bars are nice and offer a different atmosphere in each. I will say maybe to snack in the Hotel it\u2019s a bit expensive but across the road is the Fashion show mall which has a food court with all the major players inside, the location of the Encore is heading to the North of the strip it\u2019s as far North as we would stay, I would say 10-15 min walk to Mirage area but that\u2019s from room, bare in mind 5 mins will be walking through the Wynn itself. Depending on how busy the streets are its about 30mins to City centre area. Well I hope this review helps your decision and enjoy Vegas.

From our arrival we knew we had picked a great hotel - the decor was fun and upbeat, with giant butterflies and other motifs decorating the walls and floor. The casino is right near the check in area, and all done up in red - looks amazing. We had a Panoramic Suite King room which was beautiful. Marble floors; ceiling to floor windows; large bathroom with bath, shower and his&her sinks; king size bed; tv's; separate sitting area with lounge and writing desk; and a mini fridge. Decor was stylish - the only complaint I have about the room was that the windows were streaky. Room was a very big size too. The pool area of the hotel is AMAZING. There are two pools at Encore, and guests can also go to the Wynn pool areas. One of the pools at Encore is a topless pool (optional of course) and surrounds a huge bar. Waitresses come and take your drink order and music plays at all times. Cabanas can be hired, but there are plenty of lounges and towels all provided. Restaurants at the hotel were also amazing, and had several different ones to choose from. The shops were stunning, with Chanel, Prada etc being the main line up.

But not to worry, there is more than enough things going on within Wynn/Encore to keep you occupied! You're a short walk to the other nearer casinos like Treasure Island and Venetian. You CAN walk further to Bellagio, MGM etc. but it'll take a while (half an hour?) and the scorching hot Vegas sun isn't really conducive to walking much. Oh, there's a Hertz (or Avis?) car rental right in the hotel building itself, so that's very convenient if you're renting a car! ROOMS: The rooms are really spacious and plushly decorated. Big bathroom. In the room we were in, the lounge/living area was separated from the bedroom area by a counter where the TV sat. The TV was on a swivel so you could watch it in bed or turn it around if you were in the living room. It's a very very comfortable room to just relax in. But be sure to get a room on the higher floors as the nightclub is REALLY REALLY LOUD and goes on til the wee hours of the morning. No problem if you're a heavy sleeper like me, but my husband is not and couldn't fall asleep at all. A couple other gripes: 1) There were potato chip crumbs in one of the drawers!!! The cleaners overlooked that! Not acceptable for a 5 diamond hotel. 2) No bedroom slippers?? I know hotels are cutting costs, but like I said, this is a 5 diamond hotel! Bedroom slippers are a basic amenity. 3) No complimentary water and ice cubes. We've stayed in many many 5 star resorts around the world and there is ALWAYS complimentary water and ice cubes. The only places that don't have them are hotels less than a 4 star. These are not big problems at all... but when you're talking about 5 star/diamond hotels, it is precisely these small things that make the difference. SERVICE: Staff are nice and friendly, service is good but nothing terribly memorable. Compared to the Mandarin Oriental (on the other side of the Strip), it kinda falls short. You can read my review on the Mandarin's exceptional, personalized service (to the point where the doorman remembers your name and remembers you if you've stayed at there before!) FOOD: Lots of options within the hotel - reasonable and high end too. Didn't try too many restaurants but the Chinese restaurant was really good! Nice bars and cafes around the place where you can lounge and have an afternoon drink. AMBIANCE: I LOVE THE AMBIANCE!!!!! It is almost fantastical in a very elegant sort of way with its butterfly decor, colorful indoor garden at the Wynn lobby, cafes decorated with colorful parasols hanging from the ceiling!!! It is also very bright as there's a lot of natural lighting coming in from the windows and skylights - gives the place a cheery mood.

We booked a resort king suite both times. We paid more this time as had an incredible offer of $100/night on our first visit with free LeReve tickets and no resort fee. This time we paid $129/night and had to pay a $20/night resort fee (which includes in-room internet). Even with the additional cost, we were still more than happy with our visit there. We find the hotel to be very conveniently located with the Fashion Show Mall right across the street from the Wynn (Wynn and Encore are connected) and we were able to walk everywhere except for once we took The Deuce because we were going further down the Strip than we wanted to walk. It is a pretty pricey hotel overall. The restaurants are especially expensive, but the food, service and ambience can go a long way towards making up for the extra cost. The Wynn Hotels are definitely way above most of the other hotels in Vegas and we've been in most of them and stayed in quite a few of them. The Encore casino is bright, light and fresh - so much different than many of the other dark, smokey and dated casinos in Vegas. I can't really think of nearly anything negative to say about this hotel except I wish it were cheaper! We paid the $129/night with an offer that my husband got through an email. All the other online hotel booking sites were charging much more for this room. $129 plus the $20 resort fee and taxes is about our high-end price point for a per night stay. It's a great hotel.

I cannot say it is the best hotel on the strip as I have not stayed in all the hotels on the strip. However, I can say Encore surpasses hotels like Bellagio. The hotel rooms at Encore are spacious with its suites and a very good deal (depending on what offer you get) for a strip hotel. It is one of the newer hotels so you get the feel of cleaniness. Unlike Bellagio, the rooms are far from cookie cutter. The rooms have a modern touch with windows from floor to ceiling for a great view of the strip or downtown. Mirrors are all over the walls to give the room a bigger feel visually. Encore does get a very good rating and not an excellent rating though. As far as excellent, the standard bearer are Four Season Hotels in Hawaii. Unfortunately, Encore cannot compare to the service level of the Four Seasons Hotels in Hawaii. It is definitely on par with the Four Seasons Hotels in Hawaii when it comes to rooms. However, it falls far short in service. While the self-parking lot enables to you to make a short trek past the check-in and to your elevator (unlike most hotels in Vegas like Bellagio where you have to make the long trek across the casino to get to the elevator), the valet and bell hop service is not up to the service level and excellence of Four Seasons. We also ordered room service. While the service was quick, the level of friendliness is not up to par with the Four Seasons. It may be because its Las Vegas, but the hotels in Vegas will nickel and dime you for everything, while the Four Seasons in Hawaii will make the extras part of your stay with no nickeling and diming. While this is more the culture of Las Vegas, it does reflect the service aspect. The other drawback is the location of the hotel. The hotel is located at the end of the main strip. As a result, it is a far walk to other major strip hotels and can be an issue. With that said, Encore is definitely at the top of the list when it comes to hotels in Las Vegas. I would definitely recommend staying at Encore when in Las Vegas. However, to earn the highest rating in my book means meeting or exceeding in not just rooms and cleaniness but also in service.

Dont know what is so resort like in a casino. Got in around 4 PM and checked in. Fortunately this was not too long. We got to our room on 36th floor. The room was a King bed room with a sitting area and a swiveling TV. The internet speed was faast. The bathroom was also good size. There was no way to get hot water for tea in the room; no coffee marker nothing. So we called and asked for a hot water kettle. Guess what!! Its 10 bucks to rent one!! Encore; why are you nickel and diming customers when you are charging them 250 bucks a night!! This is the single one reason why I would never stay with them again; the attitude of trying to get a bit more money on small things. The bed was really uncomfortable. I just could not get a good nights sleep. Its too soft, at least did not suit me. I had expected that Encore would mean high level of service. This was really not the case. There was almost no service of any kind. You are one among the many out there. We were supposed to stay for 5 days but decided to check out after the 2nd night. I normally stay at MGM Signature and I moved there. It is a world of a change. You are person not a number. Service and high quality service exists there. And it was half price on a weekday as compared to Encore. My recommendation is that unless you are going to spend the big bucks and stay at one of the high priced suites dont expect to see much service. If your budget is sub 200 per night just quietly book at the MGM Signature. Its cheaper and much better even though Encore has spent literally billions on the hotel. I just wished they would have spent a bit more on the human factor. That would have made the premium worth it. I would not suggest it unless you want to spend a lot of money at the high suites.

Let me start by saying I did everything in my power to do as little as possible and rarely even left the Wynn/Encore premises. This gave me an opportunity to really enjoy the hotel and use most of the services. We were able to upgrade to the panoramic suite--WOW what an impressive room. Beautiful decor, comfy bed, great bath amennities, I could go on and on. From the check in to the room to the service everything was top notch. For example--we had reservations at Alex and a spa treatment booked before check in. During the check in process everything was confirmed and some helpful hints on timing were relayed. Thank you for not making me track down this information on my own. Every single interaction with hotel employees was pleasant-with big hellos and a feeling of really being welcome. A special thanks to the man working in the walkway between Wynn and Encore early on Xmas morning--your good cheer was inspiring! We were also lucky enough to enjoy various restaurants during our stay. We ate at the deli in the Wynn--good sandwiches and soups. Cocktails at Parasol Up and Down. Went to Red 8 for dim sum, headed to SW for deserts and coffees, sushi at Okada, and of course the Xmas dinner highlight was Alex. Every single meal was a perfect presentation of great food, wine, and service. My only complaint would be the coffee bars i the morning--just not a great latte to be found. All in all I would highly recommend staying at the Encore--we will return.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prescott, AZ", "Title": "\u201cBest on the Strip\u201d", "Author": "GJGPrescott", "ReviewID": "UR91585100", "Content": "Beautiful standard king room with large, separate living area.

The total cost was about $450, which included the $20 per day resort fee. Two tickets to Le Reve was included (this is the BEST show I have ever seen, highly recommend!). The Wynn Encore is connected to the Wynn, but it is totally separate as far as check in. The valet is free and very efficient, as was the check-in. My non-strip view room was spectacular and if you don't opt for strip view, you will get a room on a higher floor. My room was on 51st floor and had great view of the north strip and mountains beyond. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and definitely five star all the way. The Resort King room was beautiful and really the WOW factor hits you as soon as you open the door to the your room. I love the comfy Wynn Dream king bed and Sharp 42\" swivel flat panel tv between the sleeping area and the sitting area. I like the controls on the nightstand for the lights and the draperies! There is floor to ceiling glass windows and very dramatic views. Nice lounge seating and desk (and fax machine). Large closet and in room safe. Pay per view movies, but no DVD player available. The thing I didn't like was the mini bar had a touch sensor, so you could not remove items and use as refrigerator. Luckily, the ice bin was just down the hall. I also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room. Wired and wireless internet in the room and local/domestic long distance phone calls are included in the resort fee. The marble bathroom has separate shower, tub and toilet and TV near the sink. The towels were very scratchy and I guess that's just minor. I liked the robe and if you call, they will bring you slippers. The toiletries were good size and smelled good, there's a bathroom scale and nice makeup mirror. The housekeeping could use some improvement, as I found hair near the tub, toothpaste in the sink and the glasses were dirty. The bell service was excellent and Paul brought ice when he delivered the luggage. Get a map of the property at check in, it's very helpful to navigate your way to restaurants, shops, etc. I also got $25 slot credit, but it was very difficult to figure out the Red Card and how the machines worked, etc. You can call ahead to valet to have your car waiting for you downstairs and they will also print out your boarding pass for you. The TV will also give you your daily account balance and there is express check out. The casual dining options are very good and I love The Drugstore Cafe. Good salads(Southwest Shrimp Salad) and soup (Southwest Tortilla Soup). Open 24/7 too. There is a very handy sundries store open 24/7 near the hotel elevators, books, magazines, snacks, drinks, etc. Obviously, there is room service should you want that. The Fitness Center usage is included in the resort fee and is adjacent to the spa. For $40, you can get a day pass to use the spa facilities. The lounge area at the spa reception is free and a beautiful place to hang out. There's also a nice store there. Shopping is just on the first floor and Wynn Esplanade some of the stores include Manolo Blahnik, Chanel, Dior, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Graff. If you want to head across the street, you have the Fashion Show Mall with Macys, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdales, Zara and others. Plus, there are good restaurants and ABC store is handy for drinks, snacks, etc. Lots of restaurants, nightclubs (Blush, Tryst and XS), bars and swimming pools, golf course on the property. The Lake of Dreams is also a highlight.

The remote control for the TV was MIA and housekeeping were up with a replacement on a silver platter within 10 minutes! I love Vegas but sometimes the car parks are miles from the rooms and we live to shop so valet is usually the only option. Encore is the exception to this rule with it very easy to find a parking space less than a 2 minute walk from the elevator to your room. We got a large box 20lb delivered ahead of the stay and the business centre sent an email confirming delivery and it was delivered into our room very quickly. This aspect was great as we had ignorantly just addressed it to Wynn business center and not the encore one, assuming it was one of the same. The room was amazing. However, we seemed to have a slightly faulty privacy button by the bed. Housekeeping was quite loud during the day also. They were very good though when we had to head back to the room as we forgot money in the safe. They had literally just seen us leave a couple of minutes previously but before getting back in the room checked the room key. Gambled a few hours each day in the casino. Cocktail service was great. All communal areas were gorgeous. Would've been good if the Wynn buffet opened earlier than 8. We needed it after early morning drinking and had to wait around. we also ate at Pizza Place and the deli in the Wynn Casino. Le Reve is great and I hate shows!

Our bed was comfy. Our bathroom was large, clean and bright, with modern finishes. My fiance loved the shampoo, lotion and other products in the room. Like the room, the overall resort is contemporary, clean and strikes a balance Vegas excess and comfortable luxury. The casino air filtration system is remarkable. Non-smoking gamblers will appreciate that technology. We were slighly disappointed by the pool environment. Overall, the pools are nice, but we prefer a deeper pool that facilitates moderate swimming. The Encore pools are basically shallow wading pools. We both enjoyed the pool music, although the house beats do not make for the most \"relaxing\" pool experience. (Despite our pool experience, I'm still giving the Encore five stars because the room vastly exceeded my expecations.)

From the smile of the valet as he opened our car door to the Concierge printing our boarding passes for our flight home, the Encore has perfected Service. Every employee we encountered - housekeeping, dealers, reception, valet, pit bosses, shop staff, everyone - was polite, helpful, and interested in doing whatever necessary to assit you and make your stay the best possible. Add to the fact it's design is elegant, spacous, colorful (esp if you like red) and immaculate, Steve Wynn has outdone himself. The rooms are large, well-appointed, comfortable with the most amazing views thru the floor-to-ceiling glass wall overlooking Vegas. In fact, we had initially booked a suite at the Venetian but seeing the pics of the Encore vista convinced us to change. Being able to operate all the lights in the suite from the bed was a nice touch. The shops are at the top end of style (and price) but we did find some reasonable items. The gambling crew was helpful and fun - the dealers were friendly and patient. My wife played Blackjack for the first time and her dealer, Nina (?), warned her against sucker-bets and when to hit and stay. My wife walked away happy and with more than double her original stake! The restaurants are beyond compare (see our review of Bartolottas and Society Cafe) and room service was perfect. Not much into the club scene, but from the size and the look of the people who were, it's THE place to be. The downside(s) - well, you do pay a higher price for these perks but we felt the extra efforts and great attitudes of the staff more than compensated for the higher cost compared to other resorts. We visited most the big resorts during our stay (Ceasars, MGM, Mirage, Venetian, etc) and found only the Bellagio's staff comparable. The other (possible) turn-off may be the location at the 'end' of the Strip. But, to us, that was more a perk than a strike. Overall, great stay, great service, great experience.

Friendly valet and bell staff which contributed to a wonderful first/last impression of resort. Hotel interior bathed in red...imagine a red can of paint that exploded. Decor in common areas are visually stunning, including red chrysanthemum pieces and butterfly artwork which adorn the walls. Red theme extends throughout all areas including the casino, Encore Esplanade, ending at the Wynn Theatre. Check-in was fairly brisk, although there is no demarcation to denote where to form a line...everyone just kind of stood in a mob waiting a check-in desk to open. It was okay though, because there was just a few of us in line around 4:30pm. I can't imagine what it would be like during busier periods. Stay on 63rd floor in a Resort King Suite. Rooms are large compared to your typical hotel room. The Wynn beds are fantastic with luxe linens and very comfy pillows. Wall partition that holds a flat screen television swivels so that it can be viewed from the bedroom or the living room. Lighting is excellent throughout the room. Don't touch the mini-bar and snack tray unless you want to be charged. It has that sensor-thingee that will detect and charge you if you move them. Living room has a large couch, desk with fax and internet hookups (fee for usage of course). Automatic drapery with floor-to-ceiling windows. Lights, drapery, and privacy button can be adjusted from a panel on the bedside stand. Ample closet space with safe (not large enough to hold a laptop). Mirrored walls everywhere in room...floor-to-ceiling along one entire bedroom wall and one entire living room wall. Also mirrors in hallway. Kinda creepy being alone with all those mirrors and seeing my reflection everywhere I went in the room, but I got used to it after a while. Bathroom also large with a separate shower, tub, and toilet room. Stayed at Palazzo before and toilet room was too dark. Toilet room here had ample lighting (wall lamp above toilet). Double vanity sinks with lighted mirror. Small television in wall of bathroom. Shower had a bench which is convenient, and showerhead included a handheld nozzle. Adequate water pressure and water temperature. 2 logo robes hanging in corner of bathroom. Lemongrass citrus Desert Bambu amenities (generously sized). Also available are individually packaged Q-tips, shoe polish, buff cloth, shower cap, and I think I saw a nail file too. 4 sets of Wynn-branded available for use. Scale was helpful for keeping track of my suitcase so that I don't exceed the allowed airline weight restriction! Hair dryer also available. Only issue I encountered was that the safe in my room was locked upon check-in, requiring a call to Housekeeping who sent hotel security to my room to reset it. Otherwise, room stay was great. Beautiful, intimate casino, much smaller than Wynn's. Casino quiet over the 3 nites I stayed there (Mon-Thurs). I appreciated it though, because I do not care for a loud, party-like casino with drunk, obnoxious people everywhere. Casino atmosphere noticably more subdued and classy than others. Wynn casino was much more active. I did not have much luck in the casino here...better luck at Wynn. Unfortunately, I did not go to the Spa or dine at the restaurants at Encore. I ate at the Wynn Buffet due to the fact that for the price, I could sample wide variety of dishes. Overall, I enjoyed the accomodations at Encore. I enjoy a luxury vacation experience and certainly Encore did not disappoint. The resort is visually spectacular, paying close attention to detail. Staff that I encountered were courteous. Only downfall is that Encore is at the North end of the main Strip which is not that convenient if you like to casino hop. I had a good experience and don't mind staying here again.

I received an invitation in November and took them up on it, getting a good rate ($169/night average). When I arrived, at about 4PM on a Saturday (and this is the slow season between Thanksgiving and New Years, whee all sorts of deals are available,and Vegas is hurting for vsiitors), I was told a room wasn't yet available. At 4PM? They asked me if I would like to receive a call or if I would like to wait in the lobby until a room was available. My response was that it is 4PM, and this is a huge hotel, during a slow season, and what I would like would be a room now (by the way, as I was standing there, I saw 4 other parties being given rooms). A manager came over, and after 10 minutes of complex typing into their system, they found me a room. It was a very nice room with a great view of The Strip (which is the type of room I always get there). It was obvious to me that they were trying to find a crummyroom to utme in, and made me feel like a second class citizen. Then they told me about the $20 daily \"resort fee\", which isn't mentioned on their site until you buy the room. The hotel is nice, and so are the rooms.

Some stays were up to two weeks duration. For comparison I've also stayed at the brand new Aria, Four Seaons and Bellagio and the Palazzo. Encore is superior to all of these hotels. 1.) Encore standard rooms are the best on the Strip. They are huge - about 700 square feet. Well decorated, quiet and very comfortably furnished stylish attractive rooms. 2.) Encore spa is the best on the Strip. Great masage therapists. Gorgeous spa. Amazing facility. I'm a spa junkie and this one is world class! 3.) Encore gym is large and well appointed by hotel standards. Has everything most of us will need unless you're a serious hammerhead bodybuilder. 4.) Room service is quick by Strip hotel standards. Food quality is excellent! 5.) Dining venues are all excellent and too many to mention! The Encore has excellent service overall. The decor and \"feel\" of the property are very special. When they do make a mistake they'll quickly admit it and rectify the problem. Don't expect Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons style service at the Encore because this type of service doesn't exist on the Strip. But it's as close to it as I've experienced on the Strip. The only single drawback - and this is a minor one - is the location. Bellagio is Center Strip and is much more conveniently located to all of the other properties on the Strip.

At check out I was offered $100 off my entire stay and it was like pulling teeth just to get that. While I would not hesitate to stay here again they really need to correct these service issues. As far as the casino - every dealer I met while playing Blackjack complained about Steve Wynn and the fact that he took 40% of their tips and that once City Center fully opens they will all be leaving to work there - I understand their frustration but it did not make for a lot of fun while I was playing to hear constant complaining about working conditions - I was hesitant to tip them since they would only be getting 60% of that tip anyways.

We had a great view overlooking both the Wynn golf course and the strip. They have a great fitness center. The restaurants are fantastic. We ate breakfast at the Terrace Cafe every morning. They have a great Maine Lobster egss benedict. For Vegas, the prices are very reasonable. For dinner, we ate at SW Steakhouse, Okada, and Alex. All three were very good.

Check-in was a breeze and the gal at the front desk even gave us a couple different locations of rooms based on the view. We chose to look over the golf course and out across the valley. We don't spend a tremendous amount of time in a hotel room, especially in Vegas. They are as well appointed as any 5 star hotel you will find worldwide, complete with electric shades and draperies. The towels and linens are sumptuous. There were no problems whatsoever with our stay. What we think is best about Wynn and Encore is the attention to public spaces. The shopping arcades are so much more refined than say the mall next door at Venetian. Granted you can't take a carnivale style ride with a poorly singing gondolier, but then who would want to? The staff and guests are a cut above other locations on the strip, unless you're comparing to say Bellagio, but given the location and all the tourists that tromp through, you get more of a mix in Bellagio. The restaurants in Wynn/Encore are simply the best in Las Vegas. Everyone of them seems to be rated in one guide or another. The prix fixe meals are decadent and an incredible value given the ala carte price points. The decor, while over the top Las Vegas is much more refined and high end than the other casino properties on the strip. We're so impressed we're actually thinking of making a stop in Macau to see stay at their property there when we next fly over to Hong Kong. You won't be disappointed at the Encore.

I have to admit, I had high expectations after reading all the rave reviews and hearing over and over again how this was a five star resort. Perhaps my expectations were a little TOO high. The rooms were beautiful but overall I would say our experience here was only average, and we probably won't stay here again. Nex time I will opt for the Bellagio or Mandalay Bay. Here are some more details about our stay: Pros: 1) The rooms. Gorgeous and spacious. Everything is electronic, so you can be uber-lazy and shut your draps or put out the privacy notice without leaving the bed. The beds were very comfortable, and the pillows were heavenly. 2) The on-site staff. They were five-star friendly. Everyone bends over backwards to make sure you're happy and comfortable. Cons: 1) The towels in our room REEKED of smoke. Now, my parents didn't have this problem in their room, so I think maybe our maid was a smoker. But it was a problem every single day we were there, so it wasn't just one stray towel. ICCKKK. 2) The hallway of our floor (12th floor) also reeked of smoke half the time. Now, I understand this is Las Vegas, but we specifically asked to stay on a NON-SMOKING FLOOR! And there are signs everywhere, so I don't know why it smelled so terrible. 3) The other half of the time, the hallway reeked of pungent cleaner mixed with a ham sandwich. I'm not kidding. It was such a strong, gross smell, we wanted to throw up. 2) The resort is small and offers few amenities compared to the Wynn. You have to walk over to the Wynn for practically everything. My b/f wanted to get his shoes shined and had to walk to the Wynn. Ditto for me when I wanted to get a facial- their spa is very small and was booked up. 3) The pool. It is placed right between the Wynn and the Encore and gets sun for only two hours in the morning. What a stupid place to put the pool. It was shaded and cold all afternoon.

We were there over Halloween, so there were lots of crazy outfits. You cannot avoid the smoke - it's everywhere on the casino floor and the surroundings. The lobbies, restaurants, pool and shopping areas are OK but the air is never totally smoke-free. The location is at the far north end of the strip, away from most of the action but that can be good or bad - you will have to decide. The rooms were extremely quiet and comfortable. Room service, housekeeping and valet were 5-star. We visited almost all the other \"upscale\" hotels on the strip and the Wynn property was by far the nicest and classiest. You will not find frat boys, adolescent bachelorette parties, fast food joints or pushy time share salesmen or anything that would make you forget you are being pampered in 5-star luxury. The downside is that everything at the Wynn is pricey (a round of golf at the resort is $500!) and they nickel and dime you on everything: no free Wi-Fi or complementary business services (a fax costs $8!).

I was married here to be married in Vegas and thought that the room would be adequate for me & my bridal party to get dressed & prepared. This hotel was aesthetically pleasing. From the moment you walk in the door, you're left smiling with a signature scent and soothing jazz versions of familiar popular songs. Our check in was pleasant and fast. My party of 8 were all check in early, however I called several times to make sure all of our accounts were noted for early check in so we wouldn't encounter a problem. I LOVE the location of this hotel. I drove all over Las Vegas while I was out there and i felt this northern strip location was prime. Just far enough from the huge crowds, close to the mall & still on the strip. It's basically the last of the hotels that really feel like they're on the Strip. You could walk to Walgreens which was the next street over if you forgot your toothpaste and didn't want to pay $4 for a sample size in the \"Sundries' . The table limits were all reasonable during the day but they skyrocketed at night and on the weekend. My girlfriends and I went to Surrender for my bachlorette party. A beautiful dance club which was also partially poolside. A sea of beautiful people swerved and grinded to the hip-hop/pop mashups! Not too crowed too since it was on a Thursday. But bring your wallet, each drink was around $15. But the atmosphere was exclusive and electric! The day of my wedding went smoother than I thought at the beginning. I suggest upgrading to the tower suites if you have more than 3 girls getting ready in 1 room. 700 sq ft just isn't enough. But, we managed. As we walked through the casino/lobby bar area,guest were congratulating me with bashful smiles. My mother, my bridesmaids and I were waiting for the limo in the lobby bar. I'm standing there in a full wedding gown, beautiful and nervous. We all went up to the bar to have a \"calm my nerves\" drink. The bartender ignored us (even though there were only 5 other people, all men at the bar). After waving for minutes trying to get his attention, he rudely told us to sit down and that he would send a server over. While waiting, I asked if I could smoke a cigarette. The answer was no (I guess this is the only bar in Vegas that you can't smoke in). \"$hit!\" I said barely above a whisper. \"LANGUAGE!\" exclaimed the bartender. I was not only snubbed by not getting served, I apparently was getting an etiquette lesson 15 minutes before my wedding. We waited over 10 minutes and no one came to attend to us. Thank god my maid of honor promptly cussed that bartender out. She gave a standing ovation worthy performance of the 5 worst cuss words you could call someone. How dare he treat a bride like that!!! When we returned that night from our wedding, our room had barely been touched even though we had the house keeping light on. There were empty bottles, dirty glasses and other garbage that had accumulated from the morning preparation of 4 bridesmaids and a bride making ourselves beautiful for my wedding. The only housekeeping that had been done was the making of the bed. So, we had to call housekeeping to our room at midnight to clean. It took them just under an hour to come and by then, I had cleaned up most of the mess myself. For the price of these rooms and the reviews that I've read, I really expected them to give me top notch customer service. For the most part, the service was just average and the run in with the' bride-ignoring bartender and midnight housekeeping were huge turnoffs. I consider myself to be a snobby consumer. When I pay big money for a product or service, I expect to receive only the best in return. I felt that Encore did not deliver the service level that should correlate with its price and ambiance.

If you manage to win big in the casino, the hotel even has a Ferrari garage where you can go and treat yourself to nice new car, or pop into Chanel in the hotel and buy yourself a beautiful handbag! Opposite the hotel is the large Fashion Mall shopping centre, and everything is within walking distance, which is ideal! There is so much to do at this hotel and in vegas that you will be spoilt for choice The hotel staff are very friendly and couldnt be more helpful.... We loved Las Vegas and the Encore so much that we have booked to go again next month with some girlfriends to bring in the New Year.... I will report back and hopefully our stay will be the same as before if not better!! :) PS.. a note on las vegas in general...if you enjoy your sleep and cant live without it then dont go!

It was a terrific value for such an oppulent setting. The Encore is my top pick for the strip. We checked out the new city center too when we visited - it's beautiful and worth checking out the shops.

I can now say I've been to Vegas for fun and share a different side of the hotel story. The breakdown: 12 girlfriends from all over the country meet for one short weekend to celebrate a bachelorette party. The Hotel: The Encore ( a Wynn hotel) Rooms: 3 (which equals four girls to a room!) Itinerary: Arrive Friday afternoon and leave Sunday morning. I love Wynn hotels for their visual aesthetic. Steve Wynn and the people he has working for him have an amazing attention to detail that creates an environment that captivates your senses from start to finish. Flying from Minneapolis, I was the first to arrive at the hotel. I found the Encore lobby well decorated, with a whimsical butterfly theme. The line to check in was only 2 people long, so my wait was short. Unfortunately I arrived before check in time (3 pm) and they were unable to get me in to my room, but they immediately offered to hold my luggage and give me a pass to the pool. There are two pools at the Encore including a \"European Pool\" which is decidedly where those who want to party and socialize spend their time in the sun. Both pools were beautiful and packed on a June weekend. The Euro pool was essentially an outdoor, daytime nightclub, complete with house and R&B music blasting from 8 am to close. We rented a cabana for Saturday afternoon in order to have a waiter for food and drink service and place to sit in the shade. Though the cabana was nice (complete with refrigerator stocked with beverages, fans, TV, phone and couch), it was probably not worth price (around $600 +). The fridge wasn't working, so our beverages weren't cold and the cabana manager copped an attitude when we complained about it. Terrible customer service given the caliber of the hotel and cost of the rental. Cabanas are certainly great for a group, but next time I'd opt for a poolside chair near an umbrella. With four girls to a room I was anticipating a tight squeeze when getting ready to go out for the night. Fortunately the contemporary room was spacious, as was the grand bathroom with huge mirrors. The rooms are not a ornate as the Venetian (and not a spacious), but certainly comfortable enough for a short weekend. The spa was gorgeous and highly recommended if you are interested in expensive pampering. The services are not so different from the normal city spa fare, but the ambiance is above and beyond, making it worth the price. As with any bachelorette party, clubs going is a night-time must. The Encore and Wynn (which are connected) house a number of clubs and we were able to sample all of them. XS is right off the lobby of the Encore and opens up to the daytime Euro pool. The best part of XS would have to be the periodic spurts of one dollar bills falling from the disco ball hanging from the ceiling. Beyond collecting a couple bucks to put towards a $15 drink, the music and crowd are fairly unremarkable. Tryst in the Wynn is an upscale version of XS and the dance floor opens to a colorfully lit waterfall. Tables are a bit more sophisticated and the crowd more upscale. I'd opt for Tryst over XS if I went again. Sunday morning we had brunch at Society Cafe right off the casino in the Encore. This is a casual restaurant and perfect for groups or couples. Again service was slow and unremarkable, but the food was tasty and the ambiance is stunning in hues of black, white, lime green, and hot pink. It was also voted one of the Best New Restaurants in 2009 by Esquire Magazine. Would I stay at the Encore again? Yes. However, if I wasn't splitting the room/cabana cost with friends I would have been quite disappointed in the customer service.

The rooms in Encore are exceptionally spacious, comfortable and clean. We have a friend who was there a couple of weeks before us, and he warned us about the noise from the outdoor nightclub on the weekend. We broached this during check-in, and the receptionist was happy to give us a room to the rear of the hotel - the view wasn't as good, but at least we could sleep at night! Like some of the other Trip Advisor reviewers, our only real gripe would be about the location. If you're out along the Strip, it's a hell of a walk back and we reckon that from entering the first door at Wynn LV, it took us around 15 minutes to walk to our room in Encore. If you're going, make sure you sign up for a Red Card, if you intend gambling at all. We're not high rollers at all, but over the week, we accrued 2 free buffets (worth just shy of $80), a delicious meal at Society (worth $150) and a free night's accommodation, should we return (and we were only playing 1c slots!). The casino is airy and pleasant. We are non-smokers and twice took taxis to other parts of Vegas (Fremont Street and the Rio) only to jump straight back in a taxi back to Encore because the smoke in some of the older casinos really is unbearable. There is a distinctive scent pumped throughout Encore which masks the smoke, and the high standard of cleanliness means that the environment is generally pleasant at all times.

The room is very impressive, huge king size bed, a bathroom to die for, lovely lounge area with a 42\u201d TV that swivels round. Controls at the side of the bed for the curtains, lights and privacy, very handy! The hotel is immaculate and that was one thing I noticed throughout our stay, the staff are constantly cleaning and tidying up and it shows. The hotel is 3 years old but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s been open for more than 3 months. The effort the staff put in to keeping the hotel clean is certainly noticeable and worthwhile. I used the European pool while I was there. I would advise to get there before 11am as it starts to get busy after that but the hotel does operate a 30 minute policy whereby if you have not returned within 30 minutes then they will remove your towel. Not so much of a problem in the week but they really enforced this on the weekend. I didn\u2019t see any people take offence at this. There are waitresses walking around offering you drinks and are very pleasant. It took us a few days to get used to the smoking inside as this is banned in the UK. They spray a perfume into the reception and casino area and after a few days you don\u2019t notice it. With regards to nightclub noise, my partner noticed it on the weekend but it was very faint. I would advise asking for a room on a higher floor. It was a holiday of a lifetime and we will definitely be returning!

Overall, the stay was good, with a few exceptions, as will be noted below. SERVICE: Generally speaking the service was alright, but not spectacular. We had one major issue at check-in, though. Since we were going for a bachelor party, we brought beer with us. However, we were told by hotel staff that we could not bring any \"outside beverages\" into the hotel - no exceptions. As such, we were forced to bring our drinks back to the car before we could check in (which we subsequently snuck back in). I have NEVER heard of such a policy, even at the more \"upscale\" resorts that I have stayed at, such as the Bellagio, or the Venetian, and I have never been told to take my \"outside drinks\" back by either of those hotels, even when I had them in plain view at check in! I thought this was ridiculous. After all, this is Vegas, and we weren't a bunch of hard partying kids! HOTEL GROUNDS: the hotel grounds are beautiful, but a little gaudy, which is fine because its Vegas. Surprisingly, it didn't smell like smoke, unlike most Vegas hotels. Overall the hotel grounds were very well maintained in my opinion, possibly because the Encore is a relatively newer hotel. ROOMS: our room was awesome. Like I mentioned before, I've stayed at some of the nicer hotels in Vegas, and this was the nicest room I've stayed at. Extremely comfortable beds and bedspreads...not \"hotel-like\" at all. The bathroom was spacious, and the toiletries were a nice touch. The room is kind of set up like the suites at the Venetian, with a living room area and a bedroom area, and I believe all the rooms are suites. We managed to fit 6 guys in the room without any problems. POOL: the pool left a lot to be desired. It was overcrowded and very small for such a large resort. We went to the pool once around 1 pm, and there were LITERALLY no open pool chairs the entire 3 hours we were there. Also, the pool bar area got suspiciously murky and murkier as the day went on. LOCATION: Its at the end of the strip, so its not the greatest location if you want to walk, but not anything a cheap taxi trip won't solve. PRICE: we got a great deal on the room by booking way in advance, through Vegas.com, otherwise it would have been too pricey. I suggest doing the same. If I remember correctly, we paid $150 a night, divided by 6 guys, so it ended up being a total bargain. CONCLUSION: I would only stay here again if I got a good deal. Although its a beautiful hotel, it seemed a little stuffy for us. However, if fancy is your thing, this is definitely the place....I have no qualms about the hotel when it comes to the grounds itself, it was just something about the atmosphere there that wasn't as welcoming as other nice hotels in Vegas.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect luxury\u201d", "Author": "aaasis", "ReviewID": "UR83214923", "Content": "We stayed in a suite for 6 nights.

With the amount of people trekking through there on a daily basis- it was very obvious they took imense care in making sure everything was impeccable. We actually strolled through the hotel to grab a late, late night coffee and found the maintenance guys steam cleaning the rug!! The rooms are great. Beautiful panoramic views of the city and at sunset is so beautiful. The only thing that was a little 'inconvenient' if you may- was the location. It was the far from the rest of the hotels that were more central on the strip-but made for a nice stroll.... Service was great- staff standing around if any directions were needed. A room key was required to enter the elevators at night- which made you feel secure that punks from other hotels weren't partying it up in the rooms next to you!

The hotel is nicely appointed without being over-the-top. One of my main concerns with going to Vegas is the smell of smoke, and that wasn't a problem at the Encore. The hotel is kept spotless, but I never seemed to see the cleaning personnel (maybe because I was sleeping most of the morning!). My experience at the Encore was a nice one, except for one BIG exception. My friend and I decided to go to bed \"early\" at 2am one night. I couldn't fall asleep for at least an hour because the noise from the club at the pool was SOOOOOO LOUD. Keep in mind that we were on the 60th floor, so we were not close to all of the action. We had a panoramic view room with two Queen beds facing the Wynn/strip. I had read prior to the trip that this may be an issue, but I had no idea it would be this loud. The hotel really needs to do something about it. Our room rate for the weekend averaged almost $500 a night, so this is just unacceptable. Almost forgot to add that after about 30 minutes of not being able to fall asleep that I put in some earplugs and I could still hear the \"Boom boom boom boom\" from 60 floors down. The spa at the Encore is amazing. I got an 80 minute massage, and while it wasn't the best massage ever, the facilities were great. I spent some additional time in the steam room and plunge pool areas. Very nice. Again, very expensive, but the facilities are probably one of the best on the strip. I liked that the spa waiting area is NOT co-ed like at other casinos (stayed at the Bellagio once and was shocked to wait around in a robe with strange men...weird). The restaurants are also very nice at the Encore/Wynn. We ate at Society (grilled artichoke was awesome), Wazuzu, Bartolotta, and Terrace Point Cafe. All of the food was outstanding, but service could be much better (with the exception of Bartolotta, where service was great). There were times at Wazuzu when we had to flag down our server. The neighboring table to us was having the same issue. We went one night to Surrender and another to XS. XS was a blast! Overall, the stay was nice.

The shower was pretty good as well.The view we had from our room was amazing looking out to the mountains - the Encore is hidden behind the Wynn so not sure how good the view is Strip side. The Wynn breakfast buffet ($20+tax) was well worth the money and is worth doing if you want to fill yourself up and miss lunch even if you are not staying within Steve Wynn's complex. Our main disappointment with the Encore (we are assuming the Wynn is the same) is their need to charge for everything and not give you anything other than free ice! This was the only hotel out of 5 during our last holiday in the states where we didnt have coffee or tea making faciliaties in our room (unless you wanted to pay a large amount of $ to have one delivered...i think not) - Starbucks is cheaper at the Fashion Show Mall! Neither do you get complimentary bottles of water (we gather Donald Trump gives you them daily for free!) This was also the only hotel where we didnt get free WiFi - $13.99 per day is ridiculous particuarly when you consider you are staying in Las Vegas and some of our other hotels have been smaller and less extravagant! As a guest you are given a red card; on check-in this was not explained therefore we didnt use it and didnt use the casino in either the Encore or the Wynn. We definately felt like a number rather than a valued customer. If you can get a stay at the Wynn or Encore at a good price (e.g.on expedia or something similar) it was worth staying BUT (unless you have one big in the casino) definately buy your bottled water from the shop down the road!

Encore is a 5* and certainly is that. It is beautifully decorated to the highest standard and the rooms very specious and plush. We were on the 7th floor on the north side of the hotel so there was no noise from the beach club. I think the water in the room priced at $8 for a bottle of water though is taking the micky! The only problem we really had with the room was the strong smell of cooking that came in through the ventilation system most evenings. Casino in the Encore is not very big and most of our gambling was done at other hotels as we always seemed to more lucky. The pools are definatly not big enough for the amount of people staying in the hotel and the sun beds are crammed in on top of each other so difficult to relax. There are a choice of restuarants however no cheap option. I wouldnt recommend Stratta in Wynn as the only time we went in here they served me raw chicken. I did get an apology and they didnt charge for my meal however that was the least i would expect having thrown the whole meal up. Another complaint I have is the fact that our flight home was not until 9pm, so we asked the hotel if we could keep our hotel room for longer. This was not possible so we kindly asked if there was somewhere to have a shower. There reply was we could use the spa for $40 each and they had showers in there. We did not want to spend the day in the spa and therefore not prepared to pay $40 just for a shower.

We go to Vegas 2 - 3 times a year and finally decided to spend a few more $$$ and try Encore (129/night for a Tower Suite King with a full strip view on 56th floor). It was worth every cent and I wish I would have stayed there years ago. Simply put - both Wynn and Encore know service. We are not high rollers, but they made us feel like ones. Every request was fulfilled promptly, spa services were some of the best ever and the food at their restaurants (Sinatra and Stratta) was outstanding. We have stayed at Mirage, Venetian and Treasure Island in the past and none compare to Encore. We generally played the $1 slots and bar service was consistent and regular. The gaming area was a bit smaller in Encore and seemed a little more subdued.......both casinos do an excellent job at keeping the smoke out.......hard to tell there is smoking at all. The room was outstanding - full glass windows staring south down Las Vegas Blvd.....the bed was as comfortable as home and the bathroom was huge and well appointed. Only recommendation to the hotel was adding free wifi - but my aircard worked just fine. Tower Suites are the way to go......they have a separate entrance that avoids the main check in desk. Valet parking is complimentary and they had the car there waiting before we had time to get down the elevator. Received comp tickets to Le Reve......excellent show, but not sure I would pay over $100 to see it......I think O and Blue Man Group are better shows for less money. Finally, headed to the trendy nightclub - Blush in the Wynn on a Wednesday......a bit slow but still a lot of fun. Mixed crowd of twentysomethings to fortysomethings......no cover charges on that specific evening, but generally men pay to get in, while the ladies are free.

However, they were ultimately able to rebook us at Encore so they get props for cusotmer service. We got a beautiful suite on a high floor with a full view of the strip and at my request, Neiman Marcus. The windows go floor to ceiling and it was the best view of the strip I have had. Plus, the blinds are automatic and totally block out the sun. Nice big TV although we did not really watch much. For my husband's B.Day they brought us a big plate of chocolate. Nice touch, great snack. Speaking of snacks, the minibar had the best. The casino was not crowded either. My favorite part of Encore was the spa. So Zen. The walkway is adorned with illuminated Buddhas. I am bummed I could not take a picture. The good luck ritual treatment is a must. That spa is a great place to spend the day sipping decaf tea. We enjoyed the pool of course, not crowded or noisy. The shopping is exceptional, we had to buy a new suitcase with all the treasures. You can have a shopping adventure without leaving Wynn/Encore. They are exceptionally helpful at Rock & Republic, same day alterations. Dining is another topic, I could write about that all day. Exceptional Sushi at Wazuzu, and they do take out so you can bring it to the pool! We had an exceptional meal at Switch too. The location of Encore is fine even though it is far down the strip. We were able to walk to Venetian for dinner pretty quickly, it is easy to walk inside most of the time. It is right across the street from the Fashion Show Mall too. We truly felt there was not much reason to leave Encore. Overall, it was more low key than Venetian and had a European feel to it. We were able to relax a lot this time, not so much nightlife.

First of all I got a great offer through the Mail that I couldn't pass up. It was basically half price for 3 nights with a free show, and a free $100 credit for slot machine play. If you get this special offer don't think it's a scam like I did at first, sometimes offers that sound too good to be true are actually real!! Don't pass the offer up if you get it. They charged a $20 resort fee each night, but they did provide free wi-fi in the rooms, free local and long distance calling, as well as free valet service, and free gym access. Having said that now that I have been to the Encore I would probably pay more to stay here again because of the treatment and high quality facilities they offer. Through my deal we got upgraded to a suite instead of just the standard room. We had an amazing view of the strip, and the suite was so awesome and luxurious. It was very clean and spotless, had a 42 inch plasma tv, huge bathroom with a jacuzzi like bath tub and a huge shower, and a King size bed. Although we didn't spend too much time in the room, why would you spend time in your hotel room in vegas right??, it was still really nice to crash there and hang out with our friends to throw back some cocktails before hitting the clubs... Once you are at the Encore at Wynn you honestly don't need to leave the hotel to visit any other places in Vegas, they have everything you need right here. They have 4 of the best nightclubs: Tryst, XS, Surrender, and Blush, which supposedly are 4 of the best in Las Vegas. The pools are awesome also, we didn't go to the Encore Beach Club party on sunday it was kind of a slow week in vegas, but we had just as much fun at the European bathing pool. Just a heads up for everyone the European Bathing pool is clothing optional, meaning a lot of women lie out topless, so it's enjoyable for the guys if your lady lets you go near that pool haha :P and enjoyable for the ladies if your into that kind of thing :D Also they have a huge mall area with a ton of shops. Kind of higher end stores, but still fun shopping for your lady friend. Now onto the important stuff. THE BUFFET!! It was awesome. It was a little pricey to be honest, but I didn't go to Las Vegas to save money seriously. The Dinner buffet was great, good prime rib and anything else you could ever imagine, Sushi, Pasta, Pizza, Crepes, Cocktail Shrimp, King Crab, unlimited Champagne etc etc etc. The Brunch Buffet on Sunday was my favorite and once again they had everything, from baby back ribs to prime rib to french toast and pancakes.

I was slightly disappointed with this venue so I suppose that I was expecting more. This hotel has an understated elegance - modern and yet sumptuous - in the lobby featuring a red butterfly decor. They could have used more help at the check-in during peak hours but once we were actually helped the process went quite smoothly. I also found that the concierge desk was not always manned - more on that later. We had opted for two 'Panoramic King' suites and found that we really didn't have a view of the Strip - we could see some of the old hotels (Circus Circus and Riviera) but none of the newer sights. The rooms were a lovely size and quite comfortable for our needs. We loved being able to open and close the curtains or turn off the lights with a touch of a button by the bed. And it was fun to have a flat-screen TV in the bathroom. My only real other complaint about the room (aside from the view) would be that I just don't care for beige towels - I prefer white at home and when traveling. My main complaint was how much trouble we had printing our boarding passes for our return trip. You see we like to print them 24 hours prior to the flight and so we got up at 6 AM to go to the business center - which wasn't open. We were told that we could use the concierge but there was no one manning that desk. The front desk tried to help us but they couldn't find our reservations with the confirmation number. We were told we might have better luck at the Wynn's business center and after curling around the property we finally found that their business center wasn't open either. When we finally were able to get into the Encore's business center (after 8 AM) we were able to finally print our passes but by that time I had lost 2 hours of much-needed sleep.

We waited on line to check in for almost an hour -- and there were only 5 people ahead of us! Once we made it to check in, the clerk offered us a room on a high floor with panoramic views for $20 per night. There were 6 of us, with 3 rooms and we all decided to live a little and go for it. We were staying for 4 nights. As this part of the Wynn is all suites with floor to ceiling windows on one side, we assumed we would have a corner room with views all around. Shame on us for assuming. This \"panoramic view,\" which is defined as a view in all directions, was the normal view one way. And we weren't even facing the strip. We were facing a half built hotel that lost their funding, the roof of the parking lot and the Riviera hotel. OK if you look straight out in the distance you saw the mountains. All three rooms in our party were given the same view. I went down to the front desk and told the manager how disappointed we were and how we felt we were suckered into paying for these rooms. I asked for a refund. He said there was nothing he could do other than move our rooms. He said they couldn't refund our money because they could easily sell those rooms. The hotel was not very crowded and we only saw one other person on our floor the whole time we were there. Also, our room was dusty as if no one had stayed in it or cleaned it in a long time. Why wouldn't they have given us strip views if they were available anyway? The manager was not very pleasant or helpful. We did not change rooms as some folks had already begun unpacking. We decided to make the best of it and go to the casino. The casino was empty and had a weird vibe. We decided to go to one of the bars and have a drink. At every other hotel, you get free drinks as long as you are gambling in the video poker machines at the bar. Well, not at the Encore! Another negative. The pool is right off the lobby check-in area and very small. Never went there. We spent all of our time at the Wynn gambling. Much more crowded, much better vibe. Positives: The hotel itself (Wynn/Encore) was very clean as were the rest rooms. The Wynn pool was beautiful and we rented a cabana. Awesome experience. The Wynn buffet was great for breakfast. Great variety/great value. Society Cafe in the Encore was really good. On the expensive side, but good quality food and service - lunch and dinner. My advice: Stay at the Mirage. They upgrade you for free and treat returning customers well. The pool is very nice. They have great restaurants. And you drink for free at the bars! Will definately not return to the Encore!", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK/Nigeria", "Title": "\u201cA big WOW\u201d", "Author": "9jafunseekers", "ReviewID": "UR79239070", "Content": "I was travelling with 2 teenage boys and an 8 year old.

As a Hotelier, he sure knows how to do it right. He knows what people want even as the styles and needs and his target markets change. We have been to Vegas more times than we can count and have stayed at pretty much all the upper end places on the strip. (See my years of reviews). We've watched Wynn re-invent Vegas as we have stayed at all his hotels when they were new: Mirage, Treasure Island, etc. but the Bellagio has always been our favorite and we always wind up back there. Wynn/Encore is a beautiful resort that has an attention to detail and is impeccably maintained. Even if there are style options that are not our preference, the entire property is managed with elegance and class. Flowers and polished marble abound. Staff is professional and attentive. We stayed on a promotion that upgraded us to a Encore suite and included tickets to La Reve. If we return, I think it would be to stay at the Wynn instead. The Encore seemed to have a younger crowd (20-30's), smaller casino, less interesting restaurant options and a less interesting pool for our taste. The hotels are connected and easily accessible but we found ourselves walking to the Wynn more often than not. Our suite was immaculate and nicely appointed. The bed and linens were extremely comfortable. I slept better than I had in quite awhile. Every detail was elegant. No nightly turn-down service was disappointing. We requested a south facing strip view and unfortunately, could hear the pounding of the nightclub 37 floors below but that apparently did not affect our sleep. Other than that, no noise could be heard from ohter rooms...not even doors slamming from the hallway which is so often the case. The pools at Encore were a bit nutty, especially on the weekend but you could tell people were enjoying themselves. Music was too loud to concentrate on reading a book and shade was hard to come by. The \"European\" pool gets a lot of the club scene activity on the weekend. We chose to spend most of the time at the Wynn pool which had more nooks and crannies for not feeling part of the mob scene. There was a European pool there too but we did not hang out there. Food options at both property pools could use to be expanded. Staff was friendly and helpful and made sure the decks were neat and in order. Gaming tables near the bars is a nice and fun touch. Our favorite restaurants were at other properties which were easier to access from the Wynn as opposed to the Encore. La Reve was fun for free but not as outstanding as some of the other Cirque shows in town. That's the result of being wowed so many times that we've become jaded. Taxi's were easy to get from the Encore (which can be an issue with some of the larger properties). All in all, a beautiful property and we will definitely return to at least one of the Wynn properties again.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, QC", "Title": "\u201cby far the nicest hotel on the Strip\u201d", "Author": "Shmees", "ReviewID": "UR79029776", "Content": "PROS: Hotel: I walked into every single hotel on the strip, and this one is by far the nicest.

Self-parking was no problem. Helpful security and staff, both indoors and out. Room: Large and very new and nice. We were on the 17th floor facing the strip and overlooking the pools, but there was no noise. Nice view of part of strip, and nice sunsets over the mountains. We got a really good deal on Priceline - booked before they started charging resort fees. CONS: Hotel: At check-in there were lines but not too bad, with ladies offering bottles of water while we waited. It did get annoying having to walk through the same long corridor all the time to get anywhere. Pool area looked crowded. Business centre isn\u2019t open yet, you have to use the one in the Wynn.

Check-in It is quite busy if you go there at 3pm, but if you don't want to wait in line leave your bags with the bellman and go for a walk around the resort/strip. We checked in at about 5pm and there was no line. Renee was pleasant and offered us an upgraded room for an extra $20 a night. Would say it was worth it just because we would otherwise have been on the 9th floor compared to the 55th. She also sent up some nice chocolates since we mentioned we were on the 2nd part of our honeymoon (first part was Jamaica). The Room Very spacious and nice amenities. The bed is very comfortable and the blinds shut out all light completely which is just what we needed after being up pretty late a few nights! Beautiful view of the strip from our room, was quite nice at night with all the lights! Elevators were very quick, never waited more than a few seconds for one. The Spa Do yourself a favour and if you are in Vegas go to the spa here! It is an excellent way to relax! I went twice, once the 2nd day and once on the last day. Was a great start to the trip to have a massage, ease away the tension from flying and sitting around in airports! Also, the spa area is one of the best on the strip, with a sauna, wet sauna, hot tubs, cool plunge, cold plunge, heated stone lounge chairs, deluge shower, programmable shower with lights, music and several showerheads!). Was nice to use this on our last day as we had to check-out by noon but could go back to the spa until closing at 8pm so was able to refresh and relax before our trip home. That would be worth the money all by itself if you don't want to go for a massage (I think a day pass for the spa is about $25 or $30, but free with any treatment) Casino It was nice (despite the fact that I lost at most things I played). Not smokey like many of the older casinos. The drink service was excellent and very prompt! A fair bit of choice or table games and slots at various minimums. My only complaint is having to go to Wynn to bet on sports. They do have a 'Sports Book' kiosk at the Red Card desk but it was often closed so I would have to walk to Wynn. I will say too related to Pai Gow Poker that the dealers and pit bosses need a bit more training with respect to the 'House Way' to play the hands. Also with respect to their rules around banking. Had to go to 2 different supervisors to get the right answer. Mind you they did apologize for not doing it right in the first place but they just seemed a little unprofessional and flabbergasted that I would ask such questions and say that they were wrong when they gave me their first answer. The Restaurants We ate at several of the restaurants that were on the Wynn/Encore property while we were there: Society Cafe Nice laid back cafe style restaurant! They had a prix fix menu which was quite reasonable ($39 for appetizer, main and dessert). The food was good, but the jidoori chicken I found a little salty. Botero Food was excellent, as was the service. A little pricey, but comparable to most of the high end steakhouses on the strip. My only complaint here was related to the dress code. I don't have a problem with it (needing pants for men, no sandals, and a shirt with a collar). They went out of their way to tell us about the dress code over the phone when we made reservations but then when we got there most of the tables around us didn't follow the dress code at all. The table next to us had 4 men wearing shorts, flip flops and t-shirts. If you don't want to enforce your dress code then don't have one and especially don't preach how necessary it is when making reservations! Don't deminish yourselves by doing so! This just put a bit of a sour note on the evening. Switch My favourite restaurant at Encore! Again the prices are on the higher side but comparable to other steakhouses on the strip. We actually ended up sharing a Cesar salad, steak and sides so it wasn't as bad and they were happy to do so! There was plenty of food doing so this way (as we find American portions of everything far too large for us). The walls and ceilings of this restaurant change every 30 minutes or so. It was quite fun to watch and see how the decor changed! The food here was excelllent! One of the best Cesar salads I have ever eaten! The steak and the side dishes were excellent as well! Wish we had room for the desserts but again with the size of the portions even split between two people we couldn't finish it all! Buffet at Wynn There is lots to choose from here. We only ate here since we were given some vouchers. The food here was ok, not excellent. Seems they focus more on diversity and quantity than ensuring each of the dishes up there were quality. we just found that a lot of the dishes looked good but just lacked flavour or were way to salty. That said, they did have crab legs and prime rib up there. (I'm not a seafood eater but there were plenty of people with plates loaded high with the crab legs). The Prime rib was quite good though. Zoozoocrackers Deli We had lunch here on our last day. Lunch for two people was $48 so I would say it was a little pricey for 2 sandwiches 2 sides and a lemonade. We were sitting next to Mr. Wynn though so that was interesting to say the least. The Shows We didn't see the La Reve or Garth Brooks show, we opted instead for Beatles Love at Mirage. Do yourself a favour and if you enjoy their music in the slightest, go and see this show! It is absolutely amazing! I'm not a huge fan of the Beatles (enjoy many of their hits though!) or Cirque du Soleil, but this was excellent. Just watch out for deals on tickets as they are otherwise quite expensive. We got ours for 40% off through a promotion at Mirage, people beside us paid $150 while we paid $80 each mind you. The Pool The pool was very nice, not hard to find a chair at all. Nice that they have a poolside casino as well in case you want to try your luck while lounging by the pool! They have a family pool and a European (topless) pool. No doubt the European pool was where the party was during the early afternoons on the weekend. However both pools were very tame during the week. We could see the new Encore Beachclub from our room. Very busy place on the weekend, especially Sunday. Apparently $40 to get in and with that you don't get a loungechair. If you want one of those you have a minimum spend during the day of $1,000. Cabana's there look cool, but with a minimum spend of $15,000 they were far out of our price range! The Clubs Were not big on going to clubs (loud music, $20 drinks and annoying douchebags aren't really our thing). We walked by XS on the weekend and the line was about 500 metres long. Very busy. Sounded like the wait was hours to get in. Guess that is the place to be on the weekend though. Not quite as long of a line for Surrender, but still prohibitively long for my likings. Overall for the price we paid for the hotel ($99 per night) this hotel is an excellent deal! I only wish hotels that I have spent twice as much on closer to home had the same amenities as the Encore! There were plenty of things that I would say cost a lot of money there, but they are all optional. Just like any hotel or visit to Vegas you have control over how much you spend.

We were quite worried after reading some negative reviews on here, and werent sure what to expect. Overall the hotel is stunning, very impressive! We visited all the other hotels on the strip and ours was by far the most upscale! The rooms were very neat and tidy, and we were on the 18th floor overlooking the pool. (i wont lie on a weekend when we got back to our rooms at 12.30am the music from the nightclubs was booming (it was like there was a disco in the next room!) but it didnt bother us as we were so exhausted we were asleep within seconds of our heads touching the amazing pillows (the beds are so comfy!) The pool area was fabulous, although the pool attendants are very strict (no cameras allowed in the european pool which is fair enough) and if your away from your sun lounger for more than 10-15 mins they will take your towels away! We ate in SW restaurant in the Wynn and were very impressed! lovely meal! we had a bit of an incident where we were queuing to collect tickets for Le Reve the show that we were going to see that evening. I left my camera on the desk as we walked away, realised 30 seconds later that i had left it, went back and it had gone! the lady said try lost and found and see if anyones handed it in. was so upset as it had all our holiday pictures on, wasnt bothered about the camera itself just the pictures. To cut a long story short we had to get the hotel manager involved as security werent doing anything. He was fantastic and really helpful, and checked the CCTV which showed that the people in the queue behind us had taken the camera for themselves! shame as most people we came across in Las vegas were so friendly and lovely. so it was unfortunate that we got the thiefs behind us! Just to say the Le Reve showing was AMAZING - we treated ourselves to the VIP seats and it was well worth it. amazing show! We didnt go to the Encore Beach Club as we found the prices were far too expensive ($50 to get in, \u00a3150 if you wanted a chair to sit on, if you wanted a sun lounger you would be toured around the 'real estate' to see what was available and prices $200 plus!) so we thought we would give it a miss! Another thing to watch out for... if you get room service and pay the very high prices always get a receipt if you pay cash! On the first night we ordered a breakfast on room service at 3am as we were jet lagged, and the lady that brought us the food was so friendly and lovely, we paid cash and didnt get a receipt (53 dollars for a sausage sandwich and a fried breakfast!!) when we checked our room bill it said we hadnt paid for the room service! we spoke to a manager who said it was down that we hadnt paid for it (we had paid cash!) so we had to fill out a form which stated that we had a descrepancy with our bill and it was sorted. however the day before we were due to leave it appeared again on the our room bill so we had to speak to a manager again and have it taken off! You will find everything in the hotel is very expensive, but you cant moan because its the best hotel there and you get what you pay for! The location of the hotel is not the best, we had to get taxi's to get into the middle of the strip, as after the first couple of days of walking down there our feet were hurting quite a lot! I know some people had said about a $20 per day service charge but we didnt receive this.

The rooms are classy and the casino is striking, probably one of my favorite casinos now. The whole place has a luxurious feel to it. I found most staff to be friendly and helpful throughout my stay. There is a 'but' though; and that is you can get better value in Vegas (and I have, just check my other reviews). The 'resort suites' are big rooms but they are not suites. They are large double rooms with a partition, albeit very classy (and expensive) ones. If you stay at The Encore you get the choice of the pools there or at The Wynn, both are nice pools and it was great to have the choice. The location isn't ideal being towards the north end of the main action. It's good if you want to spend time at The Sahara, Stratosphere, Treasure Island and Wynn, but it's a fair walk to center strip. Yes, I know if you don't like walking you're in trouble in Vegas but the location really isn't the best. Having said that we took taxis most of the time anyway. I guess it depends what you're after. I did enjoy my holiday at Encore and I would recommend it if you can get a good deal but trust me there is better value to be had out there. Botero is great for steaks (on the walk through to Wynn) not cheap but well worth splashing out for.

Overall great hotel with a huge amount of amenities - make sure to try the lunch/dinner buffet although pricier than most of the strip its more than worth the extra money for the quality of food available.

Encore! Encore!\u201d", "Author": "HiMaintain", "ReviewID": "UR76855531", "Content": "Just returned from a 3 day trip to Las Vegas staying at the Encore and am still cheering and wanting more. I read reviews for months on this hotel and was a little worried I might have issues with check in/out (NOPE), noise level in rooms from night clubs (NOPE, NONE), snooty staff (NOPE) and excessive charges (YES). We arrived at noon on a very busy Saturday figuring our room would not be ready until 3pm and we could just store our luggage and hang at the pool until my spa treatment. Our very nice and cordial front desk clerk, Jill found a room that was immediately available and on a high floor facing the strip away from any noise. We headed up to our room about 15 minutes so did our bags. The room, AMAZING and we just booked the regular Resort King through Expedia mind you, not directly with Encore. Large spacious luxurious bathroom as well as sleeping and living area. Beautiful view on the corner overlooking the pool and the strip. The corner allowed us to look at both the mountains with airplanes taking off and landing and also the strip. Went on to the European pool mid afternoon. Lots of people but was able to grab 2 lounge chairs close to the pool. Only a few (2-3) ladies partaking in the european bathing so I decided to go for it. No gawkers, no comments just relaxation. Met some really great people who were about our age (late 30's early 40's). Music is pumping and loud, which may bother some, but not us. Drinks at the bar will run you about $14 without tip. Only had snacks once, hubby had italian sub ($15) which was really good, friends next to us order $10 guac and chips, a little disappointed with the very small container of guac that comes with lots of chips so I would say no to that. I then headed on to the salon for a hair and make up appointment. I took a quick shower at the spa, which is gorgeous by the way, wish I had a massage. Afterwards onto the salon where Ray styled my hair and did a great job. I did have to ask him to flat iron my hair which he was not going to do but then did with no problem. Then on to Jessica who did my airbrush make up. She was fantastic. I felt like a movie star. I also had a chipped nail that was quickly repaired at no charge. I left the salon right on time with no waiting or delays at all. when I returned to my room I was met with a delicious tray of gourmet chocolates sent up for my birthday by the front desk which I nibbled on for the next 3 days. Later that night when we left for a concert I will say that the hotel was PACKED, due to the nightclubs that are there. We had a limo pick us up at 12:15 am and he could not get into the hotel because of the back up onto the street. The hotel check in attendants were regulating traffic in and out and that did take about 15-20 mins worth of waiting. The taxi line looked like it was about 30 minutes even with taxis available. Anyway, its a Saturday night in Vegas. We made it back to our room about 3am and there was no noise coming from the clubs (still going) or any rowdy behavior we witnessed. The bed and linens are amazing. I don't know if I have ever experienced such a good night's rest before. The remote by the bed is a nice touch, just press all and all the lights go out. The room darkening shades made me think it was still nighttime at 10am. Needless to say, Mr. Wynn put a great amount of thought into ensuring his guests sleeping comfort. Sunday we had the buffet which was outstanding, every type of food you can imagine is prepared for you and is very good. Its a little pricier on Sunday but well worth it if you can put away a lot of food. We spent our afternoons at the European pool which was more livelier on Saturday than Sunday or Monday,but still a good fun crowd. By 4pm everyone is usually more relaxed and ladies are throwing caution and their tops to the wind. Not baudy, just fun. We toured both the Wynn and the Encore on Monday and came to the agreement that no stone was left unturned to making this resort a complete oasis. There are beautiful lavish live blooming plants everywhere as well as mosaic tiled and marble floors and exquisite chandeliers and ornate ceilings. The casinos were bustiling and not overly smoky. The Wynn casino is much larger and a bit more lively. I befriended a craps table dealer who took time to explain to me the ins and outs of the game and insisted I order a free cocktail while I observed even if I wasn't gambling. I never encountered one employee during my stay who wasn't polite, helpful and friendly. Check out was a breeze. Was waiting in line at check out and whenever a check in staff member was available they would assist the person checking out to reduce wait time. We stored our bags at the bell stand while we had lunch after which the bellman quickly brought out our luggage and had a cab for us to take us to the airport. All with a smile and sense of thoughtfulness. I hated to leave. The downside, the food and sundries are pricey. We had breakfast in the Society Cafe which was very good, but pricey ($60), we also had lunch in the deli at the Wynn which was also very pricey ($58 for 2 sandwiches and 2 cokes). Two bottles of suntan lotion set us back $56, yes $56 dollars for sunscreen level 6 and 15. A pack of cigarettes will cost you $11. Do yourself a favor buy items such as these at the Walgreens located at the Palazzo next door or buy extra at home before you leave. The resort fee is a little ridiculous, $20 plus tax each day, for what I really do not know. Their night club XS is just that EXCESSIVE prices. $30 cover for men $20 cover for ladies and you MUST have table/bottleservice in order to sit down. Drinks average $14-$16 and by the time midnight rolls around the bar is about 15 people deep. Wish we could have gone to Blush but it was closed. A little disappointed that the nightclubs are only open certain nights and that was not well defined on the website. Overall, we had a phenominal time and would highly recommend to friends and plan to return. Maybe next time to the Wynn just to compare. Both hotels are amazing. We visited the M Resort, Venetian, Palazzo and Paris and they were no comparison to the Wynn/Encore. I stayed at the Venetian 10 years ago and was disappointed to see that it appears to be running down. There is a huge mall inside with typical \"mall rats\" running around and even a food court. Not upscale at all. The bottomline about the Encore/Wynn is this, yes, its expensive, but it is truly a 5 star resort. Expect to pay more, but for that price you do get luxurious surroundings and accomodations, peace and serenity, amazing customer service and extreme attention to detail at the finest resort Las Vegas has to offer.

I was apprehensive with reading a couple not so favorable reviews prior to our stay. I was happy to prove the bad reviews wrong with a wonderful experience on all levels at the Encore. We drove in to town and got to the hotel around 12:30 in the afternoon. We parked in the self park and were at the front desk with in a few minutes walk. When we walked by the pool, we wanted in as soon as possible. The front desk had us checked in and up to our room in no time. An early check in was no problem (the room was available). We were down at the beautiful pool having a couple of drinks in no time and well on our way to a great stay. The pools and service at them were top notch. There is always someone cleaning off lounge chairs as guests were leaving, so if you got there during a busy time, all you had to do was be patient and you would have yourself a spot. There were all types of fun guests at the pool if you wanted to socialize or you could hang out by yourselves. The room was awesome! Clean, spacious and very comfortable. The best I have stayed in Vegas, and perhaps ever. Service was Top Notch as well. From the front desk to the cleaning crew, we were always given a smile and a willingness to go the extra mile if it could be done. We went to a several restaurants on the Wynn Property - each one fantastic with regards to design, food quality, and service. You could complain that each one was on the more expensive side, but not so much so, and you always get what you pay for. We have been off property for meals before and there are no cheap quality meals in Vegas. Stay on site and enjoy what they have to offer. We loved the Asian/Chinese for dinner, breakfast outside overlooking the pool at the Wynn Hotel Pool, and the burgers for lunch at Botero. The gym is fantastic - there could be no possible complaints. By far the best hotel gym I have been to. You can't complain about a resort fee when you get this gym, the pool and all the other features on the property. We enjoyed Le Reve as well. All in all, we will definitely be back.

I would not reccomend Encore for a younger, wild crowd (low 20's); i would say it caters to a mature crowd who still knows how to have a good time.

Satisfying. Yes, you do pay for most everything else and the rates are higher with a resort fee ($20 per day) of some extras that some may not use; fitness spa, internet and unlimited long distance phone calls but THEY'RE A 5 STAR HIGHLY RATED RESORT! I'm sure the marketing goes out to average to middle class for the higher class group doesn't care if they get a discount. They can afford it! Being on vacation we alotted for \"vacation\" expenditures and there were no hidden costs that were sprung on us.

I stayed at the Wynn last year, and was lucky to get a great rate for the Encore this year. These 2 hotels are amazing! What I love about them, is that unlike traditional casinos, you don't feel like you are in a cave. The rooms are so spacious, and have a separate living room (Encore). Bathrooms are all marble with separate tub/shower and a TV. Check in/out was easy, and the SPA was incredible. I encourage you to try it. As soon as you exit the elevator on the spa/pool level, you start to relax. i ordered room service one night, and they gave me the ETA (which was accurate) and my food was brought up in a food warmer. Where you notice the difference is in the details of everything they do. They aren't in your face, but when you need something, anyone will help. The ONLY feedback I would give is that the Taxi line needs some improvements. We had to wait both mornings for 15 minutes, and the taxi line is not shaded - so you are sweating by the time you get in a cab. The cab driver we had, told us that by FAR the Encore and Wynn get the best feedback according to his customers, and I would agree.

There are loads of restaurants to choose from - different prices so there should be something to suit most budgets. We had a particularly good chinese meal near the casino area in the Encore. The hotel is situated at the end of the strip so in August it can be hot work walking anywhere outside, and walking through hotels along the strip is not always so straightforward as they can be a bit maze-like. A piece of advice - don't pre book theatre tickets - you can buy them greatly reduced at Tix4Tonight shops - the closest of which is opposite the hotel on the ground level of the Fashion Show Mall.

It's advertised as a 5-star hotel but mostly it's the prices that are 5-star. Be aware that the whole purpose of the hotel is to separate you from your money. And mind you, that's before any gambling. The room was spacious and clean, I'll give it that. However, it was also very sterile. For what you get the rooms are way overpriced. You get a place to sleep, everything else is extra. Make sure you know about the $20/day/room resort fee which \"entitles\" you to wi-fi access, use of gym, and a few other useless things I don't remember. You expected a coffee-maker or a free movie channel like what you got at your last Super-8 stay? You're in the wrong place. A small coffee down in the bar will set you back $6. That's probably the cheapest item by far you'll find in any of their bars/restaurants. If that's the definition nowadays of \"high-end\" hotel I must be hopelessly out of touch. Their web site is actually a good representation of what to expect. A lot of fluff but no substance. The pool looks nice on the pictures, doesn't it? Well, it's quite small. Shady spots are hard to find, you'll be baking in the LV heat. When the temperatures finally drop and the pool area is in the shade they close it down. No use of the pool after 7pm. You're supposed to be in the casino or one of their restaurants. The strategy of the newer hotels/casinos to make it hard finding an exit was elevated to an art form at the Encore. It'll loop you around so even when you do find an exit you're facing the Encore or Wynn again. Shows are ridiculously expensive. We went to see Le Reve. Luckily we were invited so I shouldn't complain about a gift horse. However, at a face value of $113 or so the tickets make Disneyland (which is already horrendously overpriced) look like a bargain. I will admit though that the show itself was nicely done. Good acrobatic and artistic entertainment. Would be willing to spend $40-50 for it. Try the half-price counter near the MGM if you want to go. The machines at the Encore/Wynn casino also seemed to be very tight. We saw our gambling allowance dwindle quite fast so we went next door to the Pallazzo where we were able to nurse it much longer. By extension my impressions of the Encore apply to Las Vegas as a whole. Granted, the city always existed to relieve you of your money but by and large that was limited to gambling. I came to LV a number of times in the 80s and 90s but hadn't been back for 15 years. The hotels wanted to get you into their casinos and made most everything else a relative bargain. That's no longer the case. For instance, food used to be inexpensive. Alas, no more. A buffet (with huge waiting lines) will set you back $20-25 typically. The LV police has also gotten into the game of fleecing the tourists. Whenever we drove down the strip or to the east of it it we saw an unfortunate motorists pulled over at almost every other corner. Never noticed a NV license plate, mostly CA. So, watch out when you're driving! Las Vegas was never a place for families and things haven't changed. I head read reports that they offer more for kids now but I can't corroborate those claims. Your best bet might be the center at Circus Circus. Some casinos have little corny shows later in the day in front of their buildings (Bellagio, Treasure island, etc.) but nothing to keep the little ones entertained really. In conclusion, I wouldn't go back to the Encore. Get as much information as you can about any hotel you have in mind before you go to LV. Save your money for gambling - which is why you're going, right? Are there any other reasons to go to Vegas? None that I can think of (unless you're into gaudy displays of neon lights for which LV still doesn't have any competition). Even for the purpose of gambling I don't have to drive that far anymore. Here in CA the next casino is never more than 2 hours away. I can certainly wait another 15 years before I visit Vegas again - if indeed ever.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ShellyBNyc", "ReviewID": "UR75547782", "Content": "Amazing service: everyone from cleaning staff, to the dealers, to the waiters were exceptionally friendly and professional.

I'm a Vegas regular (6-9 visits per year), had previously stayed at the Wynn, and wanted to check out Encore. Check in took a reasonable length of time, but I was given a room that, when I got to the door, I found maintenance working on the bathtub, and he did not know when he would be finished. I was assigned another room, but the keys did not work. After waiting 20 minutes for keys, the bellman arrived with my luggage and let me in the room. The bellman was very gracious and really made an effort to make things right. I called the front desk regarding the waste of an hour of my time, and got a minimal apology. When I asked, I was given a food credit to make up for the lost time. There is a resort fee of $22/night (ugh!) which gives you wifi and health club access. It is not included in your estimated total for check-out. Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Nice big bathroom with separate shower, tub and w.c. Towels and linens are very nice, and they give you a spa bathrobe. Bed was comfortable and there was a seating area with a sectional couch in the room. A bit over-engineered with the light and drape controls. If your room is in the E Tower and an even number, be warned - the noise coming from nightclub Surrender was loud enough to be a problem on the 28th floor. The Euro pool was great - good DJ, nice layout, no kids allowed. Cabana guys were very friendly - helped me find an open chair and set me up with towels. Pool had enough people for a fun time without being a human koi pond. Poolside food service wasn't great - we usually had to go to the bar for drinks since our server didn't come by very often. The biggest complaint I have with Encore is although you are paying one of the highest room rates in Vegas, there is no advantage to being a hotel guest here. Shows, nightclubs, restaurants - you are treated just like anyone who walks in off the street. At our last visit to the Wynn in 2008, we got a room upgrade to a suite, line/cover passes to Tryst, and our friends got special seats to Le Reve. At Encore, even though my friend dropped $10K plus on her wedding at the Wynn, the best they could offer her for the group to go to a club after the reception was $30/person cover for Surrender or $100/person at XS. They also charge Encore guests full cover at Encore Beach Club. I spoke with a manager who was more than willing to come down to the concierge and talk to me, but he explained that in this recession, they had to keep all their staff employed and were trying to maximize their revenue. While I appreciate his frankness, I will choose another place to stay next trip where there are advantages to being a guest of the property (and I'm sure it will be at a lower room rate!).", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cMy stay at the Encore was poor at best, found the room I stayed in dirty and employees rude.\u201d", "Author": "rmiller44", "ReviewID": "UR75092832", "Content": "I visited the Encore from the 8th thru the 11th of August. When I first arrived the check in area was not organized. Parties coming in after me were being waited on before me, not what I consider being customer conscientious. When I got to my room someone knocked on it probably 4 minutes after arriving, young lady asked if all was correct and I said I had just walked in but noticed there were no robes. That was not taken care of until the next day. I walked down to the bar nearest to the registration where I found the two bartenders serving Sunday night to be very unresponsive, for only having 12 people in the bar. I was greeted after a 2 minute delay with what do you want? Very impressive. I gave up and called it a night. I the middle of the night I got up for a drink of water and while walking into the bathroom I stepped on a something. So I turned on the light and sit down on the edge of the bed to see what was going on. It was a piece of glass, apparently from a previous stay? I removed the glass and while sitting there I notice that there was food particles on the floor around the bar area. Again it was not cleaned up from a prior stay. Throughout my stay I ended up stepping on another piece of glass, sit down on the coach and was greeted with bobby \u2013pins. I just have to question how well you clean your rooms. I had trouble logging into the wireless, so I called down to the lobby. The young lady answered the phone explained what I needed to do and when I questioned why it was telling me I would be charged roughly $14, she said \u2013 no sir that is included in your room don\u2019t worry about it there is no additional cost. That was not what I found out later when checking out! I went to the work out area where again I was told there was a $15 charge per day and decided forget it. When I checked out of Wednesday I went down to the front desk to turn in my door key. A gentleman that had no personality what-so-ever asked if I wanted to put my additional charges on my credit card. I said no sir the stay has already been pre-paid for I should not have any additional charges. He then gave me a bill for $67.20. Telling me that was the cost for the wireless and gym charges during my stay as I tried to explain to him and he said they are \u201cRESORT FEE CHARGES\u201d. Again, I tried to explain and he said you used the wireless you get charged for it and you used the gym, stopped, looked at his screen, and said no I guess you didn\u2019t but you will still be charged for it. What kind of racket are you pulling off? The cost for a three night stay with tax was $502 and then you charge an additional $67 for \u201cRESORT FEE CHARGES\u201d. The gentleman then dropped his head would not talk to me and let me discuss my stay , nor did he ask me at any time how was my stay. Since then I have tried to call the Encore Wynn manager to discuss my stay and cannot get him to return my calls. I would have to say that from the staff I was subjected to, to the cleanliness of the room I stayed in I would have been better off staying at the Red Roof Inn and paying $39 a night.

Everything is so impersonal. While some may like the anonymity, I prefer customer service. We arrived with no greeting. No water. In the desert. In August. We waited in a line. A line usher ushered us to the next line. Each check-in took about 15 minutes so the wait was about 25 minutes. They didn't care and made no apologizes. We were packed in with dozens of loud smokers with all the luggage. Our check-in took 15 minutes. She asked for requests and I told her we came for a quick getaway without our children and wanted a quiet room on the top floor. She issued our keys. Both of us had to give ID. I asked her if our room was on the top floor and she said no. Would have been nice for her to say something. The room was OK. Although the Encore advertizes all suites - it's not really. It's a bedroom with a sitting area that doesn't close off. So, it's not like we could have brought the kids and had any privacy or had friends in for a drink without having them in your bedroom. We tried for a nap but a raging party started next door. We hadn't unpacked to we changed rooms down the hall with little inconvenience but, again, no apologies. Afterall, the front desk said (after a long hold time) it's not their fault. Well, it kinda is if they drop the room rate so low for the summer that they are getting 4 guys per room there to party hard. Next, we realize that we had no information about our slot credit and show tickets that were part of our package. This was never brought up at check-in. I called and, yes, after a long hold time, was told how to get the $25 slot credit which was really only $15 with conditions because anybody can get $10. A bit of a scam. Then, we learned we couldn't use the gym. We went to the front desk but were ushered away by the line usherer who explained people had been waiting in line. I knew this to be true because we did too. So we waited. And waited. We had to pay a $20 per day plus tax resort fee to use the gym and could no longer use the spa (which is what I would do while my husband works out longer)(this was a new policy). Again, no apologies. Everything else was so-so. Nice gym. No in room coffee so my husband had to make the trek and wait in line every am to get a cup of coffee in a paper cup for us. The Wynn Buffet line was so long, we paid extra for a front of the line pass. As a hotel guest, you get nothing extra other than use of the pool. If you have your ID. Everything is so impersonal and regulated. There is only one way in and out of the pool area. Crowd control is the name of the game - not guest convenience. We stayed up to 2 am on our last night and dearly looked forward to sleeping in the next am. We were awakened out of a dead sleep by a screaming fight next door. It was so bad we had to call security. We called the front desk and asked for a late check-out ...OK. Not even late. I asked for an extra hour. Any guess what the answer was? I guess I need to stay at boutique hotels since I expect hospitality. There was no offer to use a hospitality suite or store our luggage since we had such a late flight. No apologies, just \"corporate policy\". I asked to complain to the GM by leaving a voice mail but was told \"they are all in a meeting so use a comment card\" - I insisted that the voice mail was viable option despite the meeting and left a message.

Unfortunately, there is no coffee maker in the room and coffee will cost you a few dollars in the cafe on the main floor. The gym also costs extra to use unless you purchase a spa treatment.

We loved the hotel lobby/casino decor, and although the service was about a B+ (unless you stay at a Four Seasons or equivalent, it's hard to get consistent A-plus service), the amenities, food, and room were probably the best we have ever had in Vegas. To get a hotel like Encore in Manhattan, you'd probably pay $1000 a night. We paid $110 a night plus we got 2 free tickets to Le Reve. We also do not understand the Red Card player club system they have, but we got 2 meals comp'ed at the Society Cafe (very good food, and they brought out hot pretzels!!!! For lunch, it was about $110, so it's not like a standard cafe) and about 6 buffets comp'ed. We kinda got sick of the buffet, but the food is very good. And how can you really complain about free food? And we should say that the king crab legs (they offer it for dinner only) were sliced lengthwise. It was so easy to eat. Whoever invented that machine or tool...kudos to you! Hubby said the pizza at the pizza place at the Wynn was the best he had had in a long time! And I had an Asian Chicken Salad at the deli by the theater at the Wynn, and even though it was pre-made, it was very delicious. The food was excellent. And the retail options there are great. Of course, it's all high-end stuff, but my husband and I got some really good deals on clothing. They sell Juicy Couture sweats ($100-plus sweats) at the sundries store. That's my kind of shop. We would definitely stay again, and we preferred the Encore to the Wynn because it was laid out very well, and it was much smaller than the Wynn. So, you didn't have to walk too much to get to here or there. Then again, after eating all that food, walking is good for you. Great job, Steve Wynn...and wife!

Well it tuened out to be more like a wolf in sheeps clothing. Check in was quick and fine and we got a room on the 38th floor and could have paid an extra $25 per night to get a higher hotel room. The room was plush and the bathroom was as big as the rest of the room. First thing I noticed as I checked the room out was that it had a lot of wasted space. It had a large what I thought was a dresser, but turned out to be just a display. It had no drawers and you couldn't open it. It also had a couple of more places you would think they would allow you to store things that were no more than cosmetics. I still thought the room was fine until I tried to turn on the big screen tv and it didn't work. That was my first call to the service desk. While waiting for them to arrive I noticed they had a collection of snacks and gifts sitting on the dresser thing. Well these were balanced on a device that if you removed any item you had 60 seconds to replace it otherwise you will be charged for it. This probably wouldn't be a big deal unless you wanted to read the contents of whatever it was. Speed reading anyone!!! Also noticed that there was no refrigerator. This prompted our second call to the service desk. Turns out you could rent on for $25 dollars a day. Hummm, that works out to $175 for a week. Fortunate for us the hotel is within walking distance of a Walgreen where we went a got a disposable ice chest and other goodies to tide us over for our 3 night stay. They came up and got the tv working and we were ready to dive into the casino and other offering of the hotel. The gaming is your usual slots and table games that all hotels offer. The place had several restaurants with the most intreging being the Sinatra. Decent prices for a high end Italian restaurant. The other restaurants were just over priced. The Encore is attached to the Wynn so you can go there as well but the two places are the same in decor and amenities. After a long drive to get to Vegas we called it an early night (about 12 midnight). The next day everything changed. I checked by checking account like I do everyday and found that $850 dollars had been charged to my account. I wanted to know what this was and it turns out that the hotel had charged me for the nights I was staying and they had an incidentals charge of $150 per night that was deducted from my account. Now I don't know about you but I have never stayed in a hotel that charged for the room upfront and most incidentals were either I take you card number or about a $100 refundable deposit. I asked why the incidental charge was so much and the responde was \"we don't know it you will destroy the room or not\". Excuse me, but what type of guests do you have it you think they will destroy the room. That sheds a bad light on the hotel. We inquired about an alternative to the incidental charge that they had taken out of my account and they had none. Personally I think tying up the amount of money they were tying up was taking away from us enjoying what the hotel had to offer. Not everyone uses credit , so of us pay as we go. This whole incident led us to not want to spend any more money in this hotel, so the remainder of the trip we eat and gambled elsewhere. But that wasn't the end of out problems. We returned to our room after one excusion and our toilet didn't work and another the electricity in the room didn't work. Needless to say we wern't happy campers at this hotel. The kicker came the morning of checkout. Part of the package deal we got from the hotel was a $75 dollar credit with the hotel. We hadn't used any of it so we decided to hit the pool early and then have breakfast by using this. The pool area is wonderful at this hotel. They have a regular pool and they have an adults only pool for those who want to go european style. Cabanas go for $300 to $400 dollars a day through the week and $400 to $500 a day for the weekend. The cabana is yours for the entire day, so you could leave and comeback later in the day. Well we charge a couple of bloody maria's while at the pool and then went to breakfast. Well when we tried to charge the breakfast on the room we were informed that we had checked out of the room already. It also turned out that the drinks we thought we had charged did not count either. So we ended up spending close to $70 dollars that we could have spent somewhere else. It was a very frustrating situation. How did we get checked out without our knowledge? The explaination from the hotel was that the hotel must have automatically checked us out. What? How does a hotel automatically check you out? We hadn't even went back to the room to get out stuff. What the heck!!! Well when we really did go down to get the explaination it wasn't pretty. Our complaints were so much that they had to pull us out of line and the hotel manager talked to us on the side. Turns out that they also have a policy of letting hotel personnel use each others name tags. The person who checked us into the hotel that didn't tell us about the incidentals or the upfront room charge had been using someone elses name tag. So the hotel couldn't identify who had checked us in. There was also different solutions to the incidental charge that could have been used. On top of all this when we were ready to leave the hotel we had our luggage sent to the valet parking and they lost our luggage. We had to wait in valet for almost 45 minutes before we could go. Also turns out that we were not the only ones who had a problem or two. Overall the experience was a total failure on the hotels part. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. As a matter of fact I would recommend that anyone looking for a great experience to go to the Pallazo and Veneitian hotel for a lot better experience.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cAwesome property in so many ways, but not the best\u201d", "Author": "GetWellKatelynn", "ReviewID": "UR72660320", "Content": "Pros: This is a beautiful property and the rooms really are as beautiful as in the pictures. There's great music on the TV, which made the room have a very relaxing ambience while I worked. I took the advice of many people on this site and at check-in requested a room on the opposite side of the nightclub. The front desk clerk immediately nodded; apparently he has heard this before; and he gave me a room on the 50th floor. The downside of the \"opposite side from the nightclub\" is that your room view isn't worth writing home about. That's okay with me, because unlike many Vegas visitors, I was going to use the room to sleep at night. My colleagues, on the other hand, got very low floor rooms on the nightclub side, but I gathered from the stories I heard the following day that they didn't plan on sleeping anyway. I was also given a $75 room credit, as were my colleagues; and we pooled our credits and enjoyed a nearly-free fabulous steak dinner at Switch. The cons: It's crowded. Checking out was nearly a disaster. I was running late for the airport at 5:00 a.m., and when I went to the Registration Desk to check out, there was one clerk and four people waiting on line. No time for that, I bypassed the checkout procedure and got my receipt emailed to me the following day. They have a silly system of charging you for an overpriced snack or drink if you pick something up for more than 60 seconds, but they will refund the charge if you call them promptly. The worst thing of all about my room was the bed. I'd heard great things about the bed and was really looking forward to sleeping in it...but, someone really heavy had slept on one side of the bed, making it seem like I was sleeping on a hill.

This is probably our 30th trip to LV and our 3rd stay at Encore. We are big Steve Wynn fans - our past favorites being Bellagio and Wynn. We know the plusses and minuses of most of the hotels and for what we want, Encore is the best choice. Until something else better is built, it will be our first choice. Their attention to detail is unsurpassed. First of all, Encore is a smaller, quieter casino. Some think the location is a bit far from center strip, but if i choose to walk, it's close enough to other casinos, restaurants, etc. Besides, once you get there, you really don't need to go elsewhere - unless this is one of your first trips to LV. I'll list the things I like and things that are not that great. Love: The atmosphere - Classy, quiet, first rate decor. The Pools - beautiful, lots of lounge chairs, food and drink at pool, georgeous waitresses. The rooms - large, classy, cool big flatscreen that spins for viewing from bed or sitting area. We had small party for 6 and there was plenty of room for everyone on coaches and chairs. Bathroom is large with seperate shower/soaking tub. Lighting options are great and the beds are wonderful. Staff - We have always found the Wynn/Encore staff to be well-trained and friendly. I think some quests interpret their professionalism as \"snooty\" or \"standoffish\". We have always had good luck with the staff by being friendly and kind - and not demanding something we did not pay for. The maids were great, once they learned we liked extra towels and lotion, there was always an extra supply available. Bags were delivered right away, valet staff was super accomodating, check-in (20 min wait) was friendly and efficient. my favorites are the gaming staff - professional, efficient, friendly and knowlegable. It's clear that they all know they are working in the best property and they need to be the best at what they do. The spa - have been to 10-12 of them on the strip and this is clearly the most beautiful. The one area that i would love to see changed a bit is the food choices. The food itself, and the service is suberb. We have eaten at several of their resataurants and I rate them all equally high. However, sometimes you want a less expensive choice without leaving the property. That's my only quibble. There is a great sandwich/deli called Zoo Crackers right next to the Sports Book at Wynn, but it's a 5 min indoor walk. I have booked an end-of summer return to enjoy all the Encore and LV delights.

The hotel was busy over this holiday weekend and when we arrived - tired and late at night, the rooms were not together and one party was given an upgraded room and the other wasn't. The staff and then the manager was unable to resolve this problem and I felt customer service was very poor here. Rooms: The rooms themselves are large and bright with floor to ceiling windows and lovely views down the strip towards the airport. Other rooms do face in the opposite direction with a less attractive view. Bathrooms were large with separate shower and bath, amenities, and tv near his and hers sinks. We had 2 Queen beds with I am sure a hundred pillows!!! Slept very well. We were on the 62 floor, our friends further along the corridor said they could here the music from the Encore Beach Club that opened that weekend - even on the 62 floor!! We couldn't here it. Couldn't fault the rooms. The hotel is very plush in the public areas, with a large casino and walk way connecting through to the Wynn with a number of restaurants/shops and a night club enroute. There is a nice bar area near the reception. I liked the fact that there are windows in areas of the casino as opposed to other hotels where there are none. The let down was the pool areas. The Encore has 2 pool areas - one for all and one for adults. Both of the pools were quite small and the sun loungers were in tight rows with no parrasols to get shade from the sun. I felt like I was sunbathing in a 3 star on the Costas!! It was really busy, so even getting a sun lounger was a problem. One morning they were not ready to open the adult pool at the allocated time, due to a party there the night before. It nearly caused a riot!! There are some loungers partly submerged in the pools with shade but you paid about \u00a3500 a day for the privledge of using these. There are also cabannas for hire but these were going for over \u00a310,000!! a day. If only!! There was a bar with a few tables to eat at and some gaming tables in the pool grounds. Cocktails here cost about $60 for a pitcher for 4. The pools in the Wynn were very similar, although slightly bigger. I don't really know much about gambling so can't really comment on the tables, only to say that the minimum bet was usually \u00a325. Did try the slots for fun. You are offered a drink if you are gambling on the tables, I was never offered one on the slots, but you do have to tip the waitress well. We went to Fremont Street to gamble, minimum $3 bets and free drinks with a dollar tip to the waitress. We really enjoyed it there!! We hired a car from the airport (avis, prebooked online) very cheap compared to Europe. I think we paid about \u00a3130 for 5 days for a Ford Mustang Convertible. It's free valet parking at the hotel with a tip to the guy of course. You can drive down the strip and park free at other hotels. Vegas is loud, brash and never seems to sleep. We visited many of the other hotels on the strip and really they are all very similar. You can't check out the pools though as this area is restricted to hotel guests only. The fountains are good to watch at the Bellagio in the evenings. Our friends went on a helicopter trip to the canyon with a touch down in the canyon and fly back over the strip. They really enjoyed this. They went with Maverick Tours that fly from McCarron airport (Las Vegas). Some tours fly from Boulder so no flight over the strip on your return. We ate at the Wynn buffet restaurant one night which was good value, plenty of choice and well cooked. We added on the champagne option which was only aabout $8, for unlimited champagne while eating. Good value with most drinks costing about $15. We usually bought breakfast - fruit, croissants and coffee from the bar areain the encore and took to the pool. One good thing - plenty of free water stations around the pools. We also ate at the Hard Rock (tradition for us!) and a Tony Romas. Overall I enjoyed Vegas, I am glad I have visited as it's a must see place, but won't be rushing back. If I did return I probably would stay at the Encore again, even with its faults or possibly the Bellagio as it's more centrally located on the strip. The Encore is at the top end. Take plenty of cash - it's not cheap! It didn't help with it being an American holiday so the whole place was packed and prices over inflated due to this. By the Tuesday it had become less crowded and prices had dropped again for food. I appreciate Vegas isn't a beach hol and they want you to gamble, but I think abit more thought could have gone into the design of the pools and pool areas, after all most people can't afford to gamble for 24hrs a day.

We have been regular visitors to Las Vegas over the years, seeing hotels of varying standards, come and go. Have stayed in the majority of the strip hotels, but this was a first stay at Wynn / Encore. The hotels are adjoined, with subtle differences in identity. Both are undoubtedly beautiful to look at. Encore has a definate red colour theme - carpets, chandaliers, walls in places.Floral arrangements - both real and artificial - abound. We stayed in a resort room, having asked for a high floor - we were given that - at an extra premium. The room - and view- were fantastic. I experienced none of the problems that others have had with housekeeping etc.... everything was done efficiently. I would however agree with one of the previous reviews - despite the room being extremely large and comfortable - it could do with an extra piece of furniture ( it is almost bare really) for storage - a extra chest of drawrers would not go amiss. Realistically, there is just a wardrobe, and a small set of double drawers. More needed. Beds were extremely comfortable. I did not have any issues with noise, or the thin walls as mentioned by other reviews. It would be fair to say that my main observation would be the way the Encore has marketed itself. Every store at the hotel is \"high end\" individual retail, with pricing to match. Even mundane items are exhorbitantly expensive. I saw a pair of plain rubber flip-flops- nothing fancy whatsoever - on sale for $15. That is just silly. Everything at the hotel seems to be priced at a higher level than elsewhere, incuding food, sundries etc. So be prepared to pay! A minor point - there is an abundance of nightclubs here - this results in lots of people waiting to get in the clubs, with queues, in the casino area, and in the walkway between the Wynn/ Encore.

People on this site complain in reviews because of the cost, Encore has never said that they are inexpensive. if you don't want to spend big money, go to TI or Mirage or another nice place that gives good deals. encore is not that place. I stayed for four nights, three of them comped. between the fourth night, a few meals, and two trips to the spa for my wife, the bill was still nearly $1500. It's not an inexpensive stay, but well worth the money if you can afford it. Now to what Encore is.... Luxury at it's finest. The restaurants are first rate, especially love Wazuzu, but they are all good. pricey, but worth the money. My wife has been to most of the top spa's in town, and finds Encore's to be the best by far. The casino has professional, and personable dealers. say hello to Genet, she is the best of the group. I am not a big pool person, but the two Encore pools are beautiful. I visit Vegas often, and have stayed at Luxor, Hard Rock, Mirage, TI, Bellagio and Wynn before trying Encore. Wynn and Bellagio are great resorts, but they both have something that Encore does not have, gigantic crowds everywhere you turn. Encore has an incredibly wide open floor plan, and because of it's location and price it has remained fairly quiet, even during busy times for Vegas. this is not great for Encore, but it is fantastic for those staying there. you can always find a seat at a table in the casino, waiting times for the restaurants are reasonable, if not non existent. I just can't say enough about it, Encore is the finest. again, don't concern yourself with the negative comments from people who are looking for free buffets and cheap rooms, that is not what Encore is all about. if you want to spend a few days at a top rated hotel with outstanding staff and amenities, then I highly recommend Encore.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado Springs, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cThe Encore is like their grass...FAKE!\u201d", "Author": "maddog3333777", "ReviewID": "UR69665962", "Content": "My wife and I have been to Vegas several times and enjoyed all of our previous trips.

Next time I stay there I will consider complaining if it's not resolved. Don't get me wrong, the place was clean, but I did find a few hairs on the bathroom floor and a cup mark on table. Heard some people saying the walls were thin, not the case as far as I could tell. Every night was quiet while we were there. No riff raff either, lots of security. We brought our own coffee maker because I don't like rushing out of my room in the morning (I'm also too cheap to order room service). I highly recommend you do the same if you need your coffee in the morning like I do. Most Vegas hotels don't provide coffee makers, so we took the situation into our own hands. The hotel is really nice and perhaps one of the best Vegas will ever have. We enjoyed everything about the Encore including how it connects to the Wynn hotel.

We had a great promotion for the room including $25 free slot play and 2 tickets to La Reve. My son\u2019s room was also at a reduced rate although higher than ours. His room included a $50 food credit. The staff were all very gracious and accommodating. La Reve was dark during our stay so we were given a $50 food credit in lieu of the tickets. In addition we were provided with a second upgrade to a panorama view room - strip view. The bellman, Jim, was so helpful. Our rooms weren\u2019t ready when we checked in at 4 p.m. One was ready by 6:30 p.m so we asked for all the bags to be brought to one room about 7 p.m. It was hard to complain when we were given 2 upgrades and placed on the 56th floor. Jim walked us through the controls for the drapes, etc and got us ice. After, he called down to see if the 2nd room was ready and went downstairs to get our room keys for us. When I placed my insulin on ice in the bucket, he called housekeeping for a fridge for my meds, no charge. The rooms are lovely, comfortable and have every amenity. During our stay, the rooms were kept very clean and well stocked. Unlike other reviewers we never heard the nightclub on the 56th floor. Because it was a midweek stay, the hotel was not busy and we benefited with lower limits at the tables -$10 single deck blackjack and $10 pai gow poker. We did O.K. at the tables and I even hit a royal flush in pai gow poker. Since we rented a car, we checked out several other casinos on the strip. No one is busy and the table limits are lower than expected. We went to Okada, Tableau twice and the Wynn buffet (each reviewed). We had room service once (sandwiches) and although the food was fine, the service was great. A table with our food was placed in front of the floor to ceiling windows. Great view to accompany a BLT with fries. Expect to pay 5 star prices but do your research beforehand and make some decisions. Internet charges at $15 a day are ridiculous so I left my laptop at home. The snacks and drinks in the room are also way overpriced - plan ahead. Also, cell service was spotty or nonexistent. I believe in tipping service personal well when they provide good service. The staff was appreciative and gracious to us from the valet staff to the concierge to the front desk.

Since we were there on a special occasion, we were upgraded to the top floor (63rd) with a south view that faced the strip. Here are a list of pros and cons re: Encore; Pros: 1) Fabulous room decor and clean room. The view was over-dominating by the Wynn building south of Encore but overall, a breathtaking view of the strip at night. 2) It is less rowdy than the other hotels, namely the ones more South of the strip so it is a very peaceful couples hotel and more mature (mentally, not age-wise) hotel. 3) If you're into high-end shopping, there is Chanel, LV, Rolex and the necessary big brands for your shopping pleasure. There is also the Fashion Mall across the street with a variety of stores. 4) You get access to 4 different pools - 2 in Encore and 2 in Wynn. 5) The rotating flat screen TV was a nice touch as we were able to comfortably watch tv on our bed and on the couch. 6) Front desk, concierge, bell desk, door man were very friendly and helpful. When we tipped them, they were very appreciative of the tip and made it known that they were very appreciative by sincerely thanking us. Cons: 1) Very disappointed with housekeeping as they were subpar. We have stayed at many high class hotels and the housekeeping at Encore was by far the worst one we have encountered. Don't get me wrong, the regular stuff were cleaned but as a 5-star hotel, it's the little personal attention to details that makes the difference. Our ironing board was not put away, 2 days in a row. They forgot to give us a floor towel for the shower and when our maps dropped to the floor, they failed to kindly just pick it up and put it on the tv stand and instead, just left it on the floor. On the last day, housekeeping left their dirty towel on our desk and that was the last straw. Toiletries were not refilled properly. Also, no turn down services were offered and we didn't know if we were supposed to request for it because other 5-star hotels automatically performed such services while we were out. 2) The location itself is very North of the strip so there will be a lot of walking involved if you wish to reach the South end of the strip. 3) Be prepared for costly meals and drinks at the hotel. The price is expected for a high-end hotel. If you can't afford the food, just walk down the strip and eat somewhere else as the room per night here is not that bad if you get a good deal.

Unlike a lot of strip properties, this place exudes class, has stunning views, luxurious rooms, and delivers on what it promises to be- uberluxury. This all comes with a price that is simply prohibitive. Maybe I'm just jealous because I am not another LA spoiled tot on a weekend in LV on daddy's platinum AMEX, but prices in this hotel are downright stupid. $8 for a cup of coffee is unacceptable. If I had decided to clean out the minibar the tab would have been not quite half a mortgage payment. Maybe things are priced this high to keep out the gangster-thug-life-wanna\u2019-be's I dealt with everywhere else on the North Strip. Why is wifi not free? I felt insulted that if I am paying $300 a night the hotel has a policy that prohibits me from bringing in my own food and beverage. Yea, that's right technically the hotel prohibits you from bringingn in a bottle of wine, leftovers from your over priced dinner with Emeril, or a soda from the 7-11. If I want to go buy a 6 pack and bring it back to my room, at $300 a night, I think I've paid for the privilege. The room is beautiful. The electronic light control and drapes are a neat touch. The rooms are spacious. The bathroom provides a luxury only surpassed in the nicest of homes. My room was quiet. The TV and furniture are excellent. No complaints about the lodging. I don't mind paying for something nice. However, when it gets to the point where I feel taken advantage of, nickel and dimed, and treated like a walking revenue source as opposed to a guest, I can't help but be offended.

That being said, as soon as the music in their nightclub, XS, got started around 10pm, the bass was thumping throughout our room until 4am. And this was 18 floors up. We complained and the perception I got is that this is a fairly regular complaint. The staff moved us the following day to the other end of the building, and while the nightclub noise was dampened, we could still hear the bass. More distrssing, our 2nd room was above the site of the new Beach Club. While changing for dinner one evening, they crew was testing the sound, and despite now being on the 22nd floor, not only could we hear the music, it was loud enough to follow the lyrics. Personally, we are very leery at staying at this hotel again, and have provided some feedback to friends who knew we had stayed at Encore. My biggest complaint is not that the hotel has a nightclub on premises, if the line had been less than 2 hours, we might have gone in ourselves,rather that the hotel seems to be willing to prioritize noise in the rooms and resulting hotel guests discomfort over their desire to run a \"Trendy\" nightclub.

I paid for an upgrade to a panoramic room and upon discovered the agent apparently further upgraded us to a Tower Suite. From what I understand, the Tower Suites are the same room type, but have the following extras: separate valet entrance, check-in desk, concierge, elevators, and pool. We had two bottles of water and newspapers delivered each day and nightly turn-down service. We also noted a special \"for invited guests only\" reception area (only noted guests in there once) and also a private casino for invited guests accessible from the private elevators. Other than these, I'm not sure there are any other differences from the regular rooms. The separate check-in is apparently a big plus-- we arrived late on a Monday evening and were able to walk straight up to the regular check-in (no wait), who informed us of our upgraded room and to go check in at the Tower desk. The rest of our stay, we noted the regular check-in is kind of a mess.... on weekdays it usually had about 50-75 people trying to check in/out from around 11am to about 1 pm. The Tower desk never had more than 2 people waiting and was usually empty. Mind you, these were weekdays. So, our experience: We had a little problem during check-in with the reservation, but it was quickly resolved by the EXCELLENT front desk attendant-- Jessica. While she was working this out on the phone, my wife had mentioned we were on our 20th anniversary (more on that later). Also, we noted from other recent reviews here about the noise from the newly opened Surrender nightclub (glad I checked here again before leaving). I asked about a north-facing room, up high. I noted they had only a couple rooms on the strip-facing side up high. They had at least 10-15 on the north side. It was totally quiet. Didn't even notice any noises from neighbors (up/down/sides). She set us up on the 52nd floor. I will note that north-facing rooms look out onto the last of the old strip and downtown (Circus Circus, Stratosphere, Riviera, the stalled (but pretty) Fontainebleau right in the middle of the view, and the stalled (but nasty and ugly) Echelon site to the left. After getting to our room, we noted the place was immaculately clean. I see occasional reviews on here re: cleanliness issues. Our room was perfect. After settling in for a bit, we decided to order room service. Now, I'm used to room service being generally expensive in any hotel, so I was prepared to see the prices. Turns out, many of the items were about the same room service prices you'd see in 3-4 star hotels (note: a $5 room charge PLUS an 18% gratuity is automatically added). I decided to splurge on a $35 steak, just because we were celebrating. We were told it would be about 30 minutes. After 10 minutes, a knock was on the door... turned out not to be the dinner, but one of the staff members presenting a welcoming gift of 4-6 huge chocolate-covered strawberries in an edible chocolate bowl... with a wonderful hand-written note from Jessica at the front desk congratulating us on our anniversary and welcoming us to \"TSE\" (Tower Suites Encore). An EXCELLENT touch, Jessica. (Steve Wynn-- we noted on the news most every night how staffing cuts and shortened workdays were just being resolved while we were there... give Jessica a bonus and a personal, hand-written note that her service went above our expectations). ;) So, another 5 minutes later, maid service came for nightly turn-down service. We declined, since we were eager to eat and settle in. After a total of about 40 minutes, the room service arrived. I wish I noted the attendant's name (sorry!), but he had also delivered the strawberries. He did a fantastic job. BTW, the steak was perfect. I seriously don't think I've had another steak that good. I was actually happy to have spent $100 on room service that night. So...the rest of our stay-- We welcomed the nightly turn-down service, once we received it on our second night while we had been out. The room lighting was dimmed, the TV was set to a nice \"mood\" channel (desert scenes, classical music), a couple mints, and two sets of slippers arranged on wither side of the bed on top of a white napkin-like floor mat... and of course, covers turned down. Another nice touch. Weekdays appear to be a perfect time to visit. A friend of mine noted the \"LA Trash\" (his words, not mine LOL) come up on Thurs or Fri nights. The resort was not crowded at all during this week. Casino was bare until about 9pm. Be prepared for the higher end table minimums... $15/$25 blackjack was the normal minimums. Pool attendants were hit-or-miss.... for about an hour they circulated fairly regularly, then vanished for an hour. We had to request one.... took 30 minutes for her return with just a soda (she also delivered lunch to another guest). BTW, as others have noted, that's a $5 soda. As noted frequently here, the food prices are a bit out of control. We actually decided to skip the restaurants, just to see what other hotels had to offer (price-wise). Also, just to note. Others have commented on A/C and problems with the remote controls for lighting/shades/curtains. Ours worked perfectly. Absolutely not a single problem. Overall pros: - Fantastic staff, especially in the Tower Suites - Beautiful property. Totally upscale. - Nice to have a separate pool for the Tower Suites... plenty of lounges and room around the two much smaller pools in this area (they are actually over at the Wynn). - Extra touches were much appreciated - For the price (with Internet specials etc), the value of the room is great, especially with our upgrade. We've dropped $250/night at some crappy dives. This room was well worth the ~$133/night I paid. - The bathroom was huge; fixtures/design were nice - Weekdays and north-facing room = nice respite from the constant over-stimulation of walking the Strip, although the view isn't pretty... that's for sure. Cons: - Food prices are rough. Again, I understand the quality is supposed to be 5-star, so I understand what Steve Wynn was going for. If the economy were better, maybe the place would be full and people would pay the prices. From what I could tell, the restaurants were pretty barren most evenings (I didn't see all of them, though). - Pretty much everything is expensive. - Internet service is $13 per 24-hr period (if I recall correctly). A bit of gouging, considering what it actually costs them to provide it. I bet they'd recoup their costs for that service if they reached a lower price point. I decided not to use it at all. If it were $5-7, I probably would have used it every day. - I wish there were a couple lower stakes table games. I have a hard time justifying even $15 per hand of blackjack. I decided to play video blackjack and was entertained for at least 2 hours over two of our nights. Only lost $6 on $60 total at-stake. Taking the free drinks into account, that's about 10 drinks for about $16 (incl. tips). ;) -- this is only a slight con... and could be a pro for the right guests: the new club Surrender appears to be a new hot spot for the wannabe party crowd. On weekdays, lines aren't forming until after 11pm. We were stuck on Eastern time through most of our trip, so we didn't even bother checking it out, but it looks like it could be a bit of a nuisance if you are old and crotchety and can't stand a bunch of young people having fun. ;) If you are that kind of guest, skip the Strip-facing view and take a north-facing room... and head to bed before 11. Final Recommendations for guests: - Stay for the luxury/room value, but go elsewhere if you want cheaper food (still hard to find elsewhere). - If you fly in, I highly recommend renting a car. Parking at all hotels/casinos is free on the Strip... you can see other hotels and eat at any of them without much difficulty. Most have food courts... their prices looked a little closer to \"normal\" for the most part. Also, if you want to avoid traffic on the Strip, there are feeder roads to the east and west that run parallel to the Strip. EASY to get to the south end of the Strip on one of them. - As noted frequently here, take full advantage of the Walgreen's just a block north. - Golfing-- I understand from a friend that the greens fees were $500. If you just can't wait to play for $500/round, then this is your place!!!! In the 4 mornings I checked the course from our window, I noted no more than a total of maybe 4 groups on the course the entire time. - unrelated to the Encore specifically, but if you go to Hoover Dam, get out there before 9AM. We were glad we did. The security checkpoint allows only one car at a time. We were in a line of 6 cars when we arrived there around 9am. We left back for Vegas around 11:30 and the single line of cars waiting for the checkpoint stretched almost 3 miles. - also unrelated to Encore-- if you want to see a beautiful, natural desert landscape, go out to Red Rock National Conservation Area. Go in the morning... it was surprisingly cooler there than back in Vegas (about 5\u00b0 and a nice breeze). It's an easy drive. Final Recommendations for Wynn: - Shower: do something about the gap between the shower stall door and the vertical wall of the seat area. If the shower head is pointing to that lower hinge on the door, water hits the vertical marble and streams along its surface, right out through the gap in the door. The first night, we had a bit of a puddle running towards the sink. The rest of our stay, we had to point the shower down more towards the drain and away from the stall door. It worked out, but the initial flooding was a bit of a surprise/scare. - Toilet room: already noted here several times--- no active fan. There is what appears to be a passive vent, but I tested and there was no negative air pressure. If these vents were designed to actually vent this area, you need to do something about upping that flow. (further comments/descriptions withheld). ;) - Get rid of the $13 (?) per day Internet. I realize these charges are common across all ranges of hotels, but in a tourist destination, the convenience of free or much cheaper Internet access would have been nice. Next time, I won't bother bringing a laptop. Overall-- I would recommend Encore Tower Suites for couples wanting to be pampered. Absolutely a great stay. If you are one of those picky people who expects to be treated like a queen/king and are put off by the smallest things (things I frequently see in reviews on TripAdvisor), I'd like to challenge you to find fault at the Tower Suites, but then again, I'd rather you take your attitude somewhere else, so you don't ruin this place for when I return. :D Also, I rated Value as a 4-- Compared to other top-tier Vegas hotels, you can find lower room rates and better food prices. Compared to other, **similar quality** hotels (found elsewhere), I believe the rooms and accommodations appear to be EXCEPTIONAL value (price)..... the food prices are probably \"right\" for 5-star restaurants... just not great value.

They stayed in the Wynn, we stayed in the Encore. Encore rooms are a little newer/bigger. The two hotels are connected via a five minute walk through a shopping area. The room was well planned. It had nice touches like power operated drapes, a good sized plasma TV with real HD in the main area plus another TV in the bathroom, a tub big enough for two adults, and a \"Privacy\" light you could activate from the bed. We were getting ready to settle in for the first night when I grabbed the ice bucket to bring some ice back to the room. That's when I noticed a pair of soiled underwear in the bucket from the prior guest. I called the front desk, and I was told they would send someone \"right up.\" Forty five minutes later (it's almost midnight by now) someone shows up with an ice bucket. It's bad enough housekeeping missed the underwear but getting the ice bucket should have been a 10 minute wait, even if it meant grabbing one out of an empty guest room. Not what I would expect from a hotel that touts itself as one of the best in Vegas. Not much else went wrong, but the underwear in the ice bucket was a doozie. I'll come back on a discount, but no way at full rate. Tips: -There is a Walgreen's just north of the hotel. Exit via the valet area and head north one light. It's a good place to buy water, sunscreen, booze, etc. -The Encore parking structure is on the north side of the Wynn/Encore property. -The Saturday brunch is good but overpriced at $32/person. -The sportsbook at the Wynn is really weak, with poor ventilation and only a couple of small HD displays (there are a bunch of large displays, but they are SD).

Best view I have ever had at a Vegas hotel - and may ever have in Vegas. 56th floor facing the south side. Pros - the property is visually incredible all over. Pool was great. Room was solid - better than the Venetian stay of a few years ago. Remote control shades and lights, the swivel TV and the nice bathroom. I liked the location. Even though it's on the north edge of the main strip, Palazzo, Venetian, Mirage and Caesars were an easy walk. We had outstanding dinners at Delmonico and Carnevino at Venetian/Palazzo. We also liked Grand Lux as a reasonable option for breakfast/lunch at Palazzo. Cons - we got a great rate and upgrade price but everything else was expensive, but that was expected. It felt a lot like our stay at Atlantis Paradise Island - $14 pool cocktails, $5 cokes, etc. There was also some weird smell in the hallway between the elevators and the room but that was it. Also be aware that the Encore Beach Club/Surrender is really loud and goes well after midnight. It didn't bother us but we could still hear it on the 56th floor.

This hotel is superb, truly, with one (as we see it) fatal flaw. Most of the reviews cover the pros of this place (which I wholeheartedly agree with), so I just want to share the bad. Fast forward to our Friday night. We got back up to our room around 2am to discover someone had set up a DJ booth in the room next door. Wait, no that's not coming from any of the rooms, that's coming from the pool area. Oh, the club XS has taken over the pool and is blaring the most annoying and repetitive bass-pounding music in the world (like all other clubs on the strip do) OUTSIDE!!! My wife and I could not believe how loud it was from 27 floors up. Well, we are pretty heavy sleepers (we live within two blocks of a train) so we just tried to go to sleep. After more than a handful of false starts, we conceded to the fact that sleep wasn't happening. Called down to the front desk and was told the club will be open until 4am, and they could send up some ear plugs. We got our earplugs quickly, but they were not much help against the super low frequency of the protruding bass thumping. Even asked for an extended check-out time since we had to wait until 4am to get any form of solid sleep, but was denied. I'd sum it up like this: The Encore is like dating the perfect person, falling in love, then discovering they're a closet meth addict.

This time I had a 61st floor panoramic view suite which is 2 off the top. Firstly the suite is really nothing more than the Wynn Hotel and in some ways the furnishings are not as good. This trip was in 4 different hotels and I booked all suites for my 3 week trip but the facilities at the Encore were the poorest. The room was nice and the view was good but it lacks many of the facilities provided almost everywhere now. No free internet ($14 per day), no coffee maker, no fridge, and no waterprovided in the room even on arrival. I felt costs were being shaved all the time here even to the lack of secutity in the hotel caompared to my last 2 stays at the Wynn. It should be said this hotel is geared very much for the 20 and 30 year olds and the noise from the beach club and the night clubs on the site seems never ending. Even on floor 61 you get the thump thump from the poolside XS night club thill 4am for at least 4 night a week. Other people on lower floors must have been really disturbed and when the club comes out at 4am the noise moves to the floor corridors. I know Vegas at weekend is a bit of a zoo with drunks and noise but the Encore is particularly bad. When I complained I was ofered a rear room with a view of the derelict shops behind. From Friday to Monday the pool is jam packed and they have a DJ on who seems to think loudest is best. There is no escaping it and even with earphones on I could not hear my Ipod over the loud clubbing music blaring out of every bush in the area. From Tuesday to Thursday is is ok with only the non stop softer volume samba music. Drinking in and around the pool at weekends leads to everyone shouting to be heard above the music so the noise becomes even worse. It is a beautiful place but it is being wasted for those of us who are older and clearly we are not the market for the Encore. Staff even told us that when the XS comes out there is trouble with fights and over consumption of alcohol. Four years ago my wife saved th e ives of 2 girls who had slipped into the pool at the Wynn after taking too much alcohol in the afternoon heat.

Having stayed at the convention hotel previously and not liking it, we decided to choose another hotel on the north end of the strip. We wavered between Trump, the Ventian and the Wynn properties. I'm really glad that we chose Encore. First of all, it's at the northern-most part of the main strip. Secondly, although the Wynn and Encore are still big hotels, they are by no means the behemoths that some of the other casino/hotel compounds have become. No big malls, and the in-house theaters are somewhat secluded. Both of these mean that it's quite a bit tamer than some of the more expansive properties. We like that, but if you're looking for super high energy, it might not be the place for you. The rooms are huge by hotel standards. The bathroom is three times the size of mine at home and had a separate toilet room, double sinks, shower and big soaking tub. The toiletries were the very nice, and the housekeepers were very generous in replenishing them. The room had a separate \"living room\" with a couch and desk. The \"bedroom\" was spacious and the bed was comfortable. Everything was extremely clean and still had a \"new\" feel. We were on the 35th floor facing north, and didn't experience any noise issues that others have complained about, even over the weekend. They claim to be a 5-star resort, but this is a little questionable only because there is little to zero as far as personalized service is concerned. All of the staff we interacted with were very nice and helpful, but at other 5-star hotels I've stayed at I'd always be greeted personally, and most times by name, I'd get turn down service, as well as a call in the room to make sure everything was okay. The lack of this didn't bother me in the least, since I prefer to be more of an anonymous guest (and I guess it would be awfully hard to do this with more than 2000 rooms) but when you're claiming 5-star I think this would be the expectation. I'm also not complaining too much because we got an awesome deal by buying a bundled air/hotel deal with one of the big online travel agencies. Everyone who is saying that you get nickeled and dimed is correct. Internet is $15/day, the gym is $30/day. The smallest coffee in the lobby (and it is pretty small) is $3.50.

To top all of I requested a refrigerator and they wanted $25 per night for a small dorm fridge the probably only costs $75 or less at any Walmart. The hotel was aesthetically pleasing but that is were it ends. Everything is just extremely overpriced.

My best tip for the first-timer after staying there for two days and nights is to max out your amenities if you get any and ask a million questions at check-in because it will help you navigate the large properties. The crowd was very \"las vegas\" and not as high-roller as I expected when reading the reviews beforehand. Most people seemed to gamble periodically - but not much high roller activity that I could see. Throngs of people though the weekend after Memorial Day. Checkout bill was exactly as expected - no hidden surprises. Suggest checking out the mini bar when you first walk in the room - mine was missing a bottle of liquor (and they cost approx $9 each for the mini bottles) - there are signs that state your bags can be inspected before entering the hotel and no outside food or drink - but they do not enforce it - again too many people to realistically enforce this rule. So expect to pay $4 for a coke and $3 for a cup of coffee each and every time you want something to drink - that's a budget of $25 a day or so just to keep hydrated. No water fountains anywhere - suggest stocking up at the walgreen's immediately upon arrival. Lots of crazy people running trhough the walkways and restaurants - but it's Vegas.

What we didn't know is that our room was directly above the new Beach Club which is also a night club called Surrender in the evening.

The crowd the clubs attracted was so rowdy that we actually had a stranger bang on our door screaming for us to open up at 4:30 AM. WHERE IS SECURITY??? The afternoon at the European pool was also extremely rowdy. There were at least two drunken groups of partiers that were removed from the pool area. Even the cocktail waitresses were getting abused.

Here we go (in chronological order): 1) Suites are supposed to be ready by 3pm for check-in. Our 2 tower suites weren't made available until 6pm on the day of arrival. 2) We went to the newly opened Encore beach club on the Saturday. When we checked our bill on check-out, there was a spurious $510 additional gratuity that had been added. When we queried the charge, it was reversed immediately without investigation. This suggests that it's a common event. That is shocking. 3) We reserved a table at the Encore beach club for the Sunday, This was agreed to be a $3,000 minimum spend the day before. On the Sunday, we stood in queue for an hour, despite having a table reservation. The hosts of the club were telling the table reservation line that groups would only be moved forwards if they tipped. Basically soliciting a gratuity. When I complained to the hotel, they said that the beach club was run by a separate company and there was little that they could do about it. Escalation proved ineffective. To make matters worse, the host at the beach club then said that the table was a $5,000 minimum spend. Essentially there were just trying to squeeze people as much as possible despite prior agreements. 4) We stayed in the tower suites on the 9th floor. The newly opened outdoor nightclub, Surrender was so loud that you could hear the music very clearly in the suite. They hadn't considered additional soundproofing. 5) Room service food took over an hour every time that we ordered. One time, we complained and were told that the food would be complimentary. When we checked the bill on check-out we had been charged. All in all, it was a disastrous weekend for the Encore. Their beach club is a racket where the Encore deny all responsibility by saying it's run by a separate company. Escalation within the Encore hotel management chain doesn't get you anywhere which means that the beach club continues to get away with it. The hotel management didn't come back to us with an explanation for any of the above points and I had to continually chase them for answers. Finally, the only thing that the management did for us was to reverse the $510 gratuity which shouldn't have been on the bill in the first place!

The check-in desk resembled a train station ticket desk as bulging; luggaged queues were 8 deep as the many desk clerks furiously tapped into their consoles. On reaching the front we were given a very friendly welcome and gave our name. As the clerk entered our details she told us there were no King suites currently available as it was now just past 3pm and this was now the busiest check-in time but we could take a double Queen Suite or wait until a king became available up to which the hotel would call to notify. Having pre-booked a King suite we were a little annoyed one was not available and opted to wait. We were told we would need to come back to the room card collection desk once a room was ready. We decided to join the back of this queue and take a chance on a room becoming available as we were eager to shower, change and relax by the pool. On speaking with the new clerk and re-explaining we were on our honeymoon, he was able to offer us a free upgrade to a panoramic suite with strip view straight away which we immediately accepted! The room was amazing from the chez-lounge by the floor to ceiling windows, the bedside controlled electric sheer and blackout curtains to the double shower, deep sloped bath and super comfy king sized bed. The views were mesmerising with a prime position taken on the chez-lounge, my only gripe would be it faced away from the strip - but even then. Service was as Impeccable as you would expect from a hotel of this class with staff seemingly not able to do enough for you either when asked or if you passed them in the corridors. The European pool area is he place to head for if you plan to sunbath as the loungers are more evenly spread than the main pool where it's crowded. The pool bar and gambling tables are also situated there if you want to escape to the shade but still enjoy being outside. Drinks and poolside snacks equally are as expensive as you'd expect in Vegas with 2 mojitos costing around $30 (or 2 beers and a shrimp cocktail the same). With its Location further down the strip, there is a danger of feeling a little out of the thick of things but the Encore more than makes up for its decision to not be a themed hotel and once inside it really is a tough decision to ever leave and visit anywhere else. The television runs several Wynn infomercial channels, showing Steve Wynn talking you through the hotel, its facilities as well as its vision as a destination. With handfuls of restaurants, cafes, designer stores, bars and premier clubs there's plenty to keep those not wanting to lose it all on the gambling floor busy - after all every casino/hotel wants to keep you spending your cash with them for as long as possible. We ate at the Zoozacrackers - their take on a New York deli (not as good by far but a fair attempt). The pizza slice - another challenge on NY pizza (a pretty good alternative with really good pasta sauce). As well as their fine dining, multi award winning restaurant, Alex. The service here is impeccable, from the greeting at the door to being shown to our table down the grand staircase to the waiting staff. The sommelier found us a great bottle of red to match our meagre budget without making us feel uncomfortable at having one! The food? Amazing, 5 courses ending with our Achilles heel of a cheese board and even our own congratulatory chocolate cake to mark our honeymoon. Both my wife (stil not used to calling her that!) and I had always said if we ever returned to Las Vegas, we would want to stay at the Wynn but as we researched further we found the Encore to be more to our taste and design. Once there, we were more than satisfied with our choice as while the Wynn is a lovely hotel with a better pool and cabanas (just choose your spot with care as larger sections do fall into shadow early afternoon), the Encore benefits from a seemingly different agenda with less gambling tables, higher ceilings and more windows allowing for natural light (a Vegas no-no to have any indication on time).

One triple had a foldaway and the other triple (11th) had 2 queen beds. (Apparently this is usually an upgrade as most rooms are king as standard). The 11th (mine) was one huge big room; the 14th rooms had the separate sitting area. This was best in my opinion. I wanted to watch the Liverpool v Chelsea game at 5.30am on the Sunday. I enquired on check in and reception made a phone call and advised that Sportsbook in the Wynn was open 24/7. I walked across and checked, 4 guys in total assured me it would be on. We all unpacked and went to bed as we had been awake for 36hours!!!! But no chance of sleep as the noise from XS nightclub was unbelievable. At 5 I went down to the Wynn Sportsbook and it was CLOSED!!! Knackered and not happy I was informed that it\u2019s never been open 24/7!!!! Anyway after 5 various staff members later (who were all very helpful) they got it on a screen for me in the Poker Room. (Shouldn\u2019t have bothered, we got beat 2-0) My room mates at least grabbed some sleep as the music had stopped after 4ish. On Saturday they have the pool open which is why it\u2019s so noisy but it was fine for the next 6 nights with no noise.

There is no way they can enforce that one so why even bother with the signage. Steve, I'd be OK with that if you can price your food and drinks accordingly. I'm sorry, but I'm not paying $30 for a \"Wynn breakfast\" (that doesn't even include the \"service charge\" or tip).

On a side note, I had booked a Strip View but due to construction of the new Encore Beach Club I decided to opt for a pool view instead.

And, staying at the Encore really hit the high notes for a nice, short vacation. As everyone has commented, the casino decor will have you wearing sunglasses inside, but hey this is Vegas--where the more gaudy you are, the more you fit in! Everyone kept telling me how nice the place was, but when I got here, I wasn't so impressed--lots of color, especially red, lots of bling, deep deep bars with rows of impressive liquor, plush carpeting, butterfly motifs--just kind of what I expected from Vegas. It took me until the last day to really appreciate the Encore, because by then I've visited several other casinos and each time I came back, I felt a relative sense of serenity and relief. We registered at the Wynn, asked for as high a floor as possible and they put us on the 29th floor, without an upgrade. It turns out they have, I believe, three sets of elevators: one for fls 1-30, one for flrs 31-64; and another set in the other corner of the casino for the tower suites. The even number rooms face South, which will give you a view of the strip--the higher even numbers will have your strip view partially blocked by the Wynn hotel, and you will be closer to the XS nightclub, which can be quite loud when they open the pool area up to 4am. If you're the partying type, ask for low even numbers; if you're a light sleeper and staying over the weekend, ask for odd numbers so you're on the other side of XS. The suites(they're all suites) are the antithesis of Vegas--simple elegant lines, easy beige/black colors, comfortable functional, modern classic furniture, thoughtful amenities like automatic curtain/sheers, separate hand showerheads, bathroom tvs, and a swivel flatscreen for bed and living room viewing. Service was prompt and professional: being addressed by name by hotel operators; we were missing a remote, and within minutes a short tuxed fellow presented us with a remote on a platter. It really was comforting returning to this hotel after a day of walking and sightseeing. The casino is muted, almost hushed tones compared to all the other casinos, and especially in light of its flamboyant decor. I don't like a lot of bells and whistles the rare times I gamble, so this was very pleasant and comfortable. Everyone was very professional and helpful, and seemed to enjoy where they work. Some cons: staying at the hotel doesn't comp you into XS, although they do let you cut in line if you pay full price. Nor does it help you cut in the buffet line. There is a fridge ONLY for their beverages, and food from outside is strongly discouraged, so what do you do with leftovers? You have to drive through the entire LV blvd to get to the hotel, so figure out some shortcuts. The pool closes early, but I guess all Vegas pools do so you'll go back inside and spend money. $15 a day for wireless.

There are two ABC stores inside the mall for you to buy water and other grocery items. The pool area at Encore is also one of the best.

We got the $7 unlimited champagne, which was wonderful and we thought the buffet was delicious and well worth the money.

The bathroom has two sinks, marble shower, full tub, a full complement of towels and robes, separate TV in the wall, a good selection of amenities, and solid core doors everywhere.

Both pools have an European section (topless) that is becoming de regiur, at the bigger strip hotels. It looks as though the Encore is adding another pool area. The terrace caf\u00e9 at the Wynn has dining on the pool deck, but there are bars with some food service at both pools. Lots of free parking, and, unlike a lot of the other strip hotels, close and convenient to the room elevators. Parking is in the back of the hotel past the main Encore entrance. Encore is no different than other strip hotels, and charges $14 for 24 hours of Internet. There is no resort fee (avoid these hotels) but has the high Las Vegas tax rate. Starbucks is across the street where you can get AT&T or T-Mobile internet if you have access to those accounts. While I still prefer the aura of the Bellagio, here the rooms are bigger and nicer, at a comparable rate.

So check with them first before you charge a buffet to your room! The buffets were okay, nothing great, but plentiful and decent. No rooms comped since we were there on a deal.

We travelled to the Encore for our honeymoon and where not disapointed. i will start at the beggining in the hope you may get some helpful tips. The distance from airport is minimal. However if we returned we would choose to get a taxi on arrival as it would take maybe 10-15min and the shuttle took us to at least 4 different hotels before ours so took about 50-60min. The check in also can take about 30min so be prepared. However this was not really an issue and all the staff are very friendly. The decore throughout this hotel is stunning, stunning , stunning. This continues through to the Wynn...you can walk through a prominade of (very expensive) shops and into the Wynn. If you want to go to the mall across the road i suggest walking through to the wynn and out by their street entrance to casino by the water fall , saves a big walk. Ladies that are like me new to gambling go and find the \"Sex in the City \" slots in the Wynn they are great and tend to pay out better than any others. We saw the La reve show here and it was fantastic. we paid for VIP as our honeymoon and so glad we did. Choc strawberrys and bottle of champagne inc (should be for price) and very large comfy seats. However if not our honeymoon wld still have gone and normal seats would have been just fine, nice small theatre so can see so much detail. Food: Society in Encore is so nice. casual wear at any point, great food, great atmosphere and great coktails! Beautiful boutique style. Best breakfast...found this too late .....Its called Buffet and is in the Wynn. WOW beautiful flower and fruit orniments hang from ceiling. Cant name what they havent got!! so much to choose and very very good food. Tasted american dishes i had never had. Also pasteries and cakes...pancakes, salmon...etc etc. And a reasonable price for around there. One thing i did not like...no kettle in the room. so one tea with two cups was $16.60. Bit pricey! I do love my tea though. Golfers....a must this course is amazing again. My husband loved the course and found the caddie very friendly and gave lots of tips to help. Advised to tip caddie. We went on the upgraded package to hoover dam. In a big pink 4x4 LOVED IT. for me the best part of the trip was being able to go down ont the lake. It is a restricted area no other trips go there so just you. And it was beautiful. If i was to advise anyone it would be spend the money as i personally found the rest of the trip a bit bland so would have been disapointed if that was all i had done. Resturants..... Wazuzu really nice. SW steakhouse very nice too gets busy so make sure you book. Also one of the pricey rest. But to be honest as they have some of the best chef in the world there can you really get a bad meal???? One negative for me as a non smoker was obviously the smoke. Gets really bad in the evening. I really did not like this but nothing can be done. And it in no way affected my stay, but if i could i would chane it...im ssure many , inc my husband who smokes , would disagree.

A bit annoying but not reflective on the staff, more the idea that Monday thru Wednesday you can roam freely and uninterupted yet when there could be the odd Garth Brooks sighting or whomever the Wynn consideres Royles Royce worthy it becomes a hassel to all that are enjoying their stay. Either always have the security regulations or find a way to not impede on the clients who are their to enjoy the stay and not people watch. Also, after a long day of sight seeing in Las Vegas, water therapy should be available either in a different venue than the spa or have the spa water therapies open longer than eight in the evening.

No help with our bags, one hop wandered our way but quickly left. Maybe our 2 bags was too many. We arrived at the hotel around 9 am.

Then a New Yorker cut in front of us (you can just spot a New Yorker a mile away). We told them we were here to check in and they took our info but said no rooms were available and said they would call us between noon and 3pm. I had to ask for an up grade, $25 for strip view per night, 20 for mountain view. They called us at 1:00pm with our room. We were given a room on the 56th floor. Gorgeous room, excellent bed, wonderful view of the strip, very quiet, service and staff were excellent, pool was very nice. We spent most of our time at the European Pool (adults only), which was very quiet and classy. Topless sunbathing is OK here, but in 3 days I think we only saw one female doing this. Our only complaint about the pool is that they should have had drinking water in a few more locations around the pool. They only had one, at each pool, and it was quite a hike to get to (maybe done purposefully to get you to order drinks?). They had a nice, private way to get to the pool by going through the spa area. That way you didn't have to walk through the lobby. While walking through the spa we overheard the spa employee tell someone that the workout room is free if you have a spa treatment, otherwise it's $30.00 a day. We weren't thinking about working out, but that certainly would have made us choose not to. Wireless internet is available in the room, but costs $14.00 per day. I thought in such a classy place they should have that for free. Complimentary in room safe. We ate at SW Steakhouse and sat outside by the water feature, we both ordered the ribeye steak with blue cheese topping. Must have insulted the chef because he smoothered my prime cut with blue cheese. That is all I could taste. Just a little touch of blue cheese would have been much better. Steaks were $57 each, we split creamed spinach $10, blue cheese topping $5, featured red wine from France $14 per glass (very good). We at the buffet beakfast $18 each. Very good, two stations empty but there were plenty of choices. We had the asian salad $12 and turkey sandwich $11 twice by the pool for lunch. Very large portions. My wife and I shared it and it is very filling. We went to the La Reve show at the Wynn, free with our package, and loved it. Show was in the center with seating all around. I do not think there is a bad seat in the house. We we seated in row F and I am glad I was not any closer. The consierge printed our boarding pass for us upon departure (complimentary).

Encore was developed by Steve Wynn, who envisioned the Mirage, Bellagio, and Encore's big sister, the Wynn, which is connected to Encore by a shopping esplanade. Encore is, according to one of the front desk staff, \"the culmination of everything Steve Wynn learned from his previous hotels.\" It's smaller and newer but a little taller than the Wynn, but has all the luxuries. The standard room is about 700 square feet and includes a sitting area. Bathrooms are amazing, even by Vegas standards. It's all in the details at Encore, from the attentive service to the authentic antiques decorating the individual casino salons; from the bath products to the fabulous bed. It's worth booking the panoramic view room (a $25 per night upgrade), which puts you on one of the top floors. Ask for a south-facing room for the best view of the strip. Be sure to visit Encore's spa as it's also the best I've ever seen. Gain all-day access to the fitness area and water therapy rooms for $30, which are free if you have a treatment or salon service. Encore's first-rate concierge desk can help you with directions and recommendations\u2013\u2013especially helpful when traveling alone. Security is subtle but tight, and both Wynn and Encore's top-notch restaurant servers will protect you from an awkward solo dining experience. The feel of Encore is that of a boutique hotel.

We had #20 which is on the upper level closest to the stairs. The pool bar and casino, spa tub, and wonderful pool are right at the base of the stairs. This was our first cabana and will not be our last. 4) The variety and quality of food is astounding. Combined with offereings at Wynn next door, the choices are endless. Be sure to check out the \"Taste of Wynn\" menus at each of the fine dining venues - they are a great value for money. 5) We were in the basic resort king and it was anything but basic. What a great room. bed (one of the best ever), linens, furnishings, tub, bath products, and the list goes on. The TVs in the room carry many music stations including a \"Soundscapes\" option which was perfect for soaking the tub. I lost track of reality. 6) The casino is so bright and easily laid out on a grid you could find your way in an instant. We are slot players and played the whole time we were there. If you're picky about your slot, you'll find a broader selection down the esplanade at Wynn. 7) The service was 95% spot on. So polite, welcoming and friendly. Professional too. From the bell staff - to the casino hosts - to the restaurants - to the concierge. 8) La Reve was beautiful, inspiring and worth the price.

Check-in was a little chaotic and the reception staff a wee bit off-hand. Not rude. Just a bit frosty. The rooms are lovely, quite modern, large enough, with a separate sitting room area with a huge sofa near the floor to ceiling windows. Stunningly comfy beds with remote control curtains, sheers, lights, privacy button, Ipod station. Large LCD TV at the foot of the bed with some good channels. Bathroom is huge too, with an LCD TV. Bath is nice and deep but a little on the short side - no big surprise for most hotels. We had a high-ish floor (39) and noise was never an issue. We was offered an upgrade (at a cost) to a higher floor but didn't see the need. There is a gym, but it costs $30 a day which I thought was a bit of a con. The Encore casino was our favourite - we are not big gamblers, so it was nice to avoid the crowds and the smoke (it is a smoking casino as are all the others, but it never seemed intrusive - good aircon I guess). Tables had minimum bets of $15, but we had hours of fun with $5 and the blackjack machines (big spenders!). There's a bit of a red theme going on, which i quite liked - gave it a luxurious feel. I can understand other comments about it not being very exciting - It was pretty quiet, due to its location at the end of the strip I suppose, but that suited me. I liked walking around the other casino's then escaping back to the Encore for a drink and a flutter. The waitresses are friendly and courteous. Other casinos seemed a bit grubby by comparison. We didn't really use the restaurants or shops (all top-end & expensive) in the hotel as its just over the road to the Fashion Show Mall which is way cheaper. The food court came in useful and the coffee shop at the back of the mall on the lower level near the catwalk is more the half the price of the hotel coffee shop. Once you can find the exits (maybe it's just me, but they are never signed and you can walk for miles and not find the exit you want) It's an easy walk to the fashion show mall, The Pallazzo (used First Restaurant - very nice and not too expensive), The Venetian, and Treasure Island with the Gallions and the Siren show (which you have to see just to appreciate how bad it is!) I would use this hotel again and none of the others we saw looked nearly as nice.

The housekeeping staff were brilliant. Honestly i could not flaw any of the staff everybody was so friendly to us. It seemed like every staff member was so genuinely grateful for the business during theses times of recession. The hotel is totally amazing you could spend the day walking around admiring the decor . The hotel is expensive but i found everything in Vegas costly , Only Fault in the hotel is the pool area is a bit small for the amount of people staying in the hotel but one of the Pool Attendants did tell me that the hotel is building a new swimming pool area and it will be open this May. We walked around other hotel s in the strip and found them to be very crowded and shabby , i never felt the Encore was crowded at all even when the hotel is full. I would highly recommend the Restaurant called The Maggianos in the Fashion Show Mall across from the Wynn and Encore Hotels . It was really lovely the food was amazing except the portions are hugh so make sure u only order the half portions honestly its even hard to finish the half portions. The Encore was really wonderful , We also got tickets for Garth Brooks , and i can honestly he was fantastic , I would nt call myself a hugh Garth Fan but i was totally blown away it was just the best and such good value.

Even though they spent the money to make the hotel look like a 5 star, the service was a bit lacking. Arrived at check-in, we were helped relatively quickly. They didn't seem too busy at that time. The service did feel a little impersonal and fake. Ended up agreeing to an upgrade to a higher floor (62) with a panoramic view. We got such a great deal, thought why not, plus we didn't want to be disturbed by any noise as mentioned by previous reviewers. However, they failed to tell us it was the \"mountain\" vs. \"strip\" view. So felt a bit conned. But whatever, it was fine. The room itself is alright. Big enough, there were only the 2 of us. The decor looked nice, especially since the hotel is relatively new; the bed itself was quite comfortable, There is no fridge to use as it was stocked with their own items; there was a small slip of paper warning you that you had a time limit to pick up items before it was charged to your card. Internet was extra so didn't bother. Housekeeping did not do a very good job maintaining the room, items were still dusty. Another thing was that we had left some items in a plastic bag that we used as a laundry bag, and they ended up throwing it away! Never have we had that happen at any place we've stayed at. Not impressed. The decor of the hotel was a bit too flashy for my liking - used too much red in everything, esp for the chandeliers in some areas. Played at the casino; the minimum for some tables were pricier than at some casinos. The cigarette smoke made us feel nauseous after a while, but that's in all the casinos. The pool at Encore was closed for renovations, we wandered by the pool at Wynn, but it ended up being too chilly for a dip. Didn't try many of the restaurants there, but as we had hotel credit as part of our package, we went to Tableau for breakfast per recommendation by a friend. The food was tasty, albeit pricey. The setting was lovely, we got a seat by the window, and with the sun warming our faces, I could have sat there for hours. We also went to the Lobby Bar one night for late night drinks. The cocktail my fiance had was tasty, and my white wine refreshing. The seats were comfy, and perfect for people watching. Location wise, it was more towards one end of the strip, which we didn't mind. We ended up getting a 3 day bus pass ($15) which starts counting time the first time you use it. The \"Deuce\" bus ran 24hours and we took it into downtown and figured out which bus took us to the outlet mall so we didn't need to take taxis. Although you had to wait at times, it saved us some money. All in all, Encore is a huge modern hotel, with mediocore service.

Walk into most Casino Hotels on the Strip and you are immediately assaulted by the smell. Not so at the Encore, OR the Wynn for that matter. THANK YOU, Steve Wynn! :) There is a lot to do without even leaving the hotel, which I also enjoyed. Shops, restaurants, nightclubs, casino, AND great shows, all in one place. The Wynn and the Encore are connected by an upscale shopping mall, by the way. I cannot say enough about our amazing stay here. It is at the end near the Stratosphere. Fine location, unless your show is at the MGM Grand (as our Bon Jovi Concert was). One thing I didnt like: paying 4-6 dollars (depending on the size) for a bottle of water in the convenience store. Crazy! Walk across the street toward the Palazzo, and there is a WalGreens right on the strip in front of the Palazzo. Also, dont bother with the RED 2 story sightseeing bus, unless you want to sit for a few hours. It will set you back about $40 per person; its difficult to find the pick up spots at the various hotels because they are not marked on the map; AND they come only every half hour.

The only real connection I could see was a grammy, emmy and oscar in the showcase at the entrance. The casino was fantastic. I made a mistake one time and did not put odds behind a craps roll. The pit boss noticed this (I had been playing the same way with the same odds all night). He talked to the dealer and came over and said to me, we are going to pay you on that bet (the pay off was about $90).

When we returned to the room, there was a plate of chocolates as well as a card from the girl at the front desk wishing my boyfriend a happy birthday and good stay. The hotel itself was really pretty. The room had everything I expected...including comfy robes. The swivel tv in the room was convenient and the ipod alarm clock was cool. I must add that housekeeping was really nice. A couple times we ran into housekeeping as we were leaving our room and each time they were very friendly. I also had left a few dollars out after the first night, which i intended to be for the housekeeper...since i had requested more bar soap..and she didn't even take it! I guess it's cause she didn't want to touch it if it weren't meant for her. The next day i wrote on the actual note \"FOR YOU..housekeeping\" and she took it. I really liked that I didn't have a worry as far as belongings and money left out in the room. Honesty goes a long way when it comes to me returning. All in all I absolutely loved Encore. I did have a few gripes, but that wasnt about the service. The walls are very thin in the room. Therefore if you have noisy neighbors, you can hear them. (Unfortunately we were next to a bunch of drunk guys), and you can also hear the person in the bathroom. I also wish Encore/Wynn had a closer monorail stop or shuttle (they got rid of that from what i hear). The breakfast buffet at Wynn was really tasty, and service good. The dinner on the other hand, not so much. And the service was terrible. Wouldnt pay 40 per person again for that, but we went 3 times for breakfast and it was fantastic. If Encore is in my price range again, I'd definitely stay there again...and again!

I expect all 5* hotels to offer turn down as standard, but this is not the case - you have to request it - which we knew from this website so did it when we checked in.....however it was only done on one night and this was only after I complained again!!!! At the Palazzo and and The Venetian its standard - it's not at The Paris and New York New York, but then these hotels don't claim to be 5*!!!! When I mentioned this on check out, they said it was a shame we hadn't charged things to our room, as they would have credited us $50 - easy to say though wonder if they would have if we'd had an outstanding balance?! The rooms are lovely - the mini bar food snacks did have a thin layer of dust on them, but guessing the cleaners don't want charges to happen when they clean. Aside from that the beds are comfortable, bathrooms large with a TV and a nice seating area by the window. On our first night we did awake to hear the club - mainly the base from the music (after discussing this on check out if you are looking out over the pool area you will hear it even if you are high), but as the hotel was full all they could offer were ear plugs, and said we could move the next day - we did and were then by an elevator but we never heard this - t I thought if they had been big on customer service we would have been upgraded - but that isn't what this hotel prides itself on I suppose.....we in fact had a worse view after our view but at least slept soundly. We saw \"Le Reve\" which was very good but not as good as \"O\" although the theatre is better (fyi this show is never sold at discount booths on the strip), we also saw Peep Show as I love \"Girls from the Playboy Mansion\" but it was pretty poor to be honest and Holly is beyond wooden, we also saw Chris Angel - who is no David Copperfield - I thought his show was in fact airing on really bad compared to David Copperfield. However we did get 241 on this so couldn't really complain. Location wise you are at the end of the nicest part of the strip, but we had a car so this wasn't a problem, and to get to The Wynn you don't have to walk outside. It's also opposite Fashion Show Mall which is a good thing. Restaurant wise think they could consider vegetarians more - although The Wynn Buffet does cater for vegetarians very well. The casino seemed always rather quiet, and it was too cold to use the pool when we were there but it did look nice. The butterfly theme is lovely but I felt it could have been carried through to the rooms. Also I am big on finishing touches and the mixture of chrome and gold in the bedrooms felt a little off to me - have one or the other - both doesn't work.

The SW steakhouse was incredible(make sure you try for a table right on the water for the water and light show at night) and the Pizza Place was really great too overlooking a lovely waterfall. I think next time it is going to be a tough decision as to which one to pick Wynn or Encore. I like the Encore rooms better but the restaurants and location of the Wynn are more to my liking. Even though they are attached the Wynn is just that much closer to the other good hotels and the Fashion show mall. By the way the burgers across the street at Strip Burger at the front right corner of the Fashion Show mall are great and my son said the fries and the cookie and cream milkshakes were the best.

Room - did the standard upgrade to a panoramic for $25/night. Totally worth it! Was on the 58th floor with a view that honestly took my breath away every time I walked into the room. Mountains, strip, mountains. Panoramic doesn't do it justice. Beds were to die for, the room itself was enormous, and the bathroom was like a palace. Cleanliness - I was on the lookout after reading the other reviews: the spots on the marble floor are definitely detergent of some kind that won't come off easily. The designer who picked the speckled marble should be faulted, not the cleaning staff. Everything else was perfect. And as someone else mentioned, if you call down and ask them to change the linens they will oblige without hesitation - otherwise they make up your room in every way that you would expect from a luxury hotel (including hanging up a piece of lingerie I absentmindly left out and my partner's pants, contrary to another review I read). Restaurants - Was wowed by them all. Ate at Daniel Boulud @ Wynn overlooking the Lake of Dreams and had what I can only describe as a lovely, adventurous, and satiating meal. The Society Cafe and Wazuzu @ Encore were both great options (and you can enjoy the \"Switch\" from the Switch Restaurant in the Casino and in Society Cafe)! The bartender informed us it was the most expensive restaurant ever built...?! The breakfast buffet was great, but that was the ONLY time I was ever even slightly disappointed in the service (no OJ/coffee refills, someone was trying to get a stain out between us and another table VERY awkwardly, waiters were more interested in talking amongst themselves). The Terrace Point Cafe was A+! Mimosas were only $7 and they had a bacon/avocado omelette to die for. The Cafe in Wynn was very overpriced, but if you're looking to spoil yourself, spend a few days in complete relaxation, and feel like you are in paradise - then it's all worth it! Bars - didn't get to XS/Tryst, but spent my birthday at (the slightly more intimate) Blush, just off the casino. With outdoor heaters and \"reserved\" signs that they invite you to ignore, we were able to spend an amazing evening sipping outstanding Mojitos, Redbull Vodkas, and Manhattans until late having the time of our lives . Even though we were in more of a lounge-y mood and I didn't have on fake eyelashes or 7 inch heels, I felt comfortable and welcomed by both patrons and staff. The bathrooms @ Blush were the best - small/dark mirrored tiles abound! However, my absolute favorite bar (unexpectedly!) was Parasol Up @ Wynn. In the center of it all, the circular bar is classy and relaxed but also evokes a real sense of Vegas, waitresses in SHORT cocktail dresses, everyone smoking a cigarette or cigar, and a sort of intimate friendliness that I loved instantly. The Pear-A-Sol was the best drink I have ever had. Also, a brief mention to the Eastside Lounge @ Encore, it overlooks the pool and it perfect for an afternoon \"El Toro\" to pick you up (red bull/tequila/etc). Drinks around the resort are $6 for domestic beers, $7 for imports, at least $8-10 for a cheap glass of wine, and typically $12 or 14 for a cocktail. But let me say this, after two $12 Pear-A-Sols, I was feeling fine! Enough said. Pool/Spa - Pools were lovely, had a blast in the hottub outside and had a nice chat with the bartenders @ the over 21 pool bar. Biggest regret was not getting to experience the Spa, that main golden waiting room all over the website really is that grand. Casino - I mainly stayed to the slots (as I'm still garnering courage to play some of the more intense games), but I thought the Encore casino was outstanding. It was open and light in contrast to basically every other one I saw (and had seen before). Put it this way, you could tell that time of day it was and it wasn't crowded. The Wynn casino had a bit more life while still retaining a good amount of that open feel. Decor - The thing I think I liked the best about Encore was it's style. I loved the red and the butterflies, and the way it was so over-the-top was playful and I felt like it was almost slightly making fun of itself in a graceful way. I couldn't stop being awestruck; every little detail was considered. I didn't see that in ANY of the other hotels we checked out. Staff - Basically every time we had an encounter with a staff member, it was pleasant. I think it could get slightly better, but you could tell that you were dealing with real people and not robots - it was a diverse staff, which I liked as well. Shows - Le Reve was outstanding, but was a bit corny at times. I appreciated the live music, but the songs were really all like \"should I follow my dream? do I love him?\" Blah. But the performers themselves were all incredible and I liked that it was very upbeat and pleasing to the eye. We sat in the 3rd Row and were barely misted at one point, and the front row was \"splashed\" once or twice. I could rave about the Encore all day. I honestly want to go back soon, and even though it was my first time to Vegas I can't say enough about it. Since we're in our 20's I was expecting to feel a bit removed from the \"action\" of the mid-strip, but then I realized that all the action I wanted was within our resort. It was upscale and perfect.

Therefore, we knew what to expect in the way of check in, room upgrades, ect. We stayed 4 nights, March 6-10. Upon arrival, our bags were promptly taken by a young gentlemen that announced to us he could not take our bags up to our room but they would be stored and to call the Bell Captain when we were checked in. Check in was about a 10 minute wait but the desk attendant was very pleasant. We had a king suite and requested an upgrade to a Queen which was not available. We also requested a high floor which was a $20 per night extra charge, which we took. Since they did not have a Queen available, (we checked in on a sat.) whe offered a roll-a-way bed and no extra costs (which is usually $20 per night, so the high floor extra charge was basically a wash). Additionally, we had read where noise from the night club and the construction out front was disturbing. We heard neither from the 62nd floor. I would suggest that you ask for an even numbered room as they face south with a view of the strip. We had a northern view with limited stip views but did have a nice view of the mountains. We stayed in a room next to the elevator but never heard a thing nor did we hear any neighbors thru the walls as reported by previous reviews. The room was well appointed with the upgrades you would expect in a 5 star property. The bathroom was large with a small TV, robes for your stay and standard ammenities. We had stayed at the Wynn previously and therefore knew how the snacks and mini bar worked. Don't take the items off their resting spot for more than a few seconds or they are charged to your room. We did notice signs at the elevator saying \"no outside food or beverages allowed to be brought in\". We brought a few things and were never questioned. The bellman promptly brought our luggage, filled our ice bucket and made sure our roll-a-way request was honored. Of course, as in everywhere in Vegas, everybody gets tipped. The decor is red and black everywhere, no number in the 40's anywhere as 4's are an unlucky number in the Asian culture we were told. There is ample storage for cloths, a safe for your valuables, a 42\" TV that is mounted on a swivel, and WiFi abailable for $13.99 per day (we did not use this as we had a Verizon card). Drapes and sheers are remotely controlled by a pannel beside the bed as are the room lights. Maid service was good but they did forget to empty our garbage one day which I will ding them for. We did leave a tip at the end of our stay for the maids. Encore property is smaller than the Wynn and the gaming was tighter I thought. Cocktail services were good as was what food we comsumed on the property. VERY pricey and small servings. No in room coffee pot, coffee is $4 a cup downstairs BUT you get one free refill. They mark your cup upon the refill to prevent you from getting another. It is quite a walk from Encore to other strip properties but with use of the bus system, tram and shuttles, it is not bad if you are not in a hurry. Although we had passes to EX, (the night club) we did not go as there was a long line every night; however, if you are a hotel guest, there is a shorter line; $30 for guys and $20 for ladies but free tickets can be had if you ask. We bought a few small things in the gift shop which were also \"pricey\". In summary, I would give Encore a 4.5 having stayed in most of the properties on the strip, it is not the best value for the money; I think Paris is; however, it is a \"beautiful people\" place and I would stay there again. We go to Vegas at least twice a year and consider ourselves savory travelers. Be sure to take advantage of the free shuttle services to the off strip casinos and outlet malls. You can catch them right across the street from the Wynn at the Fashion Mall. Cabs are not the best way to get around unless you are in a hurry.

Upon arriving at the drop off at Encore, we were immediately pleasantly welcomed by the bell man and he promptly took our bags to take care of until we could check in. When it was time to check in and we entered the hotel, I was speechless, it is absolutely gorgeous, I have never seen any hotel/casino that is so architecually and decoratively stunning. There were quite a few guests in line ahead of us but we had to wait no more than five minutes, the registration lady was friendly and efficient. We were so excited to see our room as we had looked at a lot of pictures of the resort suites and hoped it was exactly as shown, and it was. The suite had an enourmous foyer/hallyway, upon entering. The bed was amazingly comfortable, the nighstand had an automatic control panel which you could control the shades/drapes/lighting and even the privacy status on your room (none of those plastic door hangy things needed!) The bathroom was gorgeous, with a huge vanity, and I especially liked the parlour chair and mirror for the ladies to do their make-up, that was a nice touch. The room was clean, tastefully decorated and all around perfect. The casino in the Encore is just as beautiful as the rest of the resort. We had no problems with the cocktail waitresses service, and sometimes we were only playing penny slots. The minimum bets for table games were a little high for us, but that is to be expected at a world class resort, so we went to other casinos that had lower min. bets. Not an issue at all. My boyfriend surprised me with a massage at the Encore Spa. The day before that I was reading the spa services menu at was saying there is no way I would ever pay $150 for a 50 minute massage! The spa was ornate, I thought I was shocked to see the beauty of the resort itself but once I entered the spa it knocked my socks off! The nice thing about having a spa service is that you can use the spa facilities for that entire day, free of charge. There is the gym, eucalyptus sauna, 3 different temperature whirpools, hot massage like chairs and beautiful showers. I felt slightly out of place at the spa because it seemed like a place only for the rich an famous, but they were not the ones who made me feel that way at all, they were very warm and welcoming. From the instant we arrived, to the moment we hopped in the cab to the airport home, the entire experience was wonderful, words cannot express how pleased I am with everything and everyone at the Encore. All of the resort staff were cheery and kind, the resort was beautiful and comfortable, and it was an amazing experience, what more could you ask for? I cannot wait to come back to Las Vegas and stay at Encore again. I will be back, no doubt about that.

It is obvious the staff genuinely cares and that upper management at the hotel is outstanding. Make sure to eat at any of their great restaurants.

I am a frequent Vegas visitor and have stayed at other high end properties on the strip including the Bellagio, The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, Caesar's Palace, The Signature at MGM Grand, Wynn, Venetian, and the Palazzo. I'd have to say that in terms of ambiance, amenities and customer service, this is certainly the best hotel I've stayed in Vegas so far. LOCATION: This is probably the only slight drawback to this property and may not be ideal for first time Vegas visitors . It is on the northern end of the strip and is connected to the Wynn via a climate controlled walkway lined with upscale shops. The Wynn/Encore complex offers plenty of shopping, dining and entertainment options (although pricey!). The walk to the Wynn is brief and once there, the more central areas of the strip can be accessed rather quickly. CHECK-IN: Lines were long but moved fairly quickly. Front desk staff was friendly and cheerful. I booked a standard resort room with Expedia and asked for a room with a view. She offered a room on the 59th floor for a nightly upgrade fee of $50. I gamely took the offer and wasn't disappointed at all (see pictures). By the way, the hotel puts a nightly hold of $150 per night on your credit card for incidentals (eg. room service, movies, etc). You'll get this amount released less the actual amount you've charged to your room account after check out. I'm just mentioning this since I've read posts on the Las Vegas forum here on TA wondering about this little detail. All the hotels I've stayed in all over the world have a similar policy but the Vegas high end properties tend to charge much higher ($150/night is typical). ROOMS: For an extra $50 night, I ended up in a panoramic room with spectacular wide views of the strip as well as the Encore/Wynn pool complex and the Wynn golf course. The pictures really don't do justice to just how dramatic the strip views are! The decor is one of understated elegance- luxurious and sophisticated but at the same time warm, relaxing and comfortable. There's a 42\" flat screen HDTV (with HD programming) that swivels 360 degrees so you can watch TV from your bed or from the living room/work desk area. The king bed is extremely comfortable (probably the most comfortable bed in Vegas) with 300 thread count sheets and a down comforter encased in a duvet cover. There's a bedside device that allows you to control the lights, curtains, as well as the privacy setting, all from the comfort of your bed. The bathroom is spacious with a large bath tub that is separate from the shower. There's also a 9\" flat screen TV in the bathroom. There are nice little touches in the room that really make your stay special such as having your name displayed on the touch screen phone and on the main menu of the TV. There's a snack/minibar station with really yummy treats. As expected in a resort of this caliber, the items there are very expensive. At about 700 square feet, this room is slightly smaller than the standard room at the Pallazo or at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, but substantially larger and far superior than the standard room at the Bellagio. Overall, I actually prefer the decor and ambiance of this room than the rooms of the resorts I've previously stayed in on the Vegas strip. DINING: For this trip, I dined at Wazuzu and Society Cafe. The food and service at both places were excellent, although a bit pricey. I also had breakfast at the buffet at the Wynn and the selection and quality of the food there is still the best on the strip in my opinion. I also ordered room service on a couple of occasions and the food were prepared impeccably and arrived on the time promised. The room service menu is quite extensive, ranging from quick eats such as sandwiches and burgers to fine dining selections such as steaks . On my previous stay at the Wynn, I had dined at Wing Lei and SW Steakhouse and the food at both establishments was outstanding. SERVICE: The service here is simply impeccable. Every single member of the staff encountered, from the front desk staff to the bellmen to the room service delivery waiters to the hotel maids, was genuinely helpful and willing to make your stay pleasant. ISSUES: In my experience from previous stays at upscale resorts everywhere, there are always issues that surface regardless of how spectacular a property is or no matter how hard working or pleasant the staff are. This is particularly true in Vegas mega resorts and the Encore is no exception. A few things I've encountered: 1) the noise from club XS is loud and can be heard even on the higher floors. I was on the 59th floor and even at that height, I could still hear the noise from the club, albeit the noise level is substantially muted and didn't really bother me enough to prevent me from sleeping. Luckily, this happened on my last night there and the club is only open Thursday-Saturday nights. I can only imagine how bothersome it must have been for those staying in the lower floors. 2) thin walls between rooms. I could hear the TV from my next door neighbor (although muted and not really particularly bothersome) and could hear doors slamming and people's conversations on the hallway. I had the same complaint during my stay at the Wynn. Pretty surprising considering the amount of money spent to build this complex. 3)turn down service not offered automatically. This is really no big deal and more nit picking. You would have to request it to get it. At other resorts such as the Palazzo/Venetian and the Bellagio, this is something you'd get without asking. IN CONCLUSION: I tend not to stay at the same property twice since I like trying out different resorts, particularly on my Vegas trips. But after this recent stay at the Encore, I must say that this is the only resort that I would actually consider for a future stay. I just really loved this place. It is elegant without being pretentious. Everything about this place exudes luxury, from the stunning lobby with the beautiful mosaic marble floors and flowers and trees that bring nature in, to the little unique art details in the casino and hallways to the extremely comfortable rooms. With the opening of City Center, there will be plenty more resorts to consider, but Encore will always be a close competitor.", "Date": "February 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cEncore, would go back in a heartbeat!\u201d", "Author": "MrandMrsS_09", "ReviewID": "UR57209574", "Content": "We (myself and hubby, both mid 20's) stayed at the Encore in August 2009 for 5 nights. the rooms: the room was one of the most well apointed accomodations we have ever stayed in, from the rotating tv, to the breathtaking view, as well as the little touches such as personalizing the tv and telephone with our names. We never heard the \"noise\" of the nightclub as other reviewers have posted. We ordered room service which was delicious! Spa: We booked a couples massage which was quite relaxing. The spa itself is beautiful so bring your camera! Casino: During our stay we visited various casino's on the strip, and Encore being relatively new we found was very bright (there were windows) and didn't have the lingering smell of cigarettes that the others had. It was never tooo too crowded and there were always waitresses seen around taking orders. Pools: We are definitely pool people, and the Encore did not disappoint here. The pools were beautiful and we enjoyed all of them. We tried lots of smoothies on the drink menu and they were all delicious! During the weekend however, it was impossible to find loungers and keep in mind we are relatively early risers, so we decided to hit the casino instead. A little bit of a let down but we got over it. Food: since we were visiting for 5 days we decided to eat mostly at restaurants at Wynn/Encore so we could just charge to our room. Its been a while, but our dinner at Botero, and the sushi restaurant facing the waterfall were definitely the most memorable for me! The breakfasts everywhere were yummy, they did eggs benedict really well. Clubs: We checked out both Tryst and XS, and they were both impressive!! I believe we contacted the hotel/concierge desk while we were there and they were able to provide us complimentary passes, we still had to wait in line but this was definitely a nice touch for Encore to accomodate their hotel guests. Both clubs had a really goodlooking crowd and we enjoyed the experience. Shows: We saw Le Reve. It was a surprise from hubby and he got the VIP seats with champagne and chocolate strawberries. What a delight! I highly recommend this as the seats had a great view and another small screen to see alternative views of the show (behind the scenes, and the performers under water). This show was outstanding and nothing like anything we've seen before. Overall comments: The Encore offers the complete Vegas experience with a modern upscale twist; every aspect of this place is incredible!!

That's okay as our room was already a deal and we got a few other perks but this is a high-end resort and they don't have to give you anything. 2. Don't waste your time in the Encore casino. We took the two minute walk to the Wynn everyday and loved it. The Wynn Sports Book is generous with drinks as long as your betting $2 horse races or more. You get one drink ticket for every bet.

We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon before check in so they asked for a cell phone number to call as on when our room was ready. While we were checking in I overheard a gentleman who couldn't believe that his room wasn't ready and what did they expect him to do while he waited. This bothered me to see as confirmations clearly indicate hotel check in times and this is just a part of the system. It's these types of people that makes huge deals out of nothing and come on here and put down the hotels when it was just the hotel following procedure. We waited maybe 20 minutes for our room and loved our upgrade to a panoramic view on the 54th floor. The room and hotel are very elegant and there is a lot of detail. This time of year there was a lot of emphasis on Chinese New Year in all the hotels and this fit in very well with Encore's red theme. I highly suggest watching the hotel channel on your room's TV to find out more little secrets about what to see within the hotel, or reading the hotels magazine which is also in your room. Things such as the crystal dragon in Wazuzu which is meant to bring good luck, to the Lake of Dreams at Parasol. What I liked most about this hotel was the fact that it was away from the hustle and bustle of the centre part of the strip. As there isn't much directly beside the Encore at the moment, no one uses these hotels as a walk-thru creating major pedestrian traffic. The crowd is a little older and the casinos aren't overly packed or smoky at all. The hotel seems to pick up in the evening as XS is quite the hot spot and getting through that hallway can be challenging at times when the club is open. Be sure to make use of your red card and ask if you have enough points for things like the Buffet. Having a redcard also allows you to bypass lines or have shorter lines for the restaurants or clubs within the two hotels. There are a couple of negative things I read in other review that I can now comment on myself now that I've been there and maybe help confirm to others that are yet to stay here. 1) Noise from the nightclub being heard in rooms - TRUE We had a view facing the strip and were on the 54th floor and could hear music and booming from XS down below. It wasn't excessive and we could certainly sleep through it. I will agree with those people that commented that you can hear it; I can't imagine what it would be like to be on a very low floor. Perhaps those that have said they can't have north facing rooms? On the bright side, the club isn't open every night but when it is its open until about 5 am. 2) Doors slamming - TRUE I suppose it's for security and fire purposes but the room doors do slam upon entering and exiting. We tried to force the door to close slowly but it's almost forces itself against you to try and slam anyways. 3) Dust - TRUE Our housekeeping came in a did a great job but it's definitely obviously that not many people take advantage of those treats you have to pay for on top of the cabinet with the mini bar. A thick layer of dust had settled upon these items which I'm guessing will continue to build. However, I'd rather that layer of dust then housekeeping cleaning it off and accidentally triggering a charge to my room that I would later have to dispute. Regardless, I loved this hotel and would return in an instance. Many positive things to say and I highly recommend it here.

I mentioned out loud that I had asked for a higher floor when we originally booked. The desk clerk then said that she was giving us an upgrade. We were very grateful for this, and assumed that it would be a higher floor too. Not so. We were put on the 8th floor, which is almost street level (there are more than 60 floors in this place). I couldn't figure out what the upgrade was, as the room looked exactly the same as the pictures I'd seen when I booked. However, we didn't want to question it. We tried to sleep later that night and were awakened in the night by a \"boom boom boom\". Seems we were also placed near their XS Nightclub, which runs until the wee hours of the morning. It sounded like someone was playing the drums in my head, that's how loud it was. It was ridiculous. They offered to switch rooms for us, but we had five suitcases that we had already half unpacked. Not very convenient. We decided to live with the noise for two nights. We noticed there was no turndown on the first night, so we asked the concierge about this on the second night.

Nice furnishings and very comfortable bed. Standard room size has to be one of the biggest in Vegas. Service was impeccable from the front desk to the end of stay. They have a lovely spa, in which I indulged in the stone massage. I highly recommend that service.. You could probably spend easily a couple of hours there just in the steam, sauna, and pools. We also visited some of their onsite restaurants and bars both in the Encore and Wynn. Alex was a treat and the 'wine guy' knew exactly what to pull out when I described what I wanted. (I'm telling you that wine list was so long.. I was getting dizzy reading it. ) The two other memorable meals I had on my trip.. (not related to Encore) was brunch at Bouchon and dinner at Joel Roubachon.. Both SPECTACULAR. I could go on and on about the food I had in Vegas, but I probably should put it on Chowhound. XS was so much fun... just go. They say it's impossible to get in, but it's not... and I went on Saturday night. Just wait in line around 10ish.. and the line goes fast.

After walking much of the strip and seeing the casinos, I am glad I chose Encore. The casino was less smokey, very elegant with natural lighting and 10 times as luxurious as the others. You can already tell the difference by the lobby and esplanade connecting to the Wynn that a decorator went nuts on these Wynn properties spicing up the corridors and spaces. The price point wasn't bad for the rooms, but I admit the food and drinks are very expensive on-site. As a last minute kooky thought.. both my husband and I liked watching the Wynn channel.. It's a taping of Steve Wynn himself describing all the restaurants, bars, and shops at his hotel... Basically- everything is wonderful, and grand.. it's his vision and he did it all for you. His voice is stuck in my head.. so weird.

We stayed in a Salon Suite with an adjoining room. We were on a lower room so not a great view but the room was outstanding. I have attached pictures of the suite. The bathroom was beautiful and huge in both sides. We ordered room service for breakfast everyday and loved every bite. For dinners we ate at Okada, Botero, and Alex. Okada had lots to choose from since my mom doesn't eat sushi at all. I enjoyed the sashimi platter. Botero was good food but small portions. My meal came with a side of potato au gratin and I think it measured one inch all the way around! Alex was splendid but I see why you pay so much. There were small meals served in between each meal. I know there's a name for that but it escapes me right now. They also served us each a glass of champagne as we sat down. I just loved the individual purse stool! I took a purse with me just so I could take advantage of this! Unfortunately I can't comment on prices since we never paid for any meals or drinks! With my brothers play status we were able to use a pool cabana for the day. My brother stayed in the room and worked while mom and I got to know the cabana host really well! The drinks were fabulous and very strong. There was also a fruit platter and non-alc drinks in the fridge and a small flat screen t.v. We were on the second floor above the pool so the people watching was great. The drinks were so strong that after lunch at the Asian restaurant next to the casino, where more drinks were had, mom and I asked at Botero if we could cut thru the patio to get to the pool quicker than walking all the way around. My mom had no patience for asking permission and walked straight into the glass wall and completely knocked herself onto the floor!! I will say that I enjoyed the Encore atmosphere and the beautiful tile work but I got tired of the bright red that was EVERYWHERE! One more thing I wanted to mention was the concierge in the Encore Towers area was extremely helpful.

No phone call, but checked back around 2 and our room was ready, 6347, on the 63rd floor which is the top floor and at the very end so as far away from the noise as it could be. Gorgeous room, bed area separated from living area with a marble divider and 48\u201d flat screen TV that swivels between the two areas.

Mini bar, but we didn\u2019t touch it as items moved for more than 60 secs are charged to the room. 3 seater black sofa and one of the seats was extended like a chaise long. There was a desk, fax machine and internet access at $13.99/24 hours. The fully mirrored walls made the suite seem twice the size and the room was spotless. There was a large bathroom with a very deep bath, separate shower, twin sinks and the toilet in a separate room with a phone. There were two bathrobes and digital weighing scales. Nice lemongrass and citrus toiletries \u2013 shampoo, conditioner, moisturiser, shoe polish, but there were only bars of soap instead of shower or bath gel.

I think I will approach describing my experience from two lenses as this will help me share more information with everyone. Also, since I have been following ALL the reviews of the Encore on tripadvisor for the last 3 months it would only be fair to express my feelings as well... Big Picture View: - The hotel/lobby/casino is quite elegant, in my opinion. Compared to the older hotels on the strip, including recently turned old ones such as the venetian and palazzo, etc, the encore is head-and-shoulders above all of them in terms of condition and in terms of presentation. In both wynn and encore, the colour red is quite prevalent. So if that particular shade doesn't suit your eyes, the use of it might get to you. - The room we got was 716; seventh floor and was a two queen bed regular type room. The wynn's regular two-bed rooms have double beds, encore has queen beds. Though we were expecting a one king-bed room, they said that since the hotel was at capacity (due to conferences, etc) and that we arrived late (9pm) they could only offer an upgrade to a panoramic room with a king bed for an additional $20. We declined and enjoyed our separate queen beds on this trip (lol). Front desk attendant was nice nonetheless and she apologized for the inconvenience. The option to ask front desk the next afternoon for a king-bed room was suggested but we didn't bother since we weren't in the room that much anyway. - The room in general, was massive. Not sure where else in the current vegas hotel offering will a REGULAR room give you a room near the size of 700+ sq ft. We went to our friends' regular room at the bellagio on the 9th floor and their room, though nice, was what looked to be half the size of ours at the encore. - We didn't gamble that much so I cannot comment on the liquor service or dealers' attitudes. Detailed Picture View: - The bathroom in general is gorgeous, both wife and I easily agreed on this. Sure, there were what seemed to be dirty spots on very small areas of the floor. Being the person that I am, I went to such spots and picked at them with my fingernail. What the spots seemed like to me was that the tiles had weak areas where cleaning detergent actually penetrated through the surface and thus the detergent-type stains were indeed permanent. Nonetheless, the tiles are quite impressive in the bathroom and foyer areas so we never thought much of it after the initial inspection. There were dust bunnies in some corners. - The corner-type L-shaped couch in the room is a nice touch and is fairly comfy to sit in. The floor to ceiling windows is always nice. The button-activated drapes and sheers, privacy button, and individual room doorbell were nice as well. - The TV was big and very nice. I believe the brand was sharp, which is ok enough in my opinion. Yes, there is a small flat screen embedded on one of the side walls of the bathroom. Neat, but not required. - The extra big pillows on the beds, mostly to be used to lean against while watching tv or reading, are a nice touch for those utilizing those. - Housecleaning staff was, in my opinion, a little lazy. They tidied up the bathroom and made the beds, but did not refill the ice bucket or put the cup tray back in the dresser (perhaps they are not allowed to though). Nonetheless, since they did't go through our bags or steal anything of ours, I still like tipping them each day of our stay. - Though we didn't hear any construction noise at all, you can hear voices through a vent or pipe or something like that Some Conluding Thoughts: - I stayed at the mirage in January of 2009 and had a fairly positive review on their property on tripadvisor. Comparing that hotel to the encore, the latter is more intimate in terms of general vibe (not sure about service from hotel staff) and more elegant looking aesthetically. - I prefer to stay on this north end of the strip (mirage northward) due to it's more quiet atmosphere and since it's a little more on the higher end (and newer) side of the strip. - Cost wise, well, you could expect to pay more in general for encore. Hotel and flight packages that we received from where we are put us only $20 a night more for encore over mirage at least from one year to the next which gave us a total cost of about $120 a night at encore ($100 per night at mirage). Now I know what you are thinking, but it was that low for the most part, and I'm sure people have gotten better package deals than us for this resort or any one's equivalent. I wouldn't have been able to afford to stay the encore if it wasn't for such good package deals available to us, but now since we have experienced the luxury of encore (and wynn), we aren't sure if we will be able to go to other properties. All budget dependant I guess. - Ate at the wynn buffet in both january 2009 and this february 2010 trip. The alaskan king crab legs were better tasting (much less saltier) back in january 2009. The other items were still good tasting, however. - Being from the tourism and travel industry, I can appreciate how the wynn and encore have marketed themselves. But, as stated by other patrons on this site, they really have to work on giving more value-adds even on little things such as internet (which is so cheap to set up in hotels nowadays), water bottles, even mints and chocolates would likely give a nice luxurious touch - even to low revenue clients like myself (non-gambler and so forth).", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms\u201d", "Author": "LisaC13", "ReviewID": "UR56053220", "Content": "Room was spacious and well appointed.

All nice to look at but I felt too intimidated to go inside.

We had a his and hers sink so I was able to place all of my stuff and do my hair in the morning without having to wait for anyone.

I have stayed there 6 times in 12 months, many of the visits were specifically to bring relatives to see this extraordinary place. (Review is of Encore rooms, but Wynn & Encore properties.) In 6 visits, I am still discovering some of the amazing details in the decor and design. Some refined and classic, many outlandish and bold - all of the decor seems to, in some magical way, blend well. There are hundreds of stories behind some of the pieces - comment on one of them to a staff member, and you'll likely hear one of the tales. Many are featured in the resort's in-house magazine or e-mail newsletter. (For example, legs on the chairs in the Encore Tower Suites lobby are modeled after Steve Wynn's dog. Seriously.) Amazing pools - 5 of them (2 topless). At peak times it may be hard to find lounges or chairs - just slip an attendent $5 or $10 and let them work their magic. I have been to about half of the restaurants. I will try to write separate reviews. Breakfasts are exceptional at Terrace Point Cafe or the Buffet. For a higher-end experience, try Tableau - its worth the trip just for their house-made ketchup (a doctored-up Heinz 57). Options are fewer and more casual for lunch than dinner - TPC or buffet again, or Red 8 for Chinese, Wazuzu for Japanese. The Country Club just started serving a $28 3-course lunch but I did not indulge. Either way, you must go at least to see the golf course and waterfall. (Other simpler options are available, but I don't go to Vegas to eat deli sandwiches.) There was a great place called Sugar & Ice, but they changed the name to Pizza Place (a strange disconnect in name, logo and appearance from all of the other glitzy eateries here.) The gelato and sorbets are excellent there and the outdoor patio affords views of 3 of Wynn's many waterfalls. Dinners are top-notch all around: SW (traditional steakhouse), Bartolotta di Mare (Italian / seafood flown in fresh daily or every other day from the Mediterranean - excellent and very expensive), Botero (a steakhouse with flair), Switch (steak / seafood / continental - the walls and ceiling actually completely transform every 20 minutes - a real spectacle), Sinatra (classic/nouveau Italian), Okada (Japanese sushi / teppanyaki / robatayaki & excellent atmosphere - ask for a table near the window or outside if weather permits to enjoy the lush greenery and waterfall). Rooms leave little to be desired - bathrooms are big enough for a small cocktail party, living area (with sectional and desk) and bedrooms are separated by a partial wall, with a large flat-screen TV that swivels so it can be viewed from either room. Views from the higher floors are second-to-none. Ask for a high floor in a low-numbered stack facing south, and you'll see about half the strip, beautiful mountain views and have the Wynn logo from the adjacent tower - a picture-perfect-postcard to behold. Separate drapes and sheers are operated remotely from your bedside night-table, as are all of the room's lights. Beds are comfortable. Mini bar and snacks are appropriately and forgivably overpriced. Request turn-down service and they'll refresh your ice nightly and leave Wynn logo slippers by your bedside. Tower Suites offer a more private entrance, front desk, concierge and bell desk, the main perk of the Suites. The rooms are pretty much the same unless you opt for a larger soom (like a Salon Suite.) There are consistently numerous hiccups in the housekeeping and bell service but I hate to dim the glow of this review by listing specific experiences - none interfered with enjoyment of the stays. Everyone is very friendly - I have had great conversations with dealers, pit bosses, members of the management team and even marketing staff (some Vegas legends are now on-staff) - all seem to be genuinely interested in their guests. (As has become one of Wynn's trademarks, most female servers and front desk staff are way above average in appearance.) The night are clubs are exceptional - Tryst and X/S are among the best in Vegas. On three occasions, I skipped long lines simply by asking staff if I had to wait in line and explaining that I am guest of the hotel. At X/S, it might help to mention that you are trying to get to the blackjack or craps tables that are situated poolside in the club's outdoor promenade. The shopping options are all high-end and offer very enjoyable experiences. You can look up the list of brand name offerings on your own, but for me, the highlights are the unusual home decor found in the resort's 2 home stores - I've not yet left empty-handed. If you're accustomed to a run-of-the-mill casino on the strip, the minimums might be too rich for your blood. Most peak evenings, you will most likely not find a table game under $25. La Reve, a Cirque du Soleil-esque effort is OK, but not in my top 10. I saw Beyonce there in July in a small intimate theatre, which was one of the best concerts of my lifetime (among literally thousands). She had specifically re-tooled her show for the small room which is a formula likely to be followed by other big names in the future. Catch any headliner you can there (ie Garth Brooks). I have gone for 3 or 4 day stays here and never left the property - there are dozens of bars and lounges in nooks and crannies, each in a unique environment. There is no getting bored here and there is little not to like. I used to go to Vegas for the restaurants, nightlife and gambling.

We really enjoyed the Wynn except we felt the housekeeping was poor, when we checked out we told the staff this and they apologized profusely and said they would pass it on to housekeeping to rectify the situation. We were excited to return as both properties are very nice and luxurious and the front of house staff are very good. They are warm and welcoming and give great service. I also found the restaurants in both properties to be excellent. If you listen to Steve Wynn talk about the properties he will tell you how proud they are with their Mobil awards however I have to say that for such a beautiful 5 star resort they let themselves down and based on the very poor levels of housekeeping I would have to say I think one can do better. Why am I so hard on them when clearly the resort is beautiful and to be honest they fall at this hurdle? Well I think when you are paying $300 plus a night and being sold luxury 5 star service you should expect it. Every night they did turn down, well actually not every night but most nights. They closed the electric curtains which always left a small gap and never bothered to ensure the curtains were closed properly, this would mean the bright sunlight came streaming into the room the next morning so we had to ensure the curtains were closed. The Mini Bar snacks above the fridge were covered in a thick layer of dust and never cleaned. One day I had bought some sugar free candy downstairs, it was something like $8 for the jelly beans, the housekeeping decided that I didn't need them and promptly removed them 2 days later but left papers that were clearly to be thrown away in the room. On the final day I opened the mini bar to find the person before us had left their nasal spray in the fridge in a dirty bag, clearly they don't check these things properly. Others have pointed out when you stay in a luxury hotel you expect the little touches like your toiletries to be laid out neatly, curtains to be closed properly and pajamas to be folded and put on the bed. Another interesting incident was that housekeeping came in one day, cleaned the room and then turned on the do not disturb sign which was bizarre in itself. We obviously did not receive a turn-down that night but also one of the robes was missing as well. all very odd indeed. Each of these issues in isolation is trivial but it is really the fact that there were so many things and to make it worse when we checked out we told reception and got the exactly same response as the time before, i realized this was their way of saying, honestly we don't give a damn! To make matters worse an hour after leaving we realized my wife had left something in the bathroom. It was a mouth guard in a box and it was left in plain sight. The bottom line is they said they couldn't find it and made no real effort to do so either. I escalated it to management but again the attitude was pretty poor and uninterested. In summary the front of house is actually great and is hard to fault, also the dealers and casino was great BUT having experienced the lackluster back of house I have to say it is my choice to take my money elsewhere.

I read some where people were thrilled and more than pleased with their stay, and then I read others in which people were disgusted with their stay. I have a word of advice for past, present, and future travelers: \"When all else fails, read the directions.\" I arrived at the Encore late in the evening after flying in from Atlanta. The hotel staff were more than pleasant and helpful. They checked me in immediately (and yes, there was a line of folks.) \"Alfred\" took the time to welcome me to the hotel, gave me some brief information, and bade me a good night (after I had told him I wanted nothing more that night than to go to sleep.) I stayed on the 10th floor in a King Resort Suite (we had booked through another website and got a great deal of $120/night.) I had already noticed some little touches such as my name printed on my room key. When I arrived at my room, I noticed it had a doorbell outside the room also with a privacy feature (so random persons couldn't ring it at night even though evening hall/loud traffic was NEVER an issue!) The room was spotless and welcoming. It was dusted, the [many] mirrors didn't have a single fingerprint on them, the bed was nicely made...no issues whatsoever. I got up the next morning, went to the convention, and when I came back, my room was just as fresh as it was when I arrived: clean...clean towels...nicely made bed...just...spotless. To address some \"issues\" others had: 1. \"The linens weren't even changed!\" Answer: If you read the card next to the bed, it clearly states, \"linens will not be changed unless requested by the housekeeper and upon check out.\" 2. \"We were charged for items from the mini-fridge! Apparently when you lift an item up for more than 60 seconds, it charges you.\" Answer: If you read the card located ON the tray of goods above the mini-fridge, it clearly states, \"feel free to pick up items to browse or count calories, but removing an item more than 60 seconds will automatically charge it to your room.\" 3. \"Internet is not free...local calls are not free.\" Answer: I don't know any hotel in Vegas in which internet or local calls are free...that are quality hotels. Vegas hotels don't want people staying in their rooms...they want them out and about spending money. I didn't have an issue with either one of these. (Are we sensing a trend here?) I ordered \"In-room dining\" three times when I was there, and it was always a nice experience. In-room dining was polite and quick, the persons who brought the food - just as nice and polite. I even chatted with some of them regarding Las Vegas, why I was there, where I had come from, where THEY had come from, etc. I am sure they would have been just as happy (or at least professional) to be ignored as I am sure they are with other guests, but as I worked my way up from serving jobs into the corporate world, I wanted to treat them with as much respect as I hope to receive. I highly recommend the French Onion Gratin soup (French Onion soup with trademark melted cheese) and the Beef Short Rib. The beef short rib is so amazingly cooked that you can pull it apart with a fork. It has just the right amount of flavor as well. As I didn't come to Vegas to gamble and party, I thought Encore was a GREAT hotel. It was VERY quiet. I never once heard loud noises, loud voices, or \"the sound of the night club\" as other reviewers have stated. I had ONE issue with Encore...my remote control died. However, a quick call to the front desk, and...voila! An \"engineer\" was up at my room fixing it. Some small touches you might enjoy: 1 .Your name on your card, television, and telephone. 2. In-room dining ringing your doorbell, and then introducing themselves, pausing, and asking permission to enter your room instead of just walking in. 3. If you enter your room with the housekeeper or mini-fridge \"checker\" in, they will ask for your room key before they let you go any further. This is to check and make sure you belong in that room and aren't just some random person walking into it. I highly recommend Encore if you're looking for a relaxing spot in Vegas.

Was well worth the $30 to use the facilities for the day. Also went to XS nightclub. We found out on the second night that if you put your name on a guest list at Encore's concierge, that you don't have to pay cover or wait in line for the club. The club is GORGEOUS by the way-- definitely had a good time there. Also went to Tryst next door at the Wynn. Only negatives are that this hotel is on the farthest end of the strip... we rented a car, but I imagine if we hadn't, we'd be cabbing it everywhere. This really wasn't an issue, but it might be for others. Also, it's on the pricier end of hotels for Las Vegas-- which around $300/night is still reasonable consiering the amazing ammenities and comfort you get, but still, if you're here to see shows and stay out, you probably don't care about the room. We cared, but you might not, so there are always other hotels to consider. If I come back to Vegas, and I've rented a car, I will definitely stay at the Encore/Wynn property again.

This time it was a little less spectacular mostly due to service. We arrived a day early due to weather and were very rudely informed they were 'sold out'. Odd since it was DEAD! no one was even at check-in, restaurants or casino area. We asked how this is possible as was informed by the staff that 'everyone went to bed early tonight'. HA! It's 8pm in Vegas! Then we were informed that there was a standard room available this Tuesday night for $400 plus tax and resort fee. But it's sold out? Hmmmm. Also odd since the next night we reserved for $99. Tuesdays must be more in demand than Wednesday. We then left and called the Encore to see what they would say over the phone. The 'sold out' was actually just 'sold out of promo rates'. But we were once again rudely dealt with and decided to stay elsewhere. This would be true for the following 4 nights we were booked here but the reservation was by then prepaid and could not be changed. Arriving the next day our friends checked right in around 2pm but we were told (next in line) that a room wasn't ready yet. Really? Then after overhearing other guests next to us in line get a standard king room we looked at the staff member puzzled and she exclaimed, \"A room just opened up!\" Off we went to our room. Expecting the same dazzling cleanliness that greeted us last year we were disappointed upon arrial. Dust covered the lights, counters and other areas of the room. A few hairs were found in the soaking tub, and stains on several towels were also found even though they appeared to have been washed. The windows that were sparkling clean last year seem to have not been touched since then either. Not the amazing entrance we hoped for. Overall the rest of the hotel was kept in nice and clean condition, the casino staff was much better than the hospitality at reception, although there was a lack of doormen this time around, as well as cocktail waitress's during the day. Enjoyed the lobby bar for breakfast, the lattes were as good as I remembered as well as the croisants! Botera steak was the best meal we had last year however upon returning this time it took 3 times before they sent out a steak that was even close to how it was ordered. The 3rd steak was certainly not the filet mignon cut that was ordered and was quite tough and stringy. The others at the table also had cooking issues where the medium chateaubriand was closer to rare, and a medium well steak was much more like medium rare. NOT what you pay for there! In the end they took off the steak that was sent back 3 times. Needless to say we won't return. Society Cafe was much better and the service was excellent as well. Upon checkout they had overcharged us by $700! As well as charging for internet service PER DAY! where as last year it was per stay! Check your bill and save your room charge receipts and it will be much easier when you must dispute their overcharges! It seems as if the hotel and staff was happy to have visitors last year, but this time around they don't really care whether you stay there or return. Quite disapopinting.

Couch and furniture was cushy and welcoming, enabling you to relax and enjoy the panoramic view, unlike the rock hard ones at the Venetian suites.

One criticism is that the prices at all the restaurants were exceedingly high and the food was sometimes disappointing. To our delight, we discovered, Maggianos, a fantastic Italian restaurant across from The Encore (highly recommended on Trip Advisor so we knew it would be good!)--reasonable prices compared to Encore and delicious food and service--about a 3 minute walk away. Recommend calling for reservations at least 2 hours ahead. Only other negative was The Encore has these ridiculous signs posted near the elevators stating that guests cannot bring their own outside food or drink to their room--everything must be purchased at The Encore.

Upon arrival at Encore valet, it dawned on us just how far away the property is from Wynn ... it felt like we were pulling into the Riviera! But we carried on and made our way through to check-in. The decor in this hotel is so tasteful! Red is the main colour theme through this hotel, as well as butterflies. Our 10 month old daughter was mesmerised by the decorations, the butterflies, the lights, the sounds, the people - everything. Check-in was very easy and the staff were extremely friendly. The elevators were not far from check-in (for once!) which made it easy to find our rooms without having to walk through the entire casino. Arriving into our room I found it to be quite dark and dreary. Where Wynn use a lot of taupes, whites, creams etc, Encore went for the darker colours - a big, heavy black door, black sheer curtains, it was all a bit much. I didn't get that homey feel like I did when I walked into Wynn ... it took away the \"comfort\" factor. The room layout and size is similar to that of Wynn, however the room is broken into 2 sections, divided by a spining plasma TV which was useful. The only issue with this divider was that it used a fair bit of space which made the rooms feel a litle smaller than that of Wynn. The bathrooms were pretty much identical to Wynn, however I was very disappointed when I found there were no slippers! :( I love my Wynn slippers! Nonetheless, all the necessities were there, plenty of towels, great water pressure, even a set of scales! We didn't get a chance to dine at any of Encore's restauants, however found it lacked a 24 hour cafe style place. They do have a coffee place that runs until around 1pm and then turns into a bar (no under 21s after this time). This bar served breakfast, but nothing substantial and nothing healthy. Saying this, it was a convenient place for us to regroup in the mornings and discuss the day's plans over coffee. The staff were very helpful and extremely efficient.

Both of our air fare and hotel were booked through Expedia.ca and we've been grant $75 hotel credit as part of the deal. Little background about us: we are young couple at our late 20s early 30s. We take vacation at least twice per year, we love gourmet food and we enjoy good shows. The upside: The hotel is really gorgeous and clean, which you can see from the pictures we post. The room is the most sound proof among all other hotel rooms we stayed, so we had good night sleep every night. The spa is world class and a must do as part of the hotel experience ($30 extra charge). The pool is beautiful but December is too cold to plunge in. The downside: From the title you know we have something to say here... While we arrived the hotel, we were about 2 hours early for checking in, however the lady who took care our check in told us our room is not currently available however we could upgrade to the next category by adding $20 more each night, we asked her if we could use our $75 hotel credit towards such upgrade and pay only the difference at the time of check out, and she gave us clear \"YES\" with her rolling eyes. At the last day when we check out our room before noon, they handed us a $90 bill that include all the charge of room upgrades and related tax. At our confused face, we've been told \"because we didn't use our hotel credit toward food and beverage, so the credit have gone void at the time of our check out\". OUTRAGEOUS is the only word that could describe our feeling for that moment, luckily after talked to manager this unhappiness got solved immediately. But we felt that we should never had such feeling during our vacation. During our stay at this hotel (only the Encore side), most of the employees (except the manager and at the spa) we've encountered gave us an impression of snobbish and phoniness which is absolutely unmatched the class of this beautiful hotel. One thing we must mention, we have made request of one extra set of toiletry at the morning of fourth day to the concierge, when we returned to our hotel room at the end of the day, we found plenty of extra toiletries on the counter top in our bathroom (more than the quantity we request), but right away, we also found out all of our luggage have been went through (one zipper bag in my luggage got unzipped, and the number on our 3-number combination lock for another luggage aren't the same set of numbers as we left the room in the morning). Fortunately, we didn't loose anything since we didn't leave any valuable items in the room, but we did feel shocking that incident like this would happen in such high scale hotel. All in all it's a love hate experience, we won't return to this hotel unless they fix their customer service problem.

Fabric on the walls, electric drapes etc. Beautiful room! I go to sit down on the ottoman and there is a nasty black stain on the center of this thing. BIG BLACK stain. I didn't want to gross my wife out and ruin the experience so I tried to tap it away hoping it was dirt from a shoe or something. Let's just say it didn't work. Almost immediately my wife comes out and is holding the handle for the sink in the restroom. Apparently it had broken off long before we arrived. It appeared that cleaning crew just placed the broken handle right back in the slot as to appear it was ok. This place seemed as if it had just had a party like the one from the movie \"the Hangover\". It felt gross. So 10 minutes later, we are unpacking. I open the drawers and find a big glob of dried soda right smack in the center of the top drawer. It had that gooey, syrup thickness to it. It appeared as if someone had dropped a soda in there. At this point I tell the wife that we should go downstairs and get some food. While downstairs, I sneak away to ask them to please clean up my room as it was clearly a filthy mess. The guy apologized and says he would have them clean the room up, and also leave us a gift basket for the inconvenience when we return. I took my wife out for a little dinner and came back 4 hours later. They cleaned up the ottoman and the soda in my dresser but as I suspected no basket. Whatever.....I didn't even call. I was just happy I was there and they had cleaned up the room. Or so I thought.... A couple of minutes later I am in the potty room and start to notice all kinds of bodily fluids stuck to the floor. It was so disgusting. It looked like they had not mopped up in weeks. Boogers and pee were two for sure! I got on the desk to start dialing the front desk, I lean back in the chair and notice there are tissue papers wedged in between the lamp shade on the desk and the actual wall.

Check in was a breeze, but that may have been due more to the flight delay of 8 hours which meant we arrived at 10pm. Rocio was lovely and we got the type of room we wanted with no problem. The room itself was gorgeous, exactly like the pictures I'd seen. Mirrors running alongside the bed was a bit kinky but wasn't exactly a problem with the room. The layout was great, and the bathroom was gorgeous ( I wish could transport the bed and bathroom to my own house). We were on the 61st floor with a north-facing view of the strip and the view of the mountains was just lovely. Others have mentioned this and I'm sure theres a good reason for it but tea/coffee facilities in the room are sorely missed. Housekeeping has a note informing you that they do not routinely change bed linens during a stay, but as we were there for 9 nights we thought a couple of changes would be in order (i would change then that often at home) and it was no problem at all, a quick call to housekeeping would ensure it done. We ate at a few places within the resort: 1) Take away breakfast from the Lobby cafe in our room. Nice, had a bacon egg and cheese croissant with coffee. 2) Dinner at Wazuzu - fabulous chinese food and the service was very friendly (our only gripe here is that when we walked past and booked a table - the people inside were all 'dressed up', so we went and got changed, were seated 30 mins later only to sat next to a fellow in board shorts and sandals so we felt a bit silly and over dressed - totally nothing to with the restaurant but just one of those things which affected our meal) 3) dinner at Daniel Boulud - we had our 'Xmas dinner' here and loved it all. The wine was easy to drink, and the food was beautiful. The show with the waterfall was great and just enhanced the whole experience. 4) Breakfast at the Drugstore cafe - again just coffee and a breakfast bagel - all good. 5) Lunch at the Pizza Place - sat outside under the heaters, food was nice but the pizza did not match New York standards (despite Mr Wynn constantly telling us this on the tv). We used the Concierge a few times but only one of them was even slightly helpful (Kenny) - the others either couldn't give us any info unless it was regarding places within the Wynn, and on two occasions we were given completely wrong information (one was Wynn information). The casino's within were very classy and the dealers were really friendly. We were not high rollers by any measure but we still felt very welcome. The location of the hotel meant a fair walk for all the more central attractions on the strip, although the hotel is very handy for the Fashion show mall.

We enjoyed the comfort, decor and location of this hotel. The atmosphere is classy and lacks the excessive theme park atmosphere that exists at many other strip hotels. It is a luxury property with lots of high-end eateries and retail shops. However, there are at least three options for casual, inexpensive (well, relatively) food. The Encore is north of the Wynn resort, and they are connected via a long esplanade of retail shops. Each hotel tower has its own restaurants, casino and pool. The Encore's casino is about half the size of the Wynn's and it also has fewer restaurants. But the two hotels basically feel like one property, so it doesn't really matter. Pros: Gorgeous, spacious suites with neat high tech features -- like being able to close the window curtains, turn off the lights and set the \"privacy\" sign from your nightstand. Comfortable beds, nice soaking tubs, double sinks and bathrobes. You can use the special \"Wynn\" channel on your TV to check out, review your hotel tab or view the waiting list in the poker room. Easy access to the room elevators from the registration desk and self carpark. Beautiful pool area. The hotel is connected to Wynn, so you have easy access to all of that hotel's facilities, restaurants and shops. Good entertainment options: Le Reve production show, numerous bars and three nightclubs. Cons: $14/day for wireless Internet access in your room. Most of the restaurants fall into the \"very expensive\" category. It's at the northern end of the strip, an easy walk to the Venetian, Palazzo, Treasure Island, Mirage and Fashion Show Mall; but if you want to explore all of the strip it could be a long haul or necessitate a cab ride, depending on your energy and fitness level.

The Tower Suites are even better as they add a couch and chaise lounge to the mix. Encore has its own casino, saving guests from constantly going back and forth to Wynn. Service is generally good, although the hotel's 2,700 rooms make personalized service difficult. My only negative comment is that Encore's restaurants are a cut below those at Wynn.

But unfortunately the hotel was packed and the room was not available immediately for my check-in even after I arrived late around 4 PM. They said they will call me when its ready. I got a call 2 hours later. Finally checked in around 6 PM. But the hotel made up for this mess up by giving me one of the nicest rooms on the 60th floor with a great view.

I reserved an Encore Tower Suite room, and at check-in, upgraded to a Salon Suite. The check-in area for the Tower Suites is amazing! The staff are very friendly, and it is so easy to get up to your room. The elevators are located within the private check-in area, so you do not have to walk through the casino to get to your room. The staff are very attentive and friendly, and surprisingly, they remembered my name. At the check-in counter, you are given a hot towel and a bottle of water---a nice touch. You also receive a list of amenities for being a guest of the Tower Suites such as 2 complimentary daily newspapers, free daily internet (usually $13.99), free $25 in daily local/long-distance calling, free admission to the spa (normally $35), and a few other perks. My suite was absolutely amazing. Spotlessly clean, and very modern and sleek furnishings. The bed was sooooo comfortable! There are 3 LCD HDTV's in the room (both Sharp Aquos Special Edition models), and one LCD HDTV built into the wall in the bathroom. They provide nightly turndown service as well. I read the previous comments about poor housekeeping, and I have to say that I did not experience this at all. Everything in my room was flawless and spotless. Maybe it helps that I always leave a note on the bed saying \"Thank you\" with a $20 bill. It pays to tip housekeeping! The valet staff are also very friendly and knowledgeable about Vegas---go ahead and ask them any questions you have, and I'll be they will have the answer. They will also get you a complimentary bottle of water if you would like one. I have stayed at almost every major resort hotel on the Strip, and by far, the Encore is my new favorite (with Venetian/Palazzo coming in second place). One not of caution: They have ripped up the front entrance to Encore, and they are building a new entrance and nightclub. The construction trucks are running 24 hours a day/7 days a week. I was on the 60th floor in room 6006, and I could barely hear the noise. However, if I were on a lower floor, I'm sure the noise would be incredibly disturbing at night with the backup beepers and construction noise. All of the Salon Suites face the Strip (above the construction area), so you are not able to get one on \"the other side\" of the hotel---they do not exist in that location. However, all of the Parlor Suites face downtown (away from the front) so you are away from the noise. There are NO Parlour Suites that face the Strip. In order to understand how the \"Tower Suites\" section is setup at Encore, picture this in your head----if you are standing on The Strip and you are looking at the front of Encore, look to the top where you see the big \"ENCORE\" sign at the top of the building. Where the last letter (the \"E\") in Encore is located, draw a straight line going all the way down to ground level.

I loved the red although I thought the butterfly theme was a bit 'girly' for such a huge, sprawling building. I was surprised by the lack of complimentary water in the rooms of a hotel of this level(the tap water tastes awful). The sound-proofing (lack of) is also a surprise. The vents for the air-con are by the window, where the controls are. If you sit in the lounge area to read a book or use your laptop (at $12.99 per 24 hrs), you freeze. If you go to bed (between lounge area and bathroom) you're too hot at night, and the bathroom is just like a sauna without the water! One of our party was doing hand washing in the evening and it was dry the next day after a night hanging up in the bathroom! Saved on the laundry bills I suppose... I'm surprised more vents weren't engineered into the building at the time of construction. We were woken up by drunks wandering up and down the corridor on a couple of the weekend nights when the Encore's nightclubs are open. Make sure you ask for a room well away from the nightclubs as I understand they can be heard - another obvious sound-proofing problem. We could also hear rooms around us flushing their loos, some muffled speech coming through a vent in the bathroom (sadly not an air-con vent), and showers being switched on and off. However, there was never any problem with water pressure or temperature considering so many people must have been showering at the same time. The spa is fabulous - really luxurious and well worth a trip. It's a shame that you can't use the facilities unless you've had a treatment that day but I suppose they have to limit the amount of people in there because of the hotel's capacity. You can pay $30 a day to have access if you're not having a treatment. The pools lose the sun at about lunch time, due to it disappearing behind the Wynn. I'm surprised new hotels in Vegas bother to build pools because of the size of all the buildings! Even in November it was warm enough (just) to lie out in the morning although once the sun went behind the Wynn tower, it was too cold to stay out.

The lobby and check-in was a zoo of people, and although about a dozen people were working the front desk, we waited about 20 min to check in. It was so noisy that I literally could not hear the woman who was checking me in, although we were leaning close to each other and practically shouting. When I made the reservation, the agent told me I would get a room with a strip view on a high floor. This was not the case. They tried to upsell me a room in the Tower Suites on the 17th floor for $50 a night which I declined, and finally, on their fourth offer, they upsold me for $25 a night to what they call a \"Panoramic View\" on the 57th floor which had a did indeed have a great view of the strip. We were staying there on a promotion, where one night was complimentary, and at check-in I was told the $25 upsell would only apply to the two paid nights, but at check-out, it was a different story. They wanted $25 extra for the complimentary night. (By contrast, when we stayed at the Four Seasons in Las Vegas six weeks prior, they upgraded us to a gorgeous strip view at no charge). I got the feeling that Steven Wynn spent a pile of money on this place -- it is absolutely gorgeous, but now he is nickeling and diming his guests to get a return on his investment. However, this is irritating to the guests.. Also Steve Wynn's photo pops up throughout the hotel, and he is the narrator on the in-room video selling the hotel. And you've probably seen the tv commercials where he is sitting on top of the building. This is a bit too much for my taste. It seems Steve Wynn is a bit full of himself, and he has passed that trait on to many of his employees, who have a pretentious attitude -- which is a turn off to guests. The room itself was beautiful, but took a bit of getting used too, as it is decorated a bit loudly for my taste. One wall is covered in a large black and white houndstooth design. The amenities in the bathroom are nice, but not great. Bring your own Q-tips, the ones they supply are so flimsy, they will poke your ear out if you are not careful. Two other negatives are there is no coffee maker in the room and you have to pay for internet access. Coffee for two from Room Service is over $25, and if you go down to the lobby bar you can buy morning coffee for about $4 a cup. (By contrast, when we stayed at the Four Seasons, they has an in room coffee maker, and complimentary morning coffee and tea serice in the lobby, and a choice of three complimentary morning newspapers.) The Encore's spa costs $30 per day, while the Four Season's is included. We used both hotel's spas, and IMO the Four Season's was nicer, though smaller. One morning we had breakfast at the Terrace Cafe in the Wynn. The service was so bad -- food had not arrived after half an hour, and when it did arrive it was cold -- that they comped us for 50% of the meal. Well %100 percent of the service was bad, but I guess the restuarant manager would have had to get an OK from Mr. Wynn himself to comp us for the entire breakfast. Another day we ate breakfast at the Encore's Society Cafe. Service was good -- they even gave us a \"free\" USA Today to read -- if you get there before they run out. But for two regular entrees and two cups of coffee, the bill came to $50. This is breakfast for two. We also ate at the Wynn Buffet which we have eaten at several times before. It is stil very good, but not as good as it once was. Also ate at the Z-something deli which was tasty though pricey. A highlight was seeing the show Le Reve. Quite a spectacle of dancers, gymnists, muscle men, etc. Another lowlight of our stay was one evening when I was walking over to the Sinatra restaurant to have a look at the menu. Now, there is only one destination when you are going to Sinatra and that is Sinatra. A big security guard stopped me, and said, \"Are you going to the restaurant?\" as if I was a criminal. \"Yes,\" I said, thinking, where else would I be going. Guests should not be treated this way. Another problem is the mini bar. I picked up a bottle of hand lotion and looked at the lable for 30 seconds. A $12 charge appeared on my bill, which they took off when I complained. So don't touch anything on the minibar unless you are going to buy it. Further, Mr. Wynn provides a little booklet hawking many of the items in the room. Like the sheets? You can buy them for a mere $300. Etc. He'll even sell you the bed for about $3,000. However, nowhere in the room was there a comment card, to ask guests how their stay was. I guess Mr. Wynn doesn't care. When we checked out on Wednesday, it was again a zoo, and I had to wait 20 minutes as only 2 people were staffing the check out. They did have a guy asking people to express check out but everyone declined, as I guess they wanted to see their bill, to make sure no weird charges slipped on. Final thought, this is a beautiful physical property, but employee service training needs a big shot in the arm, and Mr. Wynn should make his guests feel welcomed and relaxed, not like they are being watched and hit up for money at every turn. BTW the hotel just got awarded the 5 Diamond AAA awarad, and they will waste no time in tooting their own horn about it. Postscript: The shortest line in the hotel was in the casino at the cashier.

Once we were sorted, the check in clerk called the bell desk for us to have our bags delivered to the room. We waited no more than 10 minutes for them to arrive and the bell hop was very pleasant, helpful and grateful for the tip we gave him. We got the room for a fantastic rate of $109 per night. The room itself was lovely with a view of the north Strip (Circus Circus, Stratosphere, Riviera) to the left and the Wynn golf course and the convention centre to the right. The drapes and lights were all centrally controlled from a little pad beside the bed which my husband enjoyed tinkering with. The safe inside the wardrobe was easy to set and free to use but it was a little bit small so there was no room for my husband to keep his binoculars. It was fine for storing the passports and tickets though. The communal areas were all immaculately kept and the red theme was beautiful throughout. The casino wasn\u2019t busy and there was never any problem getting on my favourite slot machine. Cocktail service was pretty good in the casino and the waitresses outfits are the most beautiful in Vegas (black and backless with tiny crystals). Although we didn\u2019t spend any time by the pool this trip we did check out the pool area and it was absolutely gorgeous. We had to show our room key to gain access and were immediately offered towels which we declined. We strolled around the pool and it was very peaceful. The gardens were immaculate. If I was to find fault with the hotel room I would say that housekeeping let it down. The black couch was quite dusty and it had a dubious white stain. There was a sticky cup stain on the desk which stayed there for the duration of our stay. The glasses that we used in the room were only washed up once in three days. When housekeeping came to do the room they just made the bed and folded/replaced the towels. The amenities that we used were not replaced and they didn\u2019t tidy or spruce up the room (although they never forgot to put the card advertising the Encore shops, restaurants and spa services on the bed). Although it was a little bit disappointing for a 5 star hotel it certainly wasn\u2019t bad enough to make me complain to the front desk or spoil my Encore experience in any way.

Upon arrival at this Hotel you can tell that everything about it was done first class. There's some things that are obviously being worked on outside but everything else is just top notch. Check in was a breeze. I didn't even need to slip the clerk a $20 bill, yet still got a great room with a view. The view was amazing on the 11th floor. To our Left was the Golf Course at the Wynn and to our Right was the Montainous region toward the Northwest. At the same time, our view also included the pools and the wonderful Gardens that surrounded each of them. The Room itself was the Resort Suite King and it was amazing. It was very spacious and nicely decorated. The Entry Hall/Foyer was clean, long and led you to all of the right places. To the right off the Main Hall is a very nice bath with a Stand up Shower, a Bathtub (no Jacuzzi), twin sinks, a lighted mirror and a seat for the ladies to do their makeup. Enter a doorway to a nice separate 3 by 5 toilet room with it's own door. There's a nice 15/17\" LCD TV in the bathroom that we left on continuosly with some nice classical music on one of the cable channels. Further down the Hallway to the left leads you to an Armoire full of niceties that you can purchase (including and intimacy kit) if you lift something up for longer than 60 seconds. On the right is a closet with an Ironing Board, some hangers, a couple of garment drawers and a safe that was easy to set and use. Continuing down the hall leads you to the Bedroom which is nice in size, decorated nicely, has a nice sized LCD TV that swivels 360 degrees towards the bed or towards the separate Living Room area. The Bed is ultra comfortable and although it's advertised as a King, it seems to be closer to a Queen. The Living Room lncludes an L-shaped couch, a separate desk and a great view. The positives: The very comfortable bed and pillows (which my wife convinced me to purchase and send home from the WYNN store); The view; The Decor; The Bathroom overall; The European Bathing Pool; The luxuriousness feel throughout the Hotel; The Waterfalls throughout the Grounds of the Encore/Wynn. The negatives: The lack of a Jacuzzi, Having to pay for Wireless or Ethernet hookup; Lack of explanation of \"what's included with your stay\"; a Heat Lamp of some sort in the \"coldish\" bathroom; The Cesspool scent outside on the grounds, especially near the Valet area; The Loud Euro-Disco throughout MOST of the innards. Overall this Hotel is Awesome and I can safely recommend it highly. Just wish that it was closer to the main part of The Strip, was completely done without any construction.

We travel to Vegas 3-4 times a year and usually stay at the Mirage, but wanted to try somewhere new since we found the Mirage was getting old and the service was not what it used to be over the past few years. We decided on Encore/Wynn having heard positive things from family that have stayed there. Encore did not disappoint! We initially got a room for $199/night by calling marketing, and keep in mind that if you are a gambler, that rate may well be significantly reduced or fully \"comped\" by the end of your stay. We arrived aroung 11am and was pleasantly surprised that there was not line up at registration and they gave us a room right away and were given a choice of which floor we would like and which view we would like without having to pay extra. ( Having read previous reviews where others have had to wait several hours for a room to be ready, we were prepared to leave our bags at the Bell hop desk and wait for a phone call when our room was ready.) We stayed on the 31st floor, facing the mountains. Tip: 31st floor is the first floor in the group floors that the elevator stops at. Great because you are the first one off going up, and the last one in before going down to the lobby....no constant stopping at other floors to let people on and off. Our room was immaculately clean, and we thouroughly enjoyed all the amenities in our room that have been previously mentioned in previous reviews, The one best thing that both of us loved was the bed....best sleep we ever had! One minor glitch was the TV was not working. About 10 minutes after notifying housekeeping, our doorbell rang and there was an employee holding a leather lined tray in front of her with a lone remote control on it when we opened the door! After trying the new remote and finding that the TV still didn't work, the employee apologized repeatedly and promised a techinician would be up shortly to fix the problem....20 minutes later, our techinician arrived, fixed the TV, and apologized again and then thanked us! We had no problem with noise on our floor, not once did we hear doors opening/closing in the hallway, or people talking. It felt like we were the only ones on our floor during our stay. Downstairs in the adjoining walkway of shops joining Wynn and Encore was another story....Being it was Halloween weekend, lots of club goers going to Tryst and XS -causing congestion and we literally had to push our way through when we were coming from Wynn back to Encore on Saturday night. Housekeeping, casino floor staff,, restaurant, and registration check-in staff were all very friendly and accomodating. However we did notice that the \"girls\" at Society Cafe did have a bit of an attitude when seating us when we requested a table away from the bar area and on another occassion, appeared irritated when we asked them to repeat what they had said when we didn't hear them correctly the first time! The woman at the check-out although not rude, acted like she would rather be anywhere else but there and didn't even ask us if we enjoyed our stay. Restaurants here tend to be on the more pricier side, however most of the restaurants were offering prix fixe 3 course menus from $24-$36....We did the $36 3-course meal at Society Cafe and found the portions huge, quality excellent, and the food was delicious, this menu included wines by the glass at 1/2 price. For the regular gamblers out there like us - .we didn't gamble any more or any less than usual and found that at the end of our stay we were \"comp-ed\" the same for room and food as we have been at our other \"usual\" hotel we stay at when in Vegas. ....and Encore is definitely a higher quality hotel, so we felt we got more \"bang for our Buck\" here. The slot host here are very friendly and made it a point to contact us first, and leave a message for us on our phone introducing themselves and letting us know they where and when they would be in the hotel if we wanted to say hello in person. My previous \"senior executive slot host\" never did this when I was in town, and wasn't that friendly when I did see him. At least at Encore you feel like they do appreciate your business and you don't feel as bad when you lose at Encore/Wynn LOL. The casino itself was quiet and the machines muted, even when jackpots were hit, also very clean with someone always wiping down the machines of fingerprints, not smokey, and the casino bathrooms were extremely clean with individual closets for the toilets instead of the usual see-underneath stalls. Overall a less rambuctious, party-like crowd than you would find at some other hotels, and most were people were decently dressed (ie: no short short skirts or tank-tops) but still overall casual attire was the norm throughout the casino and eateries.

Both requests were granted and not even mentioned. The room was spectacular, better than any Vegas hotel I have been in, especially for the price we paid. Flat panel TV's, wonderful bed / bath / living areas. Nice touches like our names on the phone and television menus. Remote controlled lighting schemes and drapes.

It sits off the strip a ways, and the most convenient way to get in/out of the hotel is through the shops.

From the time we stepped into the hotel, the attention to detail was everywhere. The place was amazing! It was luxurious in every way, from the roomy, marvel bathroom to the comfortable down-covered bedspread, to the separate sitting area -- it was hotel room like no other. A large flat TV separated the bedroom from the living room and it can swing 360 degrees. This was my hubby\u2019s favorite feature of the room! I don't think we can stay at any other hotels in Vegas now, because nothing else will do. Our room did not face the Las Vegas Blvd, but we had a wonderful view of the mountains (much nicer.) The highlight of our stay was watching a sunrise one morning. It started with a red glow on the right side of the wall-to-wall window and eventually lit up the entire sky. It was absolutely breath taking and highlight of our trip. We booked our room through Hotel.com and it came with a $75 credit. We used this credit for dinner the hotel and had a wonderful eating experience. Here are a few tips I like to pass along: 1) Book a room at the Resort rate and then ask for upgrade at the check in. It\u2019s cheaper. 2) Don\u2019t touch anything in the fridge or the snack stand. If you removed anything for more than 60 seconds, the sensor will charge it automatically to your credit card. 3) The safe in the room is not free. 4) The panoramic room comes with two robes and slippers. If one is missing, ask the housekeeper. They are very accommodating. 5) The room comes with essential toiletries but their moisturizer (while smells wonderful) is not very effective. Bring your own lotion if you have a dry skin. 6) There are two electronic control panels in the room, one by the door and another one by the bedside. If you need to open/close all the lights in the room just push a button. To open/close the sheer curtain or/and heavy curtain, just push a button. If you need a room service or privacy, just push a button. It\u2019s all at your fingertip. 7) Your red keycard can be used as your casino players\u2019 club card at Wynn and Encore. It\u2019s yours to keep when you check out. 8) Across from the hotel is a shopping mall. You can get water, wine, beer, and other necessities from ABC Stores in the mall for cheaper prices.

I paid 10 dollars for nachos and a dip and it was nearly frozen it was so refrigerated, bit of a rip off. Cocktails were great though! Encore's location is just that bit out of the way compared to the Wynn and is not as well serviced with bars and restaurants. If I had to choose between the two, I would stay in the Wynn - just as luxurious and more central with more of a buzz. The recession is clearly affecting the resort as the Terrace Point Cafe was open 24 hours last year, but now only serves until 11.

On our previous two trips we stayed at the Bellagio and the Wynn and enjoyed both trips. Brits tend to include Las Vegas in a round trip to LA and San Fran but we tend to go for a full week to Vegas. The journey is 10 hours flight with an 8 hours time difference. We picked a car up at the Las Vegas Car Rental Centre, thereby hangs another story, but we eventually got to the Encore. Tip one, don't drive down The Strip it can take an hour, utiliise the highway and come off at Sands. The valet service is free and efficient and the staff, followed by a quick and uneventfull check in. Our room 2424 was large and pleasant,.with one wall an entire picture window overlooking The Strip and part of the golf course. Obviously by British standards the rooms were enormous but strangely felt somewhat under equipped. Besides the lack of a coffee/tea machine there was a serious lack of magazines and information on Las Vegas. There is, in this day and age no unearthly reason why WiFi should not be free to resident guests in this type of hotel. We settled down for the first night and were happy that the Encore offered the same type of bathroom and fittings as we enjoyed at our previous stay at the Wynn. The first day was extremely good where we opted for the pool. We preferred the larger pool to the European pool where chairs were plentiful as well as towels and a pleasant supply of free bottled water. The pool staff were excellent and helpful. Drinks and snacks like at most 5 star hotels are not cheap but they were presented nicely. If you feel like renting a Cabana, a double four poster bed or a large sun lounger for six in the pool there are plenty to choose from. we left these to the younger set. Like the Wynn there is even opportunity to play Blackjack or Craps near the pool. The Spa and the Gym were deserted probably because of the charge made to residents for using them. This is just profiteering on a grand scale and obviously has back fired. We returned to our room at 5.00 pm to find it had not been made up, and on further inspection (we didn't notice the night before as we crashed out) there was dust everywhere. My wife went beserk and they quickly sent a team up to clean the room. From that point on the room was made spotless and they even turned down the beds and gave chocolates as per cruises. The Encore is truthfully not a separate hotel but just another wing of the Wynn, your red resort card can be used anywhere on the property. There are enough dinning places to suite most tastes and pockets with special occassions being easily catered for. For our part we like deli food and enjoyed ZouZou Crackers in the Wynn quite a few times, its a popular location. The Wynn buffet is hard to beat especially at weekend and I will defy anyone to come away hungry. We went for breakfast and dinner. Tip number two try and avoid the lines by eating later than normal at the buffet. i cannot commend it more, it is probably the best and most comprehensive of its type anywhere in the world. Tip number three. Good walking shoes are essential in this hotel, its a hike to the front door and at least 15 minutes to the front door of the Wynn opposite the Fashion Show Mall. The walk from the Bellagio to the Encore is at least 60 minutes. To sum up for Brits who want to explore Vegas its a great place to stay. For Americans who fly in for a few days you have everything here don't leave the hotel. One last tip. the shops on the Esplanade of both hotels feature some of the biggest top names in fashion, jewelry, as well as some excellent Wynn/Encore merchandise.

Our view was amazing; overlooking the pool and providing a view down the strip towards TI that allowed us to view the fireworks at night. Getting in and out of the hotel (many times to see the other stuff in Vegas) was a cinch with no problems at all. If you can get a great value for staying here make sure you take advantage of it like we did... we'll definitely be back if we get a great offer again. Otherwise, I might look towards staying more towards the middle of the strip if you're looking for a more centralized location.

We got in on a Sunday morning and tried to check in early about 12:30pm . The lines were crazy with no ryhme or reason, it was a big pain to check in. We were just happy to get a room around 5pm. It was room 3015 (the view wasn't the best but we were just happy to be there). We loved the room once we got settled. I really liked all the extra drawers (over by the tv and in the closet)...I don't like living out of a suitcase and The Wynn was lacking the extra space. Although I wish the closet was a tad bigger because we like alot of space. The room was a standard resort room and plenty big enough for us , we liked the layout. The bathroom is my favorite part....it is great to lounge in a soaking tub listening to the music. I like the area to put on your makeup but I think they could have better lighting there (thinking they might do that on purpose so you wont see what you really look like after so many late nights....lol). Their bed what is there to say that hasn't been said before.......it is so comfortable. We ended up going to the homestore and buying a set of their king sheets and pillows (they will ship them and fast)., so we can enjoy a piece of the Encore at home. We did alot of late night room service for their delish sundaes and other fast food and the breakfast room service. We was not too crazy about the breakfast (I had the lobster bendict hubby had ham and cheese omelet ....mine was fine but he disliked his very much) but late night was beginning to be a problem because it was so easy and yummy (I think we gained 15 lbs). I got a 90 minute in room massage from Cheryl...I believe she said she was the head therapist and did the hiring at The Wynn. She was very good... I like a deep hard touch and she did not disappoint. ((We did a couples massage at the Bellagio - we had free two nights at Bellagio - so we took advantage of one night (left our stuff at Encore just took overnight bag) just so we could see how it was because we never stayed there. Anyway it was an awful experience- I will do a separate review for that stay and couples massage). It was the first massage that actually ever put me in a bad mood.... I was very stressed and upset. Husband suggested calling Encore and setting another one up there. I was thinking about going into the spa to get it done but I decided against it for a couples massage in room. Well just what we needed . I had Denise and hubby had Stephine (he enjoyed his very much)... Denise was WONDERFUL her techniques were different then most massages I've had. She had good skills for a deep firm massage. She was my favorite of all the therapists I've had at the Wynn and Encore and I will certainly be asking for her at our next visit. A couples massage in room was a great treat for my husband and I. We did not go to the spa- just the in room massages so cannot give an opinion on that. We dined at Botero- did a separate review- loved it. We went to Society Cafe a couple mornings...it was kinda like terrace point cafe- one day I got the frosted flake french toast I read about....yes they are yummy but very sweet more like a dessert, once was enough. We liked the layout of the Encore. We usually valet park but found it much more easier to come and go to the self parking there so we used that quite abit. Also took advantage of the business center to get boarding numbers- no cost for this- it is located down near the self parking. We don't use the pool or do the nightlife so we don't have an opinion on that. \\ Overall we really love the Encore and will be back in the spring.......we spent most of our gambling time there as well -the casino is very comfortable and the one we liked the most.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Again\u201d", "Author": "shrop", "ReviewID": "UR47319792", "Content": "This was the second stay at Encore and another really excellent stay.

Since many people (myself included) realize that the hotel is a good value for a room but the prices are high in other respects, I have a few suggestions on saving on the extras: (1) Taxi from the airport: always tell the driver to take Paradise Road. If not, once he hears Encore (or Wynn) he will likely take you on the highway and it will double the cost. (2) Water/snacks: walk to 7-11 about 1-2 blocks north of Encore on same side of street. Caveat: the area is not as nice as most of the strip south. Upside: bottled water for $1 instead of $8 in the hotel room. (3) Fashion mall: across from Encore/Wynn. Starbucks for breakfast is half the price of the cafe in the hotel. Also, Sushi Ra has good half price sushi from 5 - 7pm.

We really enjoyed the spa and fitness centre, as well as the pool. The only downside of the pool is the 1.5 hour of shade that starts around 1pm because of the closeness of the Encore and Wynn buildings. We ate at various of the Wynn/Encore restaurants and each was excellent. Sinatra's was especially good. The Encore is located at the far end of the strip, so it can seem far from other attractions. On the flip side, it is very close to the Fashion Show Mall and the Palazzo/Venetian complex, so it is very close to high-end restaurants and shopping. It goes without saying that everything is expensive, from $5 coffee to $14 cocktails. But it is all part of the high-end luxury. The only negative for us happened at checkout. We booked directly through the Wynn with a promotion that included $75 credit per night. At checkout, they advised that the promotion is a total $75 per stay. While we acknowledge the website currently offers the $75 per stay credit, we booked under a different promotion but with no proof we were left with only our word.

Was aware of some noise issues other Advisors had given, and upon check in requested a room on a higher level. Paying a little extra got us a room on the 57th floor (Resort Suite King) and we didn't encounter any noise issues. The Room is beautifully designed with a large bathroom, large bedroom area, and separate living area with couch and work desk. It felt more like a private apartment than a hotel room, spacious and inviting. The Casino is medium sized with just enough tables and slots to be buzzing but not to the point of being overly crowded. The area is brightly light with windows out to the pool area (windows are a rarity in a town notorious for you not wanting to know the time of day). The Restaurants all offer a \"taster menu\" at set times each night and they are a great way to experience fine dining without being overpriced. I highly recommend Switch, which over the course of your meal lives up to the name - great food, great service. The Spa area is a world of its own and any description will not do it justice - let's just say WOW. The Pool areas (general and European) offer great sun and drinks. Tip: get to the pool early as in the afternoon it does become shady due to the shadow the hotel casts. Location: opposite the Fashion Show mall it's at the end of the strip which is great if you want the Vegas experience without all the non-stop neon. The shopping in the hotel is great with all designer brands, but for real value cross over to Fashion Show or get a taxi to the Designer Premium Outlet mall and grab many great designer names and unbelievable bargains. As part of the Wynn empire you know you are going to get great service and luxury.

Be sure to compare their own posted room rates with the ones floating around the web. I found my deal through USAirways Vacations since, this time, I didn't feel like driving six hours each way on my honeymoon. The check-in process feels reminiscent of the Wynn since the front desk people are still just as moody. Our front desk person, I believe her name was Natalya, was clearly not glad to be there and provided little help with our room selection. I discovered that both sides of the Encore tower have a view of the strip since its floor plan lays perpendicular to it. It just depends whether you want the south side (views of Mirage, TI, Bellagio, etc.) or the north (Circus Dumpus, Riviera, etc.). I was delighted with my 32nd floor south side room. The room is clearly an upgraded version of the Wynn experience. The lighting system and privacy features are smart and easy to use. The room feels large, quite, and comfortable. Room service value is good considering the location. Entrees such as burgers and sandwiches cost about $17 each plus a $5 room service fee and mandatory 17% gratuity. Guys, seize the moment one time and order a breakfast room service! The casino is tight overall but tends to become more generous in the evening. I was disappointed with the sports book since the Encore does not have one and the drink service in the Wynn's sport book was impossible. This sports book does not cater to the $2 bet taker at the horse races. You need to bet at least $10 each time up to $300 before you can get complimentary drink coupons. But the most frustrating part for me was that you were not even able to buy a drink from the cocktail lady as she went by. Location: Friends, a big plus for the Encore is that is located right next to a Walgreens, McDonalds, and Peppermill restaurant. This means that you have plenty of reasonable food and grocery options. Just walk south (towards Circus Barfus). But if you do feel like having a special evening, without doubt, you must visit Sinatra. This restaurant is a personal tribute to Mr. Sinatra from Steve Wynn himself. As of this review, each restaurant in the Wynn property is offering a three course menu for a pre-determined price. The course at Sinatra was $59 and included a glass of wine. Please give yourself this experience. Overall, if you are a Vegas fan be sure to check this one off your list. The Encore is a grown up version of the Hard Rock but is chiseled from the rare stone of the Vegas hay day. You will be sure to make some memories at the Encore.

Had a room on the 38th floor with a mountain view. The room was elegant and tasteful. Just the right size. Amazing bed and linens. The remote control for lighting, drapes and privacy is a nice touch. We are early risers and watched the sunrise every morning over the peak of the mountain. Spectacular. Usual amenities but top drawer. No coffee maker in the room but we brought our own kettle and instant coffee supplies so not a problem at 6:00 a.m. It is an expensive hotel. From a purely value proposition perspective, probably not the best choice. From a feel good, spoil yourself proposition perspective, it is the only choice. It is memorable. Did most of our dining at Encore and Wynn. Highly recommend Daniel Boulud (more later), Society (delicious fixed price menu) , and Terrace Pointe Cafe (great breakfast, free WIFI). Wazuzu had great food but the service was a little spotty. We had issues with SW steak house. Had a reservation for 7:30 and had requested a view for the Lake of Dreams show. We arrived on time and were told it would be a few minutes. We approached the desk at 8:00 and were told that it would be another 20 minutes for a Lake view. We said we didn't want to wait and could we be seated at another table. They sat us against the back wall, as far away as you could get from the Lake. We were disappointed with the way we were treated and left. After waiting so long and with a reservation to give us the worst table in the restaurant was not acceptable. That's how we got to Daniel Boloud. Much better choice with an excellent menu and we had a Lake side view. Service was amazing, Sommelier was extremely knowledgeable. All in all a great evening. One of the best meals ever (sauteed foix gras, seared scallops)..yum. Had the buffet one night...is it my imagination but was it better last year???? Gambling here is fine...feels a bit tight but the casino is bright and elegant and the staff are terrific. Participated in a daily slot tournament. Didn't win anything but it was fun. The location is not terrific but renting a car in Vegas is inexpensive so renting one is no big deal. I wouldn't let the location be a deterrent to staying here. We did walk from Encore to Planet Hollywood Hotel and back one day. Everything in Vegas looks closer than it really is. My advice is to take the car and tip the valet. If you want to golf here take note. The course is one of the most beautiful I have seen. We did not golf here but it's now on my bucket list. The green fees are $500 per person ($350 during the summer when the thermometer reads 100+). Includes green fees, caddy (mandatory), clubs and shoes. Someday..... We did not take advantage of the fitness centre but be advised that there is a charge to use it (I think $50 per day) unless you have booked a spa treatment. Then it is complimentary. The pools are lovely. No children allowed at the European Pool (topless optional). Not a child friendly hotel. Strollers are not permitted (although I did see some) but Vegas is no longer targetting the family demographic. We usually stay at the Venetian because we are lucky enough to be comped for our rooms. However, now that we've found Wynn Encore there is no other choice. There are Vegas hotels and there are Wynn and Encore. These two properties stand alone. As an aside, I did see Steve Wynn one morning just strolling through the hotel and shopping esplanade. Nice touch. He was very friendly to everyone who approached him. He should be very proud of these two hotels.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful, the best\u201d", "Author": "evasz", "ReviewID": "UR46467207", "Content": "We've been in may resorts.

The bed was heaven and the view was gorgeous. I love the remote controlled everything... they had a remote control that opened and closed the blinds and shear drapes, that turned off all the lights in the room, living area, and bathroom, that locked in whether you wanted privacy or your room to be made up, etc. The tv was a nice flat screen. Loved the large, spacious bathroom and the robes. Everything was perfectly clean and luxurious. The service was great... checking in was easy and quick. The concierge was very helpful with all our questions and recommended some great spots. The restaurants were really good... we loved Wazazu and the restaurants in the Wynn were fantastic as well.... esp Okada! We were in Vegas 5 days and we didnt venture out to eat anywhere but the Wynn and Encore, since everything was so good! The club XS was absolutely amazing. Great music, great crowd. Tryst at the Wynn, also, absolutely fabulous! They had tons of shops... most of them very high end, so we didnt do as much shopping as we'd like, but theyre definitely fun to browse around in and just to walk around and window shop ;) Overall, like another reviewer stated, the Encore is almost classy... which is so hard to say about anything in Vegas! You go to Vegas for the novelty of it, the craziness... Encore is almost a getaway from all that. Yet it still has the corny red chandeliers and loud carpeting...but its still a whole lot of fun.

In fact we had to ask to pay more to get a room on a higher floor on the strip side. Our room was gorgeous and housekeeping was flawless. We ate at several restaurants in the hotel and they were all good (Zoozacrackers, Sugar & Ice,Terrace Point Cafe, Parasol Down, and Daniel Bouloud). Special kudos to Daniel Bouloud!! We loved the pool especially the European one. Great vibe and good music. We could always find a chair and poolside service was topnotch. Drinks were pricey at the pool but where is that not the norm now?? The casino was very nice too, not smoky at all (my one pet peeve about Vegas - I hate the smoke). Didn't care for the plastic red chandeliers but everything else was beautiful and well done. We could always find a Blackjack table when we wanted one. It was our 2nd time to La Reve and it was better than the first time - I can not figure out why that show is not packed like the others. It is just as good if not better then the Cirque shows there.

My wife and I usually travel to Vegas every other year for a convention so our trip is both business and pleasure. We have stayed @ the Bellagio, Signature/MGM, and Paris. Hands down, the Encore was substantially superior. The Bellagio is starting to show signs of wear and room service is slow to respond. The door frames @ the Bellagio are metal and when someone opens or closes a door nearby it is noisy. The best thing about the Bellagio are the pools. My second best choice in Vegas would be the Signature which is a good value for the dollar. We learned a long time ago not to walk or take the monorail. Too hot and slow to walk and the monorail always dumps you @ the back of the hotel. Cabs are the only way to go - $5-$10.00 gets you up or down the strip and saves your wife's feet. The Negatives(s) - Only one, which turned into a positive. Sure enough we had trouble @ check-in around 11AM. The staff was having computer/IT problems and the system was real slow. Mark our clerk, perspiring profusely, was working two terminals in order to check us in. Don't even think about trying to check in without your confirmation number as we could not check in with our name only. We were there about ten minutes and Mark appreciated our patience. We booked a king panorama view room. I told Mark we could be even more patient if he gave us a higher floor room on the north side away from the club noise which he said he would try and do. We left our bags and went to the conference down the strip and received a call @ 1:30 that out room was ready. Later that afternoon we picked up the keys to a fabulous 57th floor room with an incredible view! This is one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in! Tip - There is a market and Walgreens just north of the Encore to save money on wine/beer, snacks that costs 2/3 less than the hotel sundry! No one pays any attention to the sign @ the elevator stating no food/beverages from outside the hotel. Don't be afraid to open the refer cabinet which has a nice tray, glasses and bottle opener you can use - Just don't lift anything off the mat or take anything out of the refrigerator or it will cost you dearly.

The views were fantastic, the canyon on one side, the Wynn hotel itself and then the strip which could all be seen from the floor to ceiling glass window. The checking in was slow ( new staff member being trained) and we were asked lots of silly questions that had already been answered within our booking but we stuck with it, half an hour later we were finally in our room on the 35th floor. Unfortunately the air conditioning unit was faulty and when we turned it up on arrival in the room, it was like a jet engine taking off. When the bell hop arrived with the bags he confirmed that this was obviously not right and rang reception who proceeded to advise that they only had 1 other room (in the whole hotel!) available and it was on the 32nd Floor with the same view. They quickly moved us and an hour after our arrival in the hotel we were finally unpacking. The hotel was very busy as it was Labour weekend and it certainly gave you a sense of what these type of hotels are like when full of people as on the Monday evening the noise levels went down and the pool areas were dead in comparison to the previous 3 days. The rooms were large, lobby area with wardrobe (not too big) and safe, then large king bed, drinks cabinet, fully stocked fridge (electronically activated), into a lounge area with L shaped couch, desk and chair and flat screen TV that swivelled around to either the bedroom area or lounge area. Bathroom was good with double sinks, shower, Jacuzzi bath and separate toilet room. Turn down service in the evening but no water left which is usual in most hotels now a days. We expected the use of the gym to be included in our rate but the hotel advised on check in that it was not, our agent had told us it was but as we had nothing in writing the hotel said we would have to pay to use it. The rate was $150 each for 3 days usage, $50 dollars a day to use a treadmill and a few weights is losing the plot and as a result we declined to use it, they would not negotiate even though we were staying 8 days and would have been willing to pay something towards it!! We used the Adult pool every day, (over 21s no cameras for obvious reasons). The music was brilliant each day and the regular parade of beautiful bodies kept us amused and entertained. The water was freezing but a welcome relief from the 104 degree heat. The gaming tables are in the centre of the pool with a bar facility and seemed to be very popular. The nightclub leads into the pool area so every morning the pool was late opening as the beds had to be taken up each evening and put back down again each morning. Meant there was a queue each morning at 9am for beds and by 9.15 they were all full for the Fri, Sat, Sun and Mon mornings. We had lunch by the pool and the service was excellent, try their great smoothies, ceasar salad, wraps and rolls. We also took breakfast out to the pool from the muffin bar area and the croissant with egg, cheese and bacon was fabulous if not a little decadent! Granola and fruit was also brilliant for the \u201cgood days\u201d. The sun does go in around 2.30pm from the adult pool so if you want to continue to stay out you will have to move over to the second pool, usually there were beds available to transfer over to. The restaurant choice is immense so there is no point in me trying to talk you through them all, they are all good, there is a casual burger place between the two hotels and it was very cheap and excellent food and the buffet in the Wynne is well worth trying. If you sign up for the red card and get enough points on the card through gambling you will qualify for free buffet dinners so worth a try if you intend playing the machines. The drinks are also complimentary if you are playing the machines. We went to the show Le Reve and thought it was fantastic, would have gone to see it a second night if we had booked it\u2026. Definitely recommend it even if you do not like shows (we never go) as it is exciting and different.

The hotel is as beautiful as the Wynn next door. We were originally on the 28th floor but moved to the 35th floor with a strip view after the first night. Each room was configured a little different. The first had a separate living room area that was split from the bedroom area by a 1/2 wall. The 42\" LCD TV easily swiveled to face either side of the suite. The second rooom felt more spacious as the living and bed areas were more combined and didn't have a half wall to break them up. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was phenomenal. I also can't say enough about the staff at the Encore- everyone we dealt with was pleasant and very attentive. Cons: There really weren't many. The hotel was a little far from everything else. We walked everywhere and found the long trek back a little tiresome compared with other trips where our accomodations were more centrally based. The pool was also seriously lacking any shade. There were cabanas and other rentals but as far as umbrellas that were not rentals there were only 5-6 so if you weren't out very early you were out of luck. As someone who needs shade this was a huge disappointment. The first day I ended up leaving the pool much earlier than expected because there were no shady areas (i.e. umbrellas availalble).

In my opinion, the Encore still needs some details filled-in. Say what you will about the huge red plastic-looking chandeliers on the casino floor (I think they are awful) or the butterfly tile and carpet motifs (I think they're great), or the two pools, or the fine restaurants and bars all over the lobby level - everything down there expresses a more relaxed, luxurious environment than the original Wynn, which has a bigger, busier lobby floor and casino. That's fine, because the Wynn has a smaller footprint than the original Wynn. But there seems to be a large gap between the standard rooms of the Wynn and the standard rooms at the Encore (the rooms the vast majority of guests will select). The original Wynn rooms feature a seating area (sofa, coffee table, accent lighting, artwork), a desk, and a secondary seating area by the window (a table and two lounge chairs). Lots of furniture for a 500 square foot room, but very well thought out. The Encore on the other hand, has vast amounts of empty space. The seating area is a large L-shaped sofa under a large framed print hung on a wall. But there is no lighting fixture or dedicated spot lighting above it. Furthermore, if the Encore rooms are supposed to be suites, why isn't there a room deivder between the seating area and the bed? It would make an enormous difference - one wall would make this room a real suite. There is no secondary seating area. There seem to be fewer dresser drawers than the original Wynn (this is a suite, right?). And there are vast amounts of square footage of nothing but carpeting and dead space. Now I'm not suggesting that the Wynn Encore become crammed and cluttered like a Tokyo or New York apartment. But some more lighting options and a little more furniture would have gone a long way. Now about the stay itself - it was very disappointing compared to the Wynn main resort. Unlean windows. Hand prints on the mirrors. Crumbs on the carpet and sofa. It was shocking, actually, considering how perfect our stay at the Wynn was, and that both buildings have received the AAA 5-Diamond Award. So we think if you want the true Wynn experience, avoid the Encore until they can sharpen their game and fill in some details.

We stayed for 3 nights in the Encore in two Resort Suites (two girls per room). Upon arrival (at 12 noon), we were told check-in was at 3 pm but they would call us when the rooms were available (i.e. cleaned). By 1pm, we were in our room and it was fantastic. The bed was SO comfortable and because it was just two girls in a king sized bed, we never felt the other was in the same bed. The room was large with a separate living area, a great big bathroom and fun controls for the lighting and drapes. The downsides of the room included very little dresser space for our clothes and etc as well as being charged for using the fridge in the minibar. I.e., we couldn't keep our bottle of water cold because there was sensor in the fridge detecting if we put anything in there. Also, the snacks that are laid out so prominently on the cupboard were sensored that if you moved anything for more then 60 seconds, it was charged to your room. So, if I accidently knocked over the box of caramel corn/cookies, I'd be charged $10 for it. We went Labour Day weekend, along with everyone else in North America and it was packed. The pool was packed. The casino was packed. The restaurants were packed. We couldn't even have the concierge help us out with going to the nightclub (XS) because all lists were blacked out. Fortunately, we were a group of pretty girls and had no issues gettting in afterall even though there was a massive line-up to get into the club. The location of the hotel was not so great. Being on the north end of the strip, we were close to the fashion show mall but not much else. We had to cab everywhere since it was too hot to be outside walking for too long. Overall, great hotel. The casino needed some improvements since the layout was abit sporadic with tables and slots mixed in areas. Pool was FANTASTIC if you could get a seat (go early to get one on a long weekend).

The hotel itself is classy, beautiful, modern...all the things you would expect from Steve Wynn. The staff was always accommodating and courteous. I would like to first emphasis that the Encore is much smaller that the Wynn hotel. I thought the basic rooms were better designed and more refined that the Wynn. Also, I thought that the Euro pool area was better than Wynn. However, Encore HAS MAJOR SOUND ISSUES! Noise from the hallway is loud, which is surprising because the doors are so large and heavy. But that is just the half of it. We started our stay at the 21st floor on a Monday night. That night was club XS night! From across the entire pool area, from the 21st floor the sound and the bass was appalling! We did not sleep that night! Do not accept a strip view room that is from the 39th floor or below. XS will keep you up all night. It is truly shocking! Or take a mountain view room that doesn't face the strip to avoid the noise. However, to the staff's credit they listened, understood and moved us to the 59th floor with a better view and away from the noise. The decor of the Encore was both modern and elegant, but I would sooner stay at the Wynn than the Encore. I'm glad I tried it. Over all it was still a good stay.

We were greeted and after a few moments were looked after - good first impression. We agreed to pay for an upgrade for a better view. Then it started to go sideways. Got up to our room hoping to do a quick freshen up only to find the room wasn't cleaned. Called down to the desk they said they would switch us and would be up with a key. We waited and finally thought we have to go and deal with this later - opened the door and there he was in the hall - saying 'gee I wondered where you guys were' - maybe knocking might have worked. Better yet - knowing we were in a hurry - the offer to move out bags for us was met with 'oh that would be the bell desk' - not the answer you would hope for. Over all the stay was uninspiring from a service perspective. From the restaurants to the casino, most seemed to be less than enthused to be there.

Check in was easy, we upgraded to a high floor suite, which was well worth it. Room was elegant and sexy, just perfect.

We had a 50 min massage (too short), but spent 2+ hrs overall. Saunas, steam room, pools, showers, etc were great. Very relaxing and spa attendants were very attentive and professional. Pool gets crowded, but not overly so...just enough to make it fun. Get there early for a lounge chair. While several bathers were topless, it was all very respectable. Not an MTV crowd. Good pool service. We lost the sun for 1-2 hrs when it goes behind the Wynn, but otherwise plenty of direct sun. Sinatra was excellent. Pre fix meal for $50 was a good value. No cannolis offered though for dessert, which I found odd. We didnt do any of the night clubs, but I heard they are very expensive and Encore guest really dont have much priority over others. We saw a comedian at the improv at Harrah's, which was hilarious. Zumanity was interesting for 15 minutes, but then got old. Not worth it. Potential Cons: - north strip location requires longer walks and/or cabs to middle strip. I like this though as it keeps the casino floor and shops less crowded with non hotel guest. - while the restaurants and hotel rooms are worth the price, the little stuff is too expensive. Drinks, suntain lotion, etc are annoyingly expensive. Wine also tends to be 3x retail in restaurants, which is irksome. - we are not gamblers, so I cant comment on casino other than that it looked nice - probably not the best kid hotel.

Why else would he authorize his entire front desk staff to use cheesy laminated photographs of his hotel rooms \u2014 strategically shot to showcase views \u2014 and encourage them to blatantly lie and enhance the truth in an attempt to squeeze hotel guests for $25 or more extra per night beyond the rate they agreed to pay? Outside of Las Vegas, we call this BAIT & SWITCH. At Encore, they'll tell you that the non-smoking room you reserved is not available, but for an UPCHARGE, you can not only have the non-carcinogenic space that you reserved and have a right to, but a better view. Or, they'll tell you that their nightclubs are VERY LOUD. How loud? So loud that the room you booked will be thumping until 4AM. So . . . for a minor UPCHARGE, you can have a room on a higher floor (with a better view!) and save yourself the misery of being kept awake half the night. Did Wynn really build his new hotel with paper thin windows and walls? And if he did, does the music really need to be so loud? Are nightclub guests more coveted than hotel guests? The poor management of this property has infuriated numerous guests to the point that they will not return. Short sighted attempts to squeeze $25 more per night out of guests who fall for the trickery is unethical at best and illegal at worst.

Furious at this point, we proceeded to make a complaint at check in only to be told that the manager could not speak to us. When we were finally spoken to, we were given very little compensation at firsat but were eventually given $100 worth of food coupons and late check out...

We had a nice trip and we were happy with the hotel and the service. When we arrived at the hotel it was around 6pm so they didn\u2019t have anymore king rooms available (even though that is what I had reserved). They told me that they don\u2019t guarantee any room type. It was a Saturday when we checked in and that is there busiest night so I put in a request for a room change the next day. We got to our room which was on the 18th floor facing the Wynn/strip. We couldn\u2019t really see the strip because the Wynn blocks the view. We could also see the pools from our room. We thought the room was very big tons of open space. The one negative for the room with the double bed was that I could hear the club from our room. Just the base sound and it lasted until at least 3am. The next morning around 8am we looked out the window at the pool and noticed that people were starting to get seats. So we moved quickly and went down to the pool so we could grab a seat with an umbrella. There were about 8 umbrellas spread out around the pool area (you don\u2019t have to pay for these umbrellas\u2026I read somewhere in a previous post or on the forum that you had to pay for the umbrella per day this was not the case). The European pool didn\u2019t have any umbrellas unless you rented a cabana. So we used the other pool all week and got to the pool early to grab an umbrella. We did walk over to the Wynn pool since Encore guest have access to those pools as well. They also have two pools (one regular pool and one European pool). I didn\u2019t notice any umbrellas over there but a lot more shaded area from trees. The pool at the Encore has drink and food service. When you get your towels there is a menu you can grab and there are girls taking orders all day. They food was basically just sandwiches (starting at around $9 or $10 per sandwich nothing else is included). After we were finished at the pool we went back to the room and called the front desk about switching rooms since we hadn\u2019t heard anything. They did have a king bed available on the 38th floor on the other side of the hotel. The view wasn\u2019t great on that side either but at least we didn\u2019t hear the club. The king room is definitely smaller than the double bed rooms but overall it is still a really nice room. One nice thing is that the Encore and the Wynn are connected so you don\u2019t have to go outside to get to one or the other. This was also very helpful since it was so hot we always cut through the Wynn so we didn\u2019t have to be out in the heat as long. We ate at the Wynn buffet one night and it was $39 per person. They do have a large section of different types of food and a large section of desserts. I personally thought it was a little overpriced but it\u2019s the Wynn so its kind of expected to pay that price. The casino was very nice and clean. The pay outs weren\u2019t that great. Advice: Bring good walking shoes because you will do a lot of walking especially since the Encore is all the way at the end of the strip by the Fashion Mall. Also be prepared to spend a decent amount of money in Vegas. One afternoon we did a lot of walking and it was hot and we got thirsty. We stopped in I believe it was Bellagio to get a drink and for 1 small bottle of Fiji water and 1 fountain ice tea it was $10\u2026kind of steep but we were thirsty and needed a drink before we could get to CVS. I would definitely stock up at Walgreens, CVS or ABC on snacks and drinks to save money.

The housekeeping we found to be very poor, after 4 days there were still food crumbs on the carpet that were there when we had checked into our room,we had complained 3 times and eventually my hubby left a note on the pillow for the maid ASKING for her to vacuum and so she did. The noise from the club REALLY is THAT BAD... Our first stay on the 34th floor and even on the 55th floor on our second stay. I think it may not be so bad if you get a room facing North. Not allowed to take any food/drinks back to your room from outside of the hotel (even a sign stating that your bags may be checked) From what I saw though, the Encore staff didnt really bother about this rule and we took plenty back to our room,still it makes you feel like a naughty school child.

Trip started nice & I had read all of the neg reviews but wanted to go into the trip w/ good intentions--that was thrown out the door by the first evening. There were 9 couples that traveled w/ us & we all stayed @ the Encore on the same floor, but we still didnt have enough comp for anything. (You need to spend at least 30k in the casino to receive any comp...) First off, the air conditioner didn't work during our 4 day stay (the ave temp in Vegas @ the time was about 100 outside.) We complained & they brought up a service man (@ 8:30am on Sat morning mind you--so much for sleeping in) & he 'documented' that he fixed it, but we continued to be uncomfortable & woke up hot several times in during night(s). Property is just beautiful, I will give them that. Mr. Wynn attends to fine detail; the decoration/design is very impressive & just fabulous. Wish I was as rich as Mr. Wynn! Reality Checks: (and we're not the complaining type ...) Other than the a/c issue, our room wasn't cleaned for 2 days. They even sent up a maid to work out an alternative time for her to come back & but she never returned! Really! Greg Goose & Red bull in the casino - $27 bucks; Diet coke by the pool - $7 bucks (come on); the 21 & older pool simply does not have enough chairs for all the guests and my guess is that they do that purposely. You're not allowed to hold a chair for longer than 30 mins either. Laying by the pool was a pain in the buttock; it's basically a lounge where folks wear bathing suits and pretend their all models. The pool scene is totally plastic. The cabanas are rented out for $500/day; same w/ the chairs/lounges near the pool, they will set you back about $400-$600 depending which lounge you're reserving. The pool waitstaff is clearly more interested in assisting a celebrity that happens to be there rather than getting the average guest anything from the bar. And don't bother bringing booz from your room to the pool; they'll bite you're head off! Turkey sand @ the pool is definitely overpriced; go to Subway if you want a tightly wrapped sandwich in plastic. The chips & guac were a joke @ 10 bucks and little more than nothing. And of course the famous bait & switch room charge runs rampid during checkout. Every one of this 9 couple gang had problems checking out & having the hotel guarantee the advertised rate during the summer promotion ($119 promised; $169 charged.) Just remember to bring your email confirmation. We found the staff pretty condesending. We heard rumors that the reason the hotel staff is so rude b/c management treats them that way so that's why they take it out on the guests. Ya know what, I really don't care, just serve me b/c I paid for it! Basically, we thought this property was pretty high on itself. We won't be coming back no matter what the taxi drivers/locals said about Mr. Wynn priding himself on customer service b/c this place didn't have it. Stay somewhere else, you'll save yourself some $$ and have a much better time. On another note, my husband & I were shocked to see so many young children @ this adult playground.

It resembles the Belagio in certain ways but comes up short. As an adjunct to the Wynn it really doesn't have it's own distinct identity. Yes there are butterflies on just about everything but no defining personality. The pools are fine but not over the top like you expect in Vegas. They look as though they are part of a hotel built in the 70's or a nice \"motel\" Both pools were extremely crowded and both blasted loud annoying music non-stop. In fact, everywhere you went throughout the hotel there was the same loud, incessant music. It felt like a bad party where the host tried to compensate by blasting music. We stayed in the tower section of the hoel, which means you have a special entrance (less crowded) and seperate elevators. The actual \"tower\" is in the same building but double doors block off the rest of the hallway from the \"regular\" hotel. The suite was large and clean and new. Floor to ceiling windows looked out at an abandoned construction sight and parking lot. Remember this was from a top floor in the front of the hotel. Most other places I've stayed in Las Vegas all featured exciting views of the strip... so one has a sense of being out of the action. The truth is you are. The Wynn and the Encore are at the far end of the strip so that visiting most other casino's means a cab ride. As far as service goes it was well intentioned but off. For example, housekeeping would knock on our door despite our \"privacy please\" sign. In fact none of the hotel employees seemed to respect the \"do not disturb\". The engineering department merely knocked and entered,despite the DND and even though I made it clear when I called them to please wait until dinner time to come fix the electric curtains. By the way, from the time we checked in, the curtains were either stuck open or stuck closed. The engineers would come up tell us everything was working properly and leave. It was frustrating trying to sleep with the sunlight streaming in when they were stuck open or sitting in a darkened room during the afternoon. There was also a sense of some of their guest being more special than others. One day we entered a room off the tower checkin area. It was supposedly a VIP area for tower suite guests. They offered soft drinks and snacks throughout the day. We walked in and were asked to show our special red tower suite cards. I felt slightly taken aback and embarrassed because the guard asked us in a rather loud voice in front of other guests. When we showed our cards we were told we needed to have a special gold star on our card in order to enter. We were forced to leave. It just made us feel tacky and not \"special\" enough.

We arrived to our suite and it was awesome! Of course the bed was a Wynn bed which if you haven't slept in one you are missing something. Best night of sleep ever!!! Room decor was tasteful - my husband was making fun of the donut looking picture of O's but the room was lovely. The customer service was excellent from the maids in the halls greeting you and even the maintanance man in the elevator apologizing for delaying our trip to the casino when he entered and hit a floor several below ours. At the pool we found seats right away, in fact we were surprised at how UNcrowded the pool was. We set up and within about 30 minutes pool staff went around offering FREE iced bottles of water and FREE fresh cut up fruit. That was a first and wow it was awesome on a 100+ day in early August. Very impressed with everyone greeting - like Disney customer service. Later that night after a night of activities we arrived back at Encore and wanted a snack. They only have one \"coffee shop\" which is actually a bar and the prices were wayyyy too much for just fries and a ceasar salad. While the customer service and quality was good, this is when I missed being at a hotel that had an averaged priced \"coffee shop\". Also buffets and walk to Wynn was okay but a bit longer than I expected. Encore is way down the strip so I missed being more centrally located. Overall the entire staff and hotel is top notch, the slots were sooo tight couldnt win a thing but it was a beautiful hotel.

Check in was quick and the employee was extremely pleasant. The hotel and grounds are beautiful and immaculate. There are people constantly cleaning whereever you walk on the property. We stayed in a standard room on the 35th floor. It had a king bed, couch, desk, flat screen and gorgeous marble bathroom. There was a frameless shower and a large rectangular separate bath tub. We were very pleased with the accomodation. The restaurants at Encore and Wynn are fabulous! However, be prepared to pay for the beautiful ambience and delicious food. Most nights our bill game to $250. We researched all the restaurants on Trip Advisor before going on vacation. The best ones seemed to be at the Wynn and Encore. Needless to say, we made all our reservations at the restaurants there! SW steakhouse is out of this world. It overlooks the lake of dreams where they have light shows every 20 minutes. The filet was so tender I barely had to cut it. We also dined at Bartolotta. (Italian Seafood). The seafood is flown in daily from Italy. It was also beautiful. The food was great. What made it an interesting night is that we sat at a table next to Steve Wynn, his girlfriend Adrianna and two other couples they were with. Another night we ate at Switch. It is unique because the music , walls, and chandeliers actually switch every 20 minutes or so! We ordered the seafood platter for $85 for two and it was incredible!!! We also ate at Botero. It overlooks the pool and seems to be a bit more casual (but that doesn't mean cheaper!) The food was delicious. It seems to be more of a hip place to dine. If you like to people watch... then Encore is the place. Encore definitely attracts upscale people including the stars! Beyonce was performing at the hotel when we were there. Two days in a row we saw David Spade and Hugh Jackman sitting in the cabanas at the Encore pool. I saw Beyonce's mom walking in the hotel shop corridor one day! We went to the spa at Encore.

I find that to be very annoying and was glad that Encore was laid out differently. Our room was amazing. As Encore is a suites hotel, our suite was perfect. It looked exactly like the picture on the Internet. The only thing we couldn't preview before hand was the bathroom in our suite and again, we were pleasantly surprised. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive which only acted as a bonus to a fabulous hotel experience. The only downfall is that this is a luxury hotel, therefore, everything is expensive (a small bottle of water was $5 and $15 to use the Internet at the Business Center). Expect to pay loads of money for basic things. Other than that, it was definitely worth the stay and we highly recommend seeing the show La Reve while there and experiencing \"The Buffet\" at the Wynn. Both were amazing.

The room was beautiful. Not as large as a Pallazzo or Venetian suite, but much nicer and more comfortable. Bathroom was well put together, plenty of room for both of us to bath and get ready to go out. Bedroom area was nice, although a touch small. Beds are the most comfortable I have had in Vegas, just amazing. The Casino was also top rate. I love the concept of sepating the areas of gambling with curtains, made everything feel smaller than it is. The casino never had a crowded feeling that you get from other LV properties, even when the floor was buzzing before and after Beyonce shows. Dealers were very friendly, which is a nice touch.

And apparently the word 'suite' is a touchy one in Vegas. The desk agent kept insisting the hotel is 'all suite' but what we got just seemed like a 'room' - albeit a large one - but a room. Big and square. I've been told that in Vegas if you get a sofa and a table, they call it a suite. I think of 'suites' as being more than one room (ie. THEHotel). We talked to other folks at the pool who had issues at check in as well. One person said they had checked in with a confirmation on a room with two queen beds, but were told at check in no two bed rooms were available and they'd have to pay $50 more for a rollaway. The front desk staff was a little dismissive of any problems/issues in general. Not the way you would expect the desk at a 5-star to behave. The whole mini-bar situation was pretty ridiculous. They have the 'snacks' on top of some kind of metal plate that seems to send a signal that you should be charged if a snack is moved and not put back in a certain amount of time. (I was warned about this and cut a wide path around the snacks and the mini-bar). The restaurants in the hotel were all very expensive - even the takeout breakfast place charged $4 for a bagel with butter. Some of the food we got was even stale. But there was a sign posted outside the elevators saying no 'off premises' food was allowed in the room. So forget takeout. Having said all this, the room itself (they can call it a suite if they want, to me it was a 'room') was very nice, the bathroom lovely and spacious. The floor to ceiling windows in the room are quite stunning. (Even if you get a room like we did above the pool area where the music from the nightclub could well keep you up till the wee hours).

There is no cover charge for the adult pool only the warning that it is for 21 and over and there may be topless bathers there. Okay. The music was fine but wish the iced tea was better at $4.50 per glass. My husband and I had dinner at Botero for our anniversary dinner. It was good but not great. Craftsteak at MGM is better.

We chose to stay at the Encore as we thought it would be the epitome of luxury, and the tagged high dollar price ($250/night) would be worth the experience.

The shocking thing was there isnt even a coffee/tea maker, which is a standard amenity even at cheap motels. While other good properties on the strip provide a refrigerator for use, the one in our room had strict instructions not to use it for storing personal items. If we had to get a fridge in the room, there was another $25/day charge. The wireless internet in the room is not free, and the absolute worst is that we had to pay a fee for using the hotel spa facility. All this did make me wonder what did I pay the $250 a night for.

Only one bed, but chaise lounge in sitting/desk area good for me with a bad back. Only one TV - it swiveled, but kind of strange to have only one in a room of this nature. 2 main gripes- the pool closes between 5-5:30.

Buffet was definately a let down from previous experience, both regarding food and wait times to be seated.

Our rooms were not ready, but we did arrive earlier than check-in time, so we were told to wait until we got a phone call letting us know that we could go to our rooms. So we took ourselves off for lunch to the Society cafe, which was decent, and had friendly service. We actually had breakfast there most mornings, and whilst expensive, it was decent. Finally received the call to tell us our rooms were ready. When my friend reached her room, the housekeeper was still busy in there and told her she needed at least 20 minutes more to clean the room - so much for it being ready! My room was ready, and very nicely appointed with good amenities and a nice view of the north side of the hotel. The bed was exceptionally comfy, and the shower did have hot water! The suite is smaller than those of the Palazzo Hotel, where I have stayed numerous times, but seeing as I was by myself it was adequate. However, if I were to travel with my husband, I wouldn't stay here as I prefer more room space. I placed wake up calls, and those came right on the dot. The mini-bar and box are outrageously priced, so give these a miss - in fact, most of the restaurants and lounges in this hotel are very pricey! Ate at Botero in the hotel, which was superb and well worth the money spent. The waiter went out of his way to assist us with recommendations and I would most certainly return there.

The in room minibar has a nice layer of dust on them as everything is automatically charged so no one touches them and even the chamber maids are careful not to knock them down.

The rooms are huge and comfortable. The bathrooms are identical to the Wynn but still spacious, with separate shower, tub, and WC. The AC functioned great in the 105 degree heat. But who goes to Vegas to spend much time in their room? The casino is smaller than the Wynn, so you can find friends quickly. It is organized into slightly separated parlors, and, for the first time that I've ever seen, lined by windows, one side being the pool and the other side being a garden courtyard. The pool area is divided into a regular family pool, and then a separate \"European\" pool, for those 21 and over, with a bar area, televisions, a craps table and some blackjack. A scene to behold. The restaurants are top quality -- I recommend Botero for a poolside lunch and Wasuzu for excellent Asian. The Bloody Marys at the Society Cafe are outstanding. The exercise room is first class, and the men's spa is full of cool showers, whirlpools, and a couple of places to just sit quietly and relax. Most of all though, the staff is just terrific.

The hotel is located just up from the centre of the strip and is within easy walking distance of the central area. It is located next door to its sister hotel, Wynn, the two hotels are linked together making it very easy to wonder through from Wynn to Encore and make use of the exceptional facilities at both. Encore has a very European feel with lots of light in the building and attention to detail. It's not OTT Vegas in the same way as Caesars Palace more a refined retreat in the middle of all the madness. Rooms We booked a resort suite direct though the website and got a much better deal than was available through the major online travel sites. Check in was swift and I was able to get a room on the 37th floor with a view of down town Vegas. Friends had a strip review but had to pay $25 per night extra for it. The room was large with a good-sized separate living room area; bathroom was a good size with separate toilet, shower and bath. The room is equipped with all the modern cons you ask for including bipod dock and speakers and a fax. Pool & Spa The resort has 5 pools; we only made use of the two at encore. Both the main pool and European pool were lovely with lots of beds available. The only slight downside was the lack of pool servers. The spa at encore is amazing, very relaxing with good facilities. It's $35 per day or $75 for a 3-day pass, which also entitles you to use the gym. Restaurants & Bars During our stay we ate/drank in Society Cafe, Stratta, XS and Parasol Down. Society cafe - was a lovely spot for informal dining, the food was good and the service polite and efficient. The only slight issue we had was the photo shot in the bar area which meant we sat through dinner with a flash continually going off Parasol down - excellent spot for pre dinner or after dinner drinks, right on the lake of wonder on which a show is performed every 30 mins by a host characters from a giant singing frog to waltzing globes Stratta - located Wynn this was a nice pre-XS choice. We where there as a group of 20 which meant we had to have a set menu. The menu was very limited and not good value for money. In addition our group was split into 2 tables, had we known this we could have booked two separate tables and been able to eat the ala carte menu which was much more varied and better value XS - Excellent night club, be warned if you are a big group you really need to book a table otherwise you will struggle to get in and finding a place to sit/stand will be practically impossible. We booked a table for our party, it\u2019s not the cheap option but it gave us an area to ourselves (which is great as this place gets rammed later on), our own waitress and a lot of drinks.", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cBeauty and Color everywhere!

We booked 14 rooms for a sales retreat through work. Group Booking- Talk to Jojo. She was very helpful throughout the process and managed to get us a low price for two nights. The Wynn price and the Encore price were the same for group reservations. Dont expect ANY hookups though. They cant and could give us a single discount, resort, spa or any other credit for the group. I though Vegas was hurtin? Check in- Very easy and fast. We had a friendly smile greet us and accomodate an early checkin for our group since we arrived at 1. Check in is normally at 4. The cool thing is your room key is your players card, charge card and room key all in one. Its a snazy...RED with your name printed on it. Room- BEAUTIFUL. Extremely modern, comfortalbe and has a seperate living room area that is so nice. Pictures would try and do it justice. It had a long hallway, HUGE closet, and mirrors everywhere which were so nice for a girl getting ready to go out! Bathroom- HUGE. Two sinks, nice shower with great shower pressure and the most amazing bathtub. The amenities smelled yucky (lemongrass) but im sure men would like it. TV in the bathroom was fun too. BEST PART OF THE ROOM- Remote controlled drapes, lights, curtains ect. One button and off and on. No more getting up from bed! Also each room has a doorbell, with a light for privacy or clening room. No more hangers! Pool- SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW service.

Took our group of 10 who was ready to DRINK about 45 minutes to get service. Even got up to get service 4 times!!! Honestly the service was good throughout the hotel, comfortable beds, and worth the price you pay. The casino isnt very big so you are not super overhwlemed to go from one end to the other.

The rooms(I stayed in a King room) areIMO the best in Las Vegas. I have stayed at Wynn, Signature, The HOTEL, Bellagio, and Mandalay Bay and while all of these hotels have VERY nice rooms Encore really has the art of a beautiful room down to the tee! Note: Encore has around 2000 rooms but only about 400 of them have two beds while the remaning 1600 are King bed ONLY rooms so take this into consideration when booking if you have more than 1 person in your room. Also the sofa in the room does not fold out into a sofa-bed. OK on to the Encore King bed room review..... Floor to Ceiling windows: HUGE set of 10-12 foot tall large windows that fill the WHOLE wall of the far end in the room. Furniture: Blonde wood furniture that is stately, good quality and contemporary. Sofa, bed, ottoman and chairs are all attractive and good quality. Bathroom: Large marble bathroom with above average quality make-up mirror, thick satin robes, georgous inlaid beveled mirrors, large soaking tub, large glass walk-in shower, electronic scale, dual sinks with Kohler faucets, thick towels, seperate small room for the toilet, and a small falt-screen t.v. Fabrics/Lighting/Crown Molding: The room is anything but dark or depressing and has fabulous lighting placed in all the perfect spots. There are lights hidden underneath some of the furniture. Lights are also inlaid into the black laquer crown molding that gives the room a feeling that you are in an expensive showroom or clothing boutique. There is black laquer crown molding all over the room and not just in the higher ceiling areas but also in the floor areas which again gives the room a showcase type atmosphere. There are at least four areas in the guest room that have different colored/textured thick high-quality fabrics that are in-laid against the walls that give the room a multi-demonsional chic contemporary yet palatable feeling to the room. Carpet/Drapes: The carpet is a beautiful beige colored with hints of a slightly darker beige color that give it a textured palate. The drapes are electronically conrolled by a bed-side touch panel which is only found in the highest up-scale type guestrooms. Flat Screen T.V.: The SHARP T.V. has about 40 channels and all are HD which is another thing only found in top up-scale hotel rooms. Most hotels in Vegas have very few t.v. stations but at Encore you have about 40 of them with only about 2-3 hotel advetisement channels mixed in with the regular channels. Also the t.v. has Mood music which has 5 different choices of music(jazz, pop, rock, rap, classical) and it is sattelite radio with no commercials. The sound on the t.v. music channels is excellent and also shows video clips/pictures of the artist for each individual song played. Doors/Entryway: The front entry door, bathroom door, closet door are all very thick stately doors and add to the rooms feeling of a posh sanctuary. The long etnry way is all marble with a whole wall of wood in-laid mirrors which make your enry sweeping and vivid. Closet: The closet has some drawers with a large enough electronic safe to fit a laptop computer and the closet has big thick double doors. Mini Bar area: The room has a stylish peice of furniture that houses the mini bar and also has a slide-out \"drink station\" that houses the in-room glasses(wine, cocktail glasses) and is nice for keeping your drink making supplies housed. There is plenty of room on top of the actual mini bar peice of furniture to set-up a bar if you choose. The actual mini-bar located inside this peice of furniture has alot of choices(premium liqours, ect.) that again are only found in the best of hotels. Ceiling in the living room area: The ceiling in this area is beveled with in-lay lighting and with the other things in the room makes the atmosphere chic and multi-demonsional. Beds/Beddding: Beautiful big beds with good quality sheets/comforter, The bed along with the two regular pillows also has two huge body pillwows(much larger than regular bed pillows) which are only found at higher-end hotels. Service: I am a light smoker and while in Las Vegas I reserved a smoking room. I ran out of the one book of matches provided and called housekeeping to have another book of matches sent up and within 10 minutes a young man was at the door with two books of matches in a crystal bowl served on a silver platter for me to take. Everyone from the front desk, bellman, valet, to the service people I passeed in the hallways was very gracious, hard working, dedicated and genuinely friendly. Las Vegas has a difficult time giving good service beacuase the hotels are so large(3,000 room hotels) but at Encore they really exuded an effort that made it seem like I was at a 300 room hotel instead of a 2,000 room hotel. While getting ice from my hotel room floor I encountered a few service workers and they all seemed genuinley happy to say hello and make me feel like I was in a hotel that cherished it's guests. There are plenty of less expensive places to eat accross the street at the Fashion Show Shopping Mall if you do not wish to eat/drink at the Encore and Wynn hotels which may not be affordable for all people. Encore and Wynn are connected together and are both owned and operated by the same people If you want a beautiful room in Las Vegas then I would say Encore should be VERY high on your list as this same type of room in California or NYC would be $400/per night but is available for you at often close to half the price. A website called smartervegasDOTcom has Encore and Wynn room rate specials directly from the Encore and Wynn hotels. One more Note: The nightclub at Encore called XS stays open until 4am Friday- Monday and the noise can travel up to the rooms so if you definately are a light sleeper and want a quiet room then ask for a guestroom facing the North as the guestroons facing south are the ones that can be affected by the possible nightclub noise becuase the XS club is on the southside of the Encore guestroom tower.

I would definitely suggest Encore over the Wynn, both are AMAZING and beautiful hotels but Encore is newer. I actually stayed at Encore for cheaper than the Wynn.

Fun electronic switchboard next to the bed that controls lighting, sheers and draperies. Encore and Wynn are connected and the walk is very pretty.

All this means that you will be constantly amazed by the interior design. My one complaint about Encore are the restaurants. We went to two - Tableau and Switch. At Tableau, we found a hair in one of our dishes. At Switch, I had mentioned my severe allergy to nuts and peanuts and they promptly served me nut bread. Luckly, I inspected my food before consuming and caught the bread. However, if I had not, this would have ruined my entire trip (I would have been sick and may have needed hospitalization).

We did not know what to expect from our recent stay at the Wynn Las Vegas. Perhaps that\u2019s why we enjoyed it so much. The Tower Suites section of the Encore has a private entrance and lobby. Our suite on the 51st floor had a stunning view of the Las Vegas Strip. Wow. The room itself was filled with modern conveniences - a huge flat screen TV that rotated to be viewed from the living area or bedroom, an iHome docking station, a control panel by the bed to open the drapes, turn off lights, etc. The bed was comfortable and the living room furniture - resort casual off-white and black - was functional and stylish. The beautiful bathroom featured a separate shower and tub along with the now-requisite TV-in-the-wall and separate room for the toilet. This was our first experience with a Wynn property and now we can say we see what others are talking about. The service was very good and the overall attention to detail in design and experience was very successful. We had drinks in one of the bars and enjoyed dinner at two of the many restaurants (Botero and Sinatra). Both of our dinners were among the best we\u2019ve had recently - and despite their fancy pedigree were more realistically priced than some of the supposedly \u201cgreater\u201d meals we\u2019ve had in Europe this year. We had a wonderful massage in the Spa as well. It\u2019s a beautiful facility and despite the somewhat uneven service (the masseuses and welcome staff were great, but the attendants had a bit too much attitude) and messy clientele (guests left towels everywhere which never seemed to get picked up), we loved it. The walk to the treatment rooms is not to be missed and is one of the prettiest such environments we\u2019ve seen at a spa anywhere. Staying here is not cheap, but we think it\u2019s worth it.

The two pools provide more than enough space for everyone to get a seat at the pool. We were going down to the pool around 10am and had no trouble get a bed. The encore pools get the sun for far longer than the wynn pools, so if your looking to sunbathe I would recommend the Encore over the Wynn. the family pool is a good size, if you want to sit at the european pool or even walk through it you need to be over 21 and provide ID. The pools are not heated but with the strenght of the sun I found the cold pools refreshing. The food in the hotel was very good. Wazuzu was my favourite, I would recommend the Thai spicy basil.

When we arrived we were told there were no more panoramic suites available and were offered a room on the 12th floor overlooking the pool (Roughly the worst location possible, given noise from XS) we declined and asked for something higher up and got a room on the 35th floor facing the Riviera. It's disappointing that a 5 star resort would not honor the room you booked and offer you a worse room, not a better one. After speaking to a manager we were offered a late check out, which was fine, but didn't really make up for not getting the correct room. The room we got was fantastic nonetheless, bed was very comfortable, and overall we were VERY impressed with our suite. Unfortunately the pool is too small for the weekends and was extremely crowded, but was easy to get a seat on weekdays (and Sunday). The real bummer about Encore is that everything is just so ridiculously priced. Our poolside snacks (2 sandwiches, chips & salsa ) ran us about $40. A bowl of cereal from room service was 15 dollars after the 'delivery fee', 12 buffalo wings were $41. I understand that hotels charge more than general, but this was absurd. To make matters worse, it's a pretty decent walk to get anywhere else to get some food, so you are definitely captive to whatever Encore charges. We ate at Switch and it was wonderful, as well as the cafe at Wynn, which was also very good. The lobby bar at Encore had good coffee (About 3.50 for a small) and danishes ($7).

I am a seasoned traveler and I have stayed at the Wynn multiple times because we've had phenomenal stays there. So naturally when I received an offer from the Wynn offering me a spectacular rate for the Encore ($109/$159), clearly due to the economy, I jumped at the chance. I had already booked an amazing room elsewhere in Vegas, but I couldn't say no to the Encore, believing it would be even more wonderful than the Wynn. MISTAKE. At check-in, we had to almost beg for a room that wasn't facing XS because we weren't interested in being kept up all night by the club. After much back and forth and phone calls between the desk and \"someone\", we were offered a room that was acceptable to us (ie, non-smoking and not facing the club---we're not asking for much here). But when it was time for me to sign off on the room rate, WOW they tried to charge me a rate that was about $75 more PER NIGHT than the rate I had booked with. Nope, not an upgrade/upsell as you may be thinking -- the Encore actually tried to argue with me that this MUCH higher rate was what I had booked. I insisted that they were completely incorrect and they insisted \"this is an excellent rate.\" Well, this isn't a negotiation, I booked a guaranteed rate, directly through your hotel website using a promotion that your hotel emailed me personally----honor the rate I booked! They insisted that I must be mistaken. FORTUNATELY I had the foresight to have printed out the actual daily rate and final total for the full stay from my computer screen at the time I booked (NOTE: the email confirmation that they send you does NOT have this detailed information, the confirmation only has the deposit charge rate). After digging through our luggage in the middle of the check-in area for 15 minutes, I found the paper that confirmed that YES, INDEED the rate I booked was $109/$159 per their direct email promotion. They insisted that their computer must be making some sort of error for an unknown reason and they agreed to honor the lower rate--you know, the one that I had actually booked. Needless to say, this was an AWFUL way to spend our first hour in Vegas and tainted our entire vacation. You might be thinking \"oh, that must have been a random computer glitch, I'm sure that a hotel of the caliber of the Encore would never do that again.\" Well, 2 weeks later, my friend had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM---he had to PROVE to the Encore that they were attempting to overcharge him for his hotel room (the room that he had booked using the same Encore email promotion, the same rate, directly booked through the hotel website). And as you can see from other reviews, it has happened to others. I have to wonder how many hundreds of other people are having the exact same \"bait and switch\" happen to them. If you have, you should definitely share it here. If not, and you're planning to stay at the Encore, BE WARNED, and print out the computer screen snapshot that confirms your final room total AND your rate, and have it with you when you check in. Make sure that your booked rate matches the one that you sign off on at check-in. As for the Encore itself, the Wynn/Encore have increased, significantly, the prices of everything, including room service which used to be reasonably priced. The buffet costs more but has gone downhill (try PH buffet instead). Housekeeping is fine except they won't replenish any of the toiletries until you're completely out. No slippers at the Encore (you get them at the Wynn). I liked the Encore pool and spa better than the Wynn's. Wazuzu was great.

The rooms are really nice, very comfortable bed and good bathroom. Although a \"suite\" the standard encore room is about the same size as a Wynn panoramic room. Housekeeping was good and the room was cleaned well each day. When I checked in there was a problem with a loose toilet seat (!) but this was repaired the following day. So that was good. Plenty of elevators, so no queuing / crowding unlike other vegas hotels (mandalay bay, I'm talking to you) The pool area was good, use the european area to get away from the kids! Whilst I was there the staff we removing towels, so no lounger hogging was going on, which is good. The pool was never crowded, probably due to unusual June temperatures in the 80's rather than the 100's. It looks quite a small area, however having later stayed at the mirage, it's about the same size as their pool, but not as big as Mandalay Bay (but I think that's the biggest).

Society Cafe's breakfast menu wasn't great, other than the ultimate steak sliders which were fantastic, service was patchy, if well meaning! The only downside was the sound proofing, yes you can hear your neighbours! But for me only on a couple of occassions, and XS if your room faces the pool. It's that low level, barely audible noise that you get from the club, but you know it's there it does irritate. My tip is to bring your ipod and use in in room ipod dock and play it quietly so your noise covers their noise. Location wise you are on the end of the centre strip, but I would recommend a trip to the peppermill a couple of blocks north for real vegas kitch experience.

We expected everything to be perfect at a Wynn property, but it was far from it. First, when I called to make our reservations, the agent said they would make a note of my husband's birthday, and the hotel would send a basket of some sort to our room. Also, when we checked into the hotel, the desk agent again said they would be sending something to our room to acknowledge DH's birthday. We were there from Friday afternoon until Monday afternoon, and nothing arrived at our room. Thank goodness I hadn't told him to expect anything from the hotel. Second, there was the issue of not having any hot water Saturday. Although we received a $50 credit on our invoice, we still can't believe something like this could happen at Encore. To say the showers we took that day were *cold* would be an understatement. Third, we dined in-room Saturday evening. When we placed our order at 9:10, we were told our meals would arrive at 9:40. At 9:50 we received a call saying our food would be delayed another 5 minutes. It was much longer than 5 minutes; our food didn't arrive for over an hour. We were charged $66.00 for a couple of pizzas, so the least they could have done was to deliver them on time. Fourth, Sunday, which was DH's birthday, as well as being Father's Day, we tried to eat at the buffet, starting at 1:00 pm. We waited in line for over an hour and were still nowhere even close to the cashier. I understand that a larger number of guests than usual dined there because of Father's Day, but that wasn't the issue. Guests should have been told when they joined the long line that the wait was almost 2 hours. As it was, after we waited in line so long and realized we still had an equally long wait, we finally just left and went somewhere else to have lunch.

I liked that no matter how much you were playing they asked for your card so they could rate you. we were playing 20 dollars normally a spin on roulette and they wanted our card. At the Bellagio last year, even playing 25 dollar a hand blackjack nobody ever asked for our card. Pool at Encore was great atmosphere. We used the adult pool and service was excellent, always a waitress ready to take your order. Drinks were expensive but they are marked in the menu. Nobody is forcing you to buy them. What we had was very good. Didn't order any food because it looked pre-made. Ate lunch at The Country Club in the Wynn. Great spot, even better prime rib sandwich. That sandwich will be part of me vegas itinerary going forward. Had dinner at Bartolotta. Good not great. We did multiple seafood pasta dishes and while the fish was very fresh, the pasta was just ok. Sea Bass tortelini was not memorable and risotto with clams, calamari, etc. was way to buttery. The inside setting was kind of blah, we got a table outside near the lagoon so that was very nice but I would have not eaten there if I couldn't get the outside table. I would have hit up B&B in the Venetian/Palazzo. Ate there is August 08, had 8 entrees, one better than the next. Encore has a great location, connected to Wynn, which connects to Pallazo via sky bridge. Did XS club on Sunday night. great indoor outdoor setup. Encore gave us free passes, would have been 30 for me, 20 for my wife without it. Drinks are expensive, 20 dollars for 2 Miller Lites. But a cool expierence.

I got to the hotel and was told they do not have a 2Q room available to me but a complimentary roll away bed will be sent to our room within the next few minutes. We waited for over an hour until we decided to call housekeeping and they told us they will be bringing one over within the next half hour. 30 min later...nothing. We called again and housekeeping would not pick up, so we called guest services and were told we would get the roll away soon. Since we were going out that evening, we told them they can enter the room and leave the bed there. We came back at 2am and there was still no extra bed! We called housekeeping and they finally fessed up that they have no more roll aways available. That was all the explanation we got from them.

The bed was good quality, the linens were excellent and closet space was ample. The floor to ceiling windows helped open up the room and make it seem more expansive. The bathrooms are huge and well-appointed with a separate shower and bath and double sinks. Our room was on a low floor and faced the pool area which meant that room noise from the XS club was in full effect every night. I'm a heavy sleeper so it never bothered me, but it would definitely be a problem for a more sensitive person. Service was first class and efficient. Valet cars were delivered promptly, the front desk handled all questions and requests immediately. The property is spotless as workers constantly polish door handles and glass removing al traces of fingerprints and smudges. The lobby and casino areas were gorgeous with lots of \"lucky\" red splattered around the public areas. The two pools were are bit tight for the space they occupied and virtually all the chaises were occupied by 10AM on a week-end.

My wife had been at a spa and showered earlier that day while I took a brief, cold shower with little pain. For me the $50 resort credit was apology enough, but I understand that for others this interruption might have been way more of an inconvenience. I've read a few months of Encore reviews here on TA and there have been occasional hot water lapses so this is an ongoing problem at this property. This is still a young hotel so they can hopefully solve this problem and move on, but it is troubling. My little brother told me on Saturday \"Hey, I paid $40 at the Sahara and *we* have hot water. Other engineering problems exist too. My wife bought a spa day pass on Sunday to hang out with girlfriends that were getting treatments, but then found that the sauna wasn't working. She was refunded the $30/day charge but was disappointed that the one amenity that she really wanted to use was unavailable. For rooms, service, gaming and amenities Encore can't be beat.

I had booked directly through the hotel website to take advantage of good rates and a resort credit package. Let me preface the review by mentioning that we have stayed in most of the hotels on the Strip over the years so I have a reasonable perspective for comparison. I'll also mention we experienced the hot water problem noted in other reviews - more on that later. From what I gather, the Tower Suites operate as a \"hotel within a hotel\" as the checkin desk described, catering to only a few hundred guests. It appears the Tower consists of the 3-4 rooms on each floor on the west end of the Encore hotel. The Good - we arrived on Friday evening around 5:00, so we had the usual airport congestion and road traffic. One of the best features of the Encore Tower Suites is the separate portico entry outside and separate lobby/check-in. This was WONDERFUL. Staff was very professional and made us feel welcome from the moment we stepped out of the cab. Bell staff was great and the front desk was uncrowded and very nice. When asked about the nature of our stay, we mentioned it was our anniversary and were later that night pleasantly surprised to find a wonderful chocolate tray with \"Happy Anniversary\" on it, with a nice handwritten card from the desk. Very nice touch. Overall the checkin was perfect - cool towels and bottled water to boot. That alone might make the Encore Tower Suites worth the upgrade. We also had spa treatments, and the Encore spa is the best I've used. Very very nice and relaxing. We were on the 62nd floor which offered stunning views of the Wynn and down the strip. The floor to ceiling windows were outstanding. Other reviewers have posted pics and described the rooms. Overall, very clean, modern, with the remote control light, drape and privacy sign controls right near the bed. Very cool. Bathroom was excellent. In room safe was a nice feature. Minor annoyances - a few things were mildly annoying for a hotel positioned in this class of service. On check-in I was asked if I would like a complimentary paper in the mornings. I said 'yes', the NY Times. The desk said they would be delighted to provide that. I never did receive it, only the local LV paper. Also, the lovely chocolate plate mentioned above was charged to my bill. I don't expect too many freebies at a hotel like the Encore, but I didn't ask for nor approve of the charge. This annoyance was offset by the fact that we enjoyed the plate but nonetheless it was a bit presumptive. Also there were times when our phone did not connect to any hotel services - front desk, concierge, nothing. And our cell phones did not work in the hotel (we use T-Mobile and the bell staff said TMo and Verizon do not seem to work inside the hotel). Major annoyances - OK, our experience with the hot water. Friday evening we were readying to go out to dinner and - no hot water. I called the front desk and they confirmed that the whole hotel was without hot water with no estimated time for a fix. So we went out as-is, without showering - just some basic cleanup with cold water. The next morning - still no hot water and we had Spa treatments scheduled. Many treatments were canceled for the day as the spa had limited to no hot water either - only a shower or two. The steam room was working. The hot tubs were not hot. My wife's pedicure in the salon was with tepid water. The spa did offer 20% off the treatments we were able to do, which was a nice gesture. Back in our room, we had oil and spa-residue in our hair and on our bodies - still no hot water. Later in the afternoon there was a note from Steve Wynn in the room explaining that there was a major water line problem that would take until the evening to fix. The letter stated he and the staff were embarrassed and they were offering a $50 credit for the inconvenience. We kept trying the hot water in our room and it finally came back late evening. We were never notified of the estimated time to fix or that it was indeed back on. This problem was limited only to the Encore, as the Wynn kept hot water service throughout. Upon checkout, my bill was about $800 over what I was expecting. We had used room charging for most activities such as dining and the spa, but it was very much more than expected for such a short trip. The package I booked was a pre-pay, but the room was listed again each night for nearly double the rate I had agreed to pay (and had in fact paid already). The front desk seemed a bit confused and I had to dig around and find my online reservations and receipt. In the end, they found the real pricing but were unable to explain why they had added the room charges again to my bill. Again, while they apologized I felt like I had to sort of argue with them to get this understood and fixed. So why 3 out of 5 stars? Service overall was good. The staff seemed to try hard to greet you, open doors, make you feel welcome, etc. Again, the separate entry and check-in is wonderful for the Tower suites. But this is not an inexpensive resort so to me it's fair to have high expectations. Even discounted room rates aren't trivial for a weekend getaway and I felt like I was being nickel and dimed (or in the case of the Encore/Wynn - \"tenned and twentied\") for everything. Dining is pricey. A typical mixed drink at the bar out by the pool was $14 (strawberry margarita, non top shelf). The hot water issue, while it could happen to any hotel....hasn't ever happened to me at any other hotel. And during the entire problem, we felt like we were just supposed to guess what to do next. Really bad communication and I guess not enough.....\"humility\"? from the resort. In the end, when I stay at a hotel I want a nice comfortable place to sleep and a place to get clean and ready to go about my trip. The bed indeed was nice. But spending the majority of our trip without hot water to shower or shave and have no sense of when it would be fixed, and then no substantive acknowledgement that this negatively impacted quests was a major turn off to the Encore. The hotel has so much potential and I wanted very much to find perfection there. But in the end it was too inconsistent, too pricey in the wrong places, too...glitchy to recommend. I went away not having enjoyed my stay as much as I had wanted. If the hot water issue had not occurred, I might have rated the hotel a 4 out of 5 but still would have keep looking for another higher end resort. For the bottom line money I spent, I expected to walk away having found our new LV destination. We'll have to keep looking. One other note that may be factoring into my Encore/Wynn experience. We booked (ahead of time) a patio table at the Daniel Boulloud restaurant at the Wynn. I wanted to enjoy the quirky Lake of Dreams shows with dinner. The restaurant was fine, but our table - while on the patio - was crammed back into a service corner with no view of the lake. To boot, in the middle of the second LOD show, the show stopped abruptly (crashed) and that was that.

Don't eat outside if you don't like birds tho, there are sparrows everywhere (although they always seemed to wait until you'd finished with your meal, which was polite I thought).

We arrived on a Sunday and after flashing my '$20 trick,' I politely requested to be moved from the 39th floor to the 54th strip view floor. I don't really know if it was the tip that worked or just being persistent and friendly. I do believe that any of the higher floors are considered an upgrade as I overheard a conversation between another couple and the desk clerk discussing a \"$25 nightly charge\" to be on a higher floor. In any case, the hotel room was absolutely FABULOUS with GORGEOUS views. The Encore casino itself was extremely clean, the cleanest on the strip. I constantly saw housekeeping staff going around and wiping down all of the machines. I'm attaching some photos, so you can view for yourself. Everyone in the hotel was both friendly and personable, willing to help when needed instead of some places where they pretend not to see/hear you :P. Of all the hotels/casinos we visited, only at Encore and Sam's Town did someone open the doors for you (surprising since we also visited the Bellagio, Venetian, etc). BTW, if interested, I will be writing a full review of Sam's Town tomorrow complete with pictures, which I find to be a family friendly off-strip resort complete with a separate non-smoking casino. Which reminds me, Encore was the least smoky of all the casinos that we visited, I rarely saw anyone smoking there (yay). If you check my screenname in a couple days, you can find reviews of the various restaurants at Encore, but I highly recommend visiting Wynn's Champagne Sunday Brunch, or the Buffet at any time. It was the highest quality and freshest food of any Buffet that I have ever visited. We occasionally go to some rather extravagent restaurants, and I would compare the food at the Wynn Buffet to some of those restaurants. I don't like to diss, but I would skip the Bellagio Buffet. More than just a few dishes we tried there seemed to be spoiled, the desserts were unimaginative and plain, comparative to any $8 buffet that you can find in your own hometown. BTW, their prime rib was tough and was not tasty. Also notable mention includes Tableau for breakfast, and Daniel Boulud (had the best seafood/shellfish that I have ever had the honor to taste, and I grew up on the beach where fishermen brought in their catches directly to the market). Society cafe was nice for a lunch, nice atmosphere with a view of the casino. Just to note, we found a deal on slickdeals.net for our room, it was $109/night and gave us a $50 resort credit and $25 slot play. Oh, can't forget to say that I found Encore to have loosest slots, even over Wynn. I know some other people might try to argue this, but maybe they are better because Encore is new and less crowded and wanting to attract people? We gambled there every morning for about 4-5 hours. The first day we used our $25 slot credit and my $10 slot credit to play for about 5 hours and didn't spend another dime. Other days had similar experiences, I think the most we spent per person was $30-$40 and got all the free coffees/specialty drinks we wanted. We played \"Wizard of Oz\" and some \"Star Trek\" game that my husband loved, (he is sorta a star trek geek ;) .

One night I heard parts of a conversation from the next room but I think it was a fluke that we happened to both be sitting on the sofa. The flat screen TV couldn't have been any bigger. The remote control everything - lights/drapes/etc. was great too. Warning - the bathroom toilet flushes as if it were designed by the same people who engineered airplane lavatories.

Even put my feet up and watched a quarter of the NBA Finals in the lounge afterward. Not sure how the spa treatments were because I didn't indulge. THE POOL: I read others post about how the pools at Encore were too small, and/or too noisy. They were fine to me but then I wasn't here to lounge poolside for hours at a time. Went early one morning (9ish) and at 5 on a different day. Sat in the European section since it was the shadier option given the design of the builidngs. It was an adult crowd, not wild in the least. The \"family\" pool area was much more crowded but there were seats available in both areas. Never saw anyone in the pool side cabanas. Drink prices: one word - expensive. Take a nip from the bottle in your room before you go down to the pool. The FOOD: I ate breakfast at Tableau (Wynn) every morning. Unbelievable! If you eat the (shredded) Kobe short ribs and eggs for breakfast you can skip lunch. Not just filling but GOOD and filling. Also had the french toast and cream of wheat - not a bad bite in any of my meals. THE SLOTS/TABLES: I am not a gambler. Was able to make $10 last for an hour (2 drinks) playing 25 cent slots. For table players, there is an incentive to get up early. Not sure if its advertised or for how long but I saw with my own eyes $5 tables at both Encore and Wynn every morning as I began my trek over to the Venetian (before 9am). THE LOCATION: Many mentioned how \"far away\" Encore is from the action. Personally I liked that. I had to walk to the Venetian for my conference everyday. From my door to the meeting rooms of the Venetian took roughly 15-20 minutes. I'm a fast walker and I didn't stop to window shop. Walked from Encore down to Caesar's to have dinner at Bradley Ogden one night. Didn't time it but it had to be 25 minutes (ped traffic doesn't move as fast in Las Vegas). Went as far down as the Bellagio to check out the fountains. The trek back took a good 30 minutes. If 30 minutes is too long (or you have shorter legs), worry not, cabs are plentiful, the self-park gargages are open and the Duece was coming and going quite often. In summary, if/when I go back to Las Vegas I won't stay anywhere else.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cA hotel that sets a new, basic standard for a five star experience\u201d", "Author": "sterre0", "ReviewID": "UR32504922", "Content": "In my previous and first trip to Las Vegas this past January, I stayed at TheHotel adjacent Mandalay Bay on the opposite end of the strip. At the conclusion of that review, I said I was so impressed with the experience that out of the many, many Vegas choices, I would return to TheHotel on the next trip. I lied. After a $110 a night offer I couldn't refuse, I decided to alternate to the north side of the strip on this trip and attempt Encore. As i've said in previous reviews, i'm one of those people who hunts and pecks through sites like Trip Advisor trying to find the perfect hotel with the least amount of negativity in the reviews. Having just come back from Encore and read some of the more recently posted negative reviews, I've come to conclude what's an obvious reality: Not everybody's experience is going to be perfection, and sites like these do tend to seek out and lure those that did *not* have a good experience. That being said, Encore's world class. There's no other way to put that. I live in northern california and i'm not near a whole lot. I'm not a world traveler, and I don't have money to blow on a regular basis. When I do blow it, I blow it a couple times a year on a vacation experience that's hopefully five star. I can now safely say that not only is Encore fully worth my money, it's five star. On arrival at 6pm on a Saturday, we were checked in with no wait. On mentioning we were celebrating a birthday for this trip, we were upgraded to a Panoramic view (Top 10 floors) room at no charge. While the view is important to me, and I did have high hopes for a strip view, I ended up with the opposite north-facing view. Did I care anyway? No. Was the panoramic, crystal clear window view of the northern strip and downtown Las Vegas phenomenal and amazing to look out at at night? Absolutely. The rooms are amazing, simply put. I have all the same fears a lot of people do. Bad housekeeping, poorly sound-insulated walls, uncomfortable beds, etc. I found none of that. It's a brand new five star hotel, and it shows in every way and every detail. From the automatic curtains, to the incredible bed linens, to the high definition swiveling television, to the touch sensor bedside controller that allows you to choose different variations of lighting throughout the room, it's a new definition for five star. I heard no noise from my neighbors. I heard barely any noise from the hall. I slept very nicely in an amazingly comfortable bed. Is the hotel perfect in every single way? Obviously not. No hotel is. $14 a day for WiFi access is still a dissapointment but seems to be a recurring theme in most high-end strip hotels. It's also, quite honestly, a tad bit of a hike to get from the Encore elevator bank to the front end of Wynn. But when you're hiking through meticulously designed esplanades that feature all-natural lighting and marble with colored designs and flowers all over the place, along with rows of shops that likely sell lots of things probably worth my annual income, you can't much complain. You came to Encore for a large, high class luxury experience. That's exactly what you're getting. I'll wrap it up with simply this: As amazing as the hotel itself can be, the staff often times make people's experiences a good, bad or horrendous one. Nobody's perfect, and I've run into bad service at high end hotels myself as well. I've read about bad service at Encore in prior reviews here, and it's probably true. There's a tremendous amount of employees working here. I can only testify to my own experience. And as far as the staff goes, everyone I interacted with was incredibly courteous, helpful and genuinely intent on making me a repeat customer. I will be.

I had stayed once a few years ago at Wynn and was favorably impressed, and Encore is also lovely. I will say, maybe my expectations were too high, but I can still recommend the hotel for those who are not budget minded and appreciate great service in a classy, dignified hotel that isn't megasized. My first two nights of my four night trip were spent at THEHotel at Mandalay Bay, so I got an opportunity to directly compare. Of the two, I prefer the airier Encore decor, both in the common areas and the standard guestroom suites. THEHotel room is a \"true suite\" in that the bedroom is separated from the living area with a full wall and door, and it has an extra bathroom (one sans tub or shower). The Encore is similar in style to the Venetian/Palazzo \"suites\" in that there is no door or full wall separating the bed chamber from the living area. Unlike the Palazzo though, the living and bedroom areas at Encore share one television. Thus, if you desire true privacy, you might be better served at \"THEHotel.\" But the effect in a room of similar size to the Encore suite makes the living area at THEHotel feel a little more cramped and dark. Since I was traveling alone, I preferred the feeling of spaciousness offered by the Encore and the floor to ceiling window overlooking the strip and the golf course (as well as some roof equipment) offered much more natural light than its counterpart. The room: I was not in love with the black and beige color scheme, but it worked well in the room visually. It just isn't my taste as much as the more colorful and rich looking Wynn Tower rooms. The sofa placement wasn't particularly convenient for watching TV with a drink and snack. There is a side table but it is inches from the TV, so to use it you have to sit too close for comfort to the 46 inch screen. The chaise side of the sofa had no side table. There is a leather ottoman in place of a coffee table, but it is white and I didn't feel comfortable placing food and drink items on it. Tdesigner just wasn't being real practical with the layout of that space. Otherwise the room is well-equipped with nice generous sized toiletries, beautiful quality rock and wine glasses and corkscrew, plenty of towels and wash cloths two clocks--one on each night table, three phones, sufficient outlets for computers, phone charges etc., separate tub and shower, comfy robes, and slippers I didn't use. The closet is small but it has a chest of drawers and an ironing board inside and more hangers than anyone should need. (Weirdly, moments after the bellman left, a housekeeper arrived to give me another hanger, for what reason I do not know. I guess she thought 9 wasn't enough for one guest...) As per usual for the strip hotels there is no coffee maker in the room but there is a bar steps from the elevator that serves as a coffee bar and pastry shop in the morning. Service: This hotel offered the best service across the board of any of the luxury strip hotels I have recently frequented including THEHotel, Mandalay Bay, Palazzo and Bellagio. Everyone was courteous and unfailingly prompt. I was checked into my room quickly about an hour before posted check-in time on a Saturday afternoon. My room service orders arrived within a half an hour of being placed. Valet service was immediate, and the bellman arrived at my door with my bags within 10 minutes of my call. Saturday probably isn't the busiest day at the bell desk, but still, that is a record by a long stretch. He showed me all of the features in the room (lots of automated lights, drapes, etc.) and fetched ice. Likewise on checkout both the bell desk and valet, as well as the front desk who I called in order to complete checkout were fast and courteous. The only service gripe I had was at the \"Red Card\" desk where there appeared to be 8 people working, but only 2 helping customers waiting in a very long line. Cocktail waitresses in the casino were plentiful. Restaurants and casino: I had dinner at the bar at \"Sinatra\" and the meal I ordered arrived too fast! I had planned on savoring a martini and having a glass of wine with my entree, but the entree got there before I'd taken two sips of my drink. Faster than McDonalds, I swear! (Actually had a similar experience at SW a few years ago.) Other than Sinatra and the coffee bar I utilized room service for meals. The food was good and served beautifully. I enjoyed the natural light in parts of the casino and restaurant and shopping areas. The casino itself is pretty small, but the Wynn is connected by a short corridor if you have exhausted the possibilities on the Encore side. I didn't use the pool but it was very pretty. I had a wonderful massage at the spa. I must say this is the nicest of the spas I've tried at Venetian, THEHotel, Mandalay Bay, and Bellagio. It is just breathtakingly beautiful, well laid out, with plenty of amenities. It is also located on the second floor just steps from the elevator, so you needn't traipse through the casino to get from room to spa/gym/salon and back to your room. My biggest complaint about both Wynn and Encore are the prices of everything. There are very few options for an inexpensive bite to eat. Room service eggs bacon and coffee is $28 and it isn't much better in the cafe. The only 24 hour cafe is the \"Drugstore\" at the Wynn which has a very limited selection in the wee hours. But room service is 24 hours at least. A minor nit was the music in the casino. I guess some people would love it, but it was a little too lite/new agey and repetitive for me. They ought to play jazz or Sinatra type standards if they want mellow, or something a little more contemporary if they want lively. But at least it wasn't intolerable like at Mandalay's casino, where you are assaulted by dance music from two clubs, pop music over the loudspeaker and some live performer playing all at the same time. The Encore has its loud customers at the craps tables and so on, but it is mostly on the quieter side, ala Bellagio, Wynn and Palazzo. I appreciated that the slots were spaced out so you never feel crowded. The flowers and other decorating touches are just lovely, although I think the Wynn side is perhaps more beautiful to my eyes. I used a casino promotion for my stay which made the room rate very inexpensive. I'd stay at the Encore again if I was able to get a rate of a few hundred or less. Because the prices of everything else are so high, I wouldn't want to spend much more than that for the room itself, although it is luxurious and worthy of being on the higher end of strip hotels. At this point, Palazzo still reins as my favorite strip hotel for the rooms, the location on the strip and the restaurant selections available there and at the connected Venetian. But I would rate Encore/Wynn a close second.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cThere is something for Everyone at Encore\u201d", "Author": "SSemone", "ReviewID": "UR32423162", "Content": "We stayed at the Encore for my friends Vegas wedding.

Check in was a breeze, only waited about 5-10 minutes. We had requested a room with two queens and were a little concerned after reading many reviews that they would not have one available. They did & we chose to upgrade to a panormaic view for $20.00 a night as we wanted the highest floor possible & our assigned room was on the 11th floor. Got the 58th floor, room 5842, ther are only 60 floors I believe. The view was awsome...could see the the strip as well as the golf course & were directly across from the Wynn sign so the pictures looked great! The room was fabulous! 2 of the most comfortable beds ever...really big sitting area with couch...42\"m plasma TV that moved out from the wall to angle towards the living area.TV also had DVD player. The bathrom was huge with seperate shower & tub. The heated tile floor was great on cold feet. Loved that it had a huge double sink with vanity, as girls we are always vying for counter space. The TV in there was great as well...I love watching TV while I get ready. There was a doorbell and buttons to push if you wanted privacy or room cleaned...no need to worry that someone ripped your tag off the doorknob. There is a decent sized closet with a dresser & room safe. They of course have the overpriced honor bar & I did have one $5 sprite but other than that no mistaken charges for anything as I have read in other reports. After we checked out the room we called the Bell desk for our luggage...it was there in 5 minutes! There is turn down service....many people have said there is not...you have to call & request it...we did every night before we left the room. Every night when we came back there were slippers by our beds...chocolates...and a good night bookmark. They also would replace any used towels & restock any toiletries we had used between maid service & turn down. There have been numerous reports of noise from the rooms next door & from Club XS down stairs. We did not hear a peep! No thumping or noise of any kind & our room was directly above the club.

Had travelled from Australia and arrived on Sunday 17th May 2009. All of my dealings and reservations had been done with the hotel well prior to leaving for the US so you only hope all goes smoothly when you arrive. Had booked a Tower suite after originally being given a great deal on a standard panoramic room for $249 per night. Swapped to the Tower room for $300 per night and stayed 3 nights. A nice surprise for my wife and the Best move we made and here are the reasons why. 1. Arrived in town the same time a huge retail conference was happening at the convention centre just a few blocks away. The Tower suites has its own car and taxi / limo entry drop off and check area / concierge etc which is well away from the standard entry. Just as well as the main entry was well crowded at 3.00pm in the afternoon and most times we walked past it during our stay. Only a couple of groups all being attended to in the Tower area reservations desk so minimal waiting. 2. At checkin we were offered complimentary cold towels and water which was nice as it was about 104 / 38 degrees outside, the attendant breezed through the checkin, showed us a map of where things where inside the Encore / Wynn compound and offered us a choice of rooms on different floors. Nice touch and no hard sell on room upgrades for a fee as some others have mentioned. Could have had a south facing strip room but took the north view for a change as it is the quiet side of the hotel and were on the 37th floor with a view of the north strip, convention centre, golf course etc. No waiting and straight to the room with bags arriving 2 minutes later. 3. A very clean and well laid out room with big screen TV on a swivel so you can watch TV from the lounge room or in bed. Classy and clean decore and nice stone bathroom area with no mould, hair or previous visitor smells or stains. Brilliant. As per other comments minbar and snack bar are pressure sensitive so read the card provided and not the labels on the products otherwise you'll see the item on your bill at check out. Yes the prices may be a little high on some items but, hey there are a couple of liquor stores just across the road if you need to hit the hard stuff in a bigger way. Ice machine on every floor and a bag lined ice bucket for hygiene is in your room. So drink away if thats your thing. 4.The hotel casino we found was easy to navigate, great for walking around, nicer style, better lighting and atmosphere than Wynn, very nice restaurants ( Society Cafe and Switch were excellent as was the Country Club at Wynn). Friendly gambling table staff although the drink service was a little irregular (but no restrictions that we found) at night when the gaming area was busy. No big deal though just an observation. If your the type who would squabble about a free or cheap drink then this Hotel isn't for you, look elsewhere like New york New York or Fremont St for your hotel. 5. The manager I had dealt with for my booking arranged for a complimentary pool cabana for an afternoon during our stay and this was done in the Wynn tower pool area. A nice touch and great food and beverage service by the attendants. The pool was well attended by guests and has a nice atmosphere. The cabana normally costs about $500 per day and offers complimentary non alcholoic drinks, TV, sunlounges, water misting unit to keep you cool and very frequent service from the bar / food staff. Ordered up some food and Champers for a nice afternoon spent relaxing from the flights the day before. 6. People have commented on the location being out of the way, I would disagree, yes it is the last top end hotel before no mans land north of Wynn Boulevard / north strip, but you have 4 top hotels in Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn then Encore all side by side and a very easy walk between them and they are all linked by a walking bridge and shopping areas. Add Fashion show mall across the street and its a great safe and clean part of the strip. The further south you go the seedier and grungier it gets. At least you can walk around without being harrassed by \"porn ticket slappers\" and the like. Give me this area of the strip anyday. Plus if your into finding a bargain for clothes take the short walk just up from Encore to Ross, very good chioice for the whole family for cheap name brand clothes at a fraction of what we pay for them here in Australia. Eg: Long sleeve brand name shirts you pay $120+ per shirt I bought 3 at $11 each all top notch and exactly like home - someones making a killing back in Australia. 6. The Tower suite lift area has a security man on in the late afternoons till mornings. The genetlman was Excellent, very personable, remembered our names and always checked to make sure all was in order with our stay. A wonderful touch and really made our stay running into him each time we went in or out of an evening. Overall, book a Tower suite for that little nicer touch of private entry and exit, great concierge and security staff, very nice quite rooms with lovely decor and what I believe is good value for money for this level of comfort and service.

She even gave us a room on the 51st floor with a view of the strip, golf course, and mountains! Simply beatiful! Loved the remote control everything (lights, blinds, alarm, etc) next to the bed. Speaking of the bed - one word comfortable - best bed I've ever slept in! Bathroom is beautiful - love the glassed enclosed shower over looking the tub (disappointed tub wasn't jacuzzi, but still nice). No problems with services our blind was stuck once but an engineer was up to fix it in less than 5 minutes. The TV is a little difficult to work and takes awhile to come on but you get use to it after while. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Checkout lines are long and kinda of chaotic with no-one directing traffic. Check out is at 12 (wonderful) and they allow you access to the your room until 1:00 which is great! Not a lot of action in the casino area during my 3 day stay very quiet. Hotel is very expensive and caters to the upper class. My husband and I had lunch at Societys $75! No casual dining places for reasonable cost! We went to other places to eat that was more affordable. The hotel, although beatiful, is far from the main attractions. Is literally on the end of the strip! Matter of fact, it's the last main hotel on the strip before venturing into old Vegas! That being said bring walking shoes!

It's definitely not a complete 5-star experience. I'll lead off with why it's not, and then get on to the positive stuff. SERVICE: While professional and courteous, it's not on par with a Four Seasons or similar hotels that emphasize the ultimate in customer satisfaction. My dad and I went out to the pool area on an overcast day, with maybe a third of the chairs in use and all the cabanas empty. Wanting to cool off for a couple minutes, we walked into the pool and took a seat on these big round seating things they have in the water. Within two minutes, a lifeguard came over and said, \"I'm sorry, these are for cabana guests only.\" There were six of these huge seating things in the pool, each one capable of seating 8-10, and not a single person was on them. There weren't even any cabana guests to use them. And you're seriously going to kick us off them?! That's just poor service and bad business. After getting asked to get off, two other ladies in the pool said, \"Yeah, isn't that terrible? We were sitting there this morning and they kicked us off, as well.\" Moments like that leave a bad taste in guests' mouths, and they pass on such stories to others, quickly leading to bad word-of-mouth. POOL: The pool area is pretty small. The adult pool, with a bar and gaming, is very nice, but the regular pool is pretty boring. I'm a sun-worshipper, but for those who like some shade, there is NONE at the main Encore pool. Poolside dining is another disappointment. The prices seem very reasonable, even cheap for such a nice hotel, until you realize the food is pre-packaged from the Lobby Bar & Cafe. With food like that, you're better off grabbing a Subway $5 footlong and taking it out to the pool. Overall, I prefer the Wynn pools to Encore. LOCATION: Encore is pretty isolated at the far-north end of the Strip (yes, there's some stuff further north, but The Sahara and Circus Circus are not places most high-end hotel guests will frequent). If you have a car or are willing to cab it, you're fine, while getting around by foot is doable but not easy (Encore connects to Wynn, then you can take the bridge to Palazzo, which connects to Venetian, and from there you can cross the street to TI, which connects to Mirage, in the middle of the strip). Now for the positive news. HOTEL/CASINO: The design is spectacular, like the Wynn. However, avoid Encore at all costs if you don't like the color red. Whereas Wynn is decked out in neutral brown, Encore is totally and completely red, red, red. It's far too much of a non-neutral color, IMO, but I can let that go when the details and intricacies of the design are so stunning. From the crystal peacock tails to the Daphne statue in the Lobby Bar, you can tell how much thought went into every single design detail. The casino is small and intimate, but beautiful, with natural light all around. SUITES: Pretty close to perfect. The huge rooms are modern and sophisticated, in neutrals like black, beige, and white. Everything is top-of-the-line, from the big things like the beds (the best you'll find on the Strip) to the small things like the Kohler faucets. While these are bigger than the rooms at Wynn, they kind of feel smaller, because of the partial wall in between, but I like them better. The bathrooms are huge and gorgeous, too. I think I have to give the Encore rooms the edge over Palazzo, making these the best rooms on the Strip, IMO. As for the noise problem from XS, I purposely chose to stay at Encore on nights when the nightclub was closed, so I can't comment about that noise. However, the rooms were very quiet, and I heard no noise from outside the hotel or from the hallways/other rooms. *** TIP ***: For stunning views of the Strip, request the south side of the hotel, with rooms on the west side of the hall (we had rooms 18 and 20, which were perfect).", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, MO", "Title": "\u201cI thought the Wynn was the best resort in Vegas, until I stayed at Encore.\u201d", "Author": "JSBKansasCity_MO", "ReviewID": "UR31417822", "Content": "The rooms in Wynn's Encore are better than the rooms in the Wynn Resort, mainly because they are all suites.

I have found that the employees at Wynn properties make you feel like you are a welcomed guest and not just a another warm body. The casinos, and lobbies are the most beautiful in Vegas and you almost feel like you are in a much smaller botique hotel in the Ozarks.

Some of the negative things I read I assumed were freaky or isolated incidents and would not happen to me... like we all tend to think. Well, I learned my lesson. We made our reservation over 5 months ago and specifically requested a panoramic view of the strip. They were happy to take my $260 deposit and make 5 months of interest on it before we showed up only to discover they did not give us the room we requested. So I called the front desk as soon as we walked into the room and told them that we did not have a room with a strip view as we originally requested. I was politely told that they can not guarantee the type of view one would request however I was told at the time of the reservation (made directly to the hotel) that a strip view was certain, only the specific floor height could not be guaranteed. The Front Desk then told me that they would put us in the different room with a strip view later that day and would call us when it was available. So we sat with our bags unpacked for 3 hours waiting. No call. I decided to go down to the Front Desk and see what the status was with this change. They had no record of my room change request and then they said there were no strip view rooms available. Not a single one, no sir... not a single one. I then asked to speak with the manager. The lady at the front desk was very polite and left her computer to seek out the manager in the back room. The manager never showed, (which I thought rude). I waited quite a while and when she returned she magically had a room with the view we requested. Even though she insisted there was not a single room available with a panoramic strip view.. No apology, no explaination, not even a slight embarrasment at the inconsistencies of how they approached my disppointment. \"They must have Magic Rooms\", I told my partner that appear out of nowhere when you use the magic word \"manager\". You may want to remember this if you find yourself in a similar situation should you chose the Encore. I joined Trip Advisor just to write this review about the Encore. I normally let things slide but in this case I expected more from this place. So the Check In Service really sucks. I know other people have written about this same problem at the Encore on this site... you may want to see what they have to tell you about their particular details. About details, just a few things... Expect to walk alot if you want to get to the center of the strip where the action is. There is no convenient access to the monorail if you're considering that. There use to be a shuttle from the Encore that took you to the Convention Center where you could catch the monorail. That's no longer provided. It's either a taxi or hoofing it. If you walk expect 30 minutes from the Encore to the center of the stip (where the Paris or Ceasars Palace is located). We definitely got our excercise during our 3 days there. The food is good at the Encore and the service at these restaurant was quite good... its only the service at the Check In Front Desk that is very poor. The bar in our room was missing items and had not been restocked. Also we got zero bed turn down service at night. Which I thought was a common thing with 4 or 5 star- rated hotels. Maybe not in Vegas considering what some people go to Vegas for. If your still debating about staying maybe at the Wynn or Encore, I would go for the Wynn. Even though Steve Wynn ownes both and they are connected physically, the Wynn offeres more in terms of view options if you want a view of the strip. The Wynn offers a nicer floor layout of the casino and shops, restaurants and I think a way better pool. It offers more shade area around the pool in the mid afternoon than the Encore which in the summer you may definitely want. The rooms themselves are very nice and tailored in modern lines. Great bed.

I can not say the same thing for Encore. When we arrived (about 9pm) on a Friday night we were told that there were only smoking rooms available and that Encore does not guarantee a \"smoking preference\" and that a non-smoking room is just a request. This was extremely dissappointing to me since this is something that most hotels can seam to manage and did not think that it should be beyond the capability of Encore to be able to manage their own inventory. When we got to the room it did not have a smoky smell, but throughout the weekend as people smoked it got almost unbareable. In the morning I went to the coffee bar just outside the room elevators and although it did not seam any busier than a typical starbucks, I found it diffcult to order a simple cup of coffee. There did not seam to be any kind of line and the employees seamed harried, unorganized and not very friendly. After several people that arrived after me were waited on, I got someones attention and was able to order my coffee. When I went to add cream and sugar there was no cream in the picture. I handed it to the person that was makeing the the specialty coffee drinks and she handed it back to me and told there was someone that was assigned to keep an eye on that. After 10 minutes a person did come by to fill the cream.....she handed the empty picher to the same person I had 10 minutes before and filled it and handed it back to her coworker. That evening we went to a show at another proerty and got back to our room just before 11:00pm and ordered room service just after 11pm and was told the meal would be at our room by midnight. (A little outside the norm for a hotel, but apreciated them letting us know that it would take a little bit of extra time). We did not receive our meal at midnight....we did not receive it until 12:45. We got a call a few minutes before it was delivered asking us if we still wanted it. (Not to apologize that it was so late). When the food arrived, it was obvious that the meal had sat in the window awaiting delivery as the bread was hard, the meat had that dried out look and the fries were soggy. In the morning I again went to the coffe shop, it was still fairly unorganized, but I was a little more agressive with my place in line and got the attention of an employee to take my order. I added a couple of breakfast sandwhiches to the order and was told someone would bring it from the back. I paid for the sandwhiches and waited anout 15 minutes for them to be brought out. I was sitting on the other side of the coffee bar when the person delivered the sandwhich as when I went to inquire about my sandwhiches they were sitting in a bag on a wet tray behind the bar. I was handed the sandwhiches and was told they had been waiting there for me and that I was waiting on the wrong side. \"wow\" I guess it was my fault. They did not apologize or offer to give me a 2nd bag (the material was soaked through. So I took the sandwhiches out of the bag (I was afraid that the bag would break) and piled my sandwhiches on top of my cups of coffe and juggled my pruchases all the way to the room.

The casino and layout are confusing, the rooms are a little much in terms of decor, etc. But with Encore, Wynn and his team really hit their stride. Just about everything at this place works, and it's probably become my favorite Vegas hotel, just above THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. Public areas: Red, red, red. It works in the casino and check-in area in a way it didn't in the rooms at Wynn. It's vivid and exciting; the design is a stunner... well, except for those ugly red chandeliers that look like huge upside-down spiders. Otherwise, bravo. The casino layout is the easiest to navigate in any Vegas mega-property. You can actually see all the way from one end to the other of what is basically a big rectangle, and the two long sides have natural light and outside views. There are restaurants and lounges arranged around the perimeter--no following signs around corners and meandering casino paths to find anything. Spa/Pool: The fitness center is pretty much what you would expect--big, with plenty of machines of all types. The spa waiting area is a stunner. It looks like the living room of an Arabian prince with great taste. The interior is great as well--the plunge pool area has a huge tile wall with a copper cherry tree mosaic. Just gorgeous. There are also heated tiled lounge chairs which vibrate slightly. It would be easy to lose an afternoon dozing on one of those. There's a $30 daily use fee, which is outlandish but about the norm for Vegas. The pool is not a match for Mandalay Bay's [still the best in town], but it's nice in its own right with plenty of lounge chairs; even on a busy weekend, we were able to find a couple of chairs together with no problem. Drink service was frequent and efficient. The European [topless] pool is pretty much the same as the main pool, only with a huge center bar. Guys, sorry to say there was only one pair of assets on display the day I was there. Don't know how well this European bathing trend is catching on. Rooms: Much calmer and more relaxing than the public areas. Mostly in the beige family, but there were plenty of accent touches to give it character. There's rough-textured houndstooth wallpaper behind the mini-bar armoire and rust colored wallpaper behind the beds and on the entry-way ceiling. The L-shaped sofa is a great touch and the sitting area is huge. Of course, everything is remote-controlled from the bedside. I might question the choice of painting over the sofa, which is basically three big white circles on a black background, but whatever. If you've stayed at THEhotel, Venetian/Palazzo, or Bellagio, then you know what to expect in the bathrooms. Very plush and spacious, but not necessarily distinctive. We had a double-bed room with a spectacular view over the Wynn tower, the pools, the golf course, and part of the strip. We were on the 57th floor and didn't hear a peep from the nightclub, which some others have complained about. Room numbers that end in even numbers are strip view. Restaurants: A very nice selection, and we made a stop at all of them except Switch. Went to the bar at Sinatra, which has great appetizers [main course menu didn't intrigue me that much] and a polished bar staff who made fine traditional cocktails and are always ready with a suggestion. There's also a very cool huge model ship hanging over the bar. Wazuzu has the spectacular crystal dragon along one wall and a fine pan-Asian menu. Society cafe was good for breakfast and the Lobby Cafe and Bar is just off check-in if you can't even make it to the elevators before you need a drink. Best of all is steakhouse Botero, which was slam-packed the night we were there but still offered tremendous quality on every course. The bone-in NY Strip is something special, as is the salmon with Meyer lemon appetizer and the side of truffled corn pudding. Deserts are more creative than anything, so choose carefully if you're a dessert traditionalist. There's also a great bar up front here; if Kirk the bar manager is working, ask him to make you his martini with pear vodka and elderflower liqueur. Random notes: It's a pretty easy walk to Wynn down a hallway by the theaters, past a shopping arcade where they would turn you upside down and shake the money out of your pockets. Won $165 in ten minutes at a single-deck blackjack game, but I promise I didn't let that influence my review. Nothing here is a particular bargain, but I wasn't expecting it to be, so... Elsewhere on the Strip: You can skip the bar at the Trump tower. Dull. The wine list at Mix at THEhotel isn't as good as it used to be, but the food is.

As ENCORE is a relatively new hotel to Las Vegas, I believe it premiered in December, 2008. We usually stay at WYNN, but were curious to see if Mr. Wynn could top his first effort. We were pleased, but not surprised to find the same flawless service had carried over from Wynn to Encore. The same opulent, luxurious surroundings, but with different color-schemes in both the public areas and the rooms. I was slightly concerned about Encore, as a very SLIGHT minority of reviews here were anything but complimentary.

The desk agent claimed the hotel was sold out and refused to give us a room with 2 beds, and then we had to wait several hours to get a room when we checked in (which has never happened any other time I have ever stayed in Vegas).

It does not seem remotely possible that the hotel could have been fully occupied based upon the complete lack of people we saw during our entire stay. Also I was SHOCKED to find out it is their policy that drinks are not comped when gambling at any of the bars in the casino (which is contrary to every single casino in the entire city). It was nearly impossible to get a cocktail waitress on the casino floor. The Encore pool is very party oriented, they have an entire \"European bathing\" area and there is a DJ playing music that is SO loud you can barely hear yourself think, and the chairs are practically on top of each other. Not relaxing at all. The rooms at Encore are very nice with a separate living room area, but otherwise there is nothing special. Following my visit, I sent a long, detailed letter to guest services with information about the many problems I had encountered and in response (two weeks later) I simply received an email thanking me for the information and stating \"sorry to learn that your visit was less than what would be expected of a Wynn property.\" They clearly have no interest in guest services or appreciation. I would definitely recommend staying at Bellagio over either of the Wynn properties.

I choose the Encore because I had a great time at the Wynn last year. I assumed that the Encore would live up to its brother hotel, if not be better, and trust me it is not. My party consisted of 6 adults and 3 rooms total. The problems started right away. I requested a two bedroom room over four months ago when I booked the vacation, only to come to the surprise that there were not only no 2 bedrooms available, but there were not going to be for my whole stay. If I booked this trip a few weeks ago I would understand, however, I feel over four months in advance I should be guaranteed what I wanted. The man at the front desk explained that saying what kind of room you wanted was just a request and was not guaranteed. Once I got into my room there was no hot water, you would think this would be a temporary problem but it lasted the entire length of my stay (4 days!) and that was in all 3 rooms we rented. Management could care less that a whole floor was not getting hot water for an entire week. They were well aware of the problem, from my understanding a pipe broke on the floor I was on. The icing on the cake was in no way did management even attempt to compensate for this extremely unpleasant surprise with the water. Onto dinner. I ate at a few of the restaurants during my stay, every time I had to wait over 45 minutes later than my reservation time. Once again, all we received from this was apologies. In one instance we missed the beginning of Le Reve which we had tickets for that same night because of the consistent tardiness. Onto the pool. The pool is tiny and cramped compared to the Wynn. For the entire four days we tried to reserve a cabana, and was not able to do so once. In fact, one day the head cabana boy said we weren\u2019t even on the list to get one when I spoke to that cabana boy just the day before and saw him put my name down! I understand I am not Trump or Rockefella but I thought they would treat any customer a little better especially during a recession! The service was terrible, the rooms were very nice but not being able to get hot water for the entire stay was terrible. Not receiving the room I requested over four months ago is just foolish. This is supposedly a five star resort I would say it is a 2 tops. The best part about it was did they even compensate me for anything, even offer a dinner on the\u2026 only in my dreams. I play 1 hour on a table at the Venetian I can go stay there compt any week I want to during the year. I play over 20 hours in a week at the Encore I get a buffett compt for one person.

All was forgotten when we walked into our room - beautiful, clean, spacious. They did a really wonderful job on the rooms and the beds were A++++. We all wanted to buy the sheet sets at their store downstairs they were so soft and the pillows were awesome. The rooms had anything you would want and a nice flat screen that could rotate and another flat screen in the bathroom which was a nice touch. I did not mind the hotel decor at all that some have criticized - its Vegas and its supposed to stand out. I thought the hotel was beautiful. The casino is smaller which we also did not mind, the Wynn was a short walk away if you wanted more action. We spent a lot of time at the pool and never had a problem finding chairs. We never went to the \"European\" pool since we were there to relax and read by the pool. Our first night there it was late and we were hungry so we just walked into the Deli at the Wynn and split salads which were very good and reasonably priced (for Vegas, and for the Wynn). We ate breakfast at this Deli all weekend, it would still be a $40 breakfast but it was just what we wanted for breakfast - I had the veggie bagel which I liked. Friday night we ate at Switch b/c SW steakhouse was booked. The restaurant is very cool and the walls and ceiling change every 30 min - that was the only good thing about it. It was way overpriced and the food was NOT good. Very bland, they need a spice rack in the kitchen. We were not impressed at all and the service was terrible. We barely saw our waiter and for what we were paying the service should be there. We had tickets for La Reve after that which was FANTASTIC. Highly recommend it.

I've stayed at Bellagio and until now my impression was that it was the nicest. My wife and I loved the location.

Walking through Caesars, Mirage and even Bellagio is a gong show with all the crowds so we really appreciated how quiet Encore was. Room was perfect. We had the basic room on the 61st floor looking north. (Room 6117)Fantastic view of the north strip and golf course. It was very quiet and we never heard any noise from the night club or other rooms. I think it was because we were facing North. Basic room still means a HUGE bathroom, seperate living aread with a swivel flast screen tv that turns towards the bedroom, and the King size bed was extremely comfortable We ate at: Bartalotta: Incredible italian seafood restaurant. We ate outdoors in a cabana and was probably the nicest setting I've ever eaten dinner in Society: Incredible burger. Okada: Amazing sushi and modern Japanese fair. views outside of the waterfall were spectacular Wazuzu: The dim sum was the best I've ever had Botero: Steak was good, but not fantastic. Was a little over cooked but the truffled mac and cheese more than made up for it. Country Club: amazing cobb salad. View from the patio overlooking the 18th green was beautiful Room service breakfast: Omellete's wern't actually very good. They seemed to be pre-molded with the toppings (mushroom ham and cheese) scooped underneath it. The hasbrowns however were very decadent. Now, all this being said, the restaurants are clearly overpriced by approximately 20% however, you are on vacation and Vegas is a tourist area so you can't blame them. It is something to note though. If you want breakfast for $2.99 or dinner buffet for $8.99 than Encore is not for you. The pool area is gorgeous. Not as big as some of the other major hotels, but again very relaxing and not too crowded. The casino: Beautiful. It was never too crowded and very friendly. One thing i particularly liked about it is it wasn't jam packed with slot machines. It was a very open space that didn't feel too crammed with all the regular casino crap. Club XS: It's gotta be experienced. The people are beautiful, the drinks are amazing and has both a fun dance floor with a huge rotating chandalier and an outdoor area surrounding the pool. Expensive but well worth the experience. The Staff: If you've ever stayed at a Four Seasons, this hotel rivals it in terms of staff service levels. Always with a smile, friendly and they all seemed to really enjoy working there. From bellhops, to room service, to casino dealers to bartenders, they all really appreciated and enjoyed working at Wynn/Encore.

We are originally for Orange County, CA so it was going to be quiet an expensive trip to gather a group our closest friends to travel out to Vegas with us. Having monthly comps at the Palazzo we decided to go outside the box and try a hotel stay at Encore at the Wynn. We were extremely excited after viewing how elegant and nice the hotel is on their website. We decided to plan the entire stay at the Wynn. Club Tryst on Friday night and Club XS on Saturday night. This is so we would never have to leave the hotel. I had arranged the whole weekend the week in advance to ensure that everything was set in stone with our stay at the Encore. At check in, the lobby area felt extremely clutter due to the fact that they do no host an employee to direct any one person to a check in station. Upon check in, each guest is supposed to wait in any given line we unfortunately stood in a line with a guest who took 25 minuets to check out. When my party got to the front I told the check in host that I wanted to check in for 3 rooms on my reservation but leave the key cards up front so when my friends came they could pick up their room keys without checking in. The host had me write down each person\u2019s name myself so she can have a key card ready. I had originally booked my stay at the Wynn\u2019s website so I was surprise to know that my reservation rate was changed upon check in. I had to wait around 25 to 35 minuets for the host to fully check me in since she had to rebook my stay and get manager approval at the rate I booked on Wynn\u2019s Website. This was very annoying. You walk into this hotel come to find out that you are already starting to have problems. All 3 rooms were booked on the same floor. Unfortunately my room was booked next to a room that had a barking door, THAT NEVER STOPPED BARKING. I don\u2019t even believe dogs are allowed in the hotel. I am not certain. The room is small compared to The Palazzo. Nothing too special about the room except that it is modern and updated. The restrooms have no vents so when taking a hot shower it steams up the whole room. There is only one TV for the room and one for the bathroom. Which in other hotels I receive 2 flat screens and 1 in the bathrooms. So that night we went to Tryst. We were placed at a outside deck table, when we specifically asked to be inside. The table host stated that unless we tipped him or bought 2 additional bottles we would not be able to be sat inside. Due to the fact that we were going to have bottle service at XS the next night we wanted to keep simple for the first night so we decided not to tip the table host $200.00 and keep our table. To be so blunt about a bribe I was very shocked. I received a call around 11:00pm while at Tryst from a friend that was staying in one of the 3 rooms. He stated that he was unable to check in and I would have to leave Tryst to check in for him. I couldn\u2019t believe that the original check in host did not do her job, but now I was being asked to leave the Tryst night club so I could check my party in. I asked my friend to hand over the phone but the check in host stated that I would have to come to the front or call in. I called in and my friend was able to check in. Come to find out when he checked in, the host upstairs gave my friend the key to my hotel room, not theirs. How would you feel as a guest barely checking in to your hotel room to find that the room was being used by someone else. The immediately got on the phone with guest services stating the room was already used and to bring a key to their suite immediately. It took them 25 minuets. WHAT HORRIBLE CHECK IN STAFF THE HAVE. The next night we went to XS at 9pm to get our table. The table host blew us off and made us wait in line foe 3 hours. Then around 11:30 they stated that all the tables were given away and that all they could do was free entry. WTF right? We had a table reservation, we waited in line and they treated us like crap. I was furious by that time. The next night I check out of the Encore totally sadden by the customer service. I called into the hotel asking for a credit with Hotel Correspondence. They stated that I would hear back within 5 to 6 business days. I did not hear back in 6 Business days so I called back again. They still did not have an answer.

The magnificent Wynn and Encore - I don't think so. I shall start from the beginning - and let me say that I have never written such a derogotary review of a hotel on TA before: When we arrived, first the receptionist tried to downgrade our room as we'd booked a prepay deal via Expedia. She was actually going to 'escort us' as she put it - out of the Tower Suites reception to the resort reception until I could provide written proof myself that we should be there. After a 'discussion' with her manager lasting some time, we were allowed to stay in the room we booked - but she neglected to offer us the normal water and cold towels that one would expect in a 5 star hotel. Other guests got that, but not us! Finally when this was sorted, we were given a key card (not shown to our room as I would expect) and we waited and waited... and waited for our luggage. Finally after we chased and phoned, it arrived - an hour and a half later, and the bellboy was rude when he didn't get a tip. We tip for good service and don't tip for bad, sorry. We tried to make ourselves a coffee while we waited, but no facilities, shame. Again when we would stay in a hotel of this caliber, and in a room of this status, one would expect an executive lounge to grab a coffee if there are no facilities in your room. Not so, at the Encore, you only get access to the lounge if you have a 'gold star' on your card - and you only get those if you spend heavily in the casino. So if you would like a coffee when you wake in the morning, you have to get dressed and walk down past reception, into the hotel for about 10 minutes where you have the privilege of spending $5 on a coffee when you've already spent somewhere in the region of $500 on your room. Nice. I also told them it was my husband's 30th birthday while we were there - normally I would expect some recognition of this - I am not asking for huge freebies - just a little token to mark the occasion - even a sparkler on a dessert... you have to be kidding, they couldn't care less. I also personally found the waitresses with their fake boobs on display and bottoms hanging out of their deliberately short dresses a little much for breakfast time... Then there was the pool - I have a rule that I won't stay anywhere with plastic sunloungers, but somehow this place snuck through... we couldn't even find a spare one, and they are so crammed in you are like sardines. It is clearly a place where people go to show off their bodies, girls in full make up and high heels - I even saw one gentleman taking photos of a lady in a rather, um, uncompromising position - and this was quite the norm. It is very much about being seen at the 'pool scene' and you get looked up and down as you walk around, it's a bit like a daytime nightclub meatmarket. As a normal size 14, 30 something, I felt very very uncomfortable... didn't stay there long! And I was particularly offended when I asked for a glass of prosecco and was told that they had run out at that bar but the barman could offer me a glass of sparkling wine 'for the same money' - I wasn't asking for it because I wanted cheap champagne, more because we were off for an Italian meal and I find prosecco the perfect aperitif for such a thing! Oh, and when we checked out, they snuck on $50 for minibar things - which we hadn't touched. It took 20 minutes to fix the problem, and the snotty receptionist didn't even say sorry... What I will say for the hotel is that it is at the nicer end of the Strip, and the rooms are stunning. We had dinner at Sinatra's which was excellent and I would say of a 1 Michelin star standard, though they do not have such an award yet. Also of note is Stratta, the Italian restaurant where the food is excellent and the staff amongst the best in the hotel. And LE REVE is truly spectacular, a must. Then there was Big Steve, security at the Encore, tower suites - who was charming, the best member of staff we found in our four days there.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel wonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "Traveluxx", "ReviewID": "UR29833650", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel May 7-10 celebrating Mother's day.(Mom, sister, mother in law) This is a new hotel just opened Dec '08 and it is a very beatiful classy and trendy hotel.

I guess because the minibar items should not be touched that may be why they were COVERED in dust housekeeping obviously doesn't touch them either. I also noticed in the water closet that the light sconce was dusty so thats why the four stars on cleanliness. Overall the stay was very good we ate at society cafe food and service great.

I felt that check in was disorganized in that you lined up behind a clerk vs a snakeline in which you got looked after in order of showing up. We had reserved 2 beds. They told us that they only had rooms with a King bed available, that they were sold out so we either took it or not. They offered us a rollaway bed - no thanks. Then when I was asked to sign the registration card, I noticed that they wanted to charge us $699 for Sat night. I said no way & clerk had to go check with the Supervisor in order to give us the $199 rate that I had booked. Got assigned a resort room on the 9th floor in the middle of the floor ie close to the elevators. View was overlooking the pool/nightclub etc & SW view. Had no noise issues whatsoever re the Club or neighbours. Elevators are conviently located behind Registration. Lobby Bar opens @ 6:00 AM for quick breakfasts & great cappucino. We were out of the room @ 8:00 AM Saturday & when we returned after 3:00, room had not been made up. Called & complained & were told that they had until 5:00 to clean the rooms. Fine - we tracked down a maid & got fresh towels & told them no service required for that day. Next two days, we were also out of the room early & both days, room was cleaned by noon. No turn down service unless requested. Ate @ Botero, Wazuzu & Society Cafe & all were good. Ate @ Okada, WIng Lei, Buffet & Terrace Court @ Wynn & they were very good with Wing Lei outstanding IMHO. Pools (ie 2) are small with virutally no shade. When we went out there Friday @ 1:00 PM, no chaises available. Next 3 days we were there early & had no problems getting a chaise which was very comfortable. Most people @ pool & the hotel in general seemed under 40 ie crowd seemed much younger than Caesars.

After 100 points, you get a spin at a wheel with min win of $10 in free slot play. After 400 points, free buffet for 2 @ Wynn since Encore has no buffet.

Bathroom was beautiful but the layout of the rest of the room is awkward. Steve Wynn obviously watnted all these to be suites but the divider between the bed and the sitting area does not do much for the room. The couch was also uncomfortable. The decor is outstanding. The mirrored wall by the bed is kind of cheesy. The view we had was good but not great and again we were on the second to top floor in a panoramic suite. The issue is that most of our view was obscured by Wynn. This is a south facing view which is the view of most of the strip but you can't see much except Mirage and TI because Encore is directly behind Wynn and we were staring right at Wynn (as everyone else will be in any room looking down the strip). Bed, linens and pillows were OUTTANDING. Maid service was excellent and timely. Wireless was full signal with no issues. We had room service twice and both times the foood was very good and arrived quickly. We ate at Switch which was very good and also Botero which was average. We also ate breakfast at the buffett at Wynn which was excellent for breakfast. Cocktails are 14 bucks if you're not gambling and were weak. We ended up going and buying some booze at a liquor store (next door) after paying a few hundred bucks on drinks the first few days. We are not drunks but 14 dollar drinks add up quickly. The pools are WAY TOO SMALL and do not have nearly enough space. People were crammed in and on top of you at all times. There were not enough chairs and the waitress service was horrificly slow. This was a huge dissapointment for us because we like to hang outside and sun and swim for a few hours every day. The pools here suck. Period. Big mistake by Steve Wynn. I don;t know what he was thinking, they are simply too small for the size of the hotel. The Wynn pools are better but too far a walk and they were also very crowded. The casino was dead even on the week-end. Casino bars were also dead all six days we were there, even Friday and Saturday. We went to XS (encore's high end club) on Friday night and it was OUTSTANDING. Great club (we are in our early 40's) with a good mix although average age was probably late 20's to early 30's.

We arrived at Check in around 12:30pm and asked for a non-smoking room as we requested initially however we did not get into our room until 4:30pm. Booked the Resort Suite and were offered an upgrade to one of the top 10 floors for $25 per day. This was a special promotion as they normally charge $125 per day so we took it. It was worth it. Be prepared to bring your bathing suit to lounge by the pool while you wait for your room. The hotel was incredibly beautiful & oppulent to say the least. Upscale in every way. We've stayed at Caesars Palace & MGM in the past and enjoyed the latter as it was midway through the strip in the midst of the hustle & bustle. We love to be in the heart of the main strip as it gave us a plethora of choices for entertainment, dining & nightlife. This resort was quite far from everything else. Took advantage of the Monorail passes however we were told that Wynn had cancelled the stop at their hotel so we had to walk all the way to Harrah's station to catch the train everyday. Rooms: Resort Suite was beautiful with separate bedroom & living room divided by a half wall with swivel HD television. We requested the strip view but got the mountain view instead. King size bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept on! Sound proof rooms as we could not hear a peep from the surrounding rooms or the hallways. Very nice. Bathrobes, safe, good amenities. Dining: We ate at Stratta's on our last night there and it was quite disappointing. After being seated we waited 10 minutes before we were even greeted and handed our menu's. Our server was too busy to take our table as she was overwhelmed by 6 tables already. We had another server from a farther section come over to take our order and he seemed to be in a hurry all the time. Food was phenominal but unfortunately I can't say the same for the service. I don't blame the wait staff but the management who run this restaurant. Maggiano's Little Italy located at the Fashion Show Mall. Food & service were great and you definitely get your money's worth here. Servings are absolutely generous. Our waiter Shane took his time and was genuine when it came down to suggested dishes, etc. We highly recommend this place if you decide to stay at this end of the strip. Nightlife: We ventured over to BLUSH on Wednesday evening. Nice ambiance but once again, service was not that great. Unless you're planning on purchasing \"Bottle Service\" your waitress will not even bat an eye. We ordered high end Cognac but noticed only 2 tables had bottle service. They were taken care of very well while the remainder of the guests in the bar resorted to getting their drinks from the bartender. Pool: Wonderful but be prepared to spend quite a bit for drinks & food. Enjoyed it just the same. Service was great the first day however second day waitress didn't even once come by our section as there were 10 other guests complaining. No big deal as we just grabbed our drinks at the pool bar. We did look into booking a private Cabana but at $500 per day/$250 per half day, we decided to pass. Lounge Bars: We enjoyed all the lounge bars in the hotel but one of our favourites was the bar located just outside the Eastside Lounge. Service was great and Joe our bartender was super friendly and very generous with the drinks:-). Nice to see they don't believe in watering down their beverages. We were prepared for the upscale ambiance & $$$$$ however as mentioned before the location is too far from everything. Overall we did enjoy our vacation and we do not regret reserving our stay here.

They should have went the extra mile though and installed whirlpool tubs in the bathrooms (as Ceasers Palace has in their new towers) instead of just plain tubs...just my opinion though. I found the bed to be very comfortable, the electronic blinds/curtains feature to be a very big plus and the seperate tv area/work station very relaxing. The pool area is nice, but I can see it getting a little crammed during the prime summer months when everyone is laying out by the pools. I look forward to my next trip out to Vegas where I will have to see about another stay at this new resort. P.S.

However, if you are looking for any sort of relaxation by the pool (and i know many vegas visitors aren't) then think twice. I just wanted a couple of hours mid-afternoon to enjoy the nice weather, relax by the pool and read a magazine but with the loud, pounding club music and no shade to speak of, you're better off staying at the Four Seasons or getting a massage in the spa and calling it a day (btw, the spa was nice and in my book gets an 8). I was also shocked that at 2pm there was hardly a spare lounge chair to speak of. Equally surprising was the difficulty gettting reservations in the restaurants. This is a hotel which doesn;t seem to show any signs of a recession, which is not at all what we expected. In any case, we enjoyed our dinner at SW which is their signature steak house -- so much so that we ate their both nights -- but as with most Wynn/Encore restaurants they are high end...a drink in the bar beforehand -$40 with tip for 2 martinis! You will pay LA/NYC prices but you will get great service and food. Another thing to note is when we asked the concierge for reservations at SW we were told they were \"fully committed\" but when we said we really wanted to eat there, she mysteriously found a table for us both nights at prime time. Lesson is you just need to be nice and persistent with concierge, maybe checking back later.

Was upgraded to a Panoramic View Suite on the 61st floor. Great room. 8 ft tall windows, electronic sheers / curtains and lighting. Big screen HD TV. Good size closet. Separate shower and tub. Dual sink vanity. 2nd TV in bathroom. Robes, scale, hair dryer and ample custom toiletries. Mini Bar. Internet was approximately $12 a day but incredibly fast. As I remember it was about 9 meg up AND down. FOOD: Dined at Wazuzu in the Encore. Very Asian. Very good but expensive. Also ate at Strata in the Wynn (neighboring sister hotel). NOT GOOD. This was my second attempt at Strata. This trip was late night dining. In November it was for dinner before the La Reve show. That experience was not good and both our waitress and the assistant manager thought it appropriate to debate with a guest. I'm sure this behavior is not taught or tolerated by Steve Wynn. Management should clean house at Strata and start over at this particular restaurant. Did The Buffet (Wynn) for lunch. It was all very good but given the price I felt the offerings were a bit on the meager side. Could be a reflection of the economy as The Buffet was not at all busy this trip. Tried the Sunday Brunch at The Buffet on my November 2008 trip and it was excellent. Also have had several very good meals at the Terrace Point Cafe (Wynn). It's the required hotel \"coffee shop\" but a very upscale one. We perused the other restaurants at both The Encore and Wynn. Most of the restaurants at both hotels are business casual attire or better in the evening. Room service was prompt and service there was good. CASINO: The casino at The Encore is a bit smaller than at The Wynn but very nice. Cocktail service in the gaming area was excellent. POOL: Didn't partake personally this trip but it looked excellent. ENTERTAINMENT: Took in the La Reve show last November. Hard to describe but it's a sort of Cirque Du Soleil type water show. It was excellent and I definitely recommend it. SPA: Had a massage in the spa. Fantastic. Excellent facility. Juice bar was a nice surprise. Expensive. BUSINESS CENTER: Went to the business center at The Encore to print a boarding pass. Told the staff what I wanted to do and they directed me to a computer they appeared to have set aside for this. No charge. Very nice touch. As an aside I was very glad I took care of this ahead of time as the airport ticketing area was a mess on my departure and even the self service kiosks were mobbed. MISC: I'm not sure why but it seemed like taxi cabs were a little hard to come by at The Encore during my stay. Everyone seemed to agree that this was the case but no one was sure why. CONCLUSION: Loved The Encore and overall it was a real treat. Will definitely stay there or at The Wynn again.

Good comps are: Bellagio, Venezia Tower.

The attention at the front desk is very good and they spend the time with you which really slows down the process for others. If you pressed me to find faults, here is what I would say: -Biggest complaint: sucky food at the pool and no pool side restaurant (tuna salad sandwich???).

The hotel is just beautifully decorated and impressive. Checked in was excellent since we arrived almost 8pm which means not a long line and the guy that checked us in was very customer oriented even asked me what room do i prefer, strip view or mountain view. Going to the elevator has a security guard asking to show your key card, nice touch i thought. Our room was at the 18th floor and facing the pool and Xs club with very nice mountain view. It was very clean, no slipper but just a bathrobe but didn't really matter because the marble floor, i think, felt comfortable with our bare feet. The bathroom is big and more than enough for my husband and i using it at the same time. I read some complained about a cabinet space but our room has plenty of it both from the closet and from below the plasma tv. The bed is just so comfortable but had no aches or pain getting up in morning even from staying at the wee hours. Restaurant: we tried the wazuzu, i think thats the name, the food was okay nothing to brag about but expensive, busy and the waiter seemed to like to hurry you up in your decision and ordering. We also ate the at wynn, sw steakhouse, best porter steak and vegetable we had but again Expensive. Poo: Encore pool is nice but nothing extraordinary, and yes you have to reserve and pay for the cabana and the soft chair close to the pool area. don't know how much and didn't really care for it, the lounge chair served our purpose and the sun wasn't that hot for us. The water by the pool is complimentary and has a coctail waitress that comes around to take your order for drink or munchies. I ordered an asian chicken salad, mai tai and double shot of rum and coke for my husband and i, cost us close to $50! EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!! Club: Xs club--very crowded and $20 to get in. Theres a coupon from the wynn buffet that you can pick up where the girls are free for only certain days but you have to get in before midnight. Unfortunately, the line was so long that you have to be in line before 10pm or ealier to get inside by midnight. Again, drinks inside the club are expensive. It was so crowded that everyone bumping and hitting each other that i saw couple episode of almost erupting into a fight, so we got out..The music seemed to go on forever and ever to our room till about 445am. Xs is openned friday -monday. Aside from the music from the Club, my husband and i heard few conversation next door and nothing in the hallway. I always put our don't disturb light on. The casino is small but not bad for me and my husband, we are not a gambler, just passing time. The hotel has free valet parking but i heard complained of being slow so my husband parked our rental car himself. we always found parking easily in first and second floor close to the entrance. The hotel is accessible to the Forum shop,wynn shops and palazzo hotel but a lot of walking. Overall, it was a nice hotel but it is gear toward adult pupulation, businesses and high profile customers. Another thing the hotel should have at least a welcoming basket of fruit or nuts complimentary for couple celebrating anniversary, bithdays or at least with 50th or above birthday or some other special occasion to ensure customer to keep coming back.

We we impressed with the floor to ceiling windows, and a nice couch with lounge to enjoy the view. The bed linens were exquisite, and we appreciated the robes and slippers that were provided. The tv that swiveled to be viewed from the sitting area and bed was a wonderful idea, and the bathroom was elegant with the double sinks, great lighting, glass shower with a good shower head and hand held attachment. We were also impressed with the remote panel next to the bed that controlled the curtains, lighting and privacy button.

This was our second time staying at the Encore (the first was over Valentine's Day) and this stay far surpassed the first go-round. We stayed in the Tower Suites in a Salon suite, high on the 55th floor, which afforded us a great view of the Strip (and the big sparkly Wynn sign right next door - ha). Bell service was prompt and helpful, which was my chief complaint last trip, and check-in was smooth and swift. As usual, the room was impeccable - squeaky clean, gorgeously appointed, and well stocked. We had one teeny complaint - there were some track lights that wouldn't turn off - but that was dealt with and fixed within 15 minutes of discovery, and really, it's all in how they treat you. So we had zero complaints as far as that goes. We tried Sinatra (we have previously dined at Switch, Botero, and of course the Society Cafe) and found it slightly lacking. Ambience and service are nice enough (if a wee bit slow), but the food wasn't too hot. I don't think we'll be eating there again, but by no means was it a bad restaurant - there are simply finer offerings on the Strip (and indeed, within the Wynn properties). The casino continues to be my favorite casino - small, intimate, and upscale. The usual drunk frat boys and half dressed cigarette-chugging women aren't really found here, and it's refreshing. If I wanted someone breathing Jack Daniels in my face while I was playing blackjack, I'd go somewhere else. Of course I visited the spa and had the most wonderful massage I have ever had - better than the last one I had there, and that is really saying something. I may very well change my allegiance from the Four Seasons at this rate. The spa is decadent, gorgeous, fabulously well appointed, big, detailed (a la signature Wynn), and utterly tranquil. Even I, who can't fall asleep in a public place for the life of me, took a decent snooze by the hot tub on these amazing heated rock-type chairs they have (sounds uncomfortable - but believe me, it was a slice of heaven). I truly cannot say enough good things about the spa. Service was impeccable all around, from room service to bellmen to security. Truly one of the best service experiences I have personally had. Being younger and a woman, it can often be difficult to obtain the same level of service and attention afforded to others, and I was very pleasantly surprised. Encore makes you feel special! :) We visited XS not this trip, but a couple of weeks ago with a passel of friends, so I'll light on that - GORGEOUS club, big, shiny, and fantastic. Great music, amazing ambiance, gorgeous people, fantastic bottle service, and a lot of details - if you go, be sure to check out the wings on the ceiling. Well worth attending. I can't wait to go back again. This is far and away my favorite hotel in Vegas and I recommend it to everyone I know.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

This hotel is hip and relevant. No crazy ornate frou frou nonsense. We arrived on a Friday morning walked into the Tower Suites private check in, employed the \"$50 trick\" and found ourselves in a 1400 square foot north facing Parlor Suite. If you can swing it, definitely go for the Tower; it's so worth it. 2 bathrooms, a massage room, a living room, bedroom and enormous bathroom. The suite was brand new, beautifully appointed and perfectly clean. There is a wet bar with an empty mini fridge, and also a mini bar with all the accouterments. The website photos depict the rooms exactly. There was a 52\" tv in the living room, a 42\" in the bedroom and a 19\" in the bathroom. My only complaint about the suite is that it seemed a bit too minimalist. There was only a sitting chair in the second half of the bedroom and it seemed lost in the space. Also there was a big gap of space before the bathroom on the left side of the bedroom. It looked sadly empty. We never heard a peep from the hallway or anyone else's room. If you want turndown service, simply call housekeeping and they will happily provide it for you. We found the service in this hotel exemplary. Each time we walked into the lobby we were greeted with a smile. Each time we requested something it was addressed promptly. Room service food was the best I have ever had in any 5 star hotel. It was fresh, clean food presented beautifully. Also we had two breakfasts at Society and the food was very good. In a word, the spa is extraordinary. You will step into a sea of tranquility where no details have been overlooked. Wonderful treatment rooms, 4 different pools, specialty showers, and every other amenity you can think of. Yes, it is expensive, but the extras are so worth it! The therapists and treatments were first rate. We sat at the outdoor pool for a little while and within minutes were approached by an outgoing friendly cocktail waitress for drinks which were huge, delicious and not lacking liquor! One evening we saw Le Reve which was absolutely unbelievable. Pure Vegas entertainment. We ate at SW Steakhouse and the food and service was very good. We also reserved VIP at Blush and were treated like Royalty. We found the location of the Wynn properties perfect. In our opinion it was nice to be a little bit removed from all the craziness yet it's only a 5 minute cab ride away from everything. We are very picky travelers and expect the best. Encore delivered that and then some.

This hotel is truely a sight to be seen. It is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed in and I would argue the best on the Strip. You can see the million of dollars it took to construct in the detail; from the massive chandelier outside when you drive up to the luxuriousness of every suite in the hotel. But be warned this does come at a price while you are there. Check in/out: Check in and out was effortless. I was expecting lines and grumbling Americans complaining endlessly but not a peep. The lady who checked us in spent so much time answering our questions; very helpful,l friendly and welcoming. I really think it depends when you arrive. The hotel was very crowded Friday-Sunday. Midweek was not so bad. Rooms: The rooms are amazing. So luxurious. A marble hall opens up into a bedroom and then living space. The 42 inch TV is great which swivels so you can watch it in the living area and while in bed. The bathroom is also finished to a very high standard. We loved the double sinks, bath and separate shower with two shower heads. Th toilet is also off he bathroom in a different room. The bed is THE most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. In some ways it was a hindrance as it was such a hassle to get out of it! Food: There are many restaurants in the hotel but I would say there needs to be more casual dining options. Zoozacrackers is great for burgers and sandwiches but sometimes we craved food that wasn't of this sort at affordable prices. We ate at SW one night which was incredible but it did come at a price. The breakfast buffet is also incredible but again comes at a price; $18.95 each and if you are staying for an extended period it does add up. At times we were screaming 'We only want a bowl of cereal and some fruit for $15 all in' but the Encore is not this sort of place. If you want this you should be staying at Circus Circus where they have a McDonalds... enough said! Pool Area: The pool area lets the hotel down in my opinion. Although well designed it is far too small for the hotel. The Wynn one is much more appealing, better designed and less crowded but I think that is due to there being more space. I purchased some cream at the pool... $33 dollars... but that is the price of where you are staying. Did I mentioned the $8 dollar charge for bottled water in the room or the $9 charge to take elivery of flowers that a relative sent us. (Take some time now to reflect on the title of this review. Is it sinking in?!) Spa: In one word... awesome. Be prepared to let it all hang out though in the spa. Separate ones for men and women so if going with a partner you will be split. I had a massage and it was sublime. My wife had a facial. Total: $400. (Refer back to title once more!) Location: I really liked it. Not right in the hub but really close to the Venetian (which is amazing) for Blue Man Group, Phantom and Jersey Boys which we saw and across the road from the Fashion Mall which offers cheaper food options including Starbucks, KFC and other more affordable options if 'fast'. Gripes and advice: The pros far outweigh the cons at the Encore but here are a few negatives and bits of advice to help you... 1. Bring lots of money you will need it! Our check out bill was nearly $900 and we really didn't go nuts. Treatments and ONE meal in fine dining restaurant pushed it up. 2. Go to Hoover Dam or a variety of other trips with Pink Jeep Tours. You can book with the bell desk; not the concierge which I thought was strange. Very good sevice. 3. Bring very comfortable walking shoes. Due to the location, you will walk a lot. All the hotels are on a massive scale. To walk to the buffet in the wynn from the encore will take you 15 minutes and this is at a fast pace. We underestimated the scale of everything before we arrived. Pace yourself. 4. Noise. Although we didn't experience room to room noise, we were disturbed b the beat from the nightclub Fri-Mon. We were in a strip view room on 27th floor. If you don't want to be listening to the beat then request a room at other side of hotel. In my opinion, in a hotel of this class you should be hearing a pin drop. Disappointing even though the view was amazing. I would have been even more pissed off if I had kids with me. 5. Just embrace the madness. Las Vegas is crazy and like nowhere you have ever been to; it's loud, false, imposing, overwhelming and exciting.

Arrived at 10:00 in the morning and our room wasn't ready. That was fine, we went to get lunch and while eating, my husband got a call on his cell that our room was ready. Thought that was fast. We asked for an upper level floor with a good view of the strip. We got the 16th floor which was great because any higher high and the view wouldn't have been as good. However, was disappointed that were on the opposite side of the good view of the strip. We faced Fremont street end which was more construction. However, it still wasn't a \"bad\" view. The window is the entire width and length of the room and was wonderful. Night view was fantastic. The resort is absolutely beautiful. However, beware that all of the restaurants and bars are very expensive. We ate at the Switch Restaurant one night and spent $160.00 for the two of us and we only ordered their special which consisted of soup, entree (chicken which was excellent) and a small dessert. That was $59.00 each and we each had a beer because we found a new one we can't get at home that we really liked (Flat Tire). That was it! With tip it all added up to $160.00. But what the heck, we were on vacation. Overall, great resort. There are two pools, one had quite a few kids which I don't have a problem with that, I love my grandchildren but they were quite noisy and splashed a lot. So we went over to the meditterean pool which requires you to be 21 because it was topliess. No one was until we got ready to leave and two gals planted themselves right next to the entrance. Was kind of strange to me. Only disappointment was check out. We waited in line for 45 minutes. Only 4 four people in front of us but lots of questions regarding their bills where managers needed to be called in. Switched line though and moved up faster. However, beware of the added charges for the mini bar in room. I was aware of the fact that we shouldn't touch any of the candies, etc. for sale. Bellman even told us not to touch anything because it was all weighted and we'd be charged if it was taken out of it's \"home\". Looked at bill and was charged $8.00. I asked how that would happen when we didn't touch anything. She asked if we took out the ice bucket! We said yes, and she said that's probably what did it.

I should not have worried at all. This hotel was gorgeous, the service was amazing, the room was beautiful. Here's a synopsis. Check-in: We arrived at 11am and our room was ready. We were upgraded to a higher floor just by asking, and to a North-facing room so we wouldn't hear the nightclub. We didn't have to wait in line to check in, although we got there on a Thursday. The next day, we saw a massive line/crowd at the check in though. This always happens in Vegas so those who complained about long check in lines maybe haven't ever been to Vegas before? Anyways, I did see 2 hotel employees (in suits) surveying the line to figure out a better way to do things...so maybe they'll get a bit more organized in the near future. We had NO problems, though. The room: wasn't really a suite, just a larger-than-average room with a dividing wall. Who cares, it was gorgeous. And we had no noise problems whatsoever. I am the lightest sleeper and I hate, repeat, hate hearing people in other rooms when I'm in hotels. Our room was totally quiet and so comfortable. I can't say enough about the bed...I wanted to pack it in my suitcase and take it home. I spent half the vacation in the bed because it was so amazing. The soaps and lotion they give you in the bathroom are scrumptious lemon. So nice. Didn't have room service so can't comment on that. The bathroom was bigger than our master bedroom at home. No complaints. Oh one - we didn't have a trash can in our bathroom but the maid brought one right away. The Spa: didn't have a treatment but we worked out one morning. Very nice fitness centre, it was $30 but that's the case with most of the hotels in Vegas. Nothing is cheap so if you want a cheap vacation, go to Iowa or something. Anyways, the fitness centre was a bit warm and after being up late a warm room and a run on the treadmill was a bit nauseating. Otherwise the staff was so nice, they have bottled water and lockers and whatever. The Society Cafe: we didn't experience the bad service that others wrote about. In fact, the service was amazing, the food came quickly, and it was so good. I had a turkey club sandwich, yummy. Hubby had tuna sliders, amazing. Casino: it depends what you want, really. If you want frat boys and 21 year old drunk girls falling all over eachother, go somewhere else. If you're single and you want to meet someone, it's probably not gonna happen at the Encore. The casino is really nice, not smoky, no riff raff, but my complaint about it is that there are very few tables where you can bet less than $25. And, we didn't hear a lot of slots ringing..meaning, people weren't winning (?) The pool: gorgeous. but the weather was crap so we didn't lie out a lot. Servers were quick and attentive, unlike some other hotels where you have to jump up and down to get their attention. Didn't go to XS nightclub but there were a TON of people in line when we passed by at 12am on Friday. Mostly people in the 21-30 range with a LOT of makeup on. But, that's Vegas for you. All in all, a great experience with no problems.

When I did not receive a confirmation of my reservation by email after a few days, I called the Wynn 800 number and the very helpful operator confirmed my reservation and the rate, and promptly emailed a confirmation (only upon my return home did I notice that the room rate field was conspicuously blank). My friend Rob and I arrived late Friday afternoon and were informed at the front desk that not only were they out of rooms with two Queen beds (a bit of a problem - Rob and I are close, but not that close), but that our rate was actually $209/night. Of course, we protested and were informed that the system had no record of that rate (I am still at something of a loss as the Wynn website featured a prominent ad that bodly stated the $159/night rate). After half an hour of being passed around and the infuriating mumbled apologies for the confusion, I was offered the very unsatisfactory suggestion that \"maybe that rate only applied to telephone reservations.\" Determined not to let this ruin our weekend, we begrudgingly checked in. We had just set down our bags in the room when Kevin from the Wynn reservations office called. I outlined my complaint, and offered to call my office in Los Angeles and have the confirmation I received forwarded to him. His response can best be summed with two words: arrogant and condescending. He also contradicted himself a number of times, leading me to believe I did not have his full attention. I got pretty fed up with his treatment, told him that I would not spend a dime at either Wynn property, and terminated the call. Needless to say, this was not the ideal start to our weekend. We recovered quickly though - it is Vegas after all. As we are acccustomed, we enjoyed a pint or three at Nine Fine Irishmen Pub and Grill at New York, New York, and an amazing meal at Bouchon at the Venetian. The poker room at Caesar's was a pleasant surprise this trip, as was their spacious sports book. Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill lived up to the hype, and Napoleon's at the Paris is a pretty happening night spot. By and large, we otherwise enjoyed our stay at the Encore...until Saturday night. When we returned to the hotel around 2 a.m., we discovered our room keys were not working. We walked back to the front desk and were provided new keys by the desk clerk, who thought the system was \"virused.\" We walked back to the room to find that the new keys were equally as ineffective. After another trip to the front desk - no short trek, especially when you have the room at the end of the hall - we were offered more mumbled apologies, some reports of similar complaints from other guests, and new keys, which also did not work. Tired of walking and just plain tired, I elected not to return to the front desk and instead entered the housekeeping quarters, where I picked up the nearest phone. I was transferred around and then told that security was en route. After fifteen minutes of literally lying in the halls, I got back on the phone and was reassured that security was en route. When a security guard arrived ten minutes after that, we gave him a little cheer. He then checked our IDs and tried unsuccessfully to open the door with his key card. We were asked to wait another five minutes while a booster key was retrieved. Fifteen minutes later, the security guard returned with his supervisor, each of whom thought the other had brought the booster key. Had they not been so embarassed and apologetic, I would have sworn we were on a candid camera program. More waiting ensued, but we were finally admitted to our room - an hour and a half after the whole ordeal began. I was too tired to do anything but turn in for the night. My friend Rob, however, immediately got on the phone with the night manager. After going round and round with her, he was put on hold and then told that the hotel would honor the $159/rate - the rate that did not exist the night before. As he put it the next morning, \"it was as though she and the rest of the clerks received a no apologies, no gimmes lecture from management a few hours earlier.\" That pretty much sums up our experience at the Encore. It's really too bad. The resort is really quite lovely, elegantly decorated, and conveniently located with spacious rooms and all the amenities you would expect at a first rate hotel.

We arrived at 9 in the morning, and since a room wasn't ready, they offered us pool passes for the day till our room was ready. A nice guesture, even though I would have had to change in the lobby bathroom. No other hotel has ever offered this to me, and I have stayed in Vegas at over 10 different hotels. The room was gorgeous, spacious, and luxurious. Everything is top-notch, from the wall paper, to the MOST COMFORTABLE BED, to the remote control for the curtains and lights. The pool, especially the Euro side, is beautiful and spacious (although it was not the summer 110 degree weather which draws the crowds).

And no long line at the airport for a taxi! :-) Anyway, when we walked into the room we were both amazed. Absolutely beautiful. And brand spanking new. The bathrooms, the bed, the sitting area, the floor to ceiling windows... it was all extremely nice. My husband was taking pictures on his phone and uploading them to Facebook... that's how nice it was. We ordered room service and I have NEVER experienced better quality food or service. I travel for work a lot and get room service all the time. This is certainly the best experience I have had. We went to LV to just relax so we spent the whole weekend pretty much in \"Wynn World\". We did go to Sensi for dinner on Saturday night. Overall I was not impressed. I didn't really like anything I had, including the famed black cod. If you do decide to go give yourself extra time upon arrival because it's buried inside Bellagio way past the chocolate place... maybe for a reason.... We basically just vegged out and walked around, watched some NFL playoff games, signed up for the Red Club and got 2 free meals at the Wynn buffet. Shame on us... we totally skipped and didn't take advantage of them. We ordered room service again the night before we left and I had spaghetti and meatballs... it was literally among the best I've ever had. Delicious!

However, there were a lot of complaints on here and unfortunately they were right. First of all, we tried to check in when we arrived at noon but were told no rooms were ready. We came back at 340pm and were told the same thing. When I said \" I thought check in was at 3pm\" the girl behind the desk said \"check in STARTS at 3pm.\" Nice. Anyhow my husband told them we had dinner reservations at 630 and needed time to rest and they gave us a handicapped-accessible room on the 52nd floor. It was a nice view of the strip. The walls were paper thin. From 12-2 that morning a child in the next room was crying and whining. The next day at 4 am a loud group arrived from partying and was loud and raucous for 20 minutes. I could here another conversation in the bathroom throught the vents as well. The rooms are very comfy though and especially the beds. No turn down service, disappointing for a hotel of this caliber. We got robes, but no slippers- unlike the Venetian. The lemongrass soap is very pleasant. The lines to check in/out are individual- instead of the one big line. So you better hope you pick the right one. Had a $50 resort credit which took a phone call and visit to the front desk to get straightened out. Our room was charged for the mini bar which we never used/touched. Ate at Society Cafe- service painfully slow to start but food was excellent, and this wasn't even one of the top restaurants here! Definitely go back here. A lot of restaurants have specials now at great prices ( maybe due to the economy). I had a mac and cheese appetizer, 8 oz filet, and warm donuts for dessert for $38. Excellent value. What sold us on this place was the clientele- no tank tops or yard-long margarita types here. Very classy and especially in the evenings. Don't get me wrong we gamble during the day everywhere but we like a sophisticated atmosphere where we stay. This place fits that bill. I said I wouldn't come back becasue of the acoustics in the rooms but my husband really liked it here ( he slept through all the noise). Oh, another thing- it was my 40th burthday and my husband mentioned that when we checked in. The gal sent up a pretty tray of chocolates that said \"Happy Anniversary\" on them.

There are a lot of good things to say about Encore but also some things that need fixing. First the good things. Like most hotels in Las Vegas, room prices were much lower than in the past. We got our room for $169/night and have been told that when the hotel opened in December 2008 the rooms were initially priced at $350/night. Encore is beautifully decorated, both in the casino and public areas and in the rooms. Without exception, the staff was extremely friendly, including the dealers. The lobby cafe and lounge was a wonderful place to relax and have a small bite to eat. The food in the restaurant Bolero was excellent as was the service. The rooms have all of the amenities as the regular Wynn Hotel, though to call them suites is a bit misleading. They are in reality regular sized rooms with a divider that holds the television and separates the bed from the rest of the room. The use of mirrors on the walls makes the room feel more spacious that it really is. I should point out that we stayed in a regular resort suite and not in the Encore tower, but we were told by staff that the rooms there are the same as in the regular hotel and that you pay extra for the private check-in and concierge service. However, we found our room perfectly adequate. The bathroom was in the Wynn tradition of large and well-appointed. My wife says that the Encore spa was the best she has ever been in, both in terms of its beauty and the quality of the staff. Now, the bad things. The rooms have no soundproofing. We had \"ghost voices\" of other guests coming through the walls and even the floor. Our friends had to relocate because of the noise from a neighboring room (the guests were cheering on a team participating in the NCAA basketball tournament). In our friends' new room, they were very bothered at night by the noise from the Encore nightclub XS. A word to the wise--when checking in, request a room on the other side of Encore from the pool, because XS is located by the pool and the nightclub is loud and active from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. Friday through Monday. The sound travels up, so even staying on a high floor is not effective. It was disappointing that our friends were placed on the pool side of the hotel even after they requested the side away from the pool. We also found the music in the hotel restaurants extremely loud. That isn't a problem in the old Wynn. When we asked one server to turn down the music, she said it was pre-programmed for loudness and the staff had no control over the noise volume. Registration was disorganized as there was no staff member present in the lobby to direct guests to the various lines that formed. We have found that Bellagio handles this very well but not Encore. Our friends also had a bad experience at the restaurant Sinatra before we arrived, but as I did not witness the problem, I won't go into detail. In summary, Encore is nicely appointed and the staff works hard to please (except for our friends' room assignment), but our overall experience was not as good as in the older Wynn Hotel. When we return, we will probably stay in the Wynn Tower rooms and not in Encore, though we will frequent the Encore casino.", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sc", "Title": "\u201cEncore almost a home run\u201d", "Author": "luvtotravelsc", "ReviewID": "UR26923154", "Content": "Had 2 rooms for 4 nights during March 2009.

Everything is kept immaculately clean and the service is excellent. We checked in late, and unfortunately the hotel was unable to grant us the two queen beds we requested (very few rooms with two beds in hotel). Fortunately, they were able to give us one the next day and gave us a twin rollaway bed in the meantime. The King room had a divider separating the bedroom from the living area, which was nice. I preferred the room with two queens though, since there was no divider (a big open space) and the air conditioning flowed freely thoughout the room (the King room got very stuffy due to the divider). Both rooms had identical bathrooms with a small tub, separate shower stall, terry cloth bathrobes, double sinks, small flat screen tv with remote, and a toilet in a separate subroom. The main rooms both had an over-priced mini bar (snack food, sodas, alcohol, and an intimacy kit), larger flat screen tv's, bed-side controlled blinds/lights/privacy sign, an ipod dock, a desk with a fax machine, and a fairly large \"L\" shaped couch (moderately comfortable for sleeping on). There are many mirrors that make the room appear larger and floor-to-ceiling windows with a pool or north strip view. The beds were a bit to soft for me, but I don't sleep much when I'm in Vegas anyways. We went to Blush ultra-lounge at the Wynn and thought the DJ/music were excellent. Beware of the drink prices in Vegas clubs though. They usually range from $10-$15 each. While the location isn't right in the middle of the action, I enjoyed Encore's proximity to the cheaper gambling hotels (Riviera, Circus Circus and Slots-A-Fun) and the nicer ones (Wynn, Palazzo, and Treasure Island). All of these were a ten minute walk or so. We were able to book the hotel for $125 a night plus tax on Expedia by combining it with our flight, which was a steal!

And while Encore is the newest large property, it is among my least favorite. Virtually all the hotel public spaces (except some gambling) are located a good distance away in the Wynn. Therefore, if you want to want to eat after 10 pm, play poker or see a show, you will need to walk the long way under the street through a never-ending tunnel to get to the Wynn. Once you get in the Wynn, you still need to find the attraction you are interested in, further in to the casino. Not great if you have someone with even slight problems walking long distances. Our group went to see a show and returned about 10 pm. The Encore staff told us to go to this restaurant or that restaurant at the Encore, not knowing which were open\u2014none where (on a Saturday night).

The towels were not replaced properly (one day I had only two bath towels and no bath mat by the tub neither by the shower). And lastly, when I checked in there was a cake that I think belonged to the previous guest in the fridge. These are minor issues, but they really need to pay more attention to the little details if they want to achieve what the Tower Suites at Wynn Las Vegas have achieved: 5-star service all over and consistency for almost 4 years. With this addition, I believe Wynn Resorts are the best in town. Stylish, modern, great decor, and the best service. All employees have a true and honest smile in their faces you need them. One last note: The Spa at Encore is something out of this world.

The casino was small but very light and airy with drinks service aplenty !! we also found the slots to be amongst the loosest we played and saw lots of people winning also ( nothing large though) The pool area is excellent but not the largest in Vegas although you can use The pools at the Wynn ( only a short walk) Good sunloungers with complimentary drinking water. We did have breakfast at the cafe a few times but it is expensive ( as you would expect from a hotel of this quality ), if you want to save some money, i would suggest going out of the main entrance and taking a right and go to the ' American cafe' they even made breakfast bagels for us which weren't even on the menu !! Although the Encore is expensive to dine at, i did note that most restaurants seemed to be offering special deals ( including switch ) I never ate at Encore but i did eat at Stack @ the Mirage for $29.99 for 3 courses and found it excellent value and ate there several times. If i was going to be pedantic, i could mention that there was no slippers, no turn down service, howerver, who cares & the plate of homemade chocolates i was given for my 40th birthday which i celebrated here were awesome and a nice surprise ( they got my birthday from my red card details i didn't have to tell them) Would i stay here again - HELL YEAH !!!", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOne of the Best\u201d", "Author": "travelbh", "ReviewID": "UR26173695", "Content": "The encore is the epitome of what a Las Vegas luxury hotel should be.

Newly opened at the end of 2008, this resort is a great escape for anyone that wants to be pampered 24/7. It is located next door to Wynn, and connected by a corridor containing only the best in upscale shopping, called Esplanade. If you love the color red and butterflies you will not go wrong here, the resort is decorated in both. We arrived at the Encore Friday morning, after being greeted at the front door by a very professional Bell Staff; we went to the front desk for check-in.We were there for one on my clients wedding that she booked at [-]. The front desk staff did a great job of getting us checked-in and to our room, within 15 minutes we were looking out at the view which encompassed the Wynn Country Club, the Strip and the Nevada mountains, we could not have asked for a better room location or view. The room at just over 700 sq ft. has everything that you could possibly want or need during your stay in Vegas. The bathroom consisting of all marble floors has a large shower, soaking tub, 2 vanities, a decent sized TV, and a separate toilet room. Large closet space in the hallway, with ample storage and a safe, large enough to store your laptop computer. There is a mini bar that contains any drink both alcoholic and regular that you could want and a wide variety of snacks, all of which are priced typical to that of a hotel of this class. There is an office desk complete with phone, chair, and fax machine located in the sitting room which also has an \u201cL\u201d shaped sofa that overlooks the floor to ceiling windows. The bedroom section consisted of a King sized bed, which was one of the most comfortable beds that I have ever slept on while vacationing, two night stands, a 42\u201d HDTV ( that can swivel for viewing both in the sitting room or bedroom ) and a device that allows you to control all of the lighting in the room as well as the curtains that screen the floor to ceiling windows. The rooms made our 5 night stay there very comfortable. There are many choices when it comes to dining but I will comment on our favorite all around restaurant. It is called Society and is located just off of the Casino floor, and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. We had the pleasure to experience all three of them, and were very happy with all three. I would have to say that my favorite meal there was the Fillet Mignon Sliders that they serve at lunch served with hand cut fries and freshly made doughnuts. If you go, you have to get these!! My wife used the spa facilities and was very impressed with the staff as well as the treatments performed. We did get a chance to lay by the pool one day, but did not use it because the weather was still a bit cool, but we will be going back when the weather warms to take advantage of it. There are 2 pools, and a whirlpool at Encore and like the rest of the property, all well manicured and nothing out of place. Overall impressions of the resort were very positive; the only thing that I did not think was up to the rest of the resort standards would have been the Housekeeping Staff. They just did not seem to have it all together yet, and that was disappointing, knowing that they have now been opened for close to 3 months. I do however highly recommend this property to any of my clients looking to spend some time in Vegas and wanting to be pampered during your stay. Please check out the pictures of the resort at [-].

I love the Wynn and couldn't wait to try Encore. The hotel is beautiful and the people that work there are incredibly nice. Upon check in, I asked for a room in a quiet part of the hotel as I am a light sleeper. I probably should have just let fate dictate where I stayed. After going to bed at 3:30 am ( it is Vegas afterall) I was awakened by what sounded like a whole kindergarten class next door at 5:30 am! I'm guessing there were four little kids in there...and they were definately up for the day! That was it for my sleep that night. I accepted my fate and went to the casual dining restaurant for breakfast before going to my conference. Service was quick and food was fine breakfast fare. Upon returning to my room that afternoon, my room wasn't made up yet. I had left the little light indicating the room should be made up..but to no avail. I called housekeeping and asked them to come up as I went to use the gym. Came back an hour later, still no housekeeping. I'm not that fussy, but at this point, I needed my towels changed out. So I called again and informed them that no one had come all day and that I was going out for the evening, and asked them to come before I get back from dinner and gambling. When I finally got back from the night's festivities, the room was spotless and I had an abundance of towels. Not sure what their turndown service at night policies are, but I had it performed only once during my four night stay. I think that housekeeping is still a bit rusty, but I'm sure it will get better with time. Outside of that minor complaint, the only other thing, which has been discussed here is that sound travels between rooms far too easily for such a swanky place. As I said, I am a light sleeper, and it was a real problem for me. So much so, that I may switch back to the Wynn, which I find more quiet. Botero steakhouse was phenonmenal! The dealers were great! Loved the feel of the casino. Although, they stopped serving Kettle One vodka at the blackjack tables both at Encore and at the Wynn. What?? No premium vodka at such fine establishments?

Good \u00b7 Short walk from parking garage to check in. \u00b7 Front desk staff was extremely helpful, courteous and contributed to a great start to my stay. \u00b7 Every staff member that I came in contact with (face to face) was helpful, polite and trained in guest satisfaction. \u00b7 My room on the 62nd floor had a spectacular view of the Strip. \u00b7 Everything was new and clean. Bad \u00b7 Housekeeping is very disorganized. I had to call Housekeeping twice to have my room cleaned. First, the room was not cleaned when I returned to my room at 4 PM on Saturday. The maid knocked on my door at 5 PM to clean the room and I told her to come back in an hour since my friend was taking a nap. I came back to my room around midnight and it was in the same condition that I left it. I called Housekeeping and they stated that someone would be there immediately (I took that to mean about 15-20 mins). I waited for 45 mins and then went downstairs to the Front Desk and had them contact Housekeeping again to clean the room. I came back around 3 AM and the room was finally made up. And yes, I made sure the Make Up Room button was pressed (Green light indicator was ON the whole entire day). I was asked 3 times if I had the Do Not Disturb button turned off. Every time I left the room, I checked to see that the green light was on. \u00b7 Soundproofing in the rooms is nonexistent. There was a loud of bunch of guys in the next room and I could hear all 4 of them shouting at each other and the music they were playing. In my sister and her husband's room, they could hear the TV and the man talking loudly next door. I'm not sure how to solve this issue since the hotel is brand new but something to consider when renovation time comes. \u00b7 There were no bath robes in my room. I had no desire to purchase the robes at the Wynn Home Store since I didn't have an example to try on. For a 3 night stay, I would expect someone would have put robes on the 2 saddest looking hangers in the bathroom. Also, my sister's room had bath robes but no slippers. I had slippers but no robes. \u00b7 The in room express check out didn't work on the TV for both rooms I booked. I had to go downstairs again to check out of my room. I gave my room information to one of clerks helping guests in line. That was a big inconvenience and something that should have worked correctly the first time. For the most part, I tried to like the hotel but the lapses in the details, technical glitches, and my frustrating experience with housekeeping leave a lot to be desired. Especially for a resort looking to earn a 5 Star and 5 Diamond rating. At a lesser hotel, I would be willing to overlook these issues but when you are constantly advertising about the awards won and ratings bestowed, it all rings a bit hollow.

I have stayed at the Wynn, Four Seasons, and Bellagio in LV. Encore is very similar to Wynn with some improvements. The rooms are larger. I found the decor a bit more masculine. All amenites are perfect including bathroom amenity fragrance, mini-bar and bed. The spa in this hotel is gorgeous and generally very upscale. They did not provide brushes though they had dryers which was odd. The gym is great but surprisingly full. The casino area of the hotel is busy but much less so than the Wynn which we preferred. As shoppers, restaurant and show clients as opposed to gamblers it made it easier to walk through though there was still plenty of good people-watching. Both hotels have a beautiful very upscale Esplanade ( Chanel, Hermes, Graff) Service was pretty good but there was room for improvement. The concierge staff gave me the wrong info on hours of restaurants at the Wynn for example. The phone system is difficult because they seem to sort of share it and you never can tell if you are speaking with a Wynn or Encore concierge. Also, I asked them to print out boarding passes and send them to the room. This was really a time sensitive request and it was not executed. They were able to get seats at two shows successfully ( Cirque de Soleil Love and Danny Gans, both wonderful and worth seeing.) Strangely there is no concierge service after 9:00pm which does not make sense in a town like LV. This was very inconvenient and I wondered if it would be different in the Tower section of the hotel. I went in and asked and was told it was the same. I was informed that this was due to economic cutbacks. The hotel is very opulent and there are many excellent restaurants. . You would never know they were experiencing cutbacks if you were not told so. The hotel is very opulent and there are many excellent restaurants.

There is a clothing optional area but everyone there was clothed.The hotel is very opulent and there are many excellent restaurants. Botero was great although they made us wait and hour + for a table. This wasn't something I would normally do but it was in the upscale shopping area so there were distractions. You are also across the street from a topnotch mall with Neimans, SFA, Nordstrom, etc. and next to the Palazzo with many designer boutiques and Barney's NY. I would recommed this as a shopping destination to anyone from anywhere who likes fashion and has a healthy wallet. Stores are beautiful and loaded with inventory, much moreso in my opinion than even LA where I am from. This and the Wynn are providing competition and alternatives for eachother. They are both really fun places to be. Service is stronger and more personalized at the Four Seasons, but the location is not as good for other diversions.

I absolutely loved the bathroom, and floor to ceiling windows, with great view. The beds were cozy as well. but, the location of the hotel SUCKED. you had to walk forever just to get back onto the strip and to where all the other hotels/casinos were. This wouldn't be a problem if the casino at the encore was fun. Basically it was a bunch of yuppies and wannabe yuppies there so it wasnt much fun to hang out there. Drinks were outrageous and if you weren't dressed in a formal gown/tux you felt oddly out of place. So we were forced to make the long treacherous journey to casino royale (my people haha). Also, would it kill them to put a subway or mcd's in the freakin hotel! jesus h christ. i woke up at 2am STARVING one night and was forced to walk to walgreens to get something to eat (which sucked walking through the casino at 2am in sweat pants), it was better than paying 8 dollars for a bag of chips in the room. When i stayed at excalibur i could walk downstairs in my pj's and find a fast food restaurant, not at encore. First, youd have to put on an evening gown, then put a french twist in your hair, then you could head down and find an over priced cafe and get a 10 dollar grilled cheese (for real, i got a 10 dollar grilled cheese and tomato soup out of desperation) THEN when you get back to the room and find the tomato soup was too much to eat, YOU HAVE NO WHERE TO PUT YOUR LEFTOVERS because the only fridge in the room is one with a scale that charges you 12 dollars for a powerade. We literally went to walgreens and got a disposable cooler to put leftovers in lol. ok so basically, rooms were awesome, but if your a 20 something, like me, who is not rich, then this is not the hotel for you.

Rather than being a separate hotel, it really just feels like an extension of Wynn Las Vegas. It's separated by a shopping corridor of some 20 very high end stores. The feel is very much that of Wynn, if not a bit more upscale feeling and a bit more red (which I liked). THE SUITE It had the feel of the Wynn rooms, but more updated in shades of black & white. The bathroom seemed identical to those at Wynn (which would be hard to improve upon). The bedding was the same (thankfully) and the real difference was the separate sitting area with full sofa/chaise and a 46' LCD that turned to front either the bedroom or sitting room. Really, I can't find anything wrong except that for comfort, it would be nice if they added a couple of pillows to the sofa area. The views from my suite were looking from the golf course behind Wynn to straight down the Strip (with better Strip views in my opinion than Wynn) to the mountains to the west. SERVICE/RESTAURANTS Didn't eat at any of the restaurants. When I encountered staff, I would say the service was good. Check-in remains a confusing mess - which you will also find if you check in at Wynn. They obviously don't like roped off qeues where the next person moves to the next open attendant. They prefer to guide you into the individual lines and it's just luck of the draw if you get a fast or slow one. First time in my many trips to Vegas that the room wasn't ready at 11am. And they say it's dead in Vegas right now???? Not at Encore. I had to wait til nearly 3pm to get the room keys and had to stand in line again for that. CASINO The Encore casino is nice in that during the day, you get tons of outdoor light from the pool area that is next to the casino and separated via large windowed walls. But I found the casino to have a smallish feel to it. I preferred to go to Wynn to gamble. More activity - more slot choices. Couldn't believe all the penny slots at both Wynn & Encore. I guess it's a function of the economy. LOCATION I love that Wynn/Encore is across from Fashion Show Mall - several restaurant choices and an ABC store for snacks/drinks to take back to the room. And being easily accessed via skywalk to Pallazo, you have all of the amenities/casino that they offer in easy walking distance. It was a nice 15 minute walk to Ceasars for shopping and show. While Encore is slightly north of Wynn, it's connected by the shopping corridor, so you really just feel that you're at one big resort. SUMMARY Steve Wynn has done it once again with Encore. It has become my top favorite for Las Vegas accommodations. Give them a try while rates are low, because I would expect that prices here will exceed Wynn once everyone realizes you are getting a full suite vs a large room at Wynn. I appreciate that Wynn offers more reasonable food prices in their resort (Sugar & Ice and the cafe near the theaters adjacent to the main Wynn casino) and doesn't force you to go outside of the hotel for reasonable meals. If they will only improve the check-in process, they will have a full 5 star review from me on all accounts.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cLeft a lasting memory. what a great hotel!\u201d", "Author": "miathebee", "ReviewID": "UR25153433", "Content": "The Encore was very impressive right from the start.

The casino is much smaller than the other resorts, but that's OK. It's not as crowded and the decor is beautiful. Take time to admire the $42,000 (per piece) red chandaliers. The rooms! Oh...the rooms. Due to a mix-up with the reservation (the only bad part that happened to us, but can't complain because it was 3 free nights) we spent the first night in a room with one king bed and called for a rollaway. The room is beautifully decorated, the bathroom is huge (just like at Wynn), and the view is breathtaking (ask for a room facing the Strip). The room with two double beds is slightly larger and the \"living room\" isn't sectioned off, but it is more than enough for 4 girls with lots of luggage. The spa is beautiful, although treatments are pricey. The day pass is an affordable $30 and well worth the price if you're seeking a few hours of quiet and relaxation. On the downside, the walls are thin (or maybe sounds reverberates off the marble floors in the entry way), but calls to security are quickly taken care of....either way...having to hear the people next door talk wasn't a deal breaker. The room could use another tv (the tv swivels in the delux rooms with one king bed) because the Palazzo suites all have two tvs, but again, that's not a dealbreaker.

The hotel has either wired or wireless internet for $13 every 24 hours, I needed internet access so had to use this but didn't think it was excessive. It is a bit far out at the end of the strip but now there are walkways to get through the hotel through the Wynn, across the walkway to the Palazzo, into the Venetian etc etc. All the restaurants are quite expensive, I have no desire to pay $110 for a steak or $36 for a fish appetiser, but thats just me. The shops are as expensive in the esplanade, high end designer brands with hoodies starting at $1900.....yes $1900 for a hoodie! My only issues were that due to 'cost cutting' measures as I was told by the concierge, you now don't get the free slippers, you have to request them, you don't get a turn down service unless you request it.

Brown walls with white leather chairs and a mosaic floor. No detail was left unattended. I ordered the beet salad, gnocci, and brussel sprouts. Very strange combination, but these are all of my favortie foods. I think this was the best beet salad I had ever eaten. The gnocci was light and wonderful, but the red sauce was a little sweet. The brussels sprouts were lightly browned and just just right. The rest of our table oohed and ahhed over every bite. We were too full to order dessert, but when the ice cream lollipops arrived, complimentary for being seated late, we devoured them. They were a perfect ending to the meal.

Mixed reviews that we read prior to our stay, along with our first impressions of Wynn, helped lower our expectations. After spending four nights in Wynn's latest creation, we now have a new favorite resort in Vegas! The check-in process could use some work, there are too many connecting rooms (as for a non-connecting one facing South), a casual coffee shop would be nice, and the water pressure could be a bit better; but that's where the criticism ends. The rooms were the nicest we've stayed in anywhere. From the always prompt elevators, to the wide modern hallways, to the spacious suites with views straight down the Strip; ENCORE didn't disappoint! The bed and L shaped couch were extremely comfortable; the swiveling High Def LCD tv was great; the bathroom was large with modern tiling, dual sinks, separate tub/shower/toilet, and a vanity area; and the maid service was excellent. The casino did not disappoint either. The chambered effect and natural light definitely put Encore in a class of its own. Each chambered table area feels like a private casino. The dealers and floor supervisors were all extremely friendly and helpful, and the cocktail service was excellent! We loved the bright red lights throughout the casino, floor to ceiling windows looking out on the pool/garden area, and atrium style ceiling in the entrance near Switch. Encore doesn't have a sportsbook or poker room, but the walk to Wynn through the Esplanade is not too bad. Finally, the pool area looks like it will be a huge draw once the weather warms up. We tried several restaurants and checked out XS...which I'll talk about more below. Restaurants: Cafe Society - Nicely decorated, but the menu is too limited and the prices are too high. Zoozacrackers and the Terrace Cafe at Wynn are better options in my opinion. When we arrived around 3PM they had a very limited menu consisting of only 4-5 choices...that may have been part of the problem. SWITCH - We went here our first night (Valentine's Day). Had our wives not been under the weather, it may have been the best meal of the trip. As many people know by now, the look of the restaurant changes three times each hour. Aside from excellent food, I have to admit the changing \"theme\" of the restaurant actually works and helps set SWITCH aside from its competition at Encore. The caesar salad was excellent and the bone-in NY Strip was one of the best I've had. My friend had the lamb, which he thought was good but not great. Our wives had the Risotto...and both thought it was very good despite not feeling well. BOTERO - We saved this place for our last night, as it was the dinner we were looking forward to the most. We had an 8:30 reservation, but were not seated until 9:15. After mentioning this to the manager on duty, he comped a bottle of champagne...which definitely took the edge off the wait. The restaurant itself is very modern and was packed! The entire floor is tiled and clearly cost quite a bit! Once the weather warms up, the outside patio overlooking the pool will definitely be a big draw. The caesar salad was excellent (one of the best I've had). Our friends raved about their meals (halibut and pepper crusted filet), my bone-in filet was very good (but not to the level of SW, Hanks, or Alize), and my wife's scallops were just ok (they come in a broth which is odd). The dessert cupcakes were also good...but who is really hungry after a salad and steak. XS - What can I say other than wow! Victor Drai has done it again. We stopped in at about 1:30AM on Monday and there was still a wait. Once we gained entry, it's easy to see the resemblance to Tryst! A wide open club with no hidden VIP areas (at least that we could tell). The dance floor was jam packed with a very expensive rotating chandelier above it. The dance floor opens up to a patio that backs up to the pool. There are also patios on each side of the main patio. Javon Walker was hosting a full house the night we stopped by, and his booth was right on the dance floor so that everyone could see he and his friends (Shane Mosley and a few other NFL players) having a great time. Tryst has a waterfall and XS by springtime will have the full pool area with cabanas and blackjack tables. I'd have a hard time recommending one over the other...so I'd probably tell people to drop by and check out both! Drink prices for those that care were pretty high... $8-10 for beer and $12-14 for mixed drinks.", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel I've Stayed at in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "stkkattds", "ReviewID": "UR24848520", "Content": "As the title summarizes, the Encore is one of the most upscale and nicest hotels I have stayed at in Vegas when in comparison to the Bellagio and the Venetian.

Although this was our first stay at the new hotel, we have stayed at Wynn several times in the past few years. The Encore is a beauty in many ways. Parts are visually stunning. Realize, however, that there are about 25% less rooms at Encore than at Wynn, and some things just seem scaled down. The casino area is much smaller, and the pool area seemed to be about half as large. (Hard to get a real feel on a rainy winter weekend.) As at Wynn, the rooms are very well done. Same ultra-comfy mattress and linens, and, at least in the Resort rooms, much the same-sized bathroom with a similar layout.

The chaise sectional in the living room area is comfortable, although not too fancy-more casual, I guess. There was some discussion between my spouse and I as to whether this was truly a suite. She said no, because of the lack of the ability to separate the two rooms completely. For instance, it was hard for one person to sleep in the bedroom area while the other watched TV in the living room area. The casino is smaller, as I said, and completely surrounded by bars and restaurants. Much has been made of the fact that there is a lot of natural lighting in the casino area, but I found it to feel much the same as the Wynn casino. In my opinion, you're just more aware of it because of the scale of Encore. Only had the chance to visit one of the new restaurants. We had lunch at the Society Cafe, and it was very good. Service was spot on and the food we enjoyed was prepared and presented wonderfully. Although we were just across the walkway from the casino, it never seemed to intrude. The Lobby Bar was also a great place to relax and have a liquid refreshment. The staff was all top notch in their performance of their duties; very professional and friendly. Never had to wait long for cocktail service in the casino, and the CWs were very engaging and efficient. Overall our stay at Encore was great. There were a few kinks in the system that still need to be worked out. Like others, we had problems with our keys failing to unlock the room. Luckily, one of the two always worked. The lines at the resort registration area seemed crowded and hectic all day Sunday to well into the evening. Again, we lucked out, as we came in early Saturday morning. They do offer Express and In-Room checkout, and we avoided any lines on checkout that way. Overall, I'd say we were very pleased with our stay at Encore. We would return, but may go back to Wynn instead. I think one tends to forget just how well they do things at both hotels, and, as I said, it might magnify any small problems that others here seem to find so troublesome.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas, USA", "Title": "\u201cPrefer the sister resort Wynn Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "HauntedMansion", "ReviewID": "UR24692208", "Content": "We booked 2 rooms in the Tower Suites as an online package back in December. When we arrived we were politely informed that our rooms were actually located in the Resort Tower, and asked if we would like directions to the Resort check-in. It was only after we provided evidence of our booking confirmation that we were accomodated in the Tower Suites. The lady at check-in desk was very apologetic, but nonetheless it was not a very nice way to start the stay. The rooms were very comfortable as they are next door at the Wynn, but I did not care for the color palette or furniture at Encore. It was very evident that a lot of the design influences came from the Macau property. Our room was VERY beige. The second room in our party was much nicer with black furniture and deep red accents, but oddly the rooms on the north side of the tower are actually smaller than the comparable rooms on the south side - we were told this by the valet when our luggage was delivered, and it was readily apparent when we went in to their room. Even numbered rooms are on the south side. The bathrooms were virtually identical to those at the Wynn, with slight changes (a nice marble shelf that runs through the shower all the way around in front of the sinks, and extremely odd placed sconces in the middle of the mirror. The bedside controls for the drapes and lights are a nice touch, as are the controls in the foyer. No fumbling with awkward \"Do Not Disturb\" placards either, as it is all electronic. The large cabinet which contains the minibar was poorly manufactured in our room. The light inside the cabinet was designed to come on whenever the cabinet door was opened, and go off when the door was closed. However, the contact switch was not properly installed so the light stayed on all the time even with the door closed. It was only noticeable at night. Eventually they might wonder why that bulb gets replaced so frequently. With Encore they made some improvements with noise in the room, but unfortunately they introduced new noise problems. First the pros - there is no longer the outside air vent located at the base of the windows which was the source of much of the noise at the Wynn. Also, they have installed baffles on the bottom of the doors so that when the doors close the baffle lowers and blocks sounds from outside the room. And now the cons, and these are big. The room are very much not sound proof. We could hear the silverware being used in the room next to ours, and at several points could easily hear muffled conversations and the TV through the walls. But the worst is in the bathroom - the vent above the toilet is a direct feed to other peoples world. You could not only hear other conversations through this vent - you could clearly understand every word being said, and it seemed as though someone was literally standing 5' away from you speaking. Completely unacceptable in a resort aiming for 5-stars. I would much rather have the outside air vent noise at the Wynn over hearing people in other rooms at Encore. All that being said, the public areas of the resort were amazing. The amount of natural light was stunning, as was the architecture and furnishings. The casino was very comfortable with nicer tables including a hardwood surface around the edge perfect for keeping your drink stable. Surprisingly, the casino was not smokey at all. After sitting in there for several hours, my clothes did not smell of smoke. At night you can clearly see out the windows to the pool area with almost no reflection.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, Utah", "Title": "\u201cThe Encore is awesome!\u201d", "Author": "butterflygrlUT", "ReviewID": "UR24648587", "Content": "Beautiful views, stylish room and hotel decor.

Prior to booking at the Encore, I read thru all of the reviews posted here, so I wouldn't have been surprised had I experienced any of the issues that some other reviewers here noted. I am happy to report that -- other than the tendency for the bathroom to become a bit warmer than what might be considered ideal -- I have no complaints about my stay. (I think the bathroom might tend to the warm side because there are numerous lights in there, and no independent fan or additional climate control system.) The suite was peacefully quiet -- I never heard any external noise, either in the corridor or thru any vents. The room was very clean, and well stocked with amenities. Housekeeping was prompt when requested (I usually keep my privacy light on when in the room and call for housekeeping when I exit the room.) Every interaction I had with staff at the hotel was positive, from the bell person, to the front desk, to housekeeping, and on out into the gaming area. I don't frequent Las Vegas too often, but I have stayed in the Bellagio & The Four Seasons Hotel. I can't recall having any real complaints about either of those hotels, but I have to say that in my opinion, The Encore has raised the bar when it comes to a luxury property in Las Vegas.

Have to say I will not choose it again for our next Vegas trip. All was fine at first, no line at check-in and we arrived about 9pm. The problem started when they made an error with fantom hotel items charged to my credit card and the staff became quite hostile (just for the record, we did not touch anything in the minibar etc. or take them out for longer than 60 seconds, we are wise to that game). I won't recount the whole story but all I'll say is that the staff need to get their stories straight and accept that they made a mistake instead of accusing me of lying. I was put it a very upsetting situation and they did nothing to help. The room was ok, but a bit small, and yes, the walls were thin. We were woken up 3 nights at 4am by our screeching neighbours. Might as well have been in a motel. The items for sale in the room had a thick layer of dust on them - I wonder why? We walked through to the Palazzo and the Venetian where they had a lot more cheaper eating options. If it's your first trip to Vegas bear in mind that these hotels are ginormous and you will be just 1 or 2 of thousands and thousands of guests, also bring comfy shoes because you will be doing a lot of walking. Also, could the Wynn and Encore PLEASE put some comfortable chairs and couches around the reception area and hallways? I hung around in the lobby waiting 20 minutes for friends and there was nowhere to sit! The only chairs are at the slot machines and tables where it's very smokey.

The Encore was beautiful - the details in the decor, mosaic butterflies in the halls, the opulent chandeliers, the gorgeous red bursts of colour. The rooms were very comfortable, and definitely had a sexy vibe! We gambled mostly at the Wynn - better choice of tables but nothing less than a $10 minimum. Saw one woman win $1,000 at the slots - but mostly quiet at other tables. Drink service was excellent, people were friendly. It was nice to see people dressed up, and you felt like you were somewhere special! We ate at the Wynn Buffet ( a little overpriced $35.00/person), but not unsatisfactory. Compared to other buffet rooms we saw, the Wynn seemed the prettiest and least \"Mall-like\". The cafe was steep - a large coffee and herbal tea ran $8.00!! We loved exploring the hotel and people watching. We recommend doing the express check out from your room - it saves time lining up (you can see your final total on Wynn TV). We asked for a late check out and they gave us till 1pm versus the usual 12pm. Since we had a late flight, the bell desk was happy to hold our luggage until we left for the airport. We saw Elton John and the red piano - great show!! Caesars Palace had a wonderful vibe going on in the evening, lots of sexy women dancing and dealing. The Belaggio fountains were beautiful. The free Big Elvis show at Bill's Gambling Hall and Saloon was fun - not to mention the .99 margaritas. The Imperial Palace casino was drab and unimpressive even if they had $5 tables. The lookalikes dealing and performing were fun. Binions had a wonderful vibe for gambling very comfortable and had nice friendly tables. Freemont Street was a little disappointing - the light show was not very good. The Golden Nugget looked great! Other smaller casinos on Freemont were sleazy but great for people watching. The Palms was very user friendly - a lot of promotions and ways to earn points and gifts - we saw one woman win $100,000 on the slots- lucky her!! The Palms had the best odds for video poker, and obviously the loosest slots. Cab drivers in Vegas were friendly and out to make a buck (ie. going the longer routes to keep the meter up). Overall there was a certain sadness and desperation - people we loosing jobs and money. The recession is probably hitting Vegas very hard. The Deuce bus was an experience - great to see parts of Vegas that we wouldn't normally. Overall a fantastic experience - we would definitely go back to the Encore. The Encore was classy, beautiful, a step above other hotels on the strip, very hospitable, and worth it!!", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellwood, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cElegant Luxury... With A Hip Vibe\u201d", "Author": "B.Hart", "ReviewID": "UR24542210", "Content": "My wife and I recently returned from a stay at the Encore from February 7th to February 11th. This was our eleventh trip to Vegas and the Encore was the 8th hotel we've stayed in. In order from worst to best the other hotels we've stayed at have been Circus Circus, Bally's, New York New York, Planet Hollywood, Treasure Island, Mirage, and The Venetian. And as much as I love The Venetian, I would have to place Encore at the top of this list. From the moment we walked through the door, (which was held open by a very polite doorman), we were impressed. Everyone from the valets and bellmen, to the desk clerks and casino workers, to the security and wait staff, to the multitude of cleaners that we saw constantly cleaning all areas of the hotel, everyone we encountered were the most polite and helpful staff we have ever encountered in our many travels and hotel stays. When we arrived at 8:30 a.m. no rooms that met our preferences (non-smoking king room on a high floor) were ready, so the desk clerk took our mobile number and told us we'd receive a call as soon as a room was ready. We'd never experienced that service before. That allowed us to have breakfast without having to check back on our own. Check-in is 3:00 p.m. and was empty when we arrived although there were at least 3 clerks at the desk. We received a call about 3 hours later telling us we could pick up our key cards and proceed to our room. Our key cards, which had our names printed on them, also doubled as our casino players cards. You keep them after check-out for future visits to the casino even if you don't stay at the hotel. Registration is to the right of the valet area, and the resort elevators are a short walk from there. Encore has a very pleasant scent pumped through the air that really helps to combat the smoke smell of the casino, and from the elevators through all public areas of the resort, there is hip, upscale, but soothing music constantly pumped through the speakers. It is appropriate and not unbearable in any way. You must show your room key to security to access the elevators which are divided into banks of eight elevators each that serve 30 floors per bank. We were on the 35th floor, and we never had to wait more than a few seconds for an elevator going up or down. We were in room E3522 which was the first room to the left across the hall from the elevator bank. The way the hotel is designed there doesn't seem to be a long walk to the elevators from any room on the floor although the ice machines are located at the end of the hall. The room itself was absolutely gorgeous with an upscale contemporary feel. The photos you see really don't do it justice. The door opens to a marble foyer with a wall of mirrors on one side and the bathroom and a large lighted closet on the other. Next to the door is a panel that controls the lights which you can turn on by room (foyer including bathroom and closet, bedroom, or living room), or all at once. The lights, by the way, fade on and off slowly. The panel also has a button that you press to turn on the privacy or make up room lights outside your door. No more privacy cards hanging on the doorknob. There is also a doorbell outside your door that only works if the make up room light is on. The maid presses it to let you know she is about to enter. The bathroom is all marble with a tub and separate shower which has a bench and two shower heads. One head is mounted on the wall with different available settings and the other is a hand-held massaging wand. There is also a double vanity with a large mirror, a lighted vanity mirror area with upholstered seat, lighted shelves under each vanity for towels, a 19\" LCD t.v. in the wall, two spa robes for use during your stay, a digital scale, and a privacy room, with telephone, for the toilet. The closet had plenty of hangers, an extra pillow and blanket, a three-drawer dresser, an iron and ironing board, and a personal no-charge safe. The room itself is nicely appointed in cream, black, and white, are 60 to 105 square feet larger than the Wynn and 50 square feet bigger than the Venetian, and is divided into two areas by a wall that holds a 46\" HD flat screen t.v. that swivels between the sleeping and living areas. Whenever you turn the t.v. on it greets you with a personalized welcome message. Very cool. The sleeping area had two side tables, one held an I-home radio, and the other held a combo alarm clock and room remote that controlled the room lights, the outside privacy light, and the window sheers and drapes. There was also a large cabinet that held the mini bar on one side and an ice bucket, glasses, and a combo corkscrew and bottle opener on the other. There were also snacks on top, but don't touch them! Like the mini bar fridge everything sits on pressure switches that charge you if the item is removed for more than 60 seconds. There is lots of drawer space and a nice feature are the \"no slam\" drawers. You push the drawer to a certain point and the mechanism slowly pulls it in the rest of the way. The living area had more drawer space, a work table with two chairs, a sectional with integrated chaise lounge, a large leather ottoman, a telephone, and a printer/fax hidden in a drawer in the work table. The view we had was the best I'd ever seen. I'm unsure if we were in a regular resort suite or a panoramic suite, but we had a view that spanned from the Wynn golf course to the east, down the south end of the strip, to Trump tower and the mountains to the west. We never had those drapes closed. The climate control was also in the living area. Maid service was constant and we had fresh towels every morning. We had one minor cleaning concern when we arrived, but one call to housekeeping and the problem was handled professionally and quickly. Bed coverings are only replaced after each guest, but if you want your linens replaced every day of your stay you can request it. Unlike many hotels that make you go to the first floor and walk through public areas to get to the pool, you can take the elevator to the 3rd floor to access the private elevator to get to the pool area. The 3rd floor also holds the gym ($30 a day), and the spa. This floor looks, and smells, divine. Although it was chilly outside, the pool was open. There are two pool areas - one a family pool and one a \"European\" pool for adults only. There didn't appear to be a charge to access the adult pool unlike other adult pools in Vegas and cameras are not allowed. The adult pool is separated from the family pool by an archway of bushes, but both have pools heated to 80 degrees and complimentary bottled water and towels. The adult area also has a whirlpool heated to 101 degrees. Both have cabanas that are more than the glorified tents of other hotel pools. These are permanent free standing rooms with patios, and large flat screens on the wall. The pools were smaller than other pools I've seen, but it's not about swimming laps with these pools. It's about relaxing in a luxurious setting. The casino was nicely laid out and easy to navigate. As we gambled, cocktail waitresses came around often and bought drinks quickly. The drinks were not watered down jokes, either. They were good and strong. You can check-out through your t.v. and throughout your stay you can use it to periodically check to see if there are any charges to your room. And although we had no problem, during busy periods the front desk area seemed unorganized. There were plenty of desk clerks, but there was no dedicated system to take care of the next person in line. You just line up behind someone and hope for the best. That's the one negative they should address in the future. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants or visit any of the clubs. Encore has no buffet because they share the Wynn's. Also, the Encore and Wynn are connected by an upscale shopping corridor, but you can easily access the strip from either hotel. Guests at either hotel can enjoy the amenities of the other. Also Encore is in a great location connected to Wynn, and across the street from the Fashion Show mall. The Venetian, Palazzo, Mirage, and TI are close by. In conclusion, Encore is a big, bright, luxurious hotel, both relaxing yet pulsing with life, that perfectly walks the line between hip and elegance. Although open to families, Encore seems to be geared more toward upscale crowds maybe 30 and up. It's my new favorite, and I would emphatically recommend it to everyone.", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cExcellent place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Darkshine629", "ReviewID": "UR24500501", "Content": "Just returned from a 36 hr weekend trip to Vegas with the wife. This is a great hotel to stay in Vegas. Great for couples. Usually travel to Vegas 1-2 times a year and I was very impressed with Encore. Got a great deal online which indicated that we were staying at the Wynn. Front desk said that we would be at Encore. No big deal; they are connected. The room/mini-suite is awesome. The bedside remote control for the lights, drapes and privacy settings is something I wish every hotel would have. Floor to ceiling windows are nice. Love the rotating plasma tv, and found the selection of international channels very interesting. The bed was comfortable but certain people, like myself, have preferences for a firmer mattress and pillows. The bathroom is great. Separate shower and large tub, dual vanities, make-up area and stool for the wife, and privacy toilet are all extremely nice and clean. The towels are very large and comfortable, and the robes are excellent. The only complaint I have about the room is that the doors are heavy. I can imagine that some people would find it difficult to open the front door, bathroom door, or closet doors. We did not have any noise problems. The only restaurant we tried at Encore was Society (due to late arrival and it was the first place we found open at midnight). The food was fine. It's actually more interesting as a place to look into the casino and see the guys checking out the ladies. It's better than any tv show. We ate lunch the next day at Burger Bar at the Mandalay (a favorite of mine - burgers with jalapeno bacon and fried egg are the best), and dinner at Nobu at the Hard Rock. Nobu was pretty good, not great. Had the 100 Omakase dinner. I would say overrated but I would eat there again. Hard Rock is a strange property. So dark, the casino is so small, the poker room is pitch black, and it's so loud everywhere you go, and the front of the hotel is clustered with taxis, limos, cars, etc. Unless you are 21, have a minimum of 7 visible facial piercings and/or tattoos, or are a rockstar, I would not stay at the Hard Rock. Wife went to the Wynn spa (thought we were staying at Wynn). We stopped by the Encore spa to take a look and the outer waiting area was nicer at the Encore spa than Wynn. Wife thought the Bellagio spa overall was better. The Encore pools are very nice -noone was there except for one person in a hot tub. It was a bit cold in February. What is strange is that the main pool and the European pool (topless I assume as a sign says no cameras are allowed in Euro pool) are side by side without any type of barrier. I thought that other casinos section off their topless pools and charge a cover (Rio, Mandalay, Mirage, etc.), which I guess increases the perception that Encore is geared towards adults only. Maybe Encore only charges for cabana rentals, as there are many more private cabanas around the European pool than the regular pool. We walked by Tryst a couple times. It looked like a fun place to be if you're into the club scene. There seem to be a couple different types of lines to get in. Very confusing. I felt bad for the groups of 3-4 guys in line. No way they were getting in. The poker room at the Wynn is very nice. Fun place to play.

One more note....all of us never slept worse anywhere, we all figured we got about 10 hours of sleep over three days, and it was not form lack of trying. Our room was really hot as well. We did visit the spa at the Mirage and would nto recommend it either.

We went to the room and the maid was just finishing up? I thought that was strange. After they were done I put my key card in the slot and it didn't work. So I had my wife wait and I went down to the front desk to fix the problem. No biggie, but no apology. I got back upstairs and my wife said that another couple had said they were in that room! My wife told them they must have had the wrong room and sent them on their way. I tried the key and again, it did not work. I grabbed a maintenance man and they let us in. We were tired and just wanted to get a bite to eat. Once in, we started to get settled. We noticed our slippers were missing so we called the front desk and they brought up a set. There was another knock at the door and it was security asking us to leave there was yet another couple with them! Triple booked the room? No. They gave us the wrong room number. So we picked up and moved. 2 hours. No apology, still. I paid full price for this room just like every other customer in that hotel and just because I am not a high roller, this is how I am treated? Not a real caring staff, I think they need more training in customer service. You may want to give this new hotel some time to work out the issues before you book. The slot machines are not the best, there are not that many tables being worked and all the clubs were closed due to some movie production or something, they didn't even bother to tell us.

Nothing about it screams five star, from the lines at check-in and check-out, to the unhelpful staff and problems with the room. The biggest problem was an extremely noisy fridge that made a long, loud rumbling sound at 15-20 minute intervals. I called maintenance at 7pm before going out at night, requesting that it either be fixed or unplugged (it's impossible to get behind the heavy furniture and do it yourself). When I returned to the room after midnight I saw that it was still plugged-in and a mobile fridge had also been wheeled into the room. Wondering if they had fixed it I went to sleep only to be woken at regular intervals throughout the night by it. I complained in the morning about it but they (at first) denied I had made a call about it the night before and then seemed pretty unconcerned about the matter. They also have problems with the a/c on the 38th floor, it was still baking after setting the thermometer to 59 degrees, if it's like this on a cool, rainy February night then there is no hope for the summer. The bathroom was extremely hot too. Another warning, the rooms are loud, you can hear your neighbors chatting coming through the vents both by the couch area and in the bathroom. I could make out nearly every word of a regular conversation. When requesting an extra half hour to check out I was told it would be another $150 even though the room was not booked for that night, and after the complaint about getting no sleep. Eventually they agreed to a half hour but I would by no means consider this five star service. None of the employees were rude but certainly didn't go out of their way to help, smile or say hello. I would definitely recommend the Signature at the MGM over the Encore, the service and rooms are far superior and the staff seem to genuinely care about your experience. It's also in a better location, the Encore is on the north end of the strip and if you are in a north facing room you will have a depressing view over some parking lots and strip malls and not much else. Also the Signature has a wonderful little cafe and the dining options are far superior to those at the Encore and Wynn. There were hairs in one of the bathroom sinks when I arrived and the alarm clock was set to the wrong time with no instructions on how to change it--minor details, but not what you expect at five star levels and prices. Their website also claims they have turn-down service, this did not happen. The spa at the Encore is beautiful and well worth visiting. But I would recommend staying elsewhere.

I felt the Wynn's decorating was cheesy, and the lobby is a letdown. The Encore is stylish, cool, with alot of flair. The rooms are a bit smaller than they are at the Wynn, but much more comfortable. It feels more like a resort. I love the colors and the thematic styling. It feels very stylized without being overtly trendy. I was really taken by the attention to detail, and its a shame that Wynn and company just can't seem to get the Vegas hotel/resort/casino correct. This type of stylized hotel is really amazing, and its kind of shame that they wasted the chance to really break away from the typical Vegas casino formula. Steve, hire a guy (me), to give you some tips, as I have stayed at every casino/hotel in Vegas multiple times. My main complaint with Encore is the Casino being placed right upon entry. When will the Las Vegas hoteliers catch up with the tastes of the american public, this is not 1950 anymore. If you want to be classy and set yourself apart, make the Casino more of a seperate room with a grand entry, rather than the stupid notion that you want people to drop 5 bucks in a slot machine on the way to their room or a restaurant. If people want to gamble they will go to the casino. This theory of casual gambling belongs in a bygone era, or at some lesser hotel/casino. For Steve Wynn to allow this is a travesty, and I question his ability to design the perfect resort/hotel/casino. This isn't just my beef with Steve Wynn, but all of the casino hotels on the strip. Though the casino at the Encore is beautiful and very nicely appointed, it just reminds you that you are in Vegas, and not a 5 star resort. I gambled for several hours at the casino, and it seems odd the way its laid out. Regardless, I had fun, and I was very impressed with the hotel, and it is one of my new favorites. Better than the Wynn, but it still hasn't taken the notion of a top quality resort/casino/hotel to its full potential. That formula is still missing from the strip and I don't see any current build out that has gotten it yet. The Hotel at Mandalay, was a close shot to this theory, but it lacks the imagination that the Encore has. The Hotel lacks where the Encore succeeds, and that is people watching. The Encore is excellent for this sport, but again, they could have done it better. I ate at the Botero one evening and the meal was excellent. I felt the staff was a bit rushed, and felt that they were swooping in and trying to turn the table quickly. The place was filled with beautiful people, and I'm sure this will be one of the top hotels to be seen at. As a side note, and it goes as one of the top qualities of the Encore... the staff was amazing and very friendly and helpful. Only one note, since the pit bosses, dealers, etc. are recylcled from one casino to another, they really need to put them through customer service training. I'm always shocked at the patronizing and often rude behavior of dealers and pit bosses to the gambling consumer. They may do it day in and day out but the consumers are most often there for just a few days, and not always aware of the proper etiquette or rules around the table. Remember people are their to have fun, and should be treated as such.

Even after we called and specifically asked that housekeeping come, they didn't bother to show! I have had better service at a Motel 6. 2) And when housekeeping did actually show up, they left an OPEN, USED BOTTLE OF WATER, \"Compliments of Encore\" on the table (next to a brand new bottle). The seal of the bottle had been opened and at least 1 inch of water had been consumed by a prior guest! This was NOT our bottle from the prior night; we finished those. The implications of this are unspeakable. I shudder to think about what other things Encore may be re-using to save money. 3) Many things were missing from our minibar when we got to the room. I was concerned that we would be charged. I called the front desk to ensure that we were not charged. They said that housekeepking would come up and re-fill the minibar. I said, fine, but that we would be leaving in an hour and asked if they could come back at that time. The front desk told me to call back in an hour. Not a huge deal, but why should I have to waste my time calling back? Also, to add insult to injury, for the rest of our stay, the minibar was never replenished (although I did specifically go to the front desk to tell them they could go up and to confirm that we were not being charged). 4) During our stay, we had countless problems with Internet access. Wifi never worked, and we spent at least 90 minutes trying to get it working. 5) They couldn't get our newspaper preferences right, even after we asked several times.

They'd emailed us specials, and we wanted to try out the new Encore hotel. We got reasonable rates...$129/night weekday, $159/night weekend. We had reservations requesting non-smoking adjoining rooms for the Wynn, and confirmed these requests via email and telephone several times. Upon checkin, our rooms weren't ready for over an hour. We were told that they wouldn't promise us adjoining rooms since it is \"merely a preference and not a guarantee\" (exact words) even though it's what we reserved. We did finally get them though. When the rooms were ready, we went back and got our keys and finally settled in. Endless banging from construction directly above both Wynn rooms forced us to complain (there was nonstop fast hammering from what we theorize was carpet installation). They explained that the construction was only supposed to occur that particular day from 7am - 3pm. By 5:00pm, it was still going strong. We finally insisted that they move us, and found out that the work was not complete and would continue at 7:00am the next morning. We moved by 5:35pm and it was still noisy with plenty of banging. Weak apologies, no upgrades, nothing to compensate us, not even a basket of fruit. Over in the Encore, (which is supposed to be the newer and higher class hotel) the room and hallway was pretty but the service was TERRIBLE! The housekeeping staff the first night was good - the housekeeper Milagro was pleasant and friendly and a fellow NY'er to boot!). Unfortunately for us, she must have had the next few days off because the next 3 nights were absolutely terrible. They tossed the pillows onto the couch instead of leaving them on the beds...what was the purpose?!?! They took all of our belongings, shoes, boots, clothing, etc. and tossed those onto the couch too. We're not slobs, we had things on hangers on doorknobs and others draped over the desk chair. Things weren't on piled on the floor preventing them from vaccuuming or anything (except for boots & shoes, which belong on the floor!) There was a layer of clothing, then shoes, then more clothing on top. All of our clothing was now dirtied by being mixed with the shoes. Totally unneccesary and rude. To add insult to injury, the remaining 3 days we had no turndown service. No slippers, no chocolates, no beds made. In fact, they even TOOK our slippers away from us. (We had 2 pairs given to us the first night, we brought 2 of our own in from the other rooms) After the second night, all but one pair were gone and were never replaced. The one pair that was left was thrown underneath the nightstand --- literally thrown under... It took 3 days to fix a loose toilet seat. The tub was not cleaned. There was a hooker in the Encore elevator who was solicited by 2 guests right in front of my husband and my sister's boyfriend...hello? security??? They charged us over $60 for 3 mini-bar items that we did not take. (their policy is if you move something for more than 60 seconds, it automatically charges your bill, but we didn't even touch or look at them!!!). In 40 degree weather, we have absolutely no use for a suncare kit, nor would we ever listen to or want a \"Wynn Musical CD,\" or pay $8 for a snack. Thursday, Friday & Saturday night the music from the club downstairs was really loud. (we were on the 23rd floor and could hear it all) Luckily for us, we were out late ourselves those nights and returned exhausted after 4am and had no problems going straight to sleep...but if you were an early or light sleeper, too bad for you. Back at the Wynn, they jacked up the price of their buffet from $14.99 to $30.99 per person for brunch for the Chinese New Year...and it was not good, choices were limited, some stuff looked like it came out of a can - and honestly are eggs & breakfast meats, congee and stirfry really worth that kind of money? I don't think so. Plus they added 18% gratuity automatically. We did go back the second night for dinner (but only because we had a couple comps from an awesome pitboss named Brian) and their reputation was redeemed... I definitely recommend the dinner buffet, but save your money and skip the brunch. At checkout time, the lines were ridiculously long because they didn't have video checkout available, so every guest was standing on line to checkout by 12:00pm. When my husband argued the excess charges, they told us to take it up with the credit card company! Seriously?!?! Considering the economic recession, you'd think that they would treat and accomodate their guests better. (especially since 7 of us gambled and all lost quite a bit of money there). You would think that they would want to make us happy since half of us were repeat guests and gamblers. Granted we're not high rollers and we got a good room rate, but for the amount of money they'd normally charge and the reputation they're trying to maintain, their service was just poor and disgusting. I'll go back to the Venetian from now on, or even Treasure Island who once comped our stay since we gambled a lot there. We plan on writing a letter of complaint to the company.

The attraction was that the hotel is new, and touted as a 5-star. Having stayed at the Wynn just after it opened, we thought we knew what to expect. And to a certain extent that was true. The suite, save for the decoration, was identical to the Wynn, which meant it was lavish and comfortable. We weren't crazy about the decor, but, hey, that's merely personal taste. If you get a view room of the strip, it's a joy to look out from the huge floor to ceiling window. But a warning. Get a room on the right side of the building (facing the strip) because otherwise part or all of your view will be obstructed by the Wynn. Now for the real problems. The biggest one is that Mr. Wynn cut some corners this time. For example, the air conditioning unit. At some point, everyone has stayed in a motel where the air conditioning turns on, blowing cold air into the room, then turns off when the temperature is reached, only to turn on again when it gets warm in the room again. I never imagined I would experience that at a supposed 5-star hotel. But instead of a constant flow at a chosen temperature, that's what you got at the Encore. There's worse. The unit is set into a wall by the windows. So the living area is cooled to the temperature set. But there is no vent in the bedroom, which stays much warmer much longer. To get a decent night's sleep, we had to set the temperature to 62 degrees, and I still had to sleep only under the sheets. Another big problem with the Encore. It is connected by a long walkway to the Wynn. Want to eat breakfast in a room that doesn't overlook the gambling area? You have to trek to the Wynn. Want to eat at the buffet? Start walking. Want to play poker? Sorry, that room is in the Wynn, too. If you're young and fit, you probably won't even notice the hike. But if you're a little older or get fatigued more easily, that walk starts to turn into a Death March. And finally, the Encore is at the extreme end of the quality strip hotels. If you want to try your luck at the Venetian or even the Mirage, that's no big deal. It isn't that far to walk.

Encore offered us a great deal. Our room was considerably smaller than the penthouse suite we usually get at Bellagio, plus, we had to get an additional room for our babysitter, which was a duplicate of our \"suite\". The suite was pretty small... you can see pics that other people posted...same room, basically... but, really, seriously, very comfy. I was a little concerned having our 7 year old with us, we usually get a separate room.. but, the \"baby\" suite was fine, besides, our son kicks one of us (my husband) out of bed at some point during the night so he can sleep in our bed, and my husband had no problem sleeping on the sofa, which he said was incredibly comfortable. But, the thing I loved about Encore (Wynn) was the boutique feel. Very nice and cozy. I can't wait to go back. Though, I have to admit, I preferred the larger suite we had last time we were there with the massage room. But, this being the first time we've had a regular sized suite, I still really enjoyed it. We did head over to Bellagio to take our son and babysitter (his kindergarten teacher's assistant!) to see \"O\" and were blown away by the crowds.

Of course, you can't beat the restaurants at any of the upper scale hotels in the area. The food at Encore was incredible. We usually ordered room service in the AM and the Eggs Benedict had the PERFECT hollandaisse sauce. Being a foodie, and a cook, I truly appreciated it. And my skinny minny son, who LOVES and devours sushi LOVED the asian restaurant.

The last straw was when we checked in at 11 p.m. (after a VERY long flight) and one group in our party was given the most disgustingly messy room that I have ever seen. Newness and luxury don't mean squat to me at midnight when I want to sleep and it looks like someone threw a bomb in my room. I went downstairs and complained. The aloof \"front desk manager\" said she would take care of it. Mind you, this is a $300+ a night room. After much insistence due to our inconvenience she offers me a $50 dining credit. $50???!! At the Wynn Encore??! So I can buy what, a cup of coffee and some toast? And mind you, she didn't even offer... I had to prod her. The situation is not about the money... if I was looking for \"value\", I wouldn't be at the Wynn Encore. It was about receiving superior service, which we did not. We flat out refused the dining credit... we told her she could keep it. We went out to dinner and when we got back (SEVERAL hours later) the bed had been made, but the bathroom was still disgusting with used soaps, etc. Well, the front desk was called and after going ballistic, the party was given a new room and a $200 dining credit. The credit was nice... but this SHOULD NOT be happening at a hotel of this caliber!!! We should not be roving through a hotel like gypsies at 1 a.m. because we have to repack and move because the front desk and housekeeping seem to be functioning on two different planets. On the plus side, the employees of the hotel were wonderful... very nice and helpful. The service and attitude of the servers in the restaurants were wonderful. But that front desk NEEDS to get it together... it's a fiasco! All in all, we had a nice time because we are able to roll with the punches, but I can say that a very special birthday celebration was ruined due to the lack of customer service and care that we received from the front desk. They acted like they just didn't care... and the way that we were treated by them brought the point home. Mr. Wynn should spend less money of fabulous draperies and golden tassles and invest more in customer service training for his front line staff. Don't know about the rest of my party (it was six people in separate rooms) but as far as I am concerned, I will NEVER return to the Wynn Encore again!!!!

I have never stayed at the Wynn itself, and the only comparable Las Vegas hotels in which I have stayed are The Venetian and Mandalay Bay. Simply put, staying at Encore was the best hotel experience I have ever had in my many trips to Las Vegas (it made The Venetian seem like a Holiday Inn in comparison). Everyone at Encore was extremely friendly and all provided top-notch customer service. From the valets, to the registration clerks, to the housekeepers, to the security staff, I was always greeted with a smile, and made to feel very much at home at Encore. The room itself was incredible, with plenty of space, a very comfortable bed, lots of closet space, and a huge bathroom. I loved the high-tech amenities such as the 42\" LCD with HD, the iPod dock/alarm clock, and the bedside control panel (which operated the lights, the drapes, and the 'Do Not Disturb' doorsign for the room). I did not eat at any of the restaurants at Encore, but did have a couple of meals at the Wynn buffet during my stay. I will do a separate review of the buffet, but let's just say that it certainly is one of the best -- if not THE best -- buffet on the Strip. I played mostly slots at Encore, and had very good luck on one particular quarter machine. It being Inaguration Week, I played \"Stars and Bars' and was rewarded with some nice-sized jackpots more than once. I also earned enough points for two more free Wynn buffets, which I plan to use on my return trip this summer. In addition, the cocktail service was impeccable, and the cocktail servers themselves were knockouts! Nothing better than being served a qualtiy adult beverage, by a beautiful woman, while actually winning some money in Vegas! :-) Granted, this stay was free, but I would have no problem paying for a room at Encore.

Also, the casino does not have the overbearing sense of smoke everywhere as do other casinos in the area. Disagree: The employees here ARE extremely helpful and everyone is first-class. Bags were brought up to the room within 15 minutes of calling the Bell Desk. Previous posters must have stayed when the hotel was new.

We were a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews on this site. After returning from our trip, we have decided there are (2) possible explanations for the mixed reviews we have seen: 1) We have low expectations. I don't believe this to be the case, but how else to explain some of the comments I've seen. We are fairly well traveled (esecially to Vegas with over 20 trips to this town) and we have never stayed at a more beautiful hotel in Vegas. I will give you that we are perhaps not as picky as some people, but I think we have pretty realistic expectations for a 5 star property and Encore met all of them. 2) YMMV. (your mileage may vary) We did not hear anything from our \"neighbors\". I'm not saying that it wouldn't happen. Only that our stay was very quiet and we did not hear anything from the hallway or the rooms next door. We also did not hear anything from the nightclub, but we were on the side that faces \"downtown\". By the way, that view is just fine. The service we received from the dealers to the waitresses to the front desk was great. We checked in within 5 minutes, tops. Yes, it was a little strange not having the zigzag 'rope line\" to herd everybody to a specific place. But, shouldn't we welcome the fact that we are not being herded into a line? There is enough of that at the airpoort and the restaurants. A little common courtesty for your fellow man and the process works just fine. If someone was there before you, they are first. If someone arrives after you, you are first. Pretty simple concept. Overall, we had no complaints with the service we received. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Enough has been said about the rooms. Everything I read is accurate. They are absolutely beautiful and the beds are very comfortable. For my money, I didn't even mind paying $6 for a beer out of the fridge because you would have to pay that if you walked downstairs anyway. Granted, if you were gambling, then it would not cost you anything except the tip but there were times where we just didn't want to gamble. If I had one complaint, I would have to say that not comping drinks while you play video poker at the bar is it. The Encore & Wynn did lose quite a bit of our gambling business during the morning and afternoon for this reason. We simply went over to TI and had a couple bloody mary's and played there. We expect to walk an abnormal amount when we go to Vegas anyway so the location has no bearing on our decision. It is within (10) minutes of Venetian, TI, Mirage, and maybe (15) minutes to Ceasar's. In our minds, staying at Encore is very similiar to staying at Mandalay Bay and utilizing the free tram to get part way to Bellagio, Paris, Caesar's. etc. The only difference is no tram. However, the walking is about the same. Unfortunately, it was too cold for the pool but we did walk through the areas and they look like it would be a blast during warmer weather. Can't wait to go back and experience. Overall, this is now our favorite in Vegas. I just don't think you can beat the overall ambience, \"newness factor\" and the rooms themselves.

Check in was terribly long, no discernable lines so people bunch up and float around. As an invited guest I stood beside a sign saying Invited Guest Check In, but even here people jumped to the counter in front of us from other bunches. Once at the counter it took quite a while still, but the system is new and I am sure they are still working out the kinks. The room was beautiful, spacious, very clean. Just inside the entry is a panel on which you can turn on all the lights with one button, or just the lights in the bedroom or foyer - you can also turn on a Do Not Disturb which lights up a panel outside your room rather than hanging a sign on the door -- neat, but unreliable and our room was entered by housekeeping when we had engaged the privacy button which seems to have disengaged itself. The walls are painfully thin, especially in the bathroom and by the window, and we could clearly hear the conversation of two men in the room next door, including that one was \"constipated\" and \"needed more fiber\" and other things throughout the evening too x-rated to post here. This really, really hurt the \"Five Star Hotel Experience\" Wynn Resorts promise and ruined our sleep until I turned the HVAC on high fan which made loud enough white noise to hide the words of our neighbors. This fact, more than all others, soured our whole visit to this property. The TV is on a swivel between the living room and bedroom, and it is positioned well for viewing from the bed but not well at all to view from the sofa. No big deal, we only had the TV a little and were not in Vegas to watch TV in the room. The resort itself is a nice addition to Wynn and connected to it well, but Encore is brighter and a bit smaller with large windows in the casino looking out on the pool and gardens. Had quite a bit of luck at the machines, and the cocktail service was top notch. Le Reve is well worth seeing, but our dinner at Bartolotta was less then stellar. 3 bland prawns were $60, and a very tiny filet that was not even as good as Chili's was $50, and with a couple drinks and tip the total was $200. Emeril's at MGM is a much better fish place, and their steaks are awesome as well. On our last day our flight was not leaving until 8pm, so I contacted the front desk about checking out at 6pm. They offered this option to me for the \"half day rate\" of $150 -- however as an invited guest I was paying only $149 per night and mentioned this to the woman on the phone, but she said $150 would still considered my half day rate. In actuality 6 extra hours would be a quarter day which should have cost me an extra $37.25, but I would have gladly paid the true half day rate of $75, but I would not pay $150 to leave my items in the room for 6 hours. Luckily the bell desk minded our luggage during this time for the bargain price of two $5.00 tips.

I travel extensively throughout the world as part of my profession and have been fortunate enough to stay at some of the best hotels in the world but can categorically state that both the Encore and the Wynn Hotel (previously stayed there 6 times) are an experience not to be missed. There are a lot of great hotels on the Vegas Strip such as The Four Seasons and Bellagios, both of which I have previously stayed at and are equal to the Encore and the Wynn in stature and luxury. However the thing that separates the Wynn from these and all the other hotels I have stayed at is the staff and standard of customer service which quite frankly is unprecedented. They cannot do enough for you and really go out their way to make you feel genuinely welcome and appreciated. The whole Wynn experience is unique. All the staff I spoke to genuinely felt they were part of the Wynn family and certainly the way that we were treated during our stay was amazing. To cap the whole experience and during the first couple of days of my stay I was informed by a couple of members of staff that Steve Wynn regularly walks through the hotel and has a look around on a regular basis. I personally witnessed this and indeed met briefly with Mr Wynn and his business partner Scott. We had a brief discussion with reference to my stay and he was genuinely interested and caring about any comments I had. I do not know any other hotel of this stature where the owner can be so easily approached. This together with many other aspects of my stay made the Wynn experience a truly memorable occasion.

There were people everywhere and there were some semi lines but nothing real organized. I did have someone ask me if I was there on an offer and when I said yes they sent me to invited guest check in which had a smaller unorganized line however I still waited about twenty minutes. Now it could have been due to time of day because several other times I went by the desk there was no line however the Wynn is pretty much the same way. The room itself it brand new and beautiful with a different color scheme then the Wynn and a wall in the middle with a HDTV that you can turn toward the living area or the bedroom area so as far as the room goes for comfort etc I was very happy. Also I encountered no customer service issues while I was there as some other people have. My room was always clean etc. Now for the preference part. The Encore is quite a distance from the Wynn not a long distance and it does have its own entrance but it is still a hike from one lobby to the other and up to your room. I had a friend at the Palazzo and when we split up every evening and I headed back to my room I had to walk over the bridge from the Palazzo to the Wynn, through the Wynn down the walkway of shops through the Encore to the elevators to my room. It was kind of a pain. TheHotel at Mandalay Bay was built right next door to Mandalay Bay so it is convenient to go to either property and it is not such a giant pain at the Encore that I wouldnt recommend the hotel however what I would say is this, if you have a choice between the two and have friends somewhere else on the strip stay at the Wynn and if you are on your own stay at the Encore.

A gentleman at the front desk directed us to the shortest line for check-in. I had called ahead and requested two queen beds. The young lady at the desk told us that there were very few of these rooms and none were available, but she would put us on a list for the next day.

The Hotel Lobby and Casino are done in red and white with Butterflys and dragonflies and are lovely, as are the gardens and pool area. Crystal dragon and Peacocks are stunning. We stopped at a wonderful lounge and were seated by the pool windows. The cocktail waitress was terrific. We sat for several hours, just enjoying drinks and the late afternoon.

Our entire stay was great. Everyone we encountered that worked at the Encore were absolutely wonderful. A problem with the staff was a non issue. Everytime were took out our car, we were asked if we needed directions. On return we were greeted with a welcome back, by both valets and doorman.

The decor and look is the same as the Wynn which is expected since they are connected, but the Encore has a more intimate and less smokey casino floor which I liked. Yes, check-in does take a while, but I've yet to find any large Strip hotel where it takes less than 10 minutes (and most of them are moving towards this \"no line, free-for-all\" method of checking in at the desk). Check-in was efficient and polite. The room was larger than expected and of course, very nice with the automated lighting and drape features and the semi-separate living room area with the swivel LCD TV. The beds were comfortable and the linens clean as was the bathroom which had a nice separate soaking tub (although it didn't seem as large as some of the other hotels). As noted by some, the walls are very thin and I did hear both my neighbors partying next door as well as when others were showering etc. but again I think that's common in Vegas where they try to build big, fast and cheap. Didn't take advantage of many of the restaurants/bars in the hotel as it was a one night stay except that I dined at the Terrace Cafe next door at the Wynn where I had a good meal (with large portions) in a nice setting overlooking the pool area.

We were slow to warm to Encore ... the service hiccups did not faze us because we did not expect perfect operations in the hotel's first month ... we eventually became accustomed to the RED throughout ... we learned to appreciate what Encore provided rather than focus on what it was missing. By the end of our stay we LOVED the chambered casino, finding it much less crowded, noisy, and smoky than any other casino. The walk to Wynn for the buffet and casual dining was effortless; that same walk at night was VERY entertaining with the crowd milling around Encore's club, \"XS\" \"Sinatra\" was our favorite restaurant - we will definitely return; superior food and service at a \"reasonable\" price. We enjoyed \"Switch\" and although the food was excellent, we have now seen the restaurant \"transformation\" and it's not really a draw for a repeat visit. The spa is over-the-top beautiful and we heard rave reviews of all treatments. The workout facilities looked great, but I'll spend that daily $40 in the casino.

We booked anyway because we really enjoyed our stay last year at the Wynn. If you like the Wynn, you will like Encore. Yes, check-in is slow - but our check-in process was considerably faster than when we checked in at the Wynn (which has a truly awful front desk). We had no problems and were able to get our room right away. The room was very large, and clean. The bathroom was great. Everything is automated and very modern. The bed and sheets are extremely comfortable. We were on the 22nd floor and had no problems with noise. We had no problems with Encore service. We had problems with the safe in our room and within seconds of calling the front desk, we had security in our room who fixed it right away. The cleaning service was efficient and unobtrusive. And even the coffee bar in the lobby was efficient and we were able to get our morning coffee and croissant in the shortest amount of time. Yes, it is an extra 3-5minute walk anywhere. This was not a problem for my husband and I. We are both heathy enough to walk 5 minues. I dont know if I would stay here with an elderly parent, or young child. If we were going anywere, we found taxi service from the front of Encore to be quickly available - no lines, no wait. Location was not an issue for us. I certainly liked the proximity to the fashion mall! The drink service in the casino was excellent, as were the free drinks (I recommend the bloody marys). We are not big gamblers but managed to rack up enough points for 2 free buffet meals. We had those for sunday brunch at the wynn - EXCELLENT. Highly recommended. I cannot comment on the spa or fitness center, we actually chose to go to Qua at Ceasar's for our massages (also recommended). It was too cold for the pool, although the area is really pretty and will be great in the summer. As for our next visit, between Wynn and Encore - I may prefer Wynn, just because it is where most of the action is. But, the rooms at Encore help make up any difference.

The Encore was beautiful! We asked for a high floor at the time of check in & got it. Our room was ready for us, a King nonsmoking. I did have to wait awhile in line at check-in, but no big deal. There were a lot of people to watch & talk to, and you could look around and check out the new hotel. Our room was ready at 1p.m. and we were able to check in watch the Charger game which was starting soon. We are from San Diego, and were really hoping the room was ready so we could relax and watch the game. The room was great with a beautiful view of Downtown Las Vegas. A huge window to look out of. The T.V. was the perfect size, and had beautiful high definition color. It swiveled around to the front sitting area, which had a nice couch & also an office desk with a fax machine and hookups for your laptop. The bathroom was beautiful with robes provided for your use while staying in the room, also slippers were provided. Bathroom amenities were really nice with shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, q-tips, cotton balls, etc. There is a night light you can turn on, which just provides soft lighting underneath the sinks. This was great for me to be able to see when I get up during the night to use the bathroom. While my husband watched the football game, I went downstairs to check out the casino & lounges. I found a nice bar-lounge that served some food. I got a great place to sit, right in front of the big-screen T.V. and ordered a small cheese sandwich & salad. I got excellent service and stayed there a long time, only drinking ice water (not Perrier). The waitresses were beautiful, as someone else mentioned on their review. The girls were young, and looked great in their short dresses...looking like models. So refreshing to see, compared to some other hotels who hire anyone. I remember going to the Hilton and seeing some really old women as cocktail waitresses (didn't look good at all). I had fun gambling in the casino too. I loved playing Steve Wynn's 1cent Megabucks game where you spin the wheel above. Also, I won three times on the Mr. Woo game which was nearby. I won the big top jackpot three times in the same night just by switching around to different machines. Also, the Wizard of Oz machine there is good, and is just 1cent.

Although we had read some of the negative reviews that commented on poor service, we were curious to see whether the Encore would deliver and went ahead with our booking. I am glad that we did, as we not only did not experience any shortcomings in service, but were in fact consistently impressed by the efficiency and friendliness of all the staff. It is safe to say that if the Encore did have any teething troubles, these are well and truly left behind now. We booked a room a in the Tower Suites, and found the room to be gorgeous. As opposed to the smaller rooms in the Wynn, here all rooms are suites with a separate lounge area. As in the Wynn, one wall is glass from floor to ceiling, giving you brilliant views of the Strip at night. Additionally, one of the internal walls in both the lounge and bedroom areas is fully mirrored, increasing the feeling of light and space. The design is more grown-up than the Wynn, with more subtle muted colors. However, the feeling of luxury is absolute, and the finish everywhere is impeccable. The bathroom is spacious and has both a shower and tub. The room has a large lcd which cleverly swivels to face either the bedroom or lounge. The bed is supremely comfortable, and is a true bliss to sink into after a hard day of gambling or shopping. The in-room dining service is very efficient, and eating with a great view from your room is certainly a good option. However, we found the quality of the food to fall somewhat short of the brilliant dining options that Vegas now has to offer. Although certainly quite decent, the food was just ordinary (apart from the heavenly cheesecake!). In this respect, unless you are too tired to go to one of the restaurants downstairs, we wouldn't recommend ordering in. The Tower Suites have a separate check-in area, and we never had to wait (although the hotel was at full capacity when we were there). There is security at the entrance from the casino and I was always asked to show my room key before being allowed in. There is additional security in front of the lifts, which makes previous comments about stolen property from the room seem odd. Overall, the Encore is a fantastic epitome of the Vegas luxury. Although I still find the Wynn a supremely beautiful hotel, I prefer the Encore rooms as these are larger. Oh, and finally, to the remarks that this hotel is miles away from everything. Yes, it is at the end of the Strip, but it only really takes about 15 minutes to walk to Caesars palace (you can walk through the Wynn, and then the Palazzo and Venetian, so its quite a pleasant stroll).

Well, all I can say is YES! I used to think that Bellagio was still the best resort on the Las Vegas strip, well, Steve Wynn has really outdone himself this time. I booked a Panaramic view suite, the top ten floors of the tower, I forgot to ask for a strip view, but was impressed with the other side of the hotel. The building is curved so you have a great view wherever your room is. Every single employee I interacted with had a huge smile on their face, and were super energetic and helpful, from the greeter at the front door, to the Concierge, and even housekeepers. I spent three hours at the Spa and more money than my room, and loved every minute. My massage therapist 'Devon' was a very talented young man with a great spirit, I recommend him highly. The waterfall showers were a nice touch in the men's spa. My room was opulent, and the HD tv swivels so you can watch it from in bed or in the living area on the couch. I had dinner at 'Sinatra' and had the most succulent Maine lobster I've ever had. Try the 'Sinatra Smash' cocktail for a refreshing berry drink. Room service the next morning was perfect, the eggs over easy exact, the toast still hot when it arrived. I had the 'Earl Grey Mar tea ni' at the lobby bar and loved it. This hotel is full of the most attractive cocktail servers I've ever seen. Each one of them could be fashion models or soap stars. The glamourous days of Las Vegas are still alive at alive at Encore. Steve and Elaine Wynn have been able to recapture the elegance of Las Vegas, in the way that only they seem to know how to do. In 1998 when Bellagio opened it was the place to see and be seen. Bellagio, though still a great hotel, seems old and tired. If you want to feel good about yourself you need to book Encore.

In December Encore (Wynn's other hotel/casino) sent a deal with complimentary nights and free play so we decided to give it a try for a night. After parking, we went to check in (around 3 or 4 pm). Lines were long, and quite literally Not moving...at all. We stood in line, in the same exact spot, without moving for around 30 minutes. It was really unacceptable.

The concierge escorted us to our elevators (nice touch). Every employee that we encountered was very helpful, just check in lines were S-L-O-W. We stayed on the 14th floor.

I had requested a non-smoking room, and upon checking in, the front desk specialist noticed that I had accidentally been put in a smoking room. She immediately corrected the problem and gave me a room on the 61st floor with the South ship view. This small gesture went along way. The rooms were simply fantastic. The only complaint was the fact that you could hear conversations in other rooms. I'd like to see them address this problem. I loved the fact that the casino and main floor floor was SO SMALL and manageable. This is hands down the best feature of the Encore. The casino's in virtually ever other hotel are just massive and way too big. and you're constantly getting lost. The Encore allows you to pass through the casino the restaurants or Esplanade in under 2 minutes time. It was great! I had rented a car too and parking was awesome. It was always easy to find parking spots right near the elevators. The walk was again 2 minutes from parking garage to elevators. Very convenient. Most importantly, it never felt overly crowded in the Encore. I don't know how anyone can like staying in the Bellagio, Venetian or Palazzo. These placed were mobbed on Wednesday and Thursday nights with wall to wall people bumping into each other!! Also, the fact the Encore attempts to have smoking ONLY in the casino area (or in your room) is a good idea. This limited the brutal smoke smell in other areas of the hotel. My wife loved the Spa, as well. I know a lot of people don;t like the fact that the Encore is towards the end of the strip, but I loved that fact. It keeps the walk through crowds to a minimum. You could still be at the Palazzo or across the street at the Fashion Show mall within 10 minutes. All in all, it was a great stay.

The hotel officially opened on December 22, 2008, and we checked in on Sunday, January 4, 2009, staying three days. Encore has its own entrance and street just past the Wynn with yet another separate entrance for Tower Suites. We booked two adjoining Resort rooms (one king, one queen double) at what can only be considered an astronomically fantastic opening rate of $179 per night per room, with a $50 dining credit per room. I seriously doubt that anyone will ever see rates like that at Encore again. Without going on and on and on about the decor, I can only say that if you ever get to stay in brand new hotel, definately do it. Everything is so...new! I mean, it is really beautiful in that Las Vegas over-the-top way. The theme is red, with butterflies adorning almost every surface you can imagine. The rooms are huge, and quiet: ours had views of the Wynn, and and the Wynn golf course. There is absolutely nothing \"gimmicky\" about this property. It is simply a beautiful, luxururious hotel intent on - of course - keeping you at the property to spend your money on gaming, shopping and dining. And considering the fact that it is connected to the original Wynn, and connected by bridge to the Las Vegas Fashion Show, it's hard - almost difficult - to find a reason to leave. As a matter of fact, the only reasons we ever left was to see a couple of shows, and a tour Hoover Dam. As with any new hotel, though, it had its share of problems, but surprisingly, it was all with the staff - not the facility. Check-in and check-out is a nightmare. There is a single desk with maybe 8 to 10 clerks working it, but no perceivable line. You are supposed to know -somehow- automatically, that there is an employee floating around the check-in, taking down your name, and assigning you to a clerk. Woe be unto you if you don't realize this, and simply step into an existing line. Because you will be summarily and peremptorily removed and told to wait at the rear of the check-in area until this mysterious employee decides you can move forward. Housekeeping was called an inumerable number of times for many things: lack of the room being cleaned, lack of turn down service (after being repeatedly requested) lack of amenities, towels, etc. Typical housekeeping problems, but, on the bright side, the housekeeping staffers themselves were absolute gems and always had a smile and a great attitude. We had in-room dining three mornings in a row and it was great. On time, hot, and not one single problem with the order. In general, the staff issue can be summed up this way: we never, ever had a problem with the gaming staff, dining staff, housekeeping staff, shops staff, etc. The problem seems to be with the front of house staff: the front desk, and the \"concierge\" desk. Perhaps they were just overwhelmed. I don't know but, Encore really needs to \"fix\" the check-in/check-out process. I went down to the front desk at 830am on our check-out day to get our bills printed out, and then proceeded to spend approximately 30 minutes at the desk, then another hour on my own trying to figure out who owed what, what belonged on what bill/folio, and then attempting to get the charges moved, or in a couple of cases, removed. Another issue seems to be that if you don't know exactly who to ask a certain question, you get a complete and utter blank stare, or foisted off on another department, or even worse - they say they will take care of it, then they never do. In summary: Las Vegas is not my cup of tea, but luxury hotels are. Steve Wynn has set a new standard, and time will tell what the room rates will settle out to be. It's another case of \"is this the right hotel for me?\" With so many options in Las Vegas - including a Four Seasons - it makes Las Vegas one of the few cities where your choice of lodging can really make or break your stay.

Encore is revolutionary in many ways and is a winner. This is the place to stay at if you're going to Vegas. I've included some pictures so check them out as well. We arrived at Encore through the self park garage and went straight to the front desk which was only a very short walk. Upon entering Encore I immediately noticed that there was a lot of natural light inside because of the use of glass walls and ceilings throughout the hotel. Also the prominent colors used throughout the hotel seemed to be red and black, very chic. Also a lot of detail was spent on everything, nothing was spared. Once at the front desk I was immediately checked in by a very friendly and enthusiastic girl. I asked her if we could get a room with a nice view of the strip and she said she'd look into it. After all the formalities (which only took a couple of minutes) she gave me our room keys and promised us we would love the view from our room (more on this later) and if I didn't I could come back to her and ask for another room. Anyway, off we went to the room elevators, which was an even shorter walk than from the parking garage to the front desk (this is the first hotel in Vegas that doesn't have a long walk from the parking garage to the front desk or from the front desk to the room elevators). Our room on the 53rd floor had an amazing view indeed just as the girl from the front desk promised. We faced the south strip and had a nice view of the Wynn to our left, the mall to our right, and the Palazzo, Treasure Island, Mirage, Caesars Palace, and Bellagio in the center. Our room with 2 queen beds had the same layout as the 2 double bedrooms at the Wynn, with the exception of it being bigger because of the L-shaped couch. The decor inside however is more modern, the colors very chic, and overall more detailed (and luxurious). Lights can be controlled from a panel beside the entry door or the bed. The room also has a doorbell as well as an electronic privacy button. The drapes/sheer are also electronically controlled by the panel beside the bed. The 46\" Sharp LCD in the room is also bigger than the one used in the Wynn and has actual HD channels. The bathroom has the same layout as the Wynn as well and is more modern and uses more expensive materials. The staff throughout the hotel seemed very nice, even the maids I encountered. They always said hi or asked me how everything was. Now onto the casino... The casino is smaller than the Wynn and as a result we were mostly playing in the Wynn since most of the machines were occupied in Encore. What I did notice was that the casino in Encore was a lot brighter in comparison with the casino at Wynn (which is already brighter than usual i.e. Bellagio) because of natural light and light from the ceiling. Most casinos have low lighting which makes the casinos feel old and tired even if the casino is new. I also took a peek at the Spa and let me tell you it was like I was in the lobby of heaven (not that I've ever been to heaven). Very nice, relaxing, and very detailed. We dined at Society Cafe Encore four times for breakfast and dinner and the food was excellent. Not only that, the food came out pretty quick (they strive to bring your food out in less than 20 minutes). We also had dinner at Botero, however our dinner didn't go as smooth as we had wanted. First we were seated at a table that was sandwiched between the kitchen entrance and the dining room entrance so we had a lot of traffic around us. We asked to be moved and were seated in the center of the restaurant. As a result of our move our appetizers came out after 40 minutes. This incident was blamed on our move which is what we were told at least. This was not acceptable. We didn't move to a new restaurant, we just moved a couple of tables from our original table. The rest of our dinner was flawless however and we had a great time. The food of course was excellent as well (the Chimichurri Filet was amazing). I would say that the food at Botero is better than at SW (which I think is overrated). We had dinner at Switch as well and our dinner was perfect. The lobster bisque I had as an appetizer however didn't taste any better than something from the supermarket. Our steaks however were pretty good (the Chimichurri Filet at Switch was also excellent). The attraction of Switch of course is that the \"inside\" of the restaurant changes every 20 minutes, the walls and ceiling figuratively change every 20 minutes, a pretty cool sight. I don't understand why people complain that everything in the hotel is expensive. HELLO!!! You're in a 5 star hotel... However, we did have the following problems during our stay: - Our room didn't come with any slippers so we had to call housekeeping for them (minor issue). - Our room safe was locked and we called to have it opened but no one ever came (minor issue). - Our room didn't have an iron and when we called housekeeping for an iron it took over 45 minutes before they brought the iron over (a major issue). - The ventilation in the casino isn't as good as in the Wynn. The casino had a strong smell of cigarettes/cigars unlike the Wynn. I would have thought that the ventilation would be as good as in the Wynn (a major issue). All in all I had an excellent stay at Encore and is now my choice of hotel in Vegas (before Encore it was the Wynn). I highly recommend you try out Encore.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cWynn Encore Takes a Bow\u201d", "Author": "GrandOhioTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR23390458", "Content": "Having stayed at Wynn Las Vegas, although a splendid-looking place, I can honestly say that Steve Wynn's first hotel-casino offering after his famed Bellagio was somewhat of a disappointment. My initial reaction was, \"Is that all there is?\" But with Wynn Encore, Steve Wynn gets it right this time around. Wynn Encore is by far the most well-lighted hotel-casino on the Strip. Lucky ruby red colors abound everywhere from the carpet, to the walls, to those Willy-Wonka licorice chandeliers. The table game areas feel like private gaming salons, cornered by lavish drapes and ivory white columns. There's a gorgeous, picturesque-looking pool that surprisingly looks to be the center of the hotel's attention. (Steve Wynn might want to consider keeping it open to only male and female models--no kids and over-weight people allowed.) The hotel-casino, overall, is more South Beach with Asian flair than your traditional, themed Las Vegas hotel-casinos. The restaurants are open just enough such that people have a sneak peek at what they look like inside. We tried Wazuzu, Wynn Encore's Chinese-Japanese fusion restaurant. Try the chicken curry-- it has a nice balance of hot and sweet between the curry and coconut, or the caterpillar eel-avocado roll-- it does not disappoint. We topped off the dinner by sampling the mango-rich ice cream, which tasted like it was just made from fresh, ripe-very ripe, mango. The resort suite is a good size, maybe 700 square feet with floor to ceiling windows, a 42\" flat-panel TV on top of a swivel so that it can be viewed from either the bed or the living area. The furniture is mostly white but there is a black L-shaped sofa. (I'd still probably recommend the much larger Palazzo suites for families with children, though.) The bed linens must be Egyptian cotton with a very high thread count--VERY comfortable. The bathroom has two duel sinks, a shower, and separate soaking bathtub. We ordered breakfast once; the service was prompt (only 30 minute wait) but the waffles, poached egg, and corned beef hash were nothing spectacular (18% gratuity and $5 dinner charge already included, so no extra tip warranted). In short, Wynn Encore offers intimacy and elegance. While admittedly, it doesn't have the \"wow\" factor, Wynn Encore, without a doubt, has the \"cool\" factor. Frank Sinatra, which one of the restaurants is proudly named after, would probably agree.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murray, Utah", "Title": "\u201cThought it was fantastic\u201d", "Author": "tcmorse6570", "ReviewID": "UR23391235", "Content": "Had a room on the 60th floor (found out later it was really the 49th, no 13th and no rooms starting with 4, something about people being superstitious) and wow, what a view.

There are some very nice things we experienced. The spa was great, we enjoyed it very much, but unfortunately the steam room was not working, hopefully this will be fixed soon. The rooms are beautiful and I think the bathroom floors were heated, but this lead to the bathroom being too warm and with no vent and no ability to control the bathroom temp it became uncomfortable. Our biggest problem was the fact that the hotel had absolutely no sound insulation. You can hear every conversation from the rooms next to you, above you and below you, heaven forbid your neighbors are having a party. You might as well join them because you will not get any sleep. The staff is nice enough but we were not offered any apology or anything for our inconvenience of hearing these unwanted conversations. I think the sound travels through the vents and walls. At the price being charged at the Encore, I think I can do better elsewhere. Also if you are planning a stay at the encore, and love a morning coffee, good luck!

The suites are spacious and beautiful. The bed was quite comfortable and the bathroom was large and well equipped. They added some very nice touches such as the remote near the bed where you can open and close the drapes and turn the lights on/off. There is a nice desk with a great phone and fax machine in every room ($8 per page to send a fax). I did not have any of the noise problems that I've read about however a couple in the elevator asked me if I heard any noises at night, so it must be evident in other rooms. I don't think it is from the nightclub because it is not located in that block of the hotel - I think these noises are from adjacent rooms. I say this because I did hear my neighbors phone ringing quite clearly one evening. The low room rates and \"hip, contemporary\" feel of this hotel also attracts the younger crowd who like to party into the night in their spacious suites. I'm in my early 40's and found this hotel to be too hip for me. I like classy and elegant. The Encore is more \"in your face\" than elegant. The Wynn is much more to my liking. I have to say that the uniforms chosen for the staff at Encore (and Wynn) have to be the ugliest I've ever seen. Tacky, tacky polyester in the weirdest colors. The male security staff wore purple jackets. Not the dark, elegant purple but Willy Wonka purple. The staff at the Wynn Buffet had thick pink polyester suits. The staff at any Denny's restaurant looks better. If I wasn't told this was a four star, Michelin rated hotel I wouldn't look so closely at such things, but OMG. The cocktail servers' outfits were no better. The prices for food and drinks is way up there too. I paid $4.50 for a small cup of regular coffee. It had obviously been sitting on the burner for quite a while too. When I mentioned it the server actually agreed that it had been sitting for a while. OKAAAY. So much for that five star service. I don't think this hotel will be winning many awards. By Vegas standards, its OK but the service and public rooms can be improved.

Looking out the windows at night, we felt like high rollers like in the movie 21. The suite was really amazing. Steve Wynn did not skim on any materials. Everything was plush plush plush. The bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, iPod docking station, all very fancy. Even the closet doors were heavy and solid. And of course you can\u2019t beat the discounts that they have been putting out. We also stayed at the Venetian (also an all-suite hotel) for two nights but the suite at Encore was way more plush. But just know one thing. Even if you can afford the room rates at Encore, you may not be able to afford anything else. Everything is super expensive. The room service menu prices are sky high. The gym is $40/day. The mini bar has pressure sensors so if you lift up anything for over 60 seconds, you will be charged. After seeing the prices, we were almost scared to go anywhere near the mini bar. All the restaurants are very expensive. We dined at Bartolotta and my small and not-so-good fish entr\u00e9e was $55. Know that I live in New York City and my wife and I are used to New York prices and we eat out all the time. Still, the Encore prices are bother line ridiculous.

Twenty-five minutes after we were told that the security person was on the elevator to our room, a staff member arrived to let us in. At the time we hadn\u2019t realized that The Encore had only been open for two weeks. Though there were definitely bugs to be worked out, all things consider, the property was functioning surprisingly well. If the service at the Wynn is relevant, the bugs will be worked out quickly. The Encore certainly is a spectacular property. We feel like we are pretty jaded about the interior design in modern buildings. In general, we find the glitz and shine of the Las Vegas mega hotels to be off putting. The Wynn and to an even greater extent the Encore manage to be visually appealing even reaching the point that the interior design reaches a level that we would call art. Particularly notable at the Encore was the massage room area in the spa. It truly feels as if you are entering another world when you step into the room to see a central path lined with beds of smooth and flat-whitewashed stones with large lanterns placed periodically. Off the path on both sides are the black drape clocked treatment rooms. At the end of the path is a massive Golden Buddha glowing in the spotlights. The area is breathtaking and worth the visit on its own.

A close family friend had arranged for my father and I to have a room through the more exclusive Encore Tower Suites (which feature a separate entrance and a much higher employee/guest ratio, similar to the Tower Suites at Wynn). Due to the buzz for the hotel, they actually ran out of Tower Suites and placed guests, including us, in adjacent rooms in the \"Resort Tower\". First, lets be clear: The Resort Tower and Tower Suites are in the same building, and actually connect to each other on ever floor but the lobby. These rooms are simply the closest six or seven rooms on each floor to the Las Vegas Strip. Guests of either side can freely access the other on each floor. The Tower Suites side has a few much, much larger rooms, but I had an opportunity to compare the \"standard\" suite on both sides and they are virtually identical, however the Tower Suites side uses a different color palette that favors golden hues. The carpet, artwork, and wallpaper of the Tower Suites side is slightly nicer, and the section features its own driveway as well as a guest lounge with complimentary food on the lobby-level. We were able to have access to all of the Tower Suites amenities despite the push to the Resort Side. I do not feel that anyone will feel a difference from the pure aspect of simply the rooms themselves. Now onto the room: I stayed in one of the standard guest suites, which come in at a minimum of 745 sq ft (69.2 sq. meters). The contemporary design was loaded with superlatives: the layout was very spacious (not difficult, considering the size), the amenities were all of high caliber (including a large LCD TV, an iHome bedside music player/alarm), and excellent views of The Strip, mountains and general area. The bathroom was equally spacious and featured a nice shower as well as quality toiletries. The general casino areas are attractive, with bold designs and even more natural light than the Wynn. There are influences from the Wynn Macau (designed between the original Wynn and Encore), and the Wazuzu features a large crystal dragon like the one found at the Macau location. Between my father and me, we've sampled some of the world's finest hotels in the US, Europe and Asia. We agreed that this hotel stands among them, specifically for the high level of service by all levels of staff --not merely those in the Tower Suites section. Las Vegas is a lot like an adult Disneyland in that the staff and atmosphere are aimed to be so pleasing that you don't really pay much mind to exactly how much you're spending (and it can certainly be spendy).

My girlfriend and I stayed there for a night to kick off the New Year and we both thought the suites were impeccable. Most of the employees at Encore were genuinely excited about working for a Wynn casino and that showed. We ended up dining at Daniel Boulud's restaurant at the Wynn which we both really liked. We also went to XS afterwards and had a blast. There were, however, a number of negatives in the service department. We booked through American Express travel and were promised a $100 dining credit at \"any of the hotel's fine dining options.\" I called to confirm that the offer was good at any restaurant in the Wynn/Encore and a person in the marketing department confirmed this was the case. The front desk person at check-in also confirmed this. However, at check-out, we did not receive the $100 credit and were told it was ONLY GOOD at the casino's CASUAL restaurants. Eventually, after some arguing, we got the credit applied; still, it was disappointing that the hotel did not have a streamlined process for applying the promotions they ran. Moreover, at check-out, we were billed $30 for a drink we never consumed at the mini bar. I told the front desk agent we did not consume the drink, and they did not believe us. They instead sent a person up to check this out, after which fifteen minutes later, they verified we did not in fact consume the beverage. (We had a ride waiting for us which made the situation worse) In my opinion, this was of pretty poor taste and coupled with the deceiving marketing ploy left my girlfriend and I a little unhappy.
