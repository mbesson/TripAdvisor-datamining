The hotel is clean and in good shape. But the pool was filthy the entire time. It was extremely cloudy and had many water bugs. You could not see the bottom of the pool and I would say it was full of bacteria. One of the owners of a unit, (this is a condo hotel) told me that it has had a continuous problem with keeping the pool clean and clear this summer. The pool had no water pressure coming from the jets from the pool pump and they did not give it professional regular maintenance during my stay. If you love a beach front pool at your resort check the pool before checking in!

To my surprise, this hotel was really nice! I loved the location & the price tag. It's great access to the Beach, Main St is in walking distance, and it's easy to hop on International Speedway Boulevard to go to the races. We were impressed with how clean the place was, the maid service was exceptional in stocking clean towels and everything. Parking was okay, there was only one night-close to midnight-where we took the last car space. There's easy access to the beach and there's a tiki bar out back. The pool out back is for residents only, so it was never full. It was super clean too. The tiki bar had a DJ too, which was great entertainment.

We stayed here with another couple, each having an ocean view king room - one room was nicely appointed, the other, not so much - the bed didn't have a headboard. Both rooms did have basic kitchen items. I believe that since these rooms are individually owned, there should be standards that are maintained for all rooms. Housekeeping left a little to be desired. The best parts of this hotel are the Oasis Tiki Bar with a restaurant, a DJ that starts at 1 p.m. and the oceanfront location! These are the reasons are why we will stay here again. It's also walking distance to many bars & restaurants. I would not recommend this place for families with small children.

Oceanfront, and oceanview, are only 1 room apart, and are the same size unit, so you don't need an oceanfront. There were no backups in the elevators, as in previous reviews, even though we were there for Turkey Run Weekend at Daytona Speedway. The hallsways did not smell either, as previouslyend reported. Did love our new HD widescreen in the living room. TV in bedroom was so low you could not see it over your feet. A/C worked great. Kitchen was well stocked. Had coffee-maker, but no COMPLIMENTARY coffee. Had to go out and buy our own. We were fortunate to get a great rate due to a glitch in their computer system, Buy 1 nt, get 1 free. They quickly fixed that, and it became buy 2 nts, get 1 free, still a decent deal. Kristen at the front desk was great! She managed to be extremely pleasant and helpful, on an event weekend, with her computer system down, manually checking in all guests. Again....great employee...give Kristen a RAISE! The back parking lot lights were out and you practically had to feel your way around at night to get to our car. All in all, it really wasn't that bad. Loved driving on the beach.

Our room was 513 and we were there last year and it was great and to our suprise when we got there this year it was completly done over again and it was beautiful. My parents were in room 519 and they were very pleased with their room as well.The Oasis Tiki Bar was great , the food was awesome and the drinks were great, the staff were extremely friendly and we were able to take our drinks to the pool and hot tub.(thanks Brandon).The pool was very well maintained and clean, along with the hottub.Great view of beach and ocean from pool side. The view from the southside of the building from our balcony was to die for. beautiful Ocean view and view of pool as well. Management and staff were very friendly and our room maid Gracyie was fabulous. She kept our rooms up to par everyday , always was very friendly and made conversation with us each day in the hall way. One of the days she asked what we were doing that day and we told her we were going to the mall to shop. She suggested for us to go to the Daytona Flea Market instead as it was big and it had everything that the mall had, she even gave us directions. We spent the whole day there and it was a huge shopping experience, Thanks again Gracyie!!! There is a laundry room at the Fountain Beach as well and it came in handy.We had such a great experience at this establishment that we will be returning again next year as it is a Great Place, Great Price, Friendly Staff !!!

He booked the Fountain Beach Resort after seeing Orbitz had given it 4 stars (we stayed there 5/01/09 - 5/03/09). We arrived around 10 pm on Friday night and after checking in, we took the elevator to the second floor and as we walked down the hall we were completely disgusted by the smell of what could only be described as a frat house as well as at the sight of stains on the carpet. Opening the door to the room wasn't much better. Everything was completely outdated and the wear and tear on the room was about 3 years overdue for a makeover (the tile floor in the kitchen/bathroom had spots on it and I wore my flip flops at all times because I was afraid to put my bare feet on the floor). We tried to make the best of it saying that we would barely spend any time in the room and would be on the beach most of the time. I barely slept the first night due to the dirty feeling I had about the place and to my horror, the second night confirmed what I felt when when I discovered a small beetle-like bug crawling on boyfriend's pillow followed by another small insect on the inside of his pillow. We killed the bugs thinking that would be the end of them but then we saw a tiny, red, transparent tick like bug that when we killed it, squished blood out into a tissue! We inspected both sides of the pillows and noticed that some of the pillow covers had small, pin drop blood stains on them and it looked like whoever had slept there had probably killed some of these bugs unknowingly with their head (the blood looked old like the pillows had been washed and the blood stains stayed - and I cringed at the thought that my head may have touched it and that the hotel would continue to use those pillows). So, we get new pillows thinking that would be the end of it (we didn't want to deal with this and wanted to be done with it) but keep in mind that my boyfriend had to go to the front desk to get them because when we called down to the person on duty, he wouldn't bring them up to us and sounded completely surprised that we had bugs in the room. He said he never heard of that happening before and that we should bring him the dead bugs so he could see them (we didn't)! He didn't offer us another room either (we didn't think any of the rooms would be any better at this point regardless so we didn't push it). In all honesty, we were trying to make the best of it because it was our last night but when my boyfriend brought up the new pillows and set them on the bed, I see another beetle-like bug 20 minutes later! I look at the wicker headboard and see that they are coming up onto the bed from there! I kill that bug and we actually decided that the other bed (the room had 2 Queen size beds) should be okay to sleep because we hadn't seen any bugs on it (at this point it's late and we're exhausted and his credit card had already been charged for the weekend through Orbitz). I barely slept and kept waking up in the middle of the night to do a bug check and when I did eventually fall asleep (my boyfriend and I slept with our feet to the headboard and our heads at the opposite end just to be safe) and wake up the next morning, I had bug bites all over my arms! I was ready to cry; it was that bad. I travel a lot and have stayed in some places that were not great but this place takes the cake. Truly, this place was disgusting and unless you are in college looking to stay at a cheap place with beach access, I don't see how anyone could enjoy it. This is the first review I've written and I had to comment because the last two reviews from people who stayed there in April could not have more different from the experience I had. One more thing to point out is the beach. The area of the beach where Fountain Beach Resort (the \"Resort\" title is beyond laughable) resides also happens to be the part of the beach where cars are allowed. So, if you like the smell of exhaust and having your view blocked by cars, Fountain Beach is the place to go. I think I'm going to have to get my blood checked after staying there to ensure that whatever bit me wasn't carrying any diseases.

The good: The rate is reasonable. The resort is in a good location, just south of the pier and close to dining and entertainment and right on the beach. The staff was pretty good for one of these type places. The pool and the putt putt golf were OK. The bad: The outside is in need of some attention. Nothing major but it is starting to look old. The Tiki bar and restaurant are closed and it didn't look like they were planning to reopen. Oceanview means that you have to go out on the balcony to see the ocean. The ugly: Across the street is a market and around the corner from the market is a package store and a bar. This in itself is OK but what it does is attracts homeless people or to be more blunt, drunken bums.

We didn\u2019t have a lot of money so the Hilton or anyplace like that was out of the question. I finally picked the Fountain Beach Resort. My reasons we the two most recent reviews said that is was clean and that they were remodeling the hotel. When we booked the hotel though there website it said that they were remodeling and that you could get rooms as low $39 a night. When we got there you could tell they were remodeling but nothing big to deal with. The lobby was being worked on but the check in was very fast and easy and the lady was nice and friendly . Behind the counter they have about 5 monitors with the view from camera\u2019s that are throughout the hotel. When we got to our room it was better than I thought. Good size, everything was clean, a very comfortable bed and everything looked new. They have a little kitchenette that has plates and cups. The pool was clean and they had a nice jacuzzi. The location was right off International Speedway Drive which made us close to everything. The only thing that was a down side was that we though that we were booking an ocean view and from the description of the rooms on there page we thought you\u2019d be able to look out the window and see the ocean.

You know how some rooms on the beach can smell musty (that's what we worried about)not the case, this room had a fresh smell and was truly one of the cleanest rooms we've ever stayed.

We say yes and he then informs us we can't close the doors for 24 hrs. but there will be a person patroling the floor. We understand that upgrades need to be made, I was in the flooring business and hotels are what we did mostly. Not wanting to have our room door open while we slept we go down to get another room. He then tells us that he does have a beach front room without jacuzzi so we say fine and he is going to take 20 bucks off the price per night. We go up to look at it and the room isn't even made up. There is a bed frame on the floor but the mattress and box spring are leaning up against the wall and the blinds are laying on the floor, the carpet is gross, paint buckets are in there and the palce is just a mess.
