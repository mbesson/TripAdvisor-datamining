I made a reservation online and the price was totally different from what they were giving me over the phone. The Indian guy said it was a \"walk-in\" price (more expensive than the one online) I made the reservation online but the staff over the phone sounded really rude. There is no parking in the back. I had to park my car in front of the building. Inside the room the fridge didn't work properly (it was in max) and it could barely cold down the food. Your neighbors (you can smell the drugs) not a good place to stay. We payed 118 total price. Wifi is extremely slow (feels like you are surfing the Internet on a phone line) really slow.

We stayed at the studio 6 with advance reservations for 4 nights. The price was high for this sort of place and we paid $20 a night extra because we had 2 dogs and the charge is $10 per might per dog. This brought the total cost up high for this kind of place. Upon arrival in the afternoon, had we been able to do so, we would have kept driving and found a better place closer in to Burbank. This area is crummy and walking the dogs around showed more barbed wire and spiked fences including the motel itself than might be found at Folsom Prison.There are lots of hoody type people hanging around on the corners and night time has a lot of wild traffic activity. Points to consider: the room was okay, a bit worn out, the kitchen was okay but lacking in items. The bathroom was spotless but no counter for toiletries, only the limited part of the sink. The towels and bath mat-- I use better stuff to wash my car. The cheapest linens available were used, maybe Chinese rejects? The t.v. was good, plenty of cable stations but no instructions for the more complicated procedures which caused a problem. the wi fi internet is among the best, fast, swift, easy on line. we even watched a netflix movie through the laptop which proves it was high quality connection. The managers were okay, there is not too much to ask of them. The pool is in the center and unusued due to the cool weather. Its generally a small place with 2 wings, a laundry room. The parking lot is the nightmare area. Spaces are tight and many guests had big trucks and suv's probably because they had pets or children and it was tight terrible parking. We parked a pickup truck with great difficulty and wanted to avoid leaving it on the street due to the area. The first two nights there was a man lurking in the parking lot, smoking. I found out later he was a long term guest. While parking one night, trying to get into a tight spot, we bumped his front bumper. There was no damage to either vehicle. He got argumentative and would not let up saying that his junker 95 nissan pathfinder was damaged. He kept it up and I called the police who arrived in 10 minutes and defused the situation. We checked out the next morning and got a refund for the 4th night. Judge for yourself if you want to stay here. Sad to say, we find Motel 6 generally patronized by crummy people. Many motel 6's are in uncrowded locations which makes them a good place to stay especially on highways. In cities though, they are more like hot sheet places with guests coming in and out for a quickie. They allow pets which is the primary reason we stay there. I know that the company is at the mercy of the guests that are greatly varied. But think carefully before you stay here. The place was clean and the maid service was fine but the value and safety were questionable.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "pelican2770", "ReviewID": "UR116586502", "Content": "This property is meticulously maintained and absolutely spotless. Our first stay there was several months ago and found it wonderful then so we went back. At first I was skeptical because it is marketed as \"interim housing\" and I was picturing all sorts of unpleasant things. How wrong I was. The Sudio 6 branch of the Motel 6 chain caters to extended stays by offering full kitchens in the units. This really helps save money by being able to cook meals there. A weekly stay is only $55 per night, a great value for this centrally located San Fernando Valley (the Valley) property. The rooms are spotless, the appliances are good quality, the air conditioning works well (it was over 100 during our last stay), the WiFi is fast and reliable and the pool is fresh and clean. There is adequate off street parking and the grounds are kept exceptionally clean. The other guests were very friendly and I felt safe.

Unfortunatly I made the reservation over the phone the night before so I was told I wouldn't get a refund if I cancelled. I didn't worry about that since I had stayed at a Best Value Inn in Williams, Az and it was great. When we got there we had to go down a dark alley to get to the office. There were people laying down in the parking area. We would have left except we had already paid. The hallways smelled like urine. The front desk person was eyeballing and trying to flirt with my daughter. The room was awful. The bathroom was dirty. We had to clean the toilet ourselves before we could use it. Neither one of use was brave enough to step foot in the shower. We wore our shoes in the room and wore our clothes to bed as we were afraid of what might have been in it. There were signs all over the place warning about illegal drug use and prostitues as well as a sign saying you had to pay for the whole night and not just an hour. You had to put a $10 deposit to use the phone and they deducted 52 cents a minute from it for local calls. We left there as quick as we could in the morning. I have stayed in a lot of motels as I like to travel but none of them ever made me feel like I needed a shower after leaving them. After staying here I have started to read reviews before staying anywhere.
