Pros: - Our room was a decent size and very clean with a nice bathroom. - The hotel is within easy walking distance (15 minutes) to most major tourist attractions (Colosseum, Spanish Steps, museums, etc.). - Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. - The price was lower than many other hotels we looked at and overall a very good value. Cons: - The hotel charges you for basic extras such as internet access (which we couldn't figure out how to connect to even with paying) and storing bags on checkout day (3 euro to store a bag in the corner of an upstairs bathroom) - The hotel's front desk/office was closed and staff was not around several times when we had questions (mostly late in the evening). - The hotel's location (near the Termini bus station) is not the most elegant in Rome. Conclusion: - Overall a nice, clean hotel in a good location for the tourist who wants to see all that Rome has to offer.

We booked 5 rooms in total (4 double rooms and 1 room with 2 single beds). I asked for a view of the opera house (prior to our arrival at the hotel when we originally booked online through the hotel website) and got exactly that in the 4 double rooms. You get to soak in all the atmosphere of Rome that way and see everyone going about there day to day routine whilst you\u2019re chilling out in your room!). The room with the 2 single beds was positioned towards the other side of the hotel which faced out towards a small courtyard with sun shining down on it majority of the day, so this didn't have a view of the opera house but the reception guy did say this as he gave the key cards for our rooms to us which we were all fine with anyway. Little tip for you, if it\u2019s available at the time of your booking \u2013 ask for room 109. This is the room me and my girlfriend stayed in. Large spacious room with a big king side bed, It has his and hers sinks in the bathroom (compared to some rooms which just have the 1 sink) and there is also a TV cleverly built into the mirror at the touch of a button! \u2026 (I was amazed at this!!) Also, an lovely view of the opera house The hotel has a very charming authentic feel to it as soon as you walk up and into it. It has a quirky walkway leading up to the small reception which is tastefully decorated to suit the history of Rome. To the left and right of the main reception, they have 2 authentic very old lifts which adds charm and character to the ambience of the hotel (they are quiet and can accommodate a maximum 3 people with luggage at a time or 4 people without luggage!). In between these lifts is the small reception area, were you can also buy bottles of water and pick up free maps / tourists guides and info etc (which is quite handy). I think the reception closes about 9 or 10pm \u2026. Something like that anyway! I\u2019ve noticed some reviews people have put on here saying that taxi drivers etc have difficulty finding the hotel?? I don\u2019t know how as all you have to say is \u2018Opposite the opera house on Al Viminale Street) and they know exactly were you mean. The hotel has a brass sign outside it which clearly says the hotel name anyway. I think this hotel deserves more than a 3 star status to be quite honest. It\u2019s in a brilliant location (5 minute walk from underground station AND the bus station next to it) across the road from a supermarket and a couple of delicatessens and about a 20 minute walk from the coliseum. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Moving off the topic of the hotel slightly, if you\u2019re going to be staying here, then im guessing you will want to know the nearest supermarket and delicatessens etc Literally a stone throw from the hotel to the left of the opera house (as you come out of the big door at the entrance) there is a big supermarket and 1 or 2 delicatessens. The supermarket itself is not exactly signed / illuminated so its easy to miss\u2026.so much so I dint even know it was there myself until I walked into it and looked down the steps! If you like your lager, you can pick up a 660ml bottle of Peroni in there for 40 cence !!! which is about 30 / 40p in English money ! I know Peroni is Italian made but I\u2019ve never seen lager this cheap before and no it wasn\u2019t a price error lol !! There is a lovely delicatessen about 3 or 4 doors down from the hotel \u2026. (again, as you turn left out of the hotel) which serve gorgeous fresh pastries, croissants and Panini\u2019s etc. Back onto the topic of the hotel again - fantastic and ticked all the boxed for us. We liked it that much, we plan to stay there again for our next trip to rome. When ever I get chance, I\u2019ll try an upload a photo of the room, bathroom and panoramic picture of the view looking out from the room! All 9 of us though this hotel was an absolute gem of a find, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have the same view once you\u2019ve stayed there yourself. :0)", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cA treat in Rome\u201d", "Author": "Scottishwombat", "ReviewID": "UR127687168", "Content": "For those that have not stayed in Italian hotels, the view of the hotel from the street is a little daunting.

Its situation is very pleasant since it is virtually opposite the front of the Teatro dell' Opera , which has nicely planted garden borders in front . The entrance to the impressive building is by a very high , big double \" gate -door \" . Ring on the Inn's door bell which is on the right hand side of the main doors .Proceed along a wide , airy and light entrance hall and their office is to the right ( the building , which has private apartments too - also has their concierge's office to the left.

The key system works for the main entrance as well as the entrance door to the floor unit of five /four rooms and then of course for your room . Parquet floors and an impeccable bedroom greeted me .. the room was very airy and light , and nicely decorated with taste. Cupboard /wardrobe space was ample ( for me ) and one housed an individual safe, which worked excellently and simply . The air conditioning did too - when you extract the key as you go outside from the electrical card recipient at the entrance to the room , the entire electrical system is put off . The shower room was very good and the shower sophisticated. The towels were really very good and the maid service efficient. The soap , gel and shower are in the drawer underneath the attractive very thick glass lavabo . I was on the third floor and found that it was not noisy , pleasantly so . Of course , there is some background noise - in a capital city bang in the middle of it , this is normal . The view of the Opera House is great . Nearby , just two doors down going out on your left , there is caff\u00e9 - small modern style restaurant called \"Il Palchetto \" - their morning Viennoiserie/pastries are cooked on site and delicious . Espresso coffee is just 80 centimes and the place is used a lot by locals . The frontage is quite small , about 3 meters.. but do go in . I also ate a late supper there , which was nicely presented and very tasty . The staff her as in the Inn , are all very courteous . . On the corner of Via Napoli and Vai del Viminale - a few yards further down on the left as you come out of the Caff\u00e9Palchetto /Inn , there is a very discreetly indicated small food supermarket , called Carr\u00e9four Express - great for buying some bottled drinks , food and fruit . It looks strange , but one has to take a lift to the basement level where the shop is! If you carry on down the Via Napoli , you will find an Internet Point at no . 26 on the left hand side. They open I think at 9a.m. and close at midnight . Not over big , but they are used to the tourist market and visitors from all over the planet . They also do Box Office bookings for concerts , national and international phoning , fax , photocopying ,etc.. Also further down the Via del Viminale, again on the left coming out of the Inn , there is a chemist on the corner with Via Agostino de Pretis - about 250 meters/yards I estimate . One of the nearest Metro stops is Repubblica and there is of course a Metro at the Termini . I also ate at the \" Cotto\" in Via Torino - which is about 250 meters along after the Opera House - indoor and outdoor lunching and dining . Very good too . I plan on returning to the Inn in November and am booking for several dates in 2012 - what more can I say . Oh , I'm forgetting .. :) ... the bed linen is fine and the bed comfortable.

He was informative, patient, helpful and was truly above the customer service we experienced in Rome. 2. There is a little cafe around the corner on Via Napoli that has excellent breakfast items. My wife and I would go there each morning and have warm panini, pastry, various cafe and fresh OJ amd never more then E5.00- E7.00 together. 3. Buy the Roma pass if you are getting around by bus and metro, not only is it good value you get to skip the long lines so common at the first two sites you choose. I would use for Colosseum. 4. Visit Trastevere, a nice local town like area away from the endless crowds of Ancient Rome.

The hotel is a couple of floors in an apartment building. Our room was contemporary and elegant looking. It had a comfortable king bed, nice sofa and a good view right across the street to the classic-looking Opera Theater. There's a big flat screen TV, and the small bathroom had a shower with multiple jets which my wife really loved. The ultra contemporary bathroom sink was a little strange---there was no stopper, so you couldn't fiil it up for shaving. One thing we liked was that there's good light in the room. The staff are friendly, but are generally only there during the day (but are reachable by telephone if any major issues during the night). There's no breakfast, so you have to go out to one of the many cafes in the area, or you could eat in your room, as there is a good coffee machine near every room and a refrigerator in the room. Security is good, as access is restricted for much of the day (and all night)---you have to use your key card to get in. The hotel is only 5 minutes from the Termini Station. Although this is not an area where you'll find some of Rome's finest restaurants, there are many decent places to eat within a short walk from the hotel. We found Viminale Street to be reasonably quiet, so you don't get much street noise in your room.

Its 5 mins from Roma Termini. The problem with Rome is that there are only 2 metro lines, one that goes towards Colosseum and another towards Vatican. So this location is perfect.

The room was excellent and with modern furnishing. My room also had aqua jet shower. The reason I did not give 5 stars is because it does not have free WIFI. It cost 3 EUR for an hour of use. I was expecting a free WIFI because I did not do my research before hand. But that's my fault, so if you don't need WIFI then you can ignore this. The second reason is that the reception is not attended 24hrs. There attendant is at the reception from morning 8 to evening 7 and even during day time they are not always there. Its not like you need someone all the time but for me its good to know that if I need something there will be someone available. All thing considered nothing can beat the location.

LOCATION: Close to Roma Termini (Central railway station of Rome), but not too much - you don\u2019t feel that you\u2019re in the middle of crowds and constant rush. The building where the Deluxe Inn is located (it occupies the 3rd and the 5th floor, as far as I understood) is just opposite the Opera House \u2013 so I really advise all opera fans to ask for a room with a view (preferably on the 5th floor) \u2013 the fa\u00e7ade of the Opera will be seen from your window, and it\u2019s really beautiful! If you plan to travel a lot from Termini, it\u2019s also a good choice. SURROUNDING AREA. In general, the traffic in the surrounding area is rather active, but Piazza Beniamino Gigli which the Inn faces is much calmer and the windows are so good that you won\u2019t hear a thing. Though the area closer to Termini is not that quiet, near the Inn you feel absolutely secure. ROOM. I had Room 503 with two windows and a great view of the Opera, a comfy double bed, efficient a/c, a safe, an enormous TV and a fridge. The room was well-decorated and clean. It\u2019s really pleasant for a solo traveler. But if you have a partner I\u2019d recommend to ask for another room as in this one you can\u2019t have enough privacy in the bathroom/toilet but I suppose it\u2019s the only room arranged like that. FACILITIES. The Deluxe Inn normally doesn\u2019t serve breakfast, but there\u2019s a kitchen corner where you can boil water, get tea/coffee for free, take cutlery, cups and glasses. You can find a lot of shops and cafes nearby, so you won\u2019t be hungry. If you need to store you luggage after check-out, you can lock it in a special room. All in all, I was really happy with the Deluxe Inn.

He clearly explained how the electronic key worked the front door, the entrance to the suite of rooms, and the door to our room. We entered through the first door and found a bright, clean, and modern space with a pot for hot water and a couple of doors to the individual rooms. Then we entered our room and were amazed. It was exactly as the photo showed on the website. It was not hugh. But then again, the price was not hugh and we were in Rome. It was an order of magnitude better than the so-called M.... Palace where we stayed last year. The full size bed had plenty of room to walk around and was very comfortable. There was a wide screen, flat panel TV and DVD player, a small refrigerator, and a nice painted mural on the wall over the bed. The window looked right out towards the Opera House. The bathroom was completed redone with tile and modern fixtures including the Jacuzzi shower. It was a little small but had multiple horizontal jets, a rain shower head, and a hand held shower. Very nice. On leaving my wife even said she would like to stay there again. The only potential negative comments I could say were the small sign and poor initial impression when you walk in the building. Guess that helped with the better impression once we got to the rooms. Lastly, the attendant was very helpful and informative in all cases but one. He couldn't tell us how to make an outside phone call. We had problems with lost luggage and were trying to contact the airlines. He said we couldn't call from the hotel and told us to go to the corner internet cafe. They said they couldn't dial an 800 number. Overall, it was a great place, in a great location, at a great price.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haarlem, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cA very nice place to stay\u201d", "Author": "roman158", "ReviewID": "UR57424173", "Content": "Wow! what a great value for money! we booked early wich saved us allot of cash.

We got a great price for the Al Viminale and as it was our first trip to Rome, we were a little worried that we may have been too cheap with our choice....we really had nothing to be worried about!! The hotel was fantastic! The location is excellent, only about a 5minute walk from Termini train station, which is so handy and also cheap as taxis in Rome can be quite expensive. I have read from many other reviews on Trip advisor that people have found it difficult to find the Hotel, I would advise you to look out for the Opera house as the door to the hotel is the large Brown Doors directly across the road from the main door into the Opera House. We also loved the fact that you could walk to pretty much every major tourist attraction from the hotel. The Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill are 10 minutes away, and you can reach the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon etc on foot (takes a bit longer but it's lovely to ramble around the Roman streets)! The Hotel reception is only open from 8am-6pm, which suited us fine as we found that when in Rome, you spend very little time actually in the Hotel!! The staff were fantastic! Extremely friendly, efficient and helpful. During check in the lovely gentleman provided us with loads of information about our location and info about what buses and the Metro. When we were departing they stored our luggage for us for a few hours as our flight was not until the evening, and they did not charge us for this...which is very rare these days! We stayed in room 309 and it was FANTASTIC!!! The rooms appear to have been recently refurbished, excellent comfy beds, great bed linen, Flat screen TV, soundproof windows, Blackout Curtains...My favourite part though had to be the AMAZING bathroom...complete with modern dual his&hers sinks, inbuilt TV in the bathroom mirror and Jacuzzi shower with excellent strong water pressure!! There is no restaurant in this hotel, however we found this to be a plus as there are some gorgeous restaurants and coffee shops located right beside the hotel. We found the perfect traditional Italian coffee shop (I swear we were the only non-Italians in the place!!)that we went to every morning for the most delicious cappuccinos and Paninis and Pizzettes. I can't remember the name of the place but when you exit the hotel turn left and then another left at the next turn...across the road from 'That's Amore' Restaurant. I would not recommend the hotel for families due to the basic facilities. However we really cannot fault the hotel and highly recommend it to any couples or solo travellers looking for the perfect base for an affordable trip to Rome. We will DEFINITELY be back!!", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cGood Location, Nice rooms & facilities\u201d", "Author": "CosmicKidNZ", "ReviewID": "UR46038872", "Content": "This place is a bit different but we were happy with it. It is about 10 minute walk from Termini station. Better to walk - we enquired with taxi drivers how much it would cost and they were saying about 20-25 euro which is a rip-off. The walk is easier if you walk through the station itself which we worked out when we went back to the station to leave Rome. The set-up at the hotel is a bit different. There is no 'hotel' sign out front just the name on the business listing at nbr 38. You check in downstairs and the reception lady is very helpful and friendly. Then they take you up in the quaint old lift to their floor with their hotel rooms and you can only get to this area with a swipe card so good security. Just outside the rooms is free tea and coffee facilities. The rooms have their own A/C, big screen tv (you can hire DVDs from reception too) and a jet shower. The shower is in the middle of the room so there is no privacy if that is an issue. Less than 5 min walk to Republica Metro station which I would suggest using for Metro rather than Termini which can be a bit of a suspect area at night. We walked to Colosseum from the hotel - an easy 10 min walk. So hotel had good location for trains & sights.

It was in a convenient but also relatively quiet location. Staff were friendly and reasonably helpful. There is a supermarket and an internet cafe across the road. We stayed on the 3rd floor (from memory! maybe higher) and had a lovely view out to the street and opera house across the road. The room was clean and nicely furnished, with good space for luggage. The bathroom was well appointed but the shower didn't live up to the advertising - very slow to get warm water, and water pressure was nowhere near what you'd need for such a fancy massage shower. We had a chiller in our room. The bed was comfortable and furnishings quite luxurious. There was an old-fashioned wire lift to our floor. Everything was closed up after hours and in the weekends, so I'd recommend arriving during business hours, although arrangements were made for guests outside these hours. We were very happy with our room until we'd been gone for a day and I realised I'd left behind a bag of shoes (1 pair of shoes plus 2 pairs of sandals). I phoned and emailed to ask if these had been picked up, and eventually found out that the cleaner had supposedly found them, thought they were rubbish, and thrown them in the rubbish skip! I find this hard to believe and wonder if he had helped himself to them... The shoes were in good condition and I would have thought they'd be handed in and kept for a week or so in case of inquiry. It was my own fault that I left them behind, but I now have a sour taste in my mouth about this one thing. Nevertheless, I would recommend this hotel to others. It was very close to Termini and several cafes and seemed reasonably priced compared to other hotels I had considered.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BLACKPOOL", "Title": "\u201cJust what was needed\u201d", "Author": "SEASIDEJOHN", "ReviewID": "UR31705779", "Content": "Great place to stay, great location.

The room was spotlessly clean, had a great jacuzzi shower , 40 inch flat screen TV and aircon (essential in the heat).

A tip if you are travelling into Ciampino airport - a taxi will set you back 60 euro one way - the Terravision bus service which is right outside the terminal and goes straight into Termini cost us 4 euro one way - it takes 40 mins, about 10 mins longer than a cab would.
