Checkin took forever as they were seemingly figuring out where to put me. The hotel has 2 sides - the upscale and the converted apartment building. I was put in the old side, and while it could be considered a \"suite hotel\", the actual size of the room is pretty standard. They are just narrow and long. The bellman showed me to my room (since there is no elevator on the old side), but did NOT take my bag, which I thought was odd. After climbing many stairs (only option), I settled in to find the only \"desk\" was taken by a desktop computer which cost $15/day. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even a coffee table, so if I wanted to do work, it had to be in my lap. The bathroom was also very small, with very little counter space, and the bathroom amenities are outdated. The mouthwash was nasty. The room had 2 flatscreen TVs (non-HD), but the cable was \"being worked on\" for a few hours so it was out. The kitchen consisted of a small sink and basic kitchen items. Cheap countertops and cabinets. After 3 nights of poor sleep from the sun shining in (no blackout shade and the shade did not cover the whole window) and the pounding from upstairs, I switched to a top floor room. Again no help with my luggage even though the stairs were the only option. Cable went out 2 more times. It seemed like they were covering up problems/mistakes, not fixing them. Another HUGE disappointment was the internet. For $15 for 24 hours, you get slow service on ONE device. I had 2 computers for work, so I had to pay $30 per day. And if I wanted to have my phone connect, it would have been another $15. Really? And you have to call the front desk to get a code to log in. Seems very outdated and cheap. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even work properly all the time. Housekeeping was fine, the morning newspaper was nice, but no breakfast, and staff seemed burdened when I had a question/issue. In short, there are 2 sides to the hotel: nice and cheap. The lobby is nice, but the property is not well maintained. No desk to do work in the rooms. Card reader to get in the more convenient way did not work. Fitness center was about 20 years out of date. Staff was not so good. Walls/roof are very thin.

But who can afford it, really? Well, try the Plaza. I just got back from my first visit, and I can't overemphasize how impressed I was. First of all, what it isn't. The Peninsula. Don't expect stars or ridiculously expensive furnishings or an air of pretension. Although, truth be told, there were independent film people there, and the lobby really is gorgeous. I has that old Beverly Hills look. What the hotel is: a comfortable, clean, efficient, warm, full-service hotel for about $100/night less than the surrounding places. I know. I checked. The room decor is not outstanding, but the beds are comfortable, and every room is a suite, which I think means big room with sitting area. I got upgraded, and had a separate living room that was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. There is a lovely pool area, a spa, hair salon and full exercise room. The hotel is perfectly sited, especially if you need to be on the west side, right at Wilshire and Beverly Glen, and about a block down from the lovely little Holmby Park where all the locals hang out. (I've stayed at Trip Advisor's #4 hotel, the Brentwood Inn many times, and as much as I loved it, I'd give it to the Beverly HIlls PLaza all over the Brentwood. It's more convenient, more roomy, has more amenities, and more helpful staff) And the best part of the Plaza? The staff. They went out of their way to help in everything big and small. They rented a Voltzwagen for me for $44/day, which was dropped off for me at the hotel and then picked up there when I was finished. I just gave my keys to the concierge. If you don't think that was worth every penny. It didn't matter what time of the day or night, somebody was available and happy to help(if you've been out all day and don't want to go out to eat, have them give you the info for First Szechuan Wok, which delivers. Really good basic Chinese). The hotel restaurant IS very small, and can easily get overcrowded at breakfast, but the food is basic and good, the bartenders happy to serve, and it's damn convenient. My only caveats would be that because the hotel seems to be made up of more than one building, its halls wander about, and it's easy to get lost.Not only that, if you have trouble with stairs, let the staff know right away so you don't get a room in the back, because stairs are involved. But that's really my only caution. I've already told them I'll be back this summer.

We took two adjoining executive rooms (bedroom and front room with kitchen essentials). It was perfect. First, we booked the rooms only days before and were trying to save by booking one exec room and one standard. When we got to the reception desk the hotel upgraded us (about $10/night) to two executive rooms so that we could be next to each other. That was extremely helpful and considerate of them. The staff was always very nice and accommodating, from the reception to the valet staff. The location is great, on Wilshire Blvd between Westwood and Beverly HIlls. We even found parking on the street both days and were able to avoid the $28/night parking fee. That may have been because of the holiday season, though, and if you did have to use their parking, it is valet and convenient. In the back, near our rooms, there is some rushing water and a pond with koi. Our 2 year old grandson loved it. The building looks like it was two older motels put together, refurbished, and a new front added. It is owned by Donald Sterling, so my guess is that when the real estate heats up again he would sell or convert this considerable footprint to a high rise condo building, like the many others on that stretch of Wilshire.

A friend recommended the Plaza. It was a great choice. It's a unique hotel, situated around a courtyard with swimming pool. We asked for a quiet room away from Wilshire Blvd (which is a tad busy), and they put us in what was effectively a second wing. We had to walk past a little waterfall, the jacuzzi, loads of gorgeous green plants, and up some winding stairs until we reached our huge, well appointed room. We were away from all street noise and slept in peace and quiet. As I said, our room was huge: bedroom, kitchen/dining/living room, lots of storage space, and some comfy sofas. It was not newly decorated, but everything was extremely clean and worked. We walked to the centre of Beverly Hills (around 20 minutes or so) for dinner and a bit of sightseeing. There's nothing much around the hotel, so you'll either have a bit of a walk or you'll need to drive. Traffic can be terrible on Wilshire -- we drove up from LAX in rush hour, and thanks to construction it took quite a while. Just be patient and be prepared for arbitrary stupidity from other drivers, and you'll be fine. The staff at the hotel were great, from initial greetings from the parking valet, to the check-in staff, to housekeeping. Everyone was friendly and went out of their way to help.

Yes, for this was the place where Freddie Prinze committed suicide in January of 1977. Well, even weirder, upon checking into this establishment a second time recently in August of 2011, we got room #217 which is a huuuuuge (nearly 1500 sq. ft room) right next to the room #216 where Freddie spent his last days (or nights). I have to say that while this hotel which was a former apt. building back in the 1970s era, is kind of old school glamour and has very nice front desk staff, it may not be for every one. However, being that I am intrigued by true crime and the old Hollywood crowd, I just had to stay here yet another time. Our room was on the big suite side which features the one and two bedroom suites which range from 1200-2000 sq. ft. The smaller studio style rooms are on the other side of the hotel by the very beautiful hillside waterfall and koi fish pond. While we absolutely loved the room which also features a kitchenette and gorgeous living area, dining room and beautiful one-bedroom, we found the hotel to be rather noisy at night. Most of the rooms in the larger section (floors 1-3) face the pool and cabanas, we ran into a different if not unusual problem. Be it because our room was adjacent to the infamous Freddie Prinze room or whether other factors were at play, during our three night stay, every single night (like clockwork) at 2:33 AM, yes in the unGodly hours of the morning, our neighbors who were at the very end of the hallway, would let their children (under 10 years of age) run amok and scream at this hour. My friends and I very peacefully hung out in the lounge area of our deck in front of room #217 and the kids from these seemingly Middle Eastern (nothing against them) neighbors let their kids run shrieking past our windows. On three consecutive nights, I was awakened by them at that same time, and went down to the front desk to complain. I was amazed that 1). people would let their small children run around the hotel screaming at that hour and that 2). the parents didn't seem to care. The response from the front desk was \"we'll take care of it\" and though they were very diplomatic, despite my rather forceful language, they didn't seem to take active measures to stop the disturbance which other guests noticed and complained about audibly upon hearing these obnoxious and unruly kids. It is amazing to me that, in an establishment that is ostensibly an upscale one ( no, it's not the Hotel Bel-Air nor the Beverly Hills), the management cannot control the outlandish behavior of their guests. Overall, we LOVED the room and the staff was superficially nice, this party hotel seems to not want to get involved with quelling their unruly guests and from what we noticed, has had quite a few unfortunate happenings with various patrons that have come to stay there. I am not saying that this is not a good place, but something very odd is happening at this hotel and I say enter at your own risk if you are sensitive to noise. Granted, this may have been an isolated incident what with the people that caused my party this grief, but if you want a good value for the BH area and don't mind possible noise, I think that this is a good place for what it is and is very convenient if you want to explore the Beverly Hills area. STill, I AM PUZZLED AS to why the management allows loud parties and children to disturb the other neighbors at wee hours of the AM. Yeah, I'd probably go back, but I would bring the ear plugs and hope that I wouldn't be awakened by screaming kids at 2:33 AM, LOL.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cstaff unfriendly!\u201d", "Author": "ElleLondon", "ReviewID": "UR118657181", "Content": "we stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and first impression not good as staff very unfriendly!! only one who smiled was the doorman! we were given a room in the old wing.

Yes, the decore is a bit on the dated side, but it is generally in good shape. We like the full kitchen facilities. We go to the store before checking in and buy all of our breakfast needs and usually only go to room service for extra coffee. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also used room service. Room service is ok, not spectacular, but it is sufficient for most snake or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too tired\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to go out conditions. You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t write home about the food, but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad either. We like the cleaning staff. Our rooms have always been very clean and well tended to. We like the valets. They get to know you, they work hard. We like the location, walk-able to either Beverly Hills or Westwood. For us, we really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to drive much in LA, which given that it is LA, that is remarkable. The air conditioning isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad. Can get the room reasonably cold, which is important. The pool area is inviting. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve enjoyed lunch around the pool on a couple of occasions. We used to think the gym was ok. They recently moved it as part of the remodel. While the equipment is ok, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made it harder to watch tv while on the treadmill than it used to be. Its not bad, just not great. Some things we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like. While there are some lovely people at the front desk, there are a couple that have quite an attitude. I think they think this hotel is in Beverly Hills catering to the stars instead of being Beverly Hills adjacent catering to people waiting for their plastic surgery to heal, in town for their nephew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar Mitzvah or visiting in-laws. A small matter, but they should get over themselves. Another complaint. I feel I am a regular. As said, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at this hotel now more than 10 times. When I was there for a funeral \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a booked stay of more than two weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I was given a note around day 10 asking me to come down and settle my bill. Seriously, they knew we were in town for a funeral. They knew that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stayed there multiple times. Indeed, we were scheduled to stay there again in just over a month at Christmas. I know it was about accounting, but it felt like they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust me. Frankly I was insulted. Having said that, not insulted enough to not stay here because the rates and the other advantages are too good. The internet is terrible here. They charge for it ($15 a day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and what is that? You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give free internet access?) and when you do pay for it, it can be sporadic. There is a business center where you can access the internet for free, but they make it a hassle to get a hotel password and the staff doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand the equipment very well. Some of the rooms have the special foam beds. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like the foam beds. They make me hot. If you would rather have a regular mattress, you should ask for one. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been quite accommodating to us on this front. Anyway, this is a solid, basic hotel. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t glamorous (in spite of what some at the desk might want to believe) but it is very good value for money for the most part, convenient, clean and comfortable.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, perfect apartment for a family.\u201d", "Author": "Emma B", "ReviewID": "UR68124159", "Content": "We were travelling in Southern California with children aged 6 and 9 and we had a suite with two double beds in the bedroom.

Anyone seeking to stay in this hotel should read this review. By way of background, we are both professionals (lawyers), live in New Hampshire, in our early 50s. I would consider staying in this hotel again, but with a few adustments. I don't often (ever?) write reviews such as this, But I wish I had one that was complete before I had booked. Overall, it is a nice hotel. It is essentially a 2-section hotel. There is the normal \"main\" hotel and rooms, including the front desk, courtyard with nice looking pool (I didn't go in it) surrounded by rooms with balconies overlooking the pool. It looked very nice, but I didn't go into any of these rooms. There is also the \"other\" section, which looks like an apartment complex next door that was purchased by the hotel and renovated into hotel rooms. My wife and I stayed in this section, which is accessed from the front desk by a few ways, but the most common seems to be by going up one floor on the elevator (which is small, but adequate), and then walking through a somewhat weird, short maze of walkways leading to the courtyard for this \"other\" section. We stayed in room 632, which was fine/nice. However, if I had any sort of walking issue, it would have been torture, as the room (and most rooms in this \"other\" section) require going up a series of short staircases. The courtyard is very California, and contains a fake, but arguably pleasant, waterfall/stream thing and some nice bushes, along with a hot tub located awkwardly directly outside some poor soul's room. The grounds are maintained very well. It seemed every time we walked out of the room, there was some sweeping or other cleaning activity occuring. Housekeeping was excellent. I tipped $5/day, and $20 on Christmas eve. Good for me. I agree with other reviewers that there are people living in this hotel full time. That was confirmed by sources I will not name. Somewhat weird, but it didn't impact our stay in any way. If it wasn't for the following items, I would consider returning to this hotel: 1. Internet access. This hotel charges $15/day for this service. I complained, but was told it was provided by an outside service, and that they couldn't do anything about it. Very lame. In addition, the internet service was lousy, and would not allow me to send e-mails, although I could recieve them. I had to set up a Gmail account to communicate with clients and the office to take care of a few things. The hotel's website states the \" ... internet connection provided by Apex Net Systems,\" but fails to state that there is a $15/day fee. I find the website to be misleading in this regard. Take a look for yourself, and see what you think: http://beverlyhillsplazahotel.com/hotelamenities.htm. Bottom line: If you rely on internet access like I do, add $15 to the hotel's daily rate when doing your comparisons with other hotels. Even then, it's not very good service. Also, the hotel's business/conference room is modest at best, and requires the same password/username as required in your room for internet access. Ugh! 2. Mini Bar. Total rip off. Best advice - have the hotel empty it before your arrival. When we arrived in our room, we had a nice basket of wine and cheeses (from our in-laws) and a couple beers, bottles of water, and a juice or two in the fridge (also, we thought, from our in-laws or leftovers from the prior hotel-goers). As we arrived at 2:00 a.m., I cracked open a water from the fridge, and sucked down a scotch from the basket. Life is good. But apparently, all of the stuff in the fridge is part of the \"mini-bar,\" and the hotel charges dearly for this stuff. I still don't know what exactly I took from the fridge, but it wasn't much, and the total mini-bat bill added up to around $40, more or less. I complained to the front desk, was promised a call from the manager (which never arrived), and I paid it with gritted teeth so as not to tarnish my vacation experience, with the knowledge I would be writing this review. But I will continue to complain (I guess I am right now!), and will update this site if the hotel manager ever comes through and does the right thing. If I were the manager, I would have called, apologized, and sent flowers, or whatever. But I guess the manager was too busy to address a legitimate concern of one of its clients that paid the hotel for 10 days of its hotel's services. Shameful, in my humble opinion, on a whole host of levels. What is really deceitful is that there is a locked cabinet with a glass front with a bunch of small bottles of liquor, wine, chips in it. We believed, rightfully so, that this locked cabinet was the mini bar. So beware. 3. TV service. Channels 2 through 9 or so look good, including HBO on channel 3. Above that, they are all \"snowy.\" All analog. Disappointing at best, especially when they spent a few dollars for decent flat screen TVs in the living room and bedroom, and then don't deliver with comparable service. 4. Parking. Valet service is $28/day. No way. Park across the street, on the street. I did this for all but the first day. No problems. 5. Noise. Walls are thin. TV on in the next room is audible. Bring ear plugs or Ambien. So, I won't recommend this hotel, because I don't feel it was honest with the charges. I don't mind paying for things I agree to pay for, but I resent being charged for things (or forced to pay for things) I didn't agree to up front. With a few adjustments as I have described, I would recommend this hotel, but I just can't. Look around for other choices.

Again, found the hotel clean, staff helpful, room service good, accomodations pleasant and location good for Beverly Hills & Westwood & Century City. THe update is this: first, they are building some big apartment building across the street. The pile drivers and saws started early...at least up until the day before Christmas. Be aware that this construction looks to be going on for some time to come...though the noise from it will likely deminish as time goes on. However, we found it difficult to stay asleep much beyond 7:30 am on the days they were working (especially true if you open the windows to let in fresh air). Second, hotel re-habbing is ongoing. THe main lobby area has been closed off. One of the elevators wasn't working. Clearly some rooms were in the process of being re-done. They said they were looking at a copule of months work...then they would be raising their rates to about $375 per room per night (above the very reasonable for location and siize I paid). Still the accomodations were a better bargain than some other suite hotels in the area...but the potential price increase will move it out of the good deal catagory. Third, when we were there in October, our room had a regular matress that was one of the more comfortable hotel beds my wife and I ever slpet in. This time, we had one of those temperpedic (sp?) matresses...i.e. foam that seems to mold around your body. Far less happy with that...though I am sure some like it. It felt like we were sleeping on sand and also made the bed hot, IMO. Much perferred the old-style matress, this would cause us to reconsider staying there again as we never felt we got a great night sleep. Fourth, the water pressure in our room was problematic. There were problems, when we mentioned it to the desk they seemed to hop to and get it fixed, but it seems like more problems with water pressure were looming, given the hotel re-habbing. Overall, we continue to like this hotel. Having a full kitchen available as well as living room and eat-in dinning room for the price we paid in Beverly Hills/Westwood was terrific.

That night a noisy party started up at about 2:00 a.m. I called the front desk, and after about an hour a security guard shut down the party. The next three nights I stayed in a non-smoking room.

He told us to go and surprisingly the room was ready so we did the check in and get to the room. It was a nice room, a little bit dark because the best rooms facing the pool are the suites ones but really big and well decorated. We had a jr suite wich had a full kitchen inside, with oven, microwave, fridge and anything you may need to cook and have lunch or dinner. The bed was really big and comfy, we had a nice sofa and a huge TV. The bathroom was really good, made of marble and with thow bathrobes and slippers. Everything was spotless and when we get to the room at night we had the bed open for us and the light switched on. The service was great and the maid service too. The only bad thing is that there was no breakfast included (but that\u00c2\u00b4s for sure the same in this class of hotels). Also they offered us valet parking for 15 $ per night which we declined because there was a lot of free parking outside on the street.

My guest who uses a cane and I ended up walking up 3 flights of stairs to get to the room. I asked for a room change and was told that I could pay for a luxury room at a rate of $250/nt and that they were sold out for the other room categories. For that money I would have stayed at the Luxe on Sunset or LeMontrose. Some positives include: the room is close to UCLA area and valet parking is only $15/day which is a bargain for LA hotels. You also get a robe in the bathroom. The people were nicer than average and try to be helpful albeit in that aloof kinda manner.
