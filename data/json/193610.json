This hotel is absolutely filthy and not worth a single cent! We were given an ensuite room on the top floor - the carpet was visibly grey (from its original cream colour) and looked like it has not been cleaned for years, heater did not work, toilet could not flush properly and floors creaked all the time. We avoided heading back at all cost until the night when we had to rest. We were very angry that we had been transferred from our four star hotel to this one that is not even worth one star. The only comforting point is that the hotel is a 3 minute walk from the tube station, but we would have rather walked further in the cold for one that is worth our money.

The hotel is very secure you have to ring a bell and they let you in through the CCTV camera's on the door. We stayed on the 4th floor room number 41, It was abit small but VERY reasonable it was suitated on the back of the hotel over looking other houses, (but this did not both us) There is only stairs no lift, so i would not recommend this hotel to anyone with mobility issues as we struggled up them and we are both in our early 20's!!! The breakfast is RUBBISH that what does let it down. you have to ask if you want Tea or coffee and you either have a cooked of 1 sausage, 1 bacon, 1 hashbrown and 1 fried egg Which is all nearly cold, but it takes 10 minutes to get to you!!

Breakfast in the morning was not good, with the english breakfast especially not recommended and the cornflakes probably had a sale by date of last year.

We though we would 'overlook' the bad reviews on this site - they must have been having a bad day or something. Everything was going well. We arrived - checked in and made our way up to our room which was on the 4th floor. Carpet was in need of replacement, but not too bad. However as we started to look around we could see a few problems. There seems to be a bit of a damp problem or something as the paper and paint seemed to be coming away from the walls/ceiling. Made a note to myself not to wear high heels on the way out that afternoon as the carpet on the loft staircase was nearly threadbare and the banister not attached very well to the wall. On our way across the landing there were 2 bottles of Becks - one unopened, one half empty against the wall. They remained there for the whole 2 days we were there, alongside the hoover which seemed to have no permanent storage (If it did it was never put away). The room was OK (we think we were in the right one as one of the numbers was missing). In need of a good paint but clean enough with a good view. The bathroom wasn't great however. There was grime in the bottom of the toilet - obviously too old now to be scrubbed off. The sink wasn't properly attached to the wall and was wobbly. You couldn't lean on it as it was held only by a bit of sealer and the pipes behind it. The light fitting was hanging out of the ceiling and you could see the wires. Decided it would be best to have a shower with the door open to reduce the chance of electrocution! Shower did have good power and the water was always hot. We noticed that the pillows on the bed were those thin ones that you usually get when you go abroad so on the way out that night I asked the receptionist if she could sent a couple of extra pillows up for us. She politely told us that we could have extra pillowcases but no pillows. Little bit strange but decided not to persue it as she obviously didn't speak much English. I ended up with a folded up blanket under my head that night and other half used his fleece. Breakfast was served until 10am. We headed down about 9.15 to be greeted by lovely cat food in a bowl right next to the entrance to the breakfast room. After looking at what other people in the room were eating we decided that we would have cornflakes and toast. The breakfasts were swimming in grease and didn't really look like they had been cooked using the greatest of ingredients. The cornflakes never arrived. Probably due to the language barrier I think. The toast was ok - more bread than toast but edible. We packed and made a fairly swift exit after that. There is more I could say but I've waffled on for long enough now.
