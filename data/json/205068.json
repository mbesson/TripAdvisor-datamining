The room given to us was comfortable and very european (read: old world) in ambience. It had a tv and ref. Beds were comfortable. The bathroom was ok. What really impressed us was it was located literally at the back of The Vatican, so it was just a 5 minute walk from the hotel. We had to pay for wifi access but the price was reasonable and service was fast. This is why we opted to stay here again when we went to Rome in Oct. 2011, despite the higher room rate that was quoted (a difference of about 30 euros per night). However, we were quite disappointed when we did not get the same things that we had previously. The rooms that were given to us were very old, needed a paint job, very noisy at night (we're not sure if it was the plumbing or just outside noise) that we hardly had any sleep, and they were a lot smaller than the last time. Breakfast was unspectacular and the breakfast room was so small so everyone got in each other's way. Also, one guy at the reception could hardly speak english so it was really difficult to communicate what we wanted. This to me is important because what's the point in working at the reception of a hotel when you cannot communicate in a language other than your own?

At check in, the front desk clerk, a young woman was not totally unpleasant, but not helpful either. She did speak English, but had no interest in answering a couple of tourist type questions. We encountered the same reception with the three desk clerks we dealt with over the course of our stay, borderline rude, not at all helpful. The room was typical for a mid-priced European hotel, one twin bed, and two twins pushed together to make a double bed. There was a TV, small desk and armoire, no actual closet, we stacked our suitcases on top of each other. The bathroom was small and the shower, well, lets just say if you are even a few pounds overweight, you will not be able to get into the shower. Truly, the opening was so small my not-at-all overweight husband barely got in when he turned sideways. If you dropped the soap and tried to retrieve it, you could not bend forward as your head would be pressed against the shower wall. Breakfast was included in the price (I paid 150 euro per night) and this was good, pastry, meat, cheese, hard rolls, orange juice and the best coffee I have ever had. Once again, the woman who served breakfast, and made the coffee (no self serve coffee - she brings it on a tray, with steamed milk) was unpleasant and made you feel not welcome. Everyone ate in silence or whispering, the atmosphere was not friendly and everyone was there to enjoy Rome and their hotel stay. There is a restaurant a door or two down from the hotel, Caffe Vittoria, which was good, with nice, helpful waiters and good prices. We ate there three times as our waiter remembered us each time and was the only nice person we encountered during our stay in Rome. Okay - the good - the location is amazing. You walk out the door, cross the street and walk under a pedestrian tunnel. When you walk out of the tunnel, you are entering St.. Peter's square and the Basilica is looming over you - an awe-inspiring sight. We could see the dome of St. Peter's from our hotel window. The wait to get into the Basilica (and into the Sistine Chapel) was at least three hours every single day. It is worth it to be stopped by one of the young people selling tours (three are represented) and pay the 45 euro to skip the line and take the 2-4 hour tour. Once you are in and the tour is over, you can stay until it closes at 4:30. Everyone gets 15 minutes in the Sistine Chapel, but no time limit on anything else. I also recommend the 48 hour pass on one of the three open air bus tours - we did the 110 bus for 20 euro each. It takes about an hour to make the circuit and it is hop on/hop off at any of the stops, which are the main sights of Rome. The buses arrive at the various stops every 15-20 minutes. The main queue is right outside of St. Peter's Square. We also took the subway for one euro each and this was fine, but the route is limited. On the city bus back to the train station, the bus was jammed and my husband pulled a pickpocket's hand out of his pocket - the guy got nothing and jumped off at the next stop, but no one on the bus was even remotely interested in the thief being stopped until he could be handed over to one of the numerous police officers standing on various corners. Rome is beautiful, we had great weather, but I have never been anywhere else where the people are this rude and not helpful, from taxi and bus drivers, police officers and the staff of any store or hotel it was not a pleasant experience dealing with the people of Rome.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cGood Location - service ??\u201d", "Author": "CrazyCruzer", "ReviewID": "UR96919379", "Content": "the location is excellent, the breakfast is wonderful but the rooms are old and tired.

My girlfriend was working in Rome for a month and I just needed this place to sleep for three nights while I visited her. At first, the hotel looked very small from the outside and it was no different inside.The reception was very small. The lift to the rooms was very old-style indeed e.g. you stepped into a wooden 'box' and closed the two tiny wooden doors behind you - not for the faint hearted ! The bedrooms were reasonably large though and the bed was MASSIVE. It was comfortable as well.The shower area was quite small though although it was clean I didn't have breakfast over the course of my stay as I preferred to lie in. The main positives were the proximity to the Vatican and the Metro and also the price was fairly reasonable. Also, although the hotel was small and old fashioned, it had a nice atmosphere. You really felt you were in the old side of Rome. It was my first trip to Rome so I enjoyed the feeling of being in an atmospheric location The negatives were that the doors to the bedroom were very 'flimsy' e.g. it would have been very easy for someone to break into the room, the staff at the reception desk were fairly nice and attentive but it was impossible to get through to them when I asked them could they order a taxi for my girlfriend at night (she had to board with others as she was on a course in the Vatican). Her accomodation was a mile from the hotel and I wasn't happy to let her walk back to it as there were lots of badly-lit roads that I was afraid to let her walk down on her own. On the first night, I successfully got the receptionist to order a taxi but there was no such luck on the next two nights and I had to walk her home - a round trip of two miles after midnight - not nice.

I had a single room which was more spacious than I was expecting. I was a little apprehensive about this hotel based on the reviews that I read on this website. The major complaints seemed to be about noise from within the hotel and bathrooms that flooded. I will say that I did not have any problems regarding my bathroom, although I did happen to overhear another patron discussing this issue at the front desk. Apparently his shower drain was not operating too well and flooded the bathroom with water. As far as noise is concerned, that's a problem for me. I had alot of trouble getting to sleep due to people slamming the elevator doors. Once I had an issue with a another guest banging on a tambourine and singing badly at 11pm, but that's certainly not the hotel's fault - just a rude patron with bad rhythm and a horrible voice to say the least. I should also mention the good things. It is in a very good location. In 2 minutes you can walk to the Vatican City. This worked well for me. After attending a papal audience I was able to get back to the hotel very quickly. Some good restraunts/cafes are located just outside the hotel. I was fond of walking across St.Peters square at night and grabbing an evening meal in the Borgo area on the north side of Vatican. My favorite night spot was a club called \"Alexanderplatz\", a jazz club located just north of the Vatican. The hotel does have a nice breakfast available and the staff was very helpful. My room was always very clean. The 64 bus stops right in front of the hotel. This is great because this bus just happens to travel between St.Peters and Termini Station via Corso Vittorio Emanuele. In conclusion, if you think you can stand a little ambient noise from the traffic of people returning to their rooms at night, I can recommend this hotel since you will not find a much better price/location combination.

The room was big and spacious for 3 people. However, we found the toilet in need of a bit of renovations. At each flush, the water pipes seemed like they were going to explode and made a disturbing loud noise throughout the hotel. Also, with every usage of the sink tap, water would flow from the bottom onto the floor. And the shower stale, we found, was built for someone who weighted no more than 100 pounds.
