It is old, not that clean, not a good breakfast, extremely rude staff! If you want to go to Istanbul, choose one of the nice small hotels in Sultanahmet. They are much nicer and cheaper. There are multiple reasons why we did not like this hotel: 1. The staff was VERY rude and not helpful. Even though our reservation started on the 15th and we arrived there only early on the 16th, our room was not ready. A very rude lady at the reception told us that the room will be ready only at 12. After I showed her that our reservation started one day ago, she still said she does not have a room ready...Eventually (very annoyed and giving me very evil looks) she gave us a room with 2 single beds...I went back downstairs and asked for a room with one bed (that is what we had reserved...). She literally started yelling at me saying \"See your reservation? It says one standard room; it doesn't say how many beds!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was quite shocked of how she can really shout at me.... After discussions, she eventually told us maybe a room with one bed will be ready later.... My husband and I were celebrating one year since our engagement and my birthday so you can imagine this was a horrible way to start our day... 2. The taxis they bring to the hotels only want to rip you off! Here's the story: we wanted to go out in the evening so we asked one of the staff how much a taxi fare would be until the place where we want to get. He said at around 20 TL. Someone else from the staff offered to call a taxi for us. We were waiting outside but the taxi didn't show up so my husband wanted to just stop a taxi on the street. The hotel staff told him \"no, please wait, YOUR taxi is coming\"... Unfortunately we waited and \"our\" taxi arrived... The first thing the guy told us is that if he puts the meter on, it will be 65 TL (over 3 times more than what a normal fare is...) and if we agree that he drives without a meter on, it will be 45 TL (still more than twice the normal fare). My husband told him to put the meter on. He drove us around in circles for about one hour... we knew where we had to get and we realized he's driving on the opposite direction...Anyway, after being on the car for one hour, we just got out near a metro station and took the metro... So, what do you think: is it just a coincidence that the hotel insisted that we wait for this particular taxi? 3. Terrible breakfast. It was really not something to look forward to... 4. The walls are very very thin so we could clearly hear our neighbors talking, shouting, using the shower, the toilet..., you could hear EVERYTHING!!!! Even if someone was on the hallway, speaking, you could clearly hear them... 5. The AC was very loud; we just had to leave it off most of the time. 6. We did not have soap in the room at the beginning and we only had one bath towel... 7. The room was very dark, there was a window but it was facing an interior yard, towards the room where the breakfast was... 8. The bed and pillows were very uncomfortable. 9. The hotel is NOT in Sultanahmet, as they claim. It is 5 minutes to the tram station and then 3 tram stations until you get to Sultanahmet. So bottom line, we had a horrible experience there. Please don't choose this hotel. Istanbul is such a great city and it would be a shame to remember such a bad experience...", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place for Breakfast\u201d", "Author": "marshfoot", "ReviewID": "UR117896687", "Content": "I have stayed here on numerous occasions, the Hotel is Ideally situated close to all tourist attractions and within a short taxi ride (Cheap) to taxim Square and Istabul caddessi the main shopping lane.

You might find this hotel a suitable option if you intend to do a lot of sightseeing in Sultanahmet and won't spend much time in the hotel room. My room had a nice view to the Suleiman mosque but that could not make up the poor maintenance of the room. It was very dusty and dirty. The cleaning staff didn't change the plastic bag of the bathroom rubbish bin, just took the rubbish out of it. When I decided to change the bag myself I discovered the rubbish bin was so dirty that my hands smelled for a couple of hours afterwards, despite of washing. The hotel has good amenities but they are not free of charge for the customers. Using the tiny pool on the rooftop costs 10 euro. On the ground floor they have a sauna but it would have cost some 30 dollars to use it. This hotel seems to be favoured by Russian tourist groups. They also have Russian satellite channels on TV. I didn't like Sultanahmet area especially much. The vendors on the streets and in the Grand Bazaar are very pushy and everybody was talking to me in Russian (I am not Russian even though I look like it). If you are not very much into the touristy thing stay in Taksim instead of Sultanahmet! Istanbul has very good public transport and a ticket costs only 1,5 lira. You may hop into the metro straight at the Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk airport. I went to the Asian side (\u00c3\u0153skudar) twice just because it's fun to ride a ferry across Bosphorus. There are several docks on the both sides where you can catch a ferry.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jeddah, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cvery poor the picture in hotle site dffrent than real\u201d", "Author": "maherabdul", "ReviewID": "UR80751961", "Content": "the bath room not clean , a/c very bad you cant controled , is atomaric the is the first time see hotle they control the a/c not you , the below not clean", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "syria", "Title": "\u201c.Elegant hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "ghalia-alshareef", "ReviewID": "UR68625769", "Content": "we use to stay there mounthly for more than tow years!!

The reception staff was the most accomodating. They went out of their way to find us alternatives to their suggestions for things like the Turkish bath. One of the reception supervisor even offered for me to use his laptop because I couldn't get Windows Live Messenger to sign in from the guest computer. They let us have the iron board for free (everything in Turkey is chargable). The hotel is walking distance from the tram station and 2 stops away from the Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Haggia Sophia. The hotel is also around the corner from te local market which is a worth a visit (turn right when you exit the hotel and walk down the street). A lot of food joints are just outside the hotel. The Bad: I stayed there for 4 nights with my parents and brother and another family of 3 that were with us on the tour and for all 4 mornings we had the same breakfast! Absolutely no change in the menu - scrambled & boiled eggs, sausages, stale cereals, a variety of breads and jams/preservatives, a couple of types of cheese, honey, yogurt and fruits. Another thing that I did not appreciate was their non-usage of the airconditioning system. They would turn it off and it would take a lot of phone calls to the reception to have them turn it back on. And they turn it off again in the middle of the night - I remember having woken up at 3am to make a call to the reception because my room was no less than a furnace. The rooms were slightly smaller than what you'd except from a 4 star hotel, but comfortable nonetheless. Also, the rooms & bathrooms are not sound-proof - you can hear the toilet flushing in the room next door if you're in the bathroom and can hear voices outside your door if people talk loudly. The Ugly: My father asked one of the waiters at the breakfast venue if he could make a sunny-side-up egg and he said it's for an extra 10 USD! My father even offered to make the egg himself if the waiter could just provide him with an egg and he said \"no - only what is on the menu\".", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cexcellent stay\u201d", "Author": "travelling2424", "ReviewID": "UR39832626", "Content": "I spent a few nights at this great hotel a few weeks ago. it was fantastic!! the service was great, and i got to make great use of the pool and sauna which was very clean and well looked after. the rooms are beautiful, and the service is fantastic. they also have a great disco/bar in the evenings which makes the whole experience even more grand. also got to play some bowling where i met some other friendly people, all thanks to the hotel staff. i'd recommend this hotel to anybody - families, friends, singles, couples etc. the great location also makes it worthwhile.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cit was fabulous\u201d", "Author": "betzzzy", "ReviewID": "UR36444403", "Content": "we were there last month as a family and we had such a great time. the service was excellent when we got there. the workers were very helpful. there was a receptionist named koray he introduced the hotel to us at the start. he was very helpfull with what we wanted. you will find anything you need in this hotel. we used to go play blliards or bowling after dinner. we had so much fun in the disco music was good. the pool and sauna is just great for relaxing vacationists. the rooms are very clean and room service is professionaly done.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cnice and easy\u201d", "Author": "DSay", "ReviewID": "UR35241561", "Content": "stayed at this place with a group of friends...
