The hotel itself has a shabby and dated feel and in some places the decor is shockingly bad.

My room was clean but it was also stiflingly hot all the time as the radiator appeared to be stuck on max. The only way to cool things down was to open the window, to the roar of Euston Road. The TV had no remote control and the bed was uncomfortable and at least 30 years old. The doors to each hotel room are flimsy, the locks are totally inadequate, the doors and walls do not keep out any noise. Guests coming and going and also housekeeping woke me up several times, unless you put the do not disturb sign up, cleaning staff enter you room at 8am or earlier. Breakfast was a basic english menu, the coffee was horrible but the bacon and eggs were OK, the breakfast staff seemed to stand around staring, which wasn't exactly nice, there were also too many of them, and I felt as though I was being watched.

I can't say enough how much staying here was an upsetting experience. This is THE WORST AND MOST DEPRESSING place I have ever had the misfortune of staying at. I was not comfortable going to the bathroom at night to the the shared facilities where questionable looking characters sometimes lurked in hallways. You could hear everything in other rooms and doors were slamming all night long. I gave up showering and took to bird baths in the room after unsightly dark hair clumps in the shared showers remained for a few days and I realised the showers must not get cleaned. Toilets were often not flushed and often broken...yes...it was as disgusting as it sounds. It is in a terrible neighbourhood also with no restaurants nearby that are worth going to. You will have to travel out of the area to do anything. There are moths/little bugs everywhere which get in your clothes. The staff were terrible, unfriendly and unhelpful. The \"breakfast\" was pathetic and the staff in the dining area rude and again, unfriendly and unwelcoming. There are much better places to stay in London for a similar price in better areas. There is nothing in this area worth staying near. Being near to St Pancras international is no reason to stay here as you can get to it easy enough on the tube or by taxi. You would be better going to the Oxford YHA if you are on a budget. The Oxford YHA is modern, new, spotless and in a great location.

I would say that if you are not well travelled or don't mind sharing a bathroom then this place is probably not for you. The hotel is five minutes walk from Euston station, is covered in scaffolding at the moment so it is easy to walk past it, once you get in it's fine. Check in was super fast, you collect your key from the Hall Porter (and deposit it when you go out) and there is a lift to all floors. On exiting the lift, I immediately was reminded of my former Unviersity Halls of Residence, almost a carbon copy in fact. The single room I had was pretty much like the pictures already taken by others, not overly big but big and warm enough. There is a sink and a TV. At first I thought the TV was broken as I couldn't turn it on, although after around five minutes I figured it out, it is hard wired to a light switch by the bed so you have to switch it on there first - rather funny actually but it goes with the quirkiness of the place. The room was spottlessly clean, the bedding was changed every second day. The bathrooms and WC were literally next door and were kept clean, even at night when I returned late they seemed as though they had been given a once over. I didn't experience much of an issue with banging doors, it happened occasionally but I think it's just because people to forgot to close them quietly. As for the comments about cleaners in your room, I can't understand how or why that would happen as you can lock your room easily from inside and they have Do Not Disturb notices so the previous writer must have been a little absent minded not to use either. There is a bar next to reception and the prices are so cheap. \u00a32.20 for a pint of Lager in Central London is almost too good too be true, but it is. I tried their food and again, it was excellent and cheap. Almost student prices. There seemed to be a lot of workers using the bar and eating so this seems to be their mainstay custom. Breakfast was served in the basement, again remeniscent of my University days, the staff whilst monosylabic were attentive. there was a wide selection of cooked and continental stuff and all included in the cheap rate.

It never was an upscale hotel; basic accommodation, bath down the hall, clean with very pleasant staff. Sometime recently ILH gussied up the lobby with new configuration, paint and trim. Not a good thing. In the original 1930's garb it was quaint and had a certain crude charm. No more. The new decor is pitiful. The staff has changed (the others probably aged out...and I say that with no unkindly intent) and also not for the better. Total confusion over reservations made months in advance. Desk clerk I dealt with at first bordered on surly. Second, hours later (was no longer possible to get a room even a minute before 2pm) was a little more friendly though totally confused. There is free Wi-Fi internet but only in the lobby; does not reach into the rooms. The coin-operated internet computer in the lobby offers worse odds of connection than offers a Las Vegas slot machine in winning. It's still a great value; still a very convenient location but bring lots of patience with you; you'll need it!

While it is old, it is a faded old rather than a dirty old, if you know what I mean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they obviously try to keep it clean inside the rooms and the common areas.

Anyway, after that, the process was smooth. My room was small and contained the basics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a tiny television, kettle and some cups, and a wash-basin. The toilets and showers were communal. The wardrobe was a decent size for such a small room, but the cupboard above was painted shut, so you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to have too many bags; you might end up sleeping on them! The room was recently painted, but still showed some signs of old age \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the desk was chipped and the sealing around the wash-basin was coming away. The bed was a very small single, but comfortable enough, once I got used to it sliding around the room when I got in and out of it. The continental breakfast served in the basement was terrible (possibly some sort of joke) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they actually serve up some decent food, but that is not included in the free continental \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I did not enquire how much extra it was. The slop they put on display as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd option is a ruse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you would have to be pretty desperate to try it once, let alone every day.

Ask at reception and they tell you to go to the concierge desk - it was like going round in circles. When I return to a hotel I expect ANY staff member to be able to assist me ASAP.

The hotel was so shocking that when we stopped over in the end we ended up having to laugh about it because of just how tragic the situation was! When we initially arrived we entered the reception to a pretty average looknig little hotel, there was nothing major to complain about really. The first real shock came when we was given our room key. The room key was attached to a large metal bar, and had to be handed it between leaving and coming back to the hotel. We shrugged this off because we just assumed that we had gotten what we paid for and the value hotel was hardly going to be anything amazing. Then we entered our room. The room was grimy, and had two single beds of questionable cleanliness. There was a random sink in the corner of our room, we did not know why at first. The main complaint was that our wardrobe had holes in the front of it; and that the holes had been 'filled in' with toilet tissue! As my friend pulled out a piece of tissue we asked ourselved 'What is this place?!' To top it off, the sill on the outside of our window had dirty socks on it, and there was rubbish obviously thrown out of our window and into the ditch below our room. If it was not for our good sense of humour we would have probably kicked up a fuss about the unsanitary and strange conditions we were sleeping in. As previously mentioned we had a sink in our room. There was no complimentary condiments so we had no idea why we needed water running in our room. There was shared bathroom area with toilets and a few rooms with bathubs (which had no locks I might add!) It turns out there was no sinks in our toilet or bath rooms. So it was a case of doing your stuff, then walking back into your room and washing your hands. The door handles in this hotel must be full of germs! To make our stay even more pleasant, a kind individual had left us 'a treat' in one of our toilets which was not cleaned up for the two days we spent in the hotel. We ended up making a video blog of us touring through the hotel and laughing at our misfortune, so we ended up decing the hotel was worth stopping at for the comic value of everything that is wrong with it. The one positive note I can make about the hotel was the included breakfast, which was a lovely buffet style english Breakfast. This made me feel so much better in the morning after having to try and wash my hair in an open bathroom with no shampoo or conditioner. All in all I would have to say that if I am stopping in London again with a tight budget, I would not think twice before paying the extra 20 pound or so to stop at The Premier Inn down the road.

If you're looking at going down to London for a few nights for a meeting, party or whatever then this place is more than ideal. On the way down we were worried that this place was going to be like a Mongolian slaughter house due to all the negative feedback! But seriously, take my word for it... it's fine.

He helped us sort our laptop in the lobby, to get the best routes of the underground and was in brief a true and charming professional. My partner is French and was surprised by the communal bathrooms, this didn't stop him from taking a bath for almost an hour! The water pressure was amazing in the showers, washing away the stress of travel etc. The bathrooms like the bedrooms were old, but very clean. Our room was a double, the bedding clean as were the towels and the room in general. breakfast was typical English fare but as my partner said you get what you pay for and it starts off the day. A good choice of hot English breakfast or cereals and some dried fruits. If you ask nicely they will get you some fresh toast!

Back then I vowed never to darken its door again. The weekend just past I repeated that terrible mistake. Four weeks ago I spent four wonderful days in London staying at the near by Ibis at Euston (great hotel at a good price). Then the opportunity came up of an impromptu trip but with budget constraints. This was my reasoning for parting with \u00c2\u00a384 of my hard earned cash for a room for two nights in this god forsaken dump. As you turn on to Woburn Place from Euston Road the foreboding gloom of the County hits you on the street, even the front of the building is grimy and the windows are quite possibly the dirtiest in London. As you force your way through the revolving door you are met with a large brown lobby which sets the tone for the rest of the building namely unwelcoming and inhospitable. When was this place last given a lick of paint? Check in was fairly efficient and the receptionist friendly enough. I was given my key to my cell. Cells consist of a bed, a small portable television without a remote control. A sink as there are shared bathrooms on every floor. (1 bathroom for every four bedrooms) However, the toilets are separate again to the bathroom. An uncomfortable bed with two pillows with the softness of two lumps of lead. The bed side light is a strip light which is harsh and actually brighter than he main ceiling light. I might add that the sheets appeared clean and they seem to be changed daily. Needless to say I spent two sleepless nights. The uncomfortable bed was compounded by the fact that the walls are paper thin and as no room has a bathroom there is constant flow of bedroom doors opening and closing and bathroom doors opening and closing and the sound of toilets flushing. This cacophony of doors slamming is at its height late at night as people go to bed and early in the morning. It really does not make for a restful nights sleep after a busy day of sightseeing in London. I must admit that I did not shower for the two days of my stay. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring myself to use the bathroom facilities. The bathroom closest to my cell had three soiled towels on the floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough to put me off. Nor did I make use of the dinning room, despite the fact that my \u00c2\u00a384 was for bed and breakfast. I was put off by the fact that beside the kettle in my cell was a sachet of milk that was covered in some indistinguishable grim.

Our room did not have a bath or WC despite booking reference clearly stating it should have on the printout I gave to the receptionist. The public WC's were disgusting and were decorated with the contents of someone's poorly stomach. At breakfast the \"Restaurant Manager\" was very surly and unwelcoming. All he could say was \"Continental Breakfast\". The toast had mould on it and the \"Chef\" had a stand up row with a waiter in front of all the customers. All in all a very poor experience.

I stayed at this hotel from 1st - 3rd Feb 2008. If you are looking for relaxing romantic eveninigs soaking in a private bubble bath then this is not the hotel for you, but if you want somewhere cheap to leave your belongings, shower and sleep then this hotel is perfect. The staff on reception were effecient and check in was very simple. We obtained the key to the room form the porter and went up to an averaged sized twin room. On first glace it seems very sparse, but everything we needed was there. There was two quite comfy beds, each with fresh sheets and blankets and two pillows. There were extra blankets in the drawerss which we didn't use. At the front of the room was a sink and some little soaps, drawers, towels, a small kettle, tea and coffee and spoons etc, a TV and some leaflets about the area. The radiator was lovely and warm and the wardrobes has hangers in them. The room overlooked the main street and traffic could be heard whether the window was open or not - but it wasn't very loud and definately did not disturb me sleeping! The rooms were pretty clean - jut a little dust in some of the cracks and behind the radiator. The shower rooms were literally 3 steps away on the other side of the corridor and I didn't see another person use them the whoel time I was there despite the hotel being rather busy. They were sparse but the water was hot and they were kept clean. Between the four rooms at the end of our corridor was two showers and three loos, all lockable. Breakfast surprised me as I wasn't expecting much for \u00c2\u00a351 per night for two people! There was a huge selection of sausgaes, tomatoes, bacon, two types of egg, toast, rolls, butter, jams, marmalades, fruit, and lots of different cereral as well as fruit juices, teas and coffees. There were also alot of attentive members of staff at breakfast too. The key had to be left with reception whenever we left the hotel, but that was no problem. The porters were very effecient, even at 3am when we came in from a night out and asked him to point us in the nearest place that sold food! It took us eight minutes to walk back from Camden and about five minutes to get to Kings Cross - the location was brilliant, just accross the road from Euston tube/ train station and down the road from Euston Square staion. The hotel was generally very quiet despite it being quite full. I'd stay there again in a shot.

The second time, the bedlight in the room did not work, and the bathroom light again... It is REALLY hard to sleep well here. The windows are single glazed, and avoid the rooms on the main road like the plague, or the rush hour traffic at 6-7am will wake you up. Also, every door has a 'slam shut' function and the walls are really this, so every time someone leaves their room is like a bomb going off next to you. There are also no proper showers. You have to stand in a bath. The floors in the bathroom are rotting linoleum. The place is ludicrously overheated in the winter. The one positive thing about the hotel is breakfast....and price.

The experience is a bit like going through a time warp. The rooms are small clean but not en-suite. However, I never had to wait to get access to a bathroom. The plumbing was old-fashioned but the showers were powerful. The signs around the hotel seemed to be 1930s originals. The bar offers a glimpse London pubs as they used to be. Even the bar prices seemed several years out of date! Breakfast was traditional and substantial. Porters, receptionists and bar staff were polite and helpful.

The lift, in hindsight, was the best thing about the hotel, as it actually worked. The room was large enough to stick a single bed in, with a vanity unit at the end. I would hazard a guess that the Malboro cowboy had stayed in the room before me, as it stunk like someone had smoke 24-7 in there for the past 3 years. This was somewhat strange, as there was a 2 inch gap between the top of the sash window and the frame, which provided ventilation, whether you liked it or not. My colleague then knocked on my door after seeing his room, and to quote \"I didn't realise places like this still existed in England\". I had a terrible nights sleep as the hotel is located right next door to an ambulance depot, and is on one of the main roads running through Bloomsbury. The window problem clearly accentuated the noise penetration. It is worth noting that one toilet is shared between about 8 bedrooms, so if you need the loo, it can be a frustrating time. For the blokes out there, the sink in the room is just about reachable. The breakfast was administered by a guy who looked suspiciously like Pol Pot, and ruled over the breakfast room with a similar attitude to his doppleganger.
