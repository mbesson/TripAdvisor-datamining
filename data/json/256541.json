So let me tell you about a small detail that really made my day. Once I opened one of the draws I saw a universal adaptor. WOW, I know it's a small thing but it just brought back memories of the times I was overseas and it was such a pain to get a universal adaptor brought to my room, or I had to collect it from reception or pay a deposit for it etc, etc. I found the hotel very decent, very close to Darling Harbour and also the restaurant serving the breakfast was top notch. Plenty of fresh fruits and quite a large variety of them. The room was clean, the staff was great and very helpful with directions and maps and truly helpful. One minor pain is that the parking lot is in a building accross the road from the hotel. Literally you get out of the hotel, you cross the street and you are into the parking building. It's a bit of a pain because you need to waste a minute or two to have your ticket validated (if your room rate includes parking) by the helpful guys from valet. Of course, to avoid this you can pay extra and use their valet parking. The room was clean, not the largest I have stayed in but nevertheless it served us well. The shower had good pressure and everything was working well (air con). There was also an in room safe. Great and comfortable beds as well.

The hotel is a fairly typical business hotel with all the amenities you would look for in the rooms. I did not use many of the other hotel facilities, so not in a position to comment on them. Breakfast options are quite good with the buffet, but pricey like most good hotels in the country. The location is great with Darling Harbour, Queen Victoria Building, Pitt Street Mall and the Grand Central Station all within short walking distance. There are numerous eateries of all kinds surrounding the hotel in each direction; best choice for dinner would be Darling Harbour with its nice views and activity.

The room had a nice view of the harbor and the front desk staff were very friendly during check in and check out. They even allowed me to check in a few hours early as my flight landed at 6am. The location is also great for access to downtown Sydney and the Darling Harbor. The room itself was average. The staff were not great about tidying up. I found dirty bath towels given to me and a dirty face towel crumpled up underneath the bedside table while looking for something that had rolled onto the ground. My room had extremely loud pipes going through the room. Everytime my neighbor took a shower, it sounded like a pipe had burst and was flooding into the bathroom. This might not have been a big deal except twice my neighbor got up at about 5AM to shower (jet-lag?). When I called, they told me that no one has ever complained about the noise, and they would have to send someone up to check it out before they could change my room. When the guy showed up, there was no noise at that moment (as neighbor was not showering at that exact moment), and they considered the problem solved. Until 5AM the next morning of course...my last night, so I gave up. My room had barely a wi-fi signal. I PAID for internet service for an hour and about 20 minutes in, the signal died altogether.

We stayed on the 8th floor overlooking the harbour, it was so worth the extra expense. Lying in bed looking at the view of Darling Harbour was a view to die for. Our room had a balcony taking in a panoramic site. The down side to this was if you looked down from the balcony it was a extremely busy road even so we couldn't hear any traffic noise,especially at rush hour,and there was no seating or table, which would have been fabulous on a warm evening as the views day or night are spectacular, I guess this could have been for safety reasons. The room was a good size and clean. It had all the usual things to make your stay comfortable,fabulous big bed,desk,alarm clock,safe,kettle,mini bar,air-conditioning, hair-dryer, miniature items in the bathroom,shampoo etc. The bathroom was small but adequate and clean. In the corridor area was a ice machine, We opted to stay at the hotel for breakfast which was $35 each.approximately \u00c2\u00a322 each,very expensive. But on the whole Sydney is very expensive. The quality and quantity was outstanding. Coffee is already on your table as you are seated. I would request tea as not a coffee drinker and tea would be swapped in its place. Also freshly cooked eggs are ordered as you sit down. The items are to endless to list,but cooked items,fruit,breads cereal,continental etc.Unusually there was a honey comb on the counter. We didnt stay in the hotel for the evening meal as there are many places around darling harbour to eat. We found a Resturant around the corner from the hotel on Sussex street, Tony Romas,Steak Ribs and Seafood. Unfortunately for us it was our last night, Good price and lovely food. So wish we had found it before hand. Also a great convenience store facing the hotel, great for milk, snacks etc. Word of warning for many if not all of the Restaurants charged a $5 surcharge each on a Sunday. Ouch! for large parties. The hotel has two computers you can use for free in the reception area which was useful to contact home,and comfortable sofas while watching TV. The concierge was extremely helpful,we had booked a trip,which our pick up hadn't turned up, and he rang them for us,problem solved. They were always friendly,and polite. Check in/out was efficient. I would definitely go back to Four Points by Sheraton. It isn't the cheapest but the service in all areas was outstanding, nothing was overlooked.

We booked a deal on the hotel website that included both buffet breakfast and parking, so straight off the bat, the value was excellent. This was our first stay at the Four Points. From the moment we arrived, the service was well above par. Every staff member we spoke to or walked passed were so very friendly and helpful and really made us feel welcome, and not just \"another customer\". This was very refreshing and a very nice touch. It put a smile on our faces, and was one of the highlights of the hotel. We booked a Harbour View room, having seen some photos of the views from these rooms on the internet. We were not disappointed. We were given a room on the 7th floor. The views of Darling Harbour were fantastic and well worth the few extra $. The room itself was a good size with pretty much everything we needed. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and a nice luxury. There was a nice big tv, with a decent range of channels available. The decor was neat and clean, though some of the brown furniture could do with updating/modernising (if I'm being picky). The minibar had a good variety of drinks and snacks. My one complaint here is the cost of room service. We found it to be extremely expensive. Probably more so than our stays in the Hilton and Westin. For example, we ordered two cups of tea, which ended up costing us $16.50 (including a $6.50 delivery fee). The bathroom was clean and functional. If I HAD to be picky, the \"shower in the bath\" was the only thing I could say wasn't quite up to par with other hotels in this price range, and it was a little on the small side and the decor possibly a \"little\" outdated. But this is being very picky, and neither myself or my wife had any problems with it at all. The hotel provided lotions, mouthwash, comb etc were a nice touch and came in handy. The hotel's location is fantastic. A 5 minute stroll takes your into the heart of Darling Harbour and the endless bars, restaurants, museums and other attractions. And there's always a taxi sitting out front ready to take you elsewhere in the city. The buffet breakfast - wow! Such a massive selection! Fruit, cereal, cooked food (eggs, bacon, sausage etc), breads, cold meats, fruit juices, tea, coffee. There really is something for everyone. And it's all so fresh and tasty.

This hotel is located right in the darling harbour which is on the edge of the greater downtown business area. It is walking distance to everything. The hotel staff are very helpful, polite.

It has australian flavor to it. Lots of choices. I enjoyed the food with local infusion to it. That is why I travel. I do not want to go to a different country and expect locals fit my way of living in America. As far as price, yes, it is very expensive but so is everything else in Sydney. I do not see they are more expensive when compared to everything else in Sydney unless you eat in McDonald or burger kings. even McDonald is more expensive than In USA. The rooms are clean and classic to Four Points anywhere. The parking is 45 AUS dollars which is cross street from the hotel. You need to speak to bell person to get the ticket. They will give you the ticket which will allow you come in and out. Sydney publici transportation is very convenient. However, if you are rush for time, you maybe better off by getting on taxi. It actually make sense to use taxi the cost of the taxi is probably less than renting a car. Car rental is very expensive since your credit card does not cover the liability. You will have to pay extra to cover it. There are shuttles to take you to the door of your hotel. The cost is exactly the same as you take public transportation from airport. I have no clue why. Figure that one for me? It costed us about 90 dollars per day to rent a car not to mention that you need to pay tolls, parking and very expensive gas. however, we were able to go far away to hunter valley which is their wine country and to blue mountain which is a must when you go to Sydney.

First off, the carpet looks old and worn out. I don't know if its simply the shade and pattern of the carpet but it gives of a weary look. The wooden furniture are very dated and could stand to be upgraded. The bathroom still uses white square tiles that reminds me of old houses. The worst is the shower/bath tub combination.

In the 1980s, the New South Wales government formed the Darling Harbour Authority, which was tasked with modernising the area. Most of the old stone houses were demolished, to make way for modern roads, hotels and restaurants clustered around the new entertainment precinct of Darling Harbour and Cockle Bay. The biggest of these modern hotels became the Four Points by Sheraton Darling Harbour. It's actually a grand hotel - the biggest in Sydney - and its 630 rooms and suites offer you either Cityside or Harbour Views. I've stayed at the Four Points many times, and I recommend you book a Harbour View room or suite. They're a little more expensive, but their view of Darling Harbour (and the ferries and boats constantly coming and going on it) is worth the price. Plus you can see the fireworks in Cockle Bay on Saturday night. I like the staff at the Four Points. They're apparently trained to put the guest first, and it shows in their courtesy and their willingness to help. I like the rooms: they're clean and well-appointed. I like the food in the restaurant, and room service is also fast. Most of all, I like the cute and historic Dundee Arms Hotel ... one of Sydney's earliest pubs, which is right beside the hotel entrance. This historic building went from being a pub in the 1800s to being the office of the family business of Sir William McMahon (who later became Prime Minister of Australia) to being the studio of Australia's greatest tonal impressionist painter Graeme Inson and his life partner Ivy Shore. Prime ministers and governor generals, captains of industry, prominent judges and entertainers like Barry Humphries had come here to have their portraits painted by Inson or Shore; and portraits by both artisis now hang in the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra. When the Darling Harbour Authority pulled down most of the other old historic buildings in Sussex Street, it forced these two award-winning Australian artists out. But happily, the Sheraton Group treasured the artistic connection with this historic old building. When they converted it back into a pub, they gave it a distinct atmosphere and a unique selling point by placing portraits, paintings and historic documents belonging to Ivy Shore and Graeme Inson on its walls. You must visit the Dundee Arms, not just for its full bar and its excellent menu, but also for its artistic heritage: you can both read and see that on its walls. The pub even has its own ghost (and details of her are also in newspaper cuttings on the walls!). For me and for many others, this gives the Four Points a uniqueness amongst all Sydney hotels. In addition to history, the Four Points is also handy to the trains and busses and ferries, and the shops and restaurants of Sydney city and Darling Harbour. It's an ideal place to stay. I only have two quibbles about this otherwise excellent hotel: First, flying in the face of best international service, the Four Points by Sheraton Darling Harbour still does not offer free wifi in its rooms. Instead, it charges a fee for this, but does offer free wifi in the lobby if you're prepared to bring your laptop and sit there while you conduct your e-business. Second, the Four Points has just started charging guests a fee for paying by credit card. Again, this flies in the face of best international hotel practice.

Travel to the airport was made much easier with the use of the Hire Car. At a flat rate of $50 it was also the most economical method for us. The driver was friendly, a safe driver, and happy to point out landmarks to us. The car was comfortable, clean, and the most relaxing way to the airport. I can't thank the driver enough for his exemplary service and fantastic personality. In terms of cons, the list is small, and feedback was able to be easily provided to the hotel through use of there comments card. *The rooms only had a blanket on the beds,I am assuming this is the summer arrangement, however Sydney was cold this summer for those from further North. No extra blankets were in the cupboard. *The toiletry range was not the best quality, particularly the shampoo and conditioner were very low quality. *The bath towels need an update as they were small, thin, and rough. *The bathroom exhaust/vent was not very powerful and even with a standard shower the room fogged up *The complimentary late check-out was confirmed with check-in staff that morning, but was this was not passed on to the cleaners; so a clean had been started with one of the towels removed, a little annoying for getting ready to leave. *The bathrooms could do with a touch of an update in the coming year or so (older toilets that are hard to flush/ older fittings) But all in all with so many pro's the con's seemed like barely a glitch.

My hubby booked our tenth wedding anniversary as a surprise getaway. He chose Sheraton Fourpoints, as we had been there for work previously, and because of its great location. I was happy enough, because of the beautiful view, close proximity to darling harbor and previous experiences. When we checked into our suite (normally $500, but we got 3 nights for price of 2) I was pretty happy with the room and view - although it did seem a very slightly dated and the bath was a little lack old. I called, mentioned my slight dissapointment with the bathroom (cracked bath). The lovely receptionist couldnt move me (fully booked) but offered complimentary breakfast for our stay as a goodwill gesture. I was very appreciative and continued on with our romantic anniversary weekend. I had no clue my husband organised the MOST ROMANTIC EVENT EVER!!! The absolutely lovely staff members (Flavia, Sarah and YAMMI) helped my hubby pull off a private dinner for two on the rooftop - with a fully personalised menu from the CHEF and access to the best view of the fireworks. We were treated like royalty, and with a $1000 minimum spend, I expect to be - but YAMMI was wonderful and made us feel even more special than she had to. This helped make the night SOOO MEMORABLE! I would suggest in the future the events team have the little \"extras\" my hubby organised himself eg. FAIRY LIGHTS in the trees, heaps of candles (even use his idea of a pathway to the table) romantic italian music, a private open air cinema etc etc.. The only hiccup is that we were told we could view the fireworks from the balcony closest to the waterfront, and the security officer was very cold and standoffish and told us off - which was a big DOWNER after being treated so magically. Yammi was AMAZING - thank you for taking so many precious pictures xx The next day we were called by the HOTEL manager, Steve, who offered us an upgrade to the GOVERNER SUITE - retailing for $2k a night. He met and escorted us to the room, and warmly wished us the best anniversary weekend. Throughout our stay, we were often spoilt, and even at breakfast, we were delivered two mimosas in celebration of our anniversary. I really believe the service goes above and beyond any experience to date (I am an event manager and have had my share of hospitality experiences).

I had also mentioned for no other reason, except I was asked, why were we returning, mentioning that it was an emotional journey to sydney this visit. Enough said .. we were upgraded to a suite on the 15th floor, looking directly over the harbour. It was delightful. Our favorite waiter PAT was still there to also look after us at meals especially my husband, and most staff bent over backwards to make our stay as pleasant and smooth as possible. I do have one complaint (oh dear!) That is whilstsitting at the Dundee arms enjoying a bevy or two (outside), the music was considerably and I feel unneccsarily loud. I approached the bar person, who by the way had an attitude and smiling problem, if he could turn the music down slightly, to which he answered that it was set on standard control well that's a newby! Standard control!!! Okay I thought so be it standard hum bug and walked off. However the next day (we stayed for 3 days) we went and had a coffee and took it outside and guess what punters - the volume was down, new bar person so i was inquisitive and asked what was the go? Standard control through the day and night pulling my hair out I couldn't get my head around the stupidity of an excuse of how loud the THE BAR STAFF WANTED IT! I maybe a blonde but rooollly please bar people... apart from that hiccup our stay was yet again fantastic and we were made to feel at home without the staff being to intrusive or inept. I would highly recommend this property and even joining the starwood group, as we had been with Accor for many years and when we ran into the most ignorant executive chef at the sofitel who not only argued with the waitress and the maitre De, but a guest (me) about a special dietary requirement for my husband advising all of us in no particular terms that he did not want toto do it for my husband because it would ruin his food. Oh gosh red flag waved in face, no triole red flag so i went directly to the manager as one would do, complained very strongly and commenced to pack our bags to leave. However we were asked to stay on with the sofitel compliments(this was really not the outcome we wanted but admittedly it did help at the time). Needless to say as soon as we arrived home cancelled our Accor and haven't looked backwards as yet with starwood. Starwoods rewards vouchers are a great incentive also, just like Accor use to be, but they as a chain have become to frugal and hiring staff who should be employed to feed zoo animals with their attitudes.

The bathrooms do not match the aesthetics of the rooms with all room/suite categories having shower over bath, something clearly directed at the Japanese market 10 years ago but in most Asian pacific hotels of this standard are now moving towards separate bath/shower configurations. The same bathroom amenities are also used in suites as in the lower category rooms, this s definitely something the hotel could improve n and the towels small and are like sand paper, not good quality at all. The king bed was very comfortable but again the linen needs replacing. The hotel is in a great location with the harbour at the doorstep and it's million dollar views. The concierge staff are fantastic, very helpful as are the management team. We had an issue with the room service food but this was promptly rectified. In summery this is an average-good 4 star property with the potential to be a fantastic property and I feel we just had a few things go wrong all at once. We have been informed that this property is due for a significant refurb in the new year and we look forward to returning there when these refurbs are completed.

If you want to read directly to the tips, go to the end of this review for some of mine. Location wise, this hotel is perfect. As you can see from other reviewers. Its very close to darling harbor and definitely saves you cab money. Here are the things you'll be happy about by staying here: 1. Some staff (not all) are tremendously friendly and helpful. I was handled by Jessica at the reception and she made our day. We asked for an early check in after a tiring overnight flight, and in less than 10 minutes, we're given the card and ready to go to our room. Thanks Jessica :). The luggage handlers / bell boys are extremely friendly. 2. Location is almost perfect. Its very close to darling harbor. But a bit not impressed with the followings: 1. Room Size. For a price like this, the room is a bit too small. The furnishings are a bit old and just below our expectation of a hotel this scale and grade. Bathroom size is also a bit small. The ceilings of the rooms are a bit low 2. Cleanliness Yes its clean in general, but some small details are missed. In the drawers you can see some stains (not disgusting stains) just not perfectly spotless. But beds, sheets, pillows and towels are clean, don't worry. Just the details if you're a super-clean person like my wife. 3. Design I think the design of the lobby and rooms including some part of the hotels can be improved by adding details like better paintings, furnitures, lighting, color accents, etc, which should provide one certain signature theme for the hotel. With attention to detail for the design, I think guests would mind less about the price :) TIPS #1: Pick higher floors to avoid noise from traffic from the streets. TIPS #2: If you don't mind paying extra 100 AUS per night, get the harbor view. TIPS #3: Book online to their website as they re most likely provide the best offer TIPS #4: For city views, ask for the highest possible floor or your view will be obstructed by the building across.

There was one guy think his name was Alfred who was a stand out and was very helpful. Point 4. Lovely clean, spacious rooms, comfortable bed, great pillows, good nights sleep.

The hotel was at 100% capacity from the weekend so we had to wait a little while before we could be allocated a room, which was not a problem. However, as we had come off a 14hr flight we really wanted to have a shower/freshen up and as a room was not available Steve arranged for us to use the facilities in the gym area allowing us to feel a bit more human.

Gym was decent, functional for sure, few treamills, bikes, elypticals and rack of dumbells and a universal machine. Concierge and front desk staff were all super nice, helpful and welcoming.

We stayed in the same hotel eight years ago and it left us good impression, hence we decided to stay here again this time. My hubby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SPG gold member status was recognized and we were upgraded to a harbour view room during first check in and a deluxe harbour view room the second check in. Both rooms have beautiful harbour view, the difference is deluxe room is slightly bigger in size and it has a balcony. Our 2.5 year old son really enjoyed the view and he could sit behind the window for half an hour to watch the monorails, helicopters and airplanes and those boats in the harbour and was always happy and excited. One surprise was the firework show in Saturday evening; nobody informed us that there is firework show on weekend evening. We were just lucky to be at our room at that time and had a perfect view just sitting inside our room. We also watched the helicopter rescue show performed in front of maritime museum from our room. Really pleasant surprises! What we liked most about the hotel is its prime location; it is just beside darling harbour, and just 3 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk to Sydney Aquarium and Wildlife World. If you travel with children and plan to go to the above 2 places, I strongly advise you to get the combo tickets from the hotel concierge. The price is the same as what you can get from the ticket counter, but the concierge have some free photo vouchers that entitles you to take a photo with Koala in the Wildlife World which is worth AUD$19.90 each. We went for a whale watching tour and went to the Taronga Zoo, both boats departs right from Darling harbour. This can save you a lot of trouble than going to circular quay and take boat from there, especially when you are travelling with young children. There are a lot of fine restaurants in the nearby cockle bay wharf too that offer you plenty of dining options. For our second stay, we booked the\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Four Good Reasons\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package directly from the hotel website, which includes breakfast, 4 drinks (Australian wine or beer or soft drinks or coffee), late check-out at 4pm and double SPG points. We think it is a good deal at that rate. The only problem is it has been 3 weeks after we checked out and my hubby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s double points are still not in yet. Now the downside\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The room is a bit small and dated, especially the bathroom which is really cramp and there is no separate shower and bath, even for deluxe harbour view room. We later stayed at Sheraton by the park, and the room there is very big and with a huge and beautiful bathroom. We tried the seafood buffet dinner at Corn Exchange once and we found the selection is quite limited comparing with many other Starwoods properties, such as Le Meridien Kuala Lumpur or Sheraton ShenZhen.

We have stayed at many hotels in Sydney and have experienced what they have to offer, let me tell you about the Four points by Sheraton at Darling Harbour. What a hotel!! We have stayed here now over 3 times. Our first stays were satisfactory for what we wanted, these guys excel at making you feel right at home from hello, to check-in, and the rest, we were actually up-graded from our room choice to the governors suite!! As if we would decline!! The staff were incredibility friendly and nothing was a bother, the duty manager, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Byron\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was brilliant as was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chris\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who checked us in. Of course, special mention must be made to these guys, as they were our second point of contact and they were very professional and more than courteous which we feel this must be passed on to management as these are the kind of staff that very often lack the significant recognition they deserve. Also, the house keeping and room service staff are exceptional from our experience, a very special thank you to you guys also, and we sincerely hope that your special efforts do not go unrecognized by upper management. As for the catering, well, we have eaten at five star hotels all over the world, but these guys keep Sydney in play, as far as the food goes! OK, we only had in-room dining, but for the most part, from what we had, our advice is, to stay with the hotel! Do not venture too far for the best tucker, what you may find around Darling Harbour might be twice as much as what you may get at the hotel, the difference is, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in my opinion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the hotel does it better and at about half the price!! I must say even though we have stayed here previously, we only stay here when we have IT exams. This time it was my internet security exam, so a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep was essential, but, thanks to Chris and Byron we were upgraded to the Governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suite which made our stay even more exhilarating. A very special thank you to these guys and all the staff that more than fulfilled our expectation for a one night stay, we will be back and thank you so much!! First point of contact was the concierge/bag boy, (sorry I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get names) but these guys were brilliant and very warming, (please pass on to management) as was Chris at front desk. Byron was very professional in welcoming us and offering any additional services, I must say the professionalism, politeness and efficiency of the staff was exceptional. A special mention about the food, some blogs have refuted how good it is, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where they are from or what kind of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153silver-spoon upbringing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they have, but let me tell you from a world traveller, the food here is first class!! We had in-room dining and it was nothing but exceptional, by all means please try their in-room dinning menu. I would actually suggest dinning in rather than dinning out even though Darling Harbor has many food options.

Staff were all helpful and cheerful. If looking to eat out every night then fine, but if want nice meal after a tiring day in the hotel then look elsewhere... It was not a good sign, when on checking in, a handful of coupons were given to us. Coupons are not exactly classy and not what you expect of a 4* Sheraton. They are also an insult to people's intelligence. Why give everyone a coupon so that they can get the breakfast for $25 instead of $35? Am I meant to think that the receptionist chose me specially and I have got some amazing deal? It is utter nonsense. The dinner is either a la carte or buffet. You also get a coupon reducing the buffet from $80 each to $50 each if you are staying at the hotel. Who in their right mind would walk in off the street and pay $80 for a buffet...especially one as bad as this. The restaurant itself is basically in the hotel lobby. This is fine for breakfast, but not exactly nice for dinner. I don't want dinner among the conveyor belt of people walking in and out. The atmosphere is more akin to having dinner in an airport than a nice restaurant. We were at the back where it was gloomy and dark looking out into a disused adjoining room. The food consists of a good selection of seafood, soup of the day, hot selection, deserts, ice cream, cheese and biscuits. At first sight it looks a good selection, but is just incredibly ill thought through. Quality is poor, not one dish would be acceptable in any restaurant in Darling Harbour. It seemed like everything was based around keeping cost down and convenience. First up, cauliflower soup. Cauliflower and water liquidised with added salt. Taseteless, watery, no invention. Next up beef stroganoff...wait til you hear about this. Up until then, my experience of stroganoff had also been beef in a rich creamy sauce with mushrooms. This consisted of half beef, half gherkins in dark gravy (no cream detected)! The alternative was roast neck of pork. I have never seen this on a menu before and thought this cheapest of cuts was only ever used for kebabs. However, assume for one moment that someone enjoyed eating fat, you could have it with desiree potatoes (ones that were cooked properly were nice)....and now for some vegetables. The ony vegetables were chinese vegetables (bok choi and yellow beans) next to the rice. All very strange, all not very nice. This was some of the worst food I have eaten in a hotel, may be the a la carte was better.

The bath tub was dirty with someone else's hair in it. It was also a shower/bath in one. which is not very comfortable! The beds blanket was thin but over all our sleep in that bed was really comfy. The mini bar had hardly any Alcoholic beverages and other things.Also we were supposed to have an astray on our balcony. Which they did not provide. Amongst other little things. When our room was cleaned the next day they did not refill anything. which was not very nice. we ended up having to order drinks cos we were so thirsty.

And I just wanted the reception to transfer me to concierge so the fact the hotel concentrated all calls to one line is not helpful. The hotel is likely aware of this long waiting hold time as the message while on hold tells me to enjoy the music in the meantime. Being aware and not resolving it is not good hospitality. I called at various time of the day and evening so it's not a 'peak' hour issue. The main saving grace in service at Four Points Sydney is the concierge. I commend Gary and Kenny (there was a third guy whom I didn't get the name) who were extremely helpful and were excellent in their follow through on my request for dining reservation at Marque and my airline changes.

We arrived early (about 12pm) at Four Points as check in was at 2pm we expected to leave our bags with the concierge and wander around a bit but fortunately our room was ready when we booked in. The receptionist upgraded us immediately to the 14th floor which is the second highest. So far so good. The rooms are not big but they are adequately sized. There is no problem walking around the room without bumping into furniture. (I have stayed in hotels that you can barely move past the bed). Everything was clean, a few bumps on the furniture but it will still be a few years before a refurb, Flat screen TV and a good choice of channels if you speak English. The bed was comfortable and the Harbour view (Darling Harbour) superb. However I think the best asset the hotel showed when we were there was the staff. Always smiling and more than helpful. One morning I needed to print out my boarding pass for the flight home the next day and I inquired about using the internet. I was told that I had free wifi in the room but since I didn't have a laptop or printer with me this was no use to me. Normally I have to use the business centre in the hotel for a fee. The receptionist simply did it for me on the spot, All I needed to do was give my booking number (I had already booked in and chosen my seats through my mobile) and he printed off my boarding passes for me. The breakfast buffet is still great but not as extensive as I remember, even though you can still get your wheat grass shot if you need it. There was an incident with a traveler who had turned up for breakfast after 10am (breakfast is till 10.30am) who got annoyed with a waitress because her yogurt was not there and she wanted to eat healthy. Perhaps if she had managed to get there earlier then she might have got her yogurt. The wait staff told her they would see what they could do but the woman left before there was a result. The last time I was here my sister and her partner were with us and they were put in a smoking room. As non smokers they weren't happy about this but were moved. This time I ensured that I told them I required a non smoking room and had no problem. All in all a great stay at a great location in Sydney.

We decided to stay at Four Points as we have stayed numerous times previously and enjoyed our stay. However this time, our experience was very disappointing. The location of the hotel is fantastic, right on Darling Harbour and a close walk to the main centre for shopping etc. It is also only a short walk from the Town Hall train station. The rooms are always comfortable and clean and you can always seem to get a value for money room rate. The in room amenities are great - all the comforts of home. The service we experienced from the Restaurant and the Concierge were fantastic. However, we did have numerous issues regarding our actual reservation. It seems it may have been caused through miscommunication between central reservations and the hotel. I would recommend if you have any special requests, to re-confirm with the hotel direct, exactly what you need. The most frustrating thing about this was, you would speak to one person who was on the ball and very helpful and great service, but then you would speak to another employee and they were so unhelpful, seemed totally clueless about their job and had no customer service skills. In saying this, management was very encouraging to receive feedback and to turn the situation around. We ate in the Restaurant for both breakfast and lunch during our stay. The breakfast was reasonable, not the best hotel buffet I have ever eaten but there was still a good range of foods to select from. Breakfast was included in our rate, so was very easy to just get up and go to the lobby to eat. If we were to be paying extra for the breakfast in addition to the room rate, we most probably would not have eaten there every morning as Cockle Bay wharf is only a short walk from the hotel and there is plenty of cafes to eat at for often less money. The lunch buffet is mostly Seafood which those in my party who love Seafood, were very happy about! For someone who does not eat seafood like myself, there was not a very extensive amount of meals to choose from the buffet as a lot of the hot dishes still contained fish and/or seafood. If you are not going to be eating Seafood, then again, you may be better off going elsewhere for better value for money. Alternatively, they do have an a la carte menu. The service at both meal times was outstanding, even when the restaurant was busy. All in all, if you are looking for somewhere in Sydney that has a good location, comfortable room and value for money rate, then Four Points is a good choice.

This means that the Darling Harbour shops and restaurants are close by 5 minute walk and the city centre is less than five minutes in the other direction. The room was spacious and modestly decorated. The furniture did seem a little dated but was in good condition. We also had an old CRT television, however we later found out that this is only on the 2nd floor and that every other floor has larger flat screens. We also found out that all the mattresses are new and we certainly did sleep well on them. They are on the firm side FYI. We did find the air-conditioning to be relatively effective and this is a good thing as they do not have windows that open up. The bathroom was large enough and had a shower/tub with a shower curtain\u00ef\ufffd\u0152. Is it just me who hates shower curtains? The amenities provided were sufficient however no shower gel is provided, just the other standard ones.

The menu they had when we went was all items for $10. This was especially good considering the same items were on the in-room dining menu for $20.

One advice I would give is if you want fresh seafood at a very reasonable price, go to the Sydney Fish Market. We took a background tour of the auction that takes place, but within the fish market grounds are some eating places and I found it to be excellent. If you are looking for a white table cloth service, you will not find this here, but the seafood was very fresh and inexpensive. For a dozen oysters, we paid almost 50% less at the fish market.

The AC system responded rapidly, and was very quiet. Memo to families: At booking, we asked if there was a fold-out couch in the room for our two children, at which time we were told there was. Issue One: Fortunately we have skinny children, because the couch was a love seat which folded into a single bed. Issue Two: The hotel wanted to charge us $45 AUS just to fold out the couch - we made it clear that we were not informed of that policy at booking, and they graciously relented. My goodness, we were already paying $300+ a night for the suite after all. Bath was very clean with plenty of hot water, and we used the free in-room safe extensively. The few issues we had with the room were immediately rectified, and always with a smile. We did not eat in the hotel, as there are so many options within a 5 minute walk in the harbor itself. Also, I have to plug the doorman Tony, who was a great help at all times. The location is perfect. The Sydney Aquarium and Wildlife World are literally outside the back door of the hotel. We LOVED The aquarium, and went there on two separate occasions. WIldlife World was also a superb attraction, and very educational for all of us.

It is not particularly shabby or old fashioned, nor is it recently refurbished, modern, etc. This is simply a perfectly good standard, comfortable hotel to use as a base for any holiday or city break in Sydney or a business trip. It's perfectly located for shopping, for wandering the city from Darling Harbour round to the Quay and then round further to the Botanic Gardens.

They also, like many big hotel chains, continue to charge not-inconsiderable sums for internet access in the rooms. I HATE this. Whether business or leisure, I have been ripped off one too many times and have now vowed never to book another hotel that doesn't offer free wifi. As an aside, the front desk were VERY slow. They never seemed to have enough staff on. I travel extensively and I've never been kept waiting this long at reception - particularly annoying when you only want to get a new key or something.

We arrived at the hotel around 9:00 am and were immediately upgraded to a harbor view and were allowed to check in early, leave our luggage and set off for our touring of Sydney. The price of our room included a fantastic buffet breakfast each morning for my husband and myself and it was well worth the cost which was very reasonable. It was a great assortment of hot and cold entrees, much like a cruise ship and offering some things even more. We were seated immediately after we told them our room number. The personnel were a great help with directions and telling us the best things to see as our time was short. They arranged for our luggage, arranged for the taxi to the port and everyone was very helpful. If we ever go back to Sydney I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

The location was fantastic-turn right out of the hotel walk around the corner down some steps and there you at right in Darling Harbour with loads of restaurants and ferries right in front of you. My best tip for Sydney having lived there for 6 months and having visited a couple of time since is buy the public transport day tripper pass and flog it to death-$17 /adult buys you unlimited buses trains and ferries for the day. Walk to Town Hall station buy the ticket, catch a train to Circular Quay, get a ferry to Watsons Bay, walk up to the Gap for a walk along the cliff and great views back to the city, catch a bus to Bondi, have lunch at Icebergs Club (not expensive restaurant above), bus back to town and if you have the energy over to Manly and back-bargain!

We arrived at the hotel at about 9:30am but we were told our rooms would be ready at 11am which was still excellent for us because it was earlier than I expected.

Overall enjoyed the hotel. I don't understand what some peoples problems are. First off this was a trip to Sydney to see Sydney not to stay in my hotel room. If I wanted to do that I would have selected either the Westin on Martin or the Sheraton Park. That being said let me start my review. We arrived on a Monday (the day prior to the Melbourne Cup) and were allowed to check in at 10:30am and given two rooms city side (757/751). First impression of the room was that it was more the suitable for my two week stay. The bellman took our baggage upon arrival and it was delivered to the within ten minutes of me showing up! That is service. The room: Decent size, king bed, mini bar, instant coffee, tea, kettle. It was strange to me that they do not provide a top sheet, just the comforter and a bottom sheet, but no worries to me. I had enough closet and drawer space to put all my clothes. The bathroom is not large, but again, I don't live in the bathroom. They provide lemon scented shampoo, conditioner, hand soap and lotion. My room was cleaned promptly each day. I did notice the siting chair had a few marks on it, but again, I wasn't buying it. The seventh floor was quite and I never had any noise problems. The mini bar is not cheap, but you can still put a few bottles of wine to chill to take with you to dinner. The air conditioner was pretty quite and kept the room nice and cool. TV, well like any hotel, they had a few channels, local 4 or 5 stations, which is good to me. Also had several sports and news stations. Movies were available for purchase but did not take advantage of that. The bed, well it is a Starwood bed, so it was HEAVEN and found myself finding it hard to get up every morning. My room was not outdated, overly worn or anything other people claim. I don't know what they are wanting, but I was happy for my entire 14 nights. The Lobby Bar: Great service!!! The bartender remember us each nigh (even after the first night) and the prices were not bad for Sydney. Friendly bar tenders EVERY time. I will say everyone who worked remembered us. We did stop by every night before going out, but they really did remember us on the second visit. Maybe because we were American? The Corn Exchange: Breakfast - $33 per person buffet Well lets just say the buffet is not \"American\" but was good. Had every morning scrambled eggs, bacon (more like ham), sausage, beans, roasted tomatoes, coffee, juices (about 7), tea, yogurt, sushi, breads and the list goes on. If you went hungry you were just plain stupid. Lunch was $45 and dinner $65 but we did not try -- to many other great restraints to eat at. Concierge: Best ever. Friendly, knowledgeable and was more than willing to help you with ANYTHING you needed. Dundee Arms (PUB) Food is from the same kitchen as the buffet and room service. Had a meat pie, nachos and a burger there (no not at the same time) and all were good. Nothing to write home about, but it wasn't nasty! The bartender was great and very friendly. They do have several dinning specials and happy hour. You can sit outside and enjoy the weather or sit inside, but it is a tiny pub. Look for the grumpy portrait of a lady....Yikes... Location: Amazing. Short walk to Darling Harbour. Many dinning options there and the aquarium and several other tourist attractions. Easy to catch the ferry . There is a mini mart across the street that is lower priced than the one on property. Also an easy walk to the Rocks, Oxford and CBD. You can find so many places to eat within walking distance. Also there is a Woolies and Coles very close if you want to pick up munchies/water for the room. Internet: They charge an outrageous $12/hr $28/day for wireless BUT there is 2 free computers just off the lobby you can do what you need. I used it every day to check work e-mails, look up places to go, etc. Love it! And it was FREE. Fitness Center Nice size, good overall. Great views. Used it every other day, but with all the walking not sure if I needed to. Who knew they had so many hill like SF. I can't say enough about the staff. I even wrote a letter the manager about the staff and I NEVER do that. They made my long stay great!!. Ever employee was friendly. The hotel is not a 5 star but it is a 4 star. I just don't get these people's reviews. To say the least I was nervous about the hotel, but all was good!!! It is the larges in Sydney. The staff really did make the stay. On check-out, you have the option for US or AUS dollars and their exchange rate is not good. Go with the AUS -- my bank exchange rate was better!!! A little advice on dinning -- Tandori Palace on Oxford, WOW! You must go! Also go to the Rocks Cafe a the Rocks on George and have breakfast, the best in Sydney, went 3 times!! My stay overall was great! I would tell you to stay here! I will when I return next year!! But if you are someone who wants that spa bath, that room that is just so, the stuffiness of a upscale hotel (where when it is 100F and you want to wear shorts for a cocktail and were made to feel not wanted ... lets say the Westin Sydney) then this is NOT your hotel.

Nice room and no complaints about the fixtures and fittings at all, with a useful desk with 4 socket extension cord. There were two bedside lamps and also a portable desktop lamp that was convenient (though it needed the base attaching securely...) Air conditioning was unobtrusive and the room quiet - except for Melbourne cup day.... The hotel is across a busy (noisy) road,but we had no traffic noise at all, but even with the good sound insulation, the thump, thump, thump and excessive so called music from Helm Bar, on the harbour, was intrusive from about 3pm to midnight. It could be heard all over Darling Harbour and we were amazed that they were allowed to get away with it, as it must have been over 100 decibels. Coffee/tea making facilties and a fridge/minibar in the room. Needless to say, we bought our drinks elsewhere. Nice bathroom with good supplies. TV channels limited (they want you to pay for movies...) Food in the hotel we thought extortionate, and there were not the numbers for the breakfast lunch and dinner buffet that generate a rapid turnover of food. $60AUD is way over the top in spite of the seafood - most of which was cold anyway. Pretty stuff, but we weren't attracted. The Corn Exchange restaurant were charging $18 for a meat pie, yet the Dundeed Arms (part of the hotel) had excellent cheap bar meals for $10! The pie was excellent and the chips would probably be the best I have eaten, but why no garnish, peas/beans on offer? Wife's spag bol was a very generous portion. Charged to the room. No cider available either, (when every other restaurant we used did serve cider) and they were proudly pushing their wide range of available beers. Across the bridge, Harbourside was the place to eat with plenty of options. Monorail day pass at $9.95 is OK and the Monorail station is only 80 metres away. We cannot understand why some of these hotels charge so much as not all guests are on company expense accounts, so when the dining room is generally under utilised, why top prices?

However,we managed to miss/overlook these offers and booked at 270 Aus.Dollars per night for a Harbour View to include breakfast. Price was for 2 people, and included late check out , which was up to 3pm, although the sub text to this is that its at the hotels discretion. Our room was excellent and our views were well worth any premium. Breafast is buffet style and there is an extensive choice and is recommended. We only had one evening meal in the hotel and the food was more than acceptable without being stunning.Price was a tiny bit dear. Darling Harbour is a vibrant area which has been regenerated during the last 20 years. There are numerous great restaurants, shops and bars all close by. Also just across the road from the hotel are attractions such as Wildlife World, Sea World , Maritime Museum and IMAX Cinema. There is a ferry quay just over the footbridge from the rear of the hotel and many public and private ferries operate from there. Would recommend travelling by public ferry to Circular Quay from where you can see the Opera House and the Bridge. Another worthwhile public ferry trip from this landing/wharf is to Manly [ you will need to change at Circular Quay ] Manly is well worth a visit in its own right, but a best part of that day out is travelling in Sydney Harbour. The Monorail station is nearby and well worth using [ usually best to buy a day pass ] to access other tourist spots. Whilst we made our booking we joined the Starwood Preferred Guest scheme [ free to join, you get points for stays at their hotels]. There is not normally a great advantage to these schemes although we always join as we feel it gives us some leeway if we have to negotiate on anything at the hotel. On this occasion it helped us secure our late 3pm checkout . Additionally we were invited to a \"get together\" at the hotel where we were served endless canapes and beer and wines for 2 hours and finally on our return for our 2 night stay we were upgraded from a harbour view room to a harbour view room with a balcony and in our room was a bottle of champagne and chocolates, all complimentary and all without us asking.

It is nicely located on very attractive Darling Harbor, a short easy walk from the Aquarium ferry stop which will take you to Circular Quay and other transportation connections. Just a couple blocks away is a monorail stop and a 10-minute walk will put you at a main bus junction. Walking to the Rocks is a bit further but is pleasant and goes through major shopping areas. The hotel has an interesting design that incorporates both new parts and also some of the old warehouses that used to line the harbor. The rooms are in the new section and have views of either the harbor (for a bit more) or the city. We opted for the less expensive city view room for both of our stays. You can get good rates online, especially if you pre-pay.

Both had comfortable queen beds, a desk and work area, a side chair, night stands, and mini-bar with small refrigerator. The bathrooms were attractively tiled in marble and had adequate counter space. The a.c. units were quiet and effective. There is a charge for wifi internet access but there are two computers in the lobby available for free. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. For example, they made reservations for us at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Sydney for our return stay, and when checked in a note from the concierge was waiting confirming that.

The four points has an impressive entry, great service (bell boys and front desk service). We arrived early and were able to leave our luggage until our room was ready to check in. The hotel is nice we paid $145 canadian for our room per night. We stayed for two nights. The location is great for the Darling Harbour... but if you want to be close to Sydney Harbor I'd recommend The Rocks. We walked from our hotel to the Sydney Harbour which took us 20 mins or so. There is a free bus that you can catch bus 555 from market street that will take you there directly. (this is right beside the Queen Victoria building - old building turned luxury shopping centre). The area really capitalizes on the fact that it's a touristy spot... breakfast was a whopping $35 pp and dinner was $75 pp. Even trying to find a local bakery or more reasonably priced restaurant was impossible. One thing we learned a little too late, was that tipping is not necessary in Australia... anywhere.. not in restaurants ... taxis ... spas... ect. Since taxes are also included in all prices that helps things... but sydney is a pricy area so be prepared to spend a small fortune :) The room at the Sheraton was a slight disappointment.. it was clean and comfortable but very basic. I guess I expected more from a Sheraton. We had a city view... but given the hotel location I'm glad we didn't pay for a Harbour view room. We did have room service twice once for dinner and once for breakfast... the prices were more reasonable than the restaurant down stairs, the food was good. There is a $5 surcharge for room service added to the bill. Overall our stay was comfortable and safe. I would stay again if the price was right. And now I know the area...

We were quite impressed with the hotel, and very much enjoyed our stay. The best part of the hotel is its location, in Sussex Street, which is basically a two-minute walk down to Darling Harbour and a five minute walk into the centre of the city, depending on your destination (George Street, Pitt Street, Hyde Park etc). Each night we just walked straight down to Darling Harbour to have dinner at one of the many restaurants down there, and enjoyed the nightlife and the atmosphere of Cockle Bay. From Darling Harbour you can catch a ferry or take a sightseeing cruise, eat at one of the multitude of restaurants or shop at Harbourside, so it was obviously excellent to be only a stone's throw from there. It's very handy to the Monorail, which is also a short distance by foot, and there is also a number of useful services on Sussex Street including a newsagency and a convenience store. The hotel itself has many different amenities e.g. a restaurant, bar (but don't eat at the Lobby Bar - the buffet is extraordinarily expensive and there's a huge selection of restaurants at Darling Harbour anyway), fitness centre and conference rooms, so naturally we saw a lot of business travellers there. All round it was quite busy, but the staff are very efficient and friendly, especially the valets and concierge, and they were really helpful from the moment we arrived. Check-in was simple and quick, and our bags arrived up at our room in excellent time. I have to say I was quite impressed with the friendliness of the staff, who answered all our questions and tried to help wherever they could. The staff and housekeeping all said hello and smiled if you saw them in the corridors as well, which I thought was a nice touch. We stayed in a city side room, and it was good for the price and what we needed. The room overlooks Sussex Street which is not bad, but I'd highly recommend paying the extra and staying in a Harbour View Room because the views of Darling Harbour are absolutely fantastic. Because there's over 600 rooms the rooms are fairly small, but the room was clean and tidy, with everything you would expect (air-con, television, small fridge including mini bar items, tea and coffee, iron, desk, internet, room safe etc.). The bathroom was compact but big enough for everything, with a huge mirror, and housekeeping always had it spotless everyday and stocked full with plenty of fresh towels. The beds are also quite comfortable too and I slept well each night. It was great coming back to a very clean and comfortable room each night to relax in. The only gripe I have is the proximity of the rooms to one another, because of the occasional noise. The rooms are very closely situated and so we could hear people talking very audibly in the corridor outside the room, housekeeping delivering breakfasts, and other guests opening and closing their hotel room doors. Late at night this was slightly bothersome. The guests in one of the rooms adjoining ours seemed to shower quite late at night, and the water pipes made a particularly loud noise. It didn't bother us terribly much at all because there wasn't that many people staying on our floor, but I can imagine that during peak periods this would be worse, and more noticeable. If you like good distance between yourself and other guests, I would stay elsewhere. Despite that, I still think that it was a good hotel. Overall I would recommend Four Points and I plan on staying there again when I go back to Sydney, this time in a Harbour View Room. We had no difficulties whatsoever, and our stay went seamlessly thanks to the helpful staff.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Value\u201d", "Author": "berniel7", "ReviewID": "UR27460549", "Content": "We spent three nights at the hotel. We had stayed here three years ago on a previous trip. Following are pros and cons: Pros: (1) Booked a harbour view room which provided a nice view of Darling Harbour. (2) We included the buffet breakfast in our room rate and found it to be very tasty and a good value. There was ample food selection including juices, coffee, or tea, and the quality was very good. (3) Hotel is in excellent location, a few minutes walk to Darling Harbour and all its shops and restaurants, and the Sydney Acquarium. The monorail is also only a few minutes away which takes you right into the central business district where all the large department stores and shopping arcades are located. Also close to Chinatown. (4) Although only two computers were available, internet service on the lobby level was free to guests. (5) Concierge was knowledgeable and helpful especially in helping us to mail a letter without having to go to the post office and in providing directions. Cons: (1) The rooms are relatively small, although adequate in size. However, it could definitely use refurbishing as the carpet was worn and the bed could have been more comfortable. (2) No flatscreen TV. (3) Would have liked to try the Corn Exchange for dinner buffet but found that it was too expensive, especially on the weekends. In summary, we would stay here again because of its location and price charged, especially if combined with the buffet breakfast, which made for a good value.

Here is our synopsis: -Staff was very courteous and helpful, even upgraded us to Harbor View for no extra charges - The rooms are on the small side and seem very dark. I think it is the dark carpet and furntiure they chose to use; plus the carpet looks very worn out. Even the hallways in the hotel are on the dark side. -Bathroom is clean but seems very small, dark and crowded as well. -Location is good as it is within walking distance to CBD, Darling Harbor, Chinatown and about 15-20 minutes walk to Opera House/Rocks area. -Two computers with Internet are available for use complimentary to guests. -To make any phone call from your room (even toll free ones) they charge you a surcharge. This was annoying but we found this to be typical of other hotels as well... - If you like Malaysian food, Mamak is a great restaurant within a 10 minute walk from hotel and it is BYO wine which was nice. -The breakfast buffet (included in our room cost which was about $130/night inclusive of all taxes) was pretty good; they had a good selection of sweet and savory. Plus they make the eggs anyway you like. Overall, I would hesitate to highly recommend this hotel just bc there are so many to pick from and I would definately try something new. However if all else was booked, I would def. feel comfortable staying here again. Aslo, perhaps since we had just stayed in some similarly priced hotels that were overall more aestheticlly pleasing and also in good locations, this one just didn't make the cut for us.

The Four Points is right along the water, next to a small ferry port which is so convenient if you want to take a ferry to Circular Quay or Manly Beach or Watson's Bay. Highly recommend doing all of those also! The ferries take you past the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House - it's a truly magical experience! The rooms at the Four Points were great - the bed was so comfortable, the room was clean, spacious, housekeeping was good, the conceirge was extremely helpful with assisting me book my tours and giving me recommendations. I did not try the restaurant within the hotel but I did go to the bar across the street called the Dundee Arms, which is small but a perfect meeting place to grab a quick drink before dinner.

I had a Harbour View room on the SPG floor (the view was good), but the room was incredibly damp, even allowing for the fact that we were three blocks from the water. The cielings were quite low, making the bathroom dark since it only had one light. It was rather ironic, in that I read the Starwood brochure provided in the room, and it said one thing that Four Points had was a good shower - and this shower was not very good. Even the furniture in the room needed updating. The prices for all services - room service, in-room telephone, and Internet, to name a few - were all more expensive than the Westin Melbourne where I had stayed previously. After I arrived and got settled in, I checked out rates for the 5-star Sheraton on the Park across town. For the subsequent nights I had in Sydney, the Sheraton was the same price - so I checked out early the next day (the front desk was very accomodating, so a thank you to them) and transferred. It's not that the hotel overall was bad - probably 3 stars overall, and definitely suitable for tourist groups - but given the higher perception that the hotel gives on its web site and the newer, more upscale look Sheraton is trying to put on this brand, I can't give it more than the 2 stars.", "Date": "April 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "mfnMelbourne", "ReviewID": "UR14764239", "Content": "This hotel was fantastic!

All in all it felt like it's time for refurbishment. . I didn't use the restaurant but did make frequent use of room service. The service itself was slightly above average but the quality of the food was average to poor - a shamefully lame plate of fruit offering being a noticeable weakness.

Check was easy, fast - we showered and headed downstairs to breakfast what - $40 for a breakfast buffet are you insane - obviously they are - Needless to say we skipped eating in the hotel after we had spent majot bucks on a morning meal. The room - The room was a good size. We had two twin beds, tv had some channels but not nearly enough we had a lot of news we were on vacation didn't need 3 sports channels and 4 news channels. The bath room had mold in the shower - that disappointed me. They have stuff to clean that - why couldn't Sheraton buy some?! Front desk after check in I used them a couple of more times - currency conversion - great - no fee and gave a very decent exchange rate. The next was to ask about access to the business center. They said I could get in anytime with my room key but need a card to get on line and I could buy the card in 30 or 60 min increments - but of course they were out and no one could get them for me. Huh? Out? The largest hotel in Australia can not connect a guest to the internet thru their own business center? Disappointing. Location: It is not in the smack center of everything but its within a 10 min walk, bus or ferry ride to Circular Quay where everything is centered. Darling Harbour is becoming more the entertainment are with lots of restaurants/cafes just behind teh hotel as well as the ferry. The concierge was the best I have ever dealt with - they helped me make an itinerary well ahead of my arrival and helped me make changes when I arrived. They always gave good advice.

It is a few minutes on foot to the Sydney Aquarium, Sydney Wildlife World, Darling Harbour shops/restaurants/IMAX/museums, Cockle Bay Wharf, Chinatown & the CBD. BOOKING We made our reservation with the hotel direct and they were always efficient and professional in their correspondence. It was all in order on arrival. ARRIVAL/DEPATURE On arriving at Sydney airport we took a taxi to the hotel. It was lunch time and cost around AUD$55 including a toll fee. On departing the hotel to return to the airport for our flight out it was early afternoon and the friendly taxi driver asked us if we wanted to take the fast or slow way, on asking the difference he said 10 minutes extra on the slow. Since we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in a rush we took this option and it cost AUD$31.00. So if one isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in a rush on arriving/departing for the extra 5 minutes it ended up being it was a good AUD$20.00 saving. It is also possible to arrive by train direct from the airport terminal and no change of train is required. Ideal if there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot of luggage. The train station to alight at is Town Hall and a short 5 minute walk to the hotel. RECEPTION Reception was well staffed and promptly checked us in. We had arrived a few hours before the hotel check in time of 1500 and were given key cards to our room early. Check out is at 1100 and it was extended by a few hours at no additional cost. On their website there is a fee of AUD $15 per hour up until 1800 advertised so it was very lucky we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have this charged as we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about it until after we had asked to leave the room later for our flight timing. Nothing seemed to be a problem when asking reception and always professional. It was an impressive overall experience with the staff at this hotel. ROOM We stayed in a Harbour View Room with a fantastic view on the Darling Harbour area with floor to ceiling glass. There was a good small mini bar selection and good basic range of amenities provided in the room. Additional ones were available at a call to housekeeping. The bathroom had a shower combined with the bathtub and it was a good standard but wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deem the bathroom we had luxurious. It was a very comfortable room, nice and clean. The main feature of the room is the view that made us very pleased with our choice. FACILITIES There is a tour desk, business centre, concierge desk and a 24 hour gym. Unfortunately there was no swimming pool. This hotel can afford to not have a pool though as a drawcard due to the perfect location it offers. There is an overpass footbridge connecting to the hotel & then some stairs that serves as a short cut to arrive at the Cockle Bay Wharf/Darling Harbour area. There is a lobby bar, a pub and a restaurant however the immediate area also boasts some great places to go for a drink or have dinner. We only had breakfast at the hotel and dined in the area. AREA The options are endless on things to do in the area of this hotel. And the wonderful thing for visitors is that a car isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t required. Most can be done on foot or taxis/buses/monorails/ferries and trains as additional options. The ferry stop is a short walk from hotel that goes to the Circular Quay area (the Rocks, Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge). It is about a 15-20 minute walk down to this area or 3 stops away on the subway.

Took a non-Sheraton shuttle bus from the airport for 10 AUD. My wife and I arrived at 8:30 AM and our room was not available yet (reg check-in is at 2:00pm). We were told that we had to wait about two hours for our room to be cleaned, which was really good. We were given keys to the fitness centre and found out they have excellent shower facilities there (individual shower with bathroom, not like a locker room with multiple stalls). We left our suitcases with concierge and took a well awaited shower after our 15 hour journey to Sydney. The fitness centre is excellent on the second floor, it has many treadmills, bikes and a universal gym. There are no free weights there but they do have a rowing machine along with many TVs. We got our room keys early around 10 AM and went up to the 7th floor which is a Starwood Preferred Guest only floor. We became Starwood members only days earlier and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a free service. We loved our room as we got upgraded for free (we had requested that) to a beautiful harbour view room for AUS 160 a night with a king size bed. We would like to say that our stay there was excellent; we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the restaurants so we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on that. We called for a couple of things from our room and they were very good at using our names on the phone and prompt in providing what we wanted. The room has an in-room safe and mini bar.

We were provided with a paper in the morning and you can grab some apples in the lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not sure if it was only on the Starwood member floor though.

If you go toward George Street/King Street, there is a Coles which is comparable to a Woolworths\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.

This property is definitely not up to the usual Sheraton standard and is massively overpriced. I stayed for 3 nights in February but very nearly did not make it past the first. This was my first stay at this establishment. On arrival I was ignored by the concierge, even though he clearly saw me arrive and then struggle to load heavy suitcases from the taxi onto one of his trolleys that I personally had to retrieve. He didn't offer to assist until all the hard work was done and I was half way to reception. Reception then advised me that I had been upgraded due to high occupancy, but I was allocated exactly the room I had booked and overpaid for. The room was reasonably sized and appointed, but definitely not to Sheraton standards, and was well overdue for a refurbishment. The bathroom was tiny and poorly appointed. The room had just been cleaned and smelt like a chemical factory - it took more than an hour of airing before it was even habitable. Houskeeping advised that the same highly scented cleaning products were used in all rooms, so there would be no benefit in changing. At 10 minutes to 6pm I went to the restaurant to book a table for dinner later that evening, but I (and 2 other couples) were totally ignored by the staff until 6pm, when I presume the restaurant officially opens (however there were no signs to this effect). The Maitre d' came to the desk we were waiting at several times over the 10 minutes but didn't even have the decency to acknowledge those waiting until exactly 6pm. I ordered a Lamb dish from room service the next night, but was delivered what looked like, tasted like, and met the menu description of the beef steak dish. I contacted room service to query this and was forcefully assured that there was no question that I had been delivered the Lamb. The next night I placed exactly the same order and to my surprise (not), I received a totally different meal which looked and tasted like lamb. The above may seem like reasonably trivial matters, but they demonstrate a total disregard for the level of customer service one should expect from an establishment bearing the Sheraton name and charging the tariffs that they do.

We decided to go for it. The room was immaculate, with a HUGE bed (I didn't think beds came in that size!) lots of cosy cushions, a massive TV, fridge, mini bar, safe, hairdryer, not to mention a fantastic view of Darling Harbour. The maids service was second to none, the room was always well made up. The check in staff were very helpful as were the consierge staff. One member of staff who sticks in my mind as going the extra mile was Tony (he was on the front door). We wanted to go to Bondi Beach and were recommended to take a taxi, however Tony asked if we were feeling adventurous and wanted to save some money. Why not. He told us to get the tube, then change at Bondi Junction and get the public bus to the beach, he even told us how much the fares would be and what platforms the tubes were on. The hotel catters for the business world and there were lots of \"suits\" about and to be honest sometimes we did feel out of place being the tourist, but we were not treated any differently by the hotel staff.

We chose this hotel in Sydney because we wanted to be close enough to the city center but also wanted to be right by the harbour. We stayed at the hotel for a week in July. Our flight from Los Angeles arrived early in the morning and we were at the hotel by 8am. They couldn't check us in right away because our room wasn't ready yet so they told us it will be ready at 10am. No problem, we just left our luggage there and we walked down the street and got breakfast at this little deli nearby with reasonable prices for breakfast and sandwiches rather than getting breakfast at the Corn Exchange restaurant at the hotel. After breakfast, we went back to the hotel and lounged around by one of the many sitting areas around the lobby of the hotel and then we checked in at 10am as promised. The room was a good size room and we had two double beds and a sofa bed. The room had plenty of space for 3 people to move around even with 6 luggage laying around the room. The room was nicely equipped with a mini bar, tv, coffee maker, safe, closet, iron, desk, etc. The bathroom was big and had all the amenities we needed (hair dryers, toilletries, international plugs, etc.). The room was clean and housekeeping always kept our room tidy and in order by the time we get back to our hotel later in the day. The view from our room was fantastic! We had a view of the harbor and the bridge, and right across the Maritime Museum. We later realized we can actually also see the sea lion house in the Sydney Acquarium from our hotel room. The room was quiet, we didn't hear noise from our neighbors. The people at the reception area were so friendly and accommodating. The people at the concierge were also very friendly, accommodating and were just so helpful in getting us the information we needed and also some discounts to places, tours, etc. that we weren't aware of. The hotel is so close to the Victoria shopping center, you can just walk up the hill and get there. We would just walk around the corner to get to the harbor and catch a ferry going to The Rocks and the Sydney Opera House. If you're in a group of 3 or 4 people, I suggest to take a cab to get to the Rocks area or even the Sydney Bridge area since taking the ferry (+ walk) to get to that area didn't really save much money, sometimes it actually cost more to pay for single tickets to take the ferry. Downtown is not far at all, even taking a cab isn't as heavy on the wallet either. But there is plenty of good public transport to get you around wherever you need to be (ferry, bus, tram). The tram is just up the hill from the hotel and you can catch that to get you to places as well. There's a little store in front of the hotel where you can get some goodies and snacks and bring them back to your hotel and use the mini fridge to store soda, water, etc. and should help save money from having to use the mini-bar stuff. All in all, we really loved our stay at this hotel and we'd go back and stay there again.

The hotel was very classy from the moment we stepped onto the property. Our flight from san francisco arrived in sydney around 7:30 am and they were able to check us in right away (normal check in time is in the afternoon). A nice long shower after a 15 hour flight was priceless. We had a double queen and our view was city side but we didn't really miss the harbor view because we were only in our rooms for sleeping and showering. The view only showed the parking garage across the street and a glimpse of Sydney Tower. The hotel is steps away from Darling Harbor which has many bars and restaurants. It is also on the west side of the central business district, well within walking distance of the botanical gardens, opera house, The Rocks, Chinatown, and Darling Harbor. The hotel has a restaurant on the ground floor which looked very nice. Prices were just that, pricey. Buffet lunch was over $30 AUD ($25) per person and dinner was $50 plus a la carte per person. With the amount of restaurants around, you had a much better deal walking around and finding a cuisine that fit you and your pocketbook better. During our 2 week trip, we were in Sydney on two different occasions with the first staying here at the Four Points. The second hotel we stayed at was the Metro Hotel on Pitt (300 Pitt Street). With half the price and only 2 blocks away, I thought the Metro was a better hotel pick in my opinion (read my review of that hotel). Overall, the Four Points is a very fine hotel. Very clean, quiet, and classy amenities and staff. You will not be disappointed. But with the higher price tag, I would choose the Metro Hotel on Pitt based on value.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saratoga, CA, USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great view\u201d", "Author": "tak2", "ReviewID": "UR5490468", "Content": "I just got back from Sydney a week and Port Douglas .

The closest train station would probably be Town Hall which is around a 5-10 minute walk away, Central Station (for the Blue Mountains) was around a 15 minute walk away.

This was our last of 3 sections of our holiday in Sydney, having stayed at the Park Hyatt and the Sebel Pier One earlier (see separate reviews!). Of all 3 hotels we stayed in, we were the most satisifed with this hotel. It's standards were superb, location perfect and service excellent. The entrance is road side, rather than harbour side, and so you don't appreciate where you are until you're inside your room, or walk to Darling Harbour, and then you see how great the location is. Value for money We stayed in a Maritime Studio (which is essentially a deluxe room) on the 15th Floor (the very top floor) on which we got a great deal through Hotel Club.com For comparison, the 3 nights here cost us \u00c2\u00a3450 B&B, compared to \u00c2\u00a31050 for 3 nights in a Deluxe Opera View room at the Park Hyatt. Hence why overall (inc value for money) this is a better hotel. The room We had a \"Maritime Studio\", and whilst I'm not sure of the full range, it seemed equivalent to a Deluxe room. At some other hotels, I've had rooms of this grade described as \"junior suites\" on account of the room features/balcony. The room was large, with a fanstastic full length wrap round balcony (unique to the maritime studios - other rooms have a smaller balcony, and some just a window), and all glass to the interior - so there were excellent night views to be had across the harbour. The bed was a huge King size bed, and very comfy. There was a separate dressing area and a large bathroom, well supplied with good toiletries etc. The mini bar was well stocked and (compared to many hotels) more moderately priced - we even had a few beers from it. Location If you want the opera house side, you don't want to be at Darling Harbour. DH is a more active and cosmopoitan side of Sydney, even though its not that far away across town. It has a \"younger\" feel, and there is plenty going on well into the night. Within easy reach of the hotel is the Main Area of Darling Harbour, with its many restaurants and attractions, such as the Aquarium and the Maritime Museum. A little farther is the entertainment complex/casino hotel, Star City, which is worth a look if you like that scene. The hotel itself has a few small shops \"built in\" as well as being pretty much next to a Monorail Station, which lets you ride around DH in a big loop that also takes in Paddy's Market (a large indoor market, which seems to be dominated by Chinese stall holders!), China town, and some of Sydney's central shopping area. At $3 a trip, its a good deal, though seating is hard to come by when busy. Meals We only had breakfast, but its the usual buffet type and is pretty good. The hotel must cater for a large Japanese clintele as well, as the also serve Miso soup and other oddities for breakfast if you want to try them ! The bar is very friendly and professional, always ready with a Tooheys New after a long walk round town. Service We found all services to be superb, though we heard some argument going on with a reservation mix up as we were checking in, so maybe we were lucky? However, the hotel does have a very \"helpful\" feel, and the concierge was excellent in helpinmg us make arrangements for airport transfers, booking the Sydney Obsevratory night trip, and even a hire car (which involved a very modest premium for the hotel of something like AUD10). Alternatives There are several hotels in Darling Harbour, though the larger ones seem to be the other side of DH, taking them just a little further away from the centre of Sydney. The other hotels we've stayed at are the Park Hyatt (superb, but pricey), the Sebel Pier One (my opinion - don't bother unless all you want to do is sleep in the room to recover jet lag), and the Quay Grand Suites (an excellent, reasonably priced, all suite hotel next to Circular Quay, if you want to be a the heart of the Quay).

If you want more information from our visit, I will be writing a report on the Sydney Forum shortly - my user name is cantwaittobethere and I will give loads of helpful tips on there for all you lucky ones that are going out there soon.", "Date": "December 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "N Ireland", "Title": "\u201cTerrific Location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4127420", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel on our first 4 nights in Australia. The view of Darling Harbour from the room was amazing. The hotel room was excellent in everyway. The location to transport, the harbour, bars, restaurants and ferries couldn't have been better. A lot of business people use this hotel but tourists are made very welcome by the friendly and courteous staff. I would certainly stay here again on my next visit to Sydney.", "Date": "November 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pontefract, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat view!\u201d", "Author": "RebeccaG", "ReviewID": "UR4070325", "Content": "Just returned from Australia, The Four Points Shearton Darling Harbour in Sydney was our first point of call. We arrived late evening and as we were driving into the city it looked dark and miserable and we were rather concerned as to what we had come to. We pulled up at the Sheraton and checked in to the hotel we had booked a city side room but were offered an upgrade to a harbourside view if we prefered. We took a look at the cityside room and it was looking at a parking lot for an office building so we upgraded to the harbour view. We opened the door and looked out of the huge window to an amazing view of the whole of darling harbour it was really nice definatley worth upgrading. Also it was my partner's birthday and the hotel gave him chocolates and champagne as a gift which we thought was a really nice gesture. The room was pretty modern and spacious with a huge comfortabel bed, the bathroom was not great but clean and functional. The location of the hotel was pretty good for getting around the city, some nice restaurants on darling harbour. The hotel did feel geared towards business people rather than tourists but the staff where pleasant enough.", "Date": "October 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pleasant Hill, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location For Touring Sydney Harbour\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4040958", "Content": "I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. Paid $165-US. Great location for touring Sydney especially if you are using public transportation. At first glance you think you are in no man's land and then you realize you are just a few steps away from Dahling Harbour. The monorail that circles this area is right around the corner. Its an easy walk to both sides of Cockle Bay where the Maritime Museum and the Sydney Aquarium are located as well as many restaurants. Several good restaurants at nearby King Street Wharf too. We especially enjoyed the Thai one. The room was spotless and the bathroom appeared to have been recently redone. I had a city view room so my room looked out to an office building but I'm sure the harbour side rooms have nicer views. The staff at the concierge desk were especially helpful.

The staff were OK but only a few of them gave you a genuine smile. The 8th floor Harbour View room was excellent with a stunning view across the whole of Darling Harbour. The bed was huge but a bit too soft. The location is brilliant as all the major sites are within walking distance as well as the best shopping areas. There are some top restaurants in Darling Harbour and many others are just minutes away. You really can't go wrong with this location.
