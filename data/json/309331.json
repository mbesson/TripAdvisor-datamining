{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Paradise in the Paddies Waka di Ume is a beautiful experience, at the same time completely rustic and entirely luxurious. The cottages open up to rice paddy fields. You have breakfast surrounded by lotus blossoms rising out of the fields, and dinner greeted by the fireflies.The staff - Lasmini, Sudiari, Karmana, Sumitri and others - wrapped in sarongs present an aesthetic delight. Their warmth is touching. Great service. Oh, and the women carry large platters on their heads in which they bring you delicious pineapple juice, a splendid nasi goreng, etc.We loved the experience!", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR420514712", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "insearchoflight"}, {"Content": "amazing place--you will feel great after staying here We ABSOLUTELY loved the Waka di Ume. What an amazing place--gorgeous, beautiful location. huge luxurious rooms, amazing staff, fantastic food. We can't say enough about the place, everything was perfect. We had massages everyday and ate the most amazing fresh meals overlooking rice paddies and the valley or sitting alone in the sit on the floor dining room. Their staff was amazing and one day we hired a driver from the hotel--Wayan-he lives down the street who took us all over the place (8 hours) whereever we wanted for just 50 usd (that was a year ago. We also stayed at Waka Nusa on Nusa Lembongan and it too was magical.One thing, the Balinese are so poor but so kind. If you have things you don't want, give them to the hotel staff or people you meet of the street. They are so grateful. We want to return.

The resort feels so very Balinese (isn't that the reason for travelling to Bali) and the location was great. Food was *far* superior to what we were expecting, and considering how cheap the resort is, standards are very impressive.

Also it is kind of small for what we expected.The breakfast was a bit disappointing, after staying before in Nusa Dua where all hotels have huge breakfast buffets, the small a la carte selection of Waka di Ume breakfast does not rub you quite well.Last to say, the staff was always extremely nice, and did an excellent service.

The grounds, villas and staff were amazing. Friendly, informative and fun. The spa was beautiful, one of the best we'd experienced. One thing we felt was missing was a quite bar / lounge for guests to meet for pre-dinner drinks, a place to swap adventures, learn of hot shopping spots, tours etc. It could be used for promoting inhouse activities or just relax back and listen to some local music.

To begin with, they had rooms aplenty and at 3pm still wouldn't bargain. In the end we decided to stay in the expensive pool villa.We had relaxed, lay by the pool and then the Manager burst in telling us that we had to move. Clearly that had had another offer for the room. No apologies.We moved into the standard room. The sheets were musty and there was a dusty feel to the room.The view over the rice paddies was nice.The complimentary bus to take you in and out of town left us stranded in town three times!The pool was fabulous, unfortunately we didn't use it as it was in the shade and Ubud being in the mountains, the temperature was a little cooler than the coast. Had the pool been in the sun, we would have been in it.Breakfast buffet was sparse - two kinds of fruit and some cold toast.Ants in the room, bugs all over the bed, blood on the sheets.Booked the room with a US Dollar rate though at the end their exchange rate was a little dubious and as an Australian we paid AUS 400 for what was quoted as US 200 - doesn't quite make sense to me.

They are quieter than staff in some hotels we stay in which fits in with the whole ambiance, they are always there when needed and some of the long standing staff have become good friends.

The concept of the hotel is a good one but it doesn't quite work. The views across the rice fields are somewhat diminshed by the next villa complex about 300m away. The pool area is attractive but shaded and rather small and during our stay was rather affected by building work for the hotel's new spa. Service was very variable. The hotel had overbooked the rooms and we found we had to move during our stay. Yes they did put us in a suite for our first two ( out of three ) nights but there was no apology forthcoming for the disruption caused. there was a long disagreement over the bill when checking out and in general the management were unhelpful. The rooms were beginning to look a little tired and there seemed to be little attention to general maintainence.
