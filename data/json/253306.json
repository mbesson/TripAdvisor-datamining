I was just looking for a basic place to lay my head for the short night and Jet Motel was exactly what I needed. I didn't have much with me as my check-in luggage was still at the airport. The clerk was helpful in directing me to a local convenience store down the way to grab some essentials. I had a good night's sleep and they got me back to the airport on time. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good value in the airport area, all the other places I looked at were much more expensive.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eagle River, AK", "Title": "\u201cI should have slept in the terminal\u201d", "Author": "Jennifer O", "ReviewID": "UR125764605", "Content": "I cannot warn travelers enough---STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! It is old and disgusting! We got stuck in Seattle late at night and had to be back to the airport early in the morning. Not wanting to spend a lot of money, we opted for the low price....bad move! Despite all the tacky \"no smoking\" signs, people clearly smoke in the rooms. But that's not the worst part. The rooms are old, smelly, and just feel dirty. The bed was horrible. The walls are so thin you can hear the tv on in the room next door. The bathroom was DISGUSTING! I was so tired and wanted a shower but I refused because it was so old and gross. I think taking a shower would have made me feel dirtier. Bottom line, spend the extra $30 to stay in a place where you can actually sleep and shower. Honestly, the benches in the terminal would have been better.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lacey WA", "Title": "\u201cService is horible, Beds are hard and shuttle is miserable.\u201d", "Author": "travelswithbicycle", "ReviewID": "UR124044420", "Content": "The hotel is one of the worst I have stayed in. It is in a great location for the airport but it is like you are in nasty place with simple people running the place. They have no computer set up for managing shuttle service. This resulted in extended delays waiting at the airport to be picked up for return to the hotel. The staff was then rude and complained about the cost to send the shuttle driver to get me. I travel over 30 times a year for business and Jet motel used to get my parking business but not anymore. As I waited in the cold for them to come I watched several other parking services make 3 trips through the airport. Use wally, or master park.

For $60 it's pretty much all that's mentioned in the other reviews: an old-time little cheap motel, the sort you thought would have long been wiped out from this location, but it sodiers on and being 5 minutes from the terminal does count for something. Everything's cheap, worn and old; must acknowledge very friendly staff. TV is superbasic local. The conventional-key door (cheapo knob and no chain, as mentioned) was a major throwback! Must note, this time they did not have the \"trolley\" shuttle, just a conventional van.They have obviously made very good use of the website and the SeaTac arrivals hotel-phone screens, where they are one of the first listings, to catch business.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "dougedoug in the'ville", "Title": "\u201cel-Dump-o\u201d", "Author": "doug_8", "ReviewID": "UR20315311", "Content": "Pay an extra $15-30 bucks and stay somewhere else!!

I called the 800 number to confirm the free parking and 24-hour shuttle service, then I booked a room here to stay 1 night. Based on Trip Advisor reviews I wasn't expecting a lot. Well, this place certainly exceeded my low expectations! (I only wish we had pictures because you won't believe this!) The good: Yes, the rooms are large - the double queen room my daughters and I stayed in was actually a 1 bedroom suite w/a full kitchen. The sheets, towels, fixtures, and appliances appeared to be clean, but very worn. And yes, the front-desk staff and shuttle driver were nice & helpful. Also, it is only a 5 minute ride to the airport. Denny's next door is convenient, too. The bad: Extremely noisy due to air conditioning units not being well-sealed to the outside. Fortunately, we did not need the A/C, as the knobs kept falling off and the units looked filthy inside. The second floor balcony was dirty and smelled of ciggie smoke, even though we had a non-smoking room. The full kitchen had no silverware (even plastic would've been nice) or even paper plates - made it difficult to heat & eat our Denny's leftovers @ 3:30 a.m. No dishwashing soap either. The TV barely worked, but we made do by not watching. The TV cable was not even hooked into the wall - the plate was off exposing a big hole in the wall! The ugly: It gets worse, folks! The baseboard heating units were falling apart, leaving wiring exposed (thank goodness my kids are teens!) and gaps in the walls. I could not tell if the carpet was clean, so none of us took off our shoes. My youngest wanted to sleep on the sagging, ancient couch, so I made her bring up the sleeping bag from the car to lay on - again, no idea how long since the furniture had been cleaned. Tiles had fallen off the walls in the bathroom, and the grab - bar in the tub had been removed! No anti-slip strips in the tub either. Yes, Room 21 was barely habitable. Had we not arrived after 8 pm, with a 4 am airport delivery of my eldest to the airport, I'd have left. Oh, did I mention the thin doors and KEYED lock with no chain or anything? I slept not a wink that night! PLUS, they have a \"strictly no refund\" policy. Never again will I risk my family's health and safety for lack of spending an extra 50 or 60 bucks!", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Vancouver, BC, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBig rooms\u201d", "Author": "motohachi", "ReviewID": "UR13305680", "Content": "It's a old budget hotel.
