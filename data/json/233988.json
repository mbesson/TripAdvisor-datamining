{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Only if you can't afford better Quite a large town centre hotel, which is a 10 minute walk from the local train station (S1/S2 lines). Really basic facilities, with no air conditioning (an absolute essential in Summer, and even in May). Possibly the most basic room I have ever stayed in. Bring your own soaps, shower gels, shampoos, pillows, towels etc. because you will need them. Totally, absolutely 100% unsuitable for any disabilities. Ramps are unheard of, and even some of the steps leading up to the main door dont have handrails. Dreadful breakfast, one of the worst I've ever seen. Has the dubious benefit of being cheap, but that's all that can be said for it. Roll over in the bed and you will end up on the floor. Hardly room to turn around in the en-suite. A prime example of the old saying that you get what you pay for.
