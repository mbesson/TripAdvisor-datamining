This is not a 5-star hotel, but I will gladly give it a 5-star rating for what it is. We had a fantastic stay and highly recommend the place. A great value a block from the boardwalk. The room was clean, very large (with a table and chairs and sleeper sofa). The bathroom was clean. Others complain about a mildew smell. Yes, this is apparent. As it is in every beach hotel I have stayed at. This is another reason why there is no carpet (but there was a nice area rug, which I wasn't expecting). Fridge and microwave were clean. Pillows were soft, but flat, as other reviews have said. So, bring some pillows. But the bed was very comfy. It was quiet. It was great. We will love going back.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cWhat a shame.

Upon entry it smelled like mildew. Granted we may have been near the ocean but not close enough for the room to smell like it was saturated with water. The pillows were flat. I was scared to lay on the bed. Could barely get any good channels on the tv (which you received the tv control) upon check-in. Tile was missing all over the bathroom and I was scared to take a shower. Since I had to take a shower I put towels on the shower floor. The room was $140 and should have cost $60. Parking is horrible. For my first experience at OC..this truly left alot to be desired. They need to tear it down and start all over. One of my friends took me there for the experience and what an experience it was. NEVER EVER EVER STAY HERE.

The other reviews are completely right. I don't have a problem with how small the room is but I had a major problem with how the rooms are maintained. When you first walk in your towels, soap, and bath \"mat\" are sitting on your bed. The microwave and mini-fridge are worn down, rusted, and look like they came from a thrift store. There is no phone or alarm clock in the room. The bathroom was modest and didn't look that bad but the water temperature in the shower and sink would constantly change from hot to cold and back again. (I def wore sandals in the shower tho) One of the towels smelled like someone's booty (yuk!). When I went to lay down I pulled back the sheet and there was a blood stain on it. When the guy at the front desk came up to change the sheets one of the ones he was going to put on had a \"mystery\" stain on it. He ended up putting two flat sheets on the bed. After that my friend and I cut one night off our 3 night stay and couldnt find vacancy at any other places in the mean time.
