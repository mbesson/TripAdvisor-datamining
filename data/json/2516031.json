Rooms are spacious, clean, with lovely big comfortable beds. Staff are friendly and extremely helpful, and responded to any queries straight away. Location is great for The Grove shopping centre and the Farmer's Market. You are on a main road so there is traffic noise, but let's face it - you are not going to escape that anywhere in LA, unless you go up into the mountains! The hotel is on a major bus line, has its own restaurant and a coffee shop opposite. Parking is free. My only minor complaints about our room (116) would be that it had a stale smoke smell and the DVD remote control was missing but really, these were pretty teeny issues. The bathroom was big and clean, plenty of closet space, decent TV. I'd recommend this motel highly - I doubt you would get this good service for this price elsewhere in LA.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida", "Title": "\u201cMajor Bedbug Problem\u201d", "Author": "sarahs_travels34227", "ReviewID": "UR128143993", "Content": "My son and I stayed here and there was a major bedbug problem.

The hotel does not have a restaurant but it has a cafe located next to it. The cafe is Fiddler's Bistro and serves great breakfast. Location of the hotel is excellent and in a safe neighborhood. The Grove is about 7-10 minutes walk past a park - go out of the hotel and make a right onto W. 3rd Street. There is a 7-Eleven next to the hotel to the right. A Coffee Bean & Tea Leaves is next to the hotel on the left. There is no guest laundry in the hotel but you could go to a laundry shop 3 blocks away on W. 3rd Street to the left of the hotel and across the street. The laundry shop is called \"3rd Street Cleaners\" and is a laundromat and offers Wash & Fold service as well.

Staff on the front desk were very helpful and try their best to handle any queries. That's pretty much where the good part ends though... Rooms at this hotel are very outdated - with old looking beds and very old furniture. The furniture looked like it was a survivor of the cold war era. One day a microwave randomly turned up in our friends room - we still don't know why. Bathrooms were an ok size - but ours had leftover hair from the previous room occupants in the shower... Security doesn't seem to be top of the hotel's priority either... Our friends who were staying in an adjacent room had a plank of wood in place as a security mechanism to stop the patio door from being opened. I don't think this was really a problem for them though, as both our patio doors opened out onto a brick wall...! Perhaps the worst thing though, was a blood splattered lamp shade in one of the rooms - truly grim. Or maybe it was the pool, which is located right behind the restaurant, so you can take in the natural aroma of cooking fat whilst sunbathing or having a swim...! I did not risk actually getting into the pool for a swim... I used to work as a lifeguard and pool attendant.. Read into this what you may.... It seems as though the hotel is in need of a decent refurbishment and modernisation. I do hope the owners have the good sense to do this soon, before they lose any further potential repeat customers.

The A/C unit was loud, and you can't regulate the temp very well. The bed was comfy but the pillows were so flat.

My husband back in Sacramento came to visit last weekend. Since her apartment is small I decided to rent a room for us at a hotel about three blocks away. I called early in the week and made the reservation for Saturday night. Wednesday morning about 1:30 there was an earthquake northeast of LA. We learned about it on the morning news the next day. Thursday afternoon the hotel called the number I had given them (my cell phone, with a Sacramento area code) and told me that, since the hotel had sustained damage to several rooms, they would not be able to honor my reservation for that Saturday. I told the person on the phone that I was just across the street and that the earthquake had no impact on this neighborhood, the pictures on the wall weren't even skewed. The gentleman on the phone (who seemed to have trouble understanding me) reiterated that there was damage and that they were trying to get it fixed \"sorry\", then hung up. The other hotels in the area were booked. I walked across the street and they were facing a very angry woman. I was given to a person who appeared to be the owner who again told me that there had been damage, guests had been frightened and had \"all came into the lobby, and I have been here since 2:30 this morning\", and that the last several reservations had been canceled. I insisted on seeing some damage and she took me into an occupied room and showed me a hole -- not a crack -- in the window that looked like it was made by a projectile. I explained that I still did not believe her and I was very angry and planned to take action. They called late Friday and said that they could accommodate us after all. We declined the room. We felt uncomfortable at the prospect of staying there. There are two possibilities. (1) They had a chance for a better booking and didn't particularly mind bumping us. Their ethics are somewhat flexible. They would also have been wiser to plead a plumbing emergency or something like that. (2) They were telling the truth, with damage sustained and guests frightened in a very tiny earthquake.
