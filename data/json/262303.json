Opposite side of town from the airport and a 60 minute metro trip but if your business is over that side then it's easy to get to as it's 2 minutes from San Francisco Metro. Staff were very helpful. Room very clean. Make sure you ask for the mini-bar key on check-in or you'll be going back downstairs. Tapas bar (untried) opposite. So glad we picked it", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Egido Via Lusitana", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d262303-Reviews-Egido_Via_Lusitana-Madrid.html", "Price": "$62 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Antonia Rodriguez Sacristan 14</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28044</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "262303", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/97/91/9791a1f9bd54b2b7ee5b547b4d4cae5b5large.jpg"}}
