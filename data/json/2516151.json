We left very relaxed and satisfied with our stay. We stayed in a standard queen bed on the first floor with our windows overlooking the path to the pool. Although I've certainly stayed in nicer hotels, the prices in the Napa Valley can go sky high and I was certainly happy with this price point for the room that we received; I would give it a rating of 4 1/2 if I could. The decor was that fitting a boutique hotel and the location in the middle of downtown Calistoga was awesome. We loved getting coffee and pastries delivered to our room in the morning and enjoyed laying out by the pool in the afternoon. If you get a chance go to JoLe, the restaurant in the front of the hotel, we both did the tasting menus for dinner and weren't disappointed!

However, while the Mount View has done some minor touches to make rooms more comfortable such as replacing the bedding and installing flat screen televisions, the hotel interior needs a major overhaul to bring it up to modern standards. Some of the major issues: 1) Many wooden floorboards under the carpet creak - this is especially bothersome for late night bathroom runs. 2) The rooms are VERY small and not luxuriously appointed. We had a hard time finding room for 2 suitcases. 3) The bathroom was dated (tub with old-style shower curtain) with a free standing sink, very small vanity and little room for toiletries...not suitable for most women. 4) Noisy window unit heat/air conditioners with no thermostats to control temperature.... 5) Old style deadbolt locks with big metal keys - don't automatically lock on exit, and are easy to copy. 6) Very limited parking and no valet.

After researching for weeks I was thrilled to find a place that looked cool and modern yet quaint at the same time and they did not disappoint in any of those areas. The location is excellent and I'm pretty sure that I would stay there again. Mount View has three Winery Cottages with outdoor spa tubs and I had booked the Peju Winery Cottage for my boyfriend's birthday. The room was darling, not in a ruffled throw pillow sort of way, it just had a very cool vibe. It was, however, very small, but it was clean and comfortable and with the doors opened to the private patio it really made the space feel larger. Relaxing in the tub under the stars after a full day of wine tasting was incredible! It was enough space for us, it was the private patio and outdoor spa tub that sold it for us anyway, but if you are looking for a separate sitting area inside then this is not the room for you. The downside...there was construction in the alley directly behind the cottages. The first morning we awoke to the sound, sight and diesel fuel smell of a cement mixer which was towering over the gate behind our 'private' patio. Did I mention that it was 7:00 am? It was full on construction mode right outside the cottage...at 7:00am. The sweet girl at the desk seemed surprised and said that she would try to contact someone regarding the noise. The noise was so unbearable that we asked to have our breakfast delivered to us at the pool. So much for sitting on our cute patio and enjoying the morning. As we were leaving to go wine tasting the front desk girl told us that she had called the city and that they had said that it is ok to start construction @7:00 and that she would move us to another room, in the hotel, if we'd like. Again, the deciding factor for choosing Mount View was because we wanted the outdoor space. We didn't want to be in a stuffy hotel room, we wanted fresh air. Ultimately we declined the room switch and hoped that the work would be finished by the time we got back that afternoon. When we did return, the cement mixer and construction crew were gone and waiting in our room was a bottle of Korbel and an apology note from Mount View. Ok...I don't want to come off as a jerk but, KORBEL? Seriously??? We'd just spent $ 500 on wine that day, the cottage was $387 a night, we were in Napa for goodness sake and their peace offering was a bottle of Korbel. Cheap, tacky and basically lame of Mount View. We hadn't expected anything in the form of compensation and, yes, I do believe that it was a kind gesture but it bordered on insulting and just showed a lack of appropriateness on the part of the hotel. The truth is, you will still hear a lot of noise very early in the morning from delivery trucks so pack some ear plugs if you plan on staying in a cottage. This and that...Calmart is the sweetest little market practically right next door so I highly recommend grabbing some sandwiches to pack for lunch. Palisades deli which is right across the street gets a lot of press, however, after comparing sandwiches, price and attitude from staff, Calmart was hands down the winner. They have amazing fresh deli selections and pastries to die for and all kinds of breads and cheese. Excellent produce as well. Barolo, located off the lobby of Mount View...excellent dinner!

The good: - The room was cozy, nicely-decorated and immaculate (albeit a tad small). - Mount View is located right on the main drag in Calistoga and it's an easy walk to restaurants, wine shops, and a grocery store. - Free parking off the street (not necessary in winter, but great at other times of year). - At $129 per night, the rate was reasonable. - The hotel was very quiet (as are most places in Napa during winter) and we slept like babies. - The included \"mud bath\" was a nice way to spend an hour after tasting wine all day. - The wine tastings arranged by the hotel as part of the package deal (at two smaller Calistoga wineries) were the best of our trip. - Close to Robert Louis Stevenson State Park, the Palisades trail and Mount Helena, which offer some great hikes. - The hotel pool and hot tub, which I unfortunately didn't get to use, was empty while we were there (again... in winter). The bad: - The full price of a room booked in peak season is probably a bit much for me, but then again everywhere in Napa is nuts during summer.

The location is convenient, the hotel is absolutely beautiful down to the smallest details, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. The Mount View is located in beautiful, downtown Calistoga, on the main street, Lincoln, Ave. You can walk (or bike) anywhere you need to go. There are great restaurants within walking distance... * Breakfast- in bed (you can pick your desired time of delivery), Sarafornia (don't forget to sign the wall in the back of the restaurant) * Lunch- Checkers, Buster's Southern BBQ, or pick up some sandwiches from Palisades Deli for a picnic in Pioneer Park. * Dinner- Flat Iron (DELICIOUS, right across the street, and no corkage fee) * Drinks- Hydro Bar, Barolo, or Susie's (a fun dive bar) * Wine Tasting- There are a few shops which offer wine tasting on Lincoln Ave, but I recommend renting a bike from the Calistoga Bikeshop and biking around to the local wineries. If you find some wine you like, Calistoga will even pick up your wine for you and you can pick it up at the shop later on. Beautiful trails, awesome experience! The Mount View Hotel is beautiful and they continue to make it more beautiful all the time. Over the past few years they have tastefully redecorated the hotel lobby, rooms, and pool area. It still has the feel of the historic hotel it is, but it now has a hip, upscale modern art-deco elegance. There is an outdoor heated pool as well as an outdoor jacuzzi. On Fridays, they have a weekly poolside winetasting. Awesome! The rooms have new mounted flat-screen tv's, dvd players, ipod clock-radios, and more. All rooms also have free high-speed wi-fi access. Each room I've stayed in over the years is uniquely decorated and they have each been beautiful. Although a bit more expensive, the suites and the cottages are DEFINITELY worth the money.

It was a little odd that the hotel didn't give the housekeepers a better place to keep the cleaning cart then off to one side of the hallway in front of the room we stayed in, but that wasn't a big deal. The little restaurant connected to the hotel was great and reminded me of the Ponzu at the Serrano Hotel in San Fransisco (a dog owner's favorite when visiting the city). We were able to book spa treatments for the following day and I was so happy with my facial (extraction, Ouch!) with Corinne. She was lovely and very knowledgable. The massage was another story...the gentleman giving the massage was somewhat physically intimidating and throughout the massage was breathing directly into my face. Thankfully it was minty fresh, but I found it hard to relax while instinctively holding my breath.

The front desk staff were polite, but they didn't smile or make us feel welcome. There was no lift/elevator in the building so we had to haul our bags up the stairs and the hallway seemed tired and a bit dated. The room was on the small side, a bit dated, but comfortable. The bed was so high you needed to launch yourself into it. Breakfast was delivered to your room the next morning which was a nice touch. The problem was that there was a wedding party staying at the hotel so they took over the pool area and hot tub that evening and all the next day up until lunch time as there was a wedding brunch, so guests couldn't use these. I went to the spa to see if we could use their facilities instead, but there was noone around. And then there was the noise! All night till 2am. I heard the next day that guests were making complaints up till long before then, but I don't think staff did anything about it. When I complained the next morning, the front desk lady just shrugged and said they were sorry, but as it was a wedding they didn't want to spoil it by breaking up the party. But what about the guests! If the staff had just tried to keep the noise down, I'd have given this a different rating, but they were just rude all round really.

She did a thorough on-line search, but we eventually plumped for a suite at the Mount View. The Mount View is a heritage building, originally built in 1917, but over the years, it's been subject to much refurbishment and is now thoroughly up to date. But aside from its impressive, Victorian facade, there is a certain corporate, vineyard-cultivated, blandness to it. The suite we booked - 250 Twomey Cellars - one of two balcony suites, was expensive for the Saturday night but the price was dropped to $190 for the remaining four nights. The suite had a decent sized lounge and bedroom but was on the dark side when the sun was off the balcony. The balcony is a good place to sit out although it's shared with the neighbouring suite and gets all the noise from the main street. The bathroom was spacious and bright thanks to a skylight in the high ceiling. Some of the bathroom fittings were hanging a bit loose, including the shower curtain above the Victorian roll-top bath, but that got fixed speedily. Flat-screen TVs were provided in both the lounge and bedroom, although we never did get the hang of the remotes. Breakfast was complementary but limited to a room-service continental breakfast consisting of two pastries, two pieces of fruit, orange juice and coffee. This was unchanging and there seemed to be no option of taking one's breakfast in one of the two restaurants - Bar Vino and JoLe - somewhat ambiguously attached to the hotel. Both of these serve good, mediterranean-influenced food, although both have rather a bar-restaurant feel and get a tad noisy at times. The Mount View has a decent spa, but this is of the usual type rather than the unusual mud or mineral variety available elsewhere in Calistoga. There's also a room where one can do yoga and some exercising but no gym equipment is provided. There is however a pretty good gym just a block away that one can use for $15 a day. Out back, there's a decent sized pool with sun loungers. These never seemed to get too occupied and sometimes it was just the two of us by the pool. There's also a covered area with tables and chairs that looks as if it has a bar, but we never saw it open apart from a wine tasting evening that happens every Friday.

While I can't disagree with a lot of the reviews that call the property average we still enjoyed our stay. We too were given a room that didn't have a great view (parking lot), so I would recommend that you ask for a view of the pool/courtyard when booking your stay. You have to realize that this hotel is in the main area of the town and there are shops and buildings around the hotel. The view can't be great in every room. The room was cozy (a little small) but the bathroom was beautiful (still had the historic tile and feel) and was very large. We were not in Napa Valley to stay in our hotel and we spent a lot of time out touring wineries or eating at restaurants so the size of the room didn't bother us. It was the perfect size to house your stuff, have a nice breakfast in bed and get ready for your day! The pool and hot tub area is very nice and large. We also had the hot tub to ourselves every time we went out which was very nice. The hot tub does not \"close\" as long as you are quiet at night and polite for the other customers. That was a very nice feature. The hotel is within walking distance of many shops and restaurants (again on main street) which is very nice. The Bar Vino looked good and the menu was very reasonably priced but we didn't have time to eat or drink there.

There are many wonderful shops and restaurants on Lincoln, but the Mount View is quiet and peaceful. My sister and I started the afternoon with hot stone massage treatments at the spa. We both had a lovely experiences. The spa is small but elegant. The women's locker room is a little cramped, but it is comfortable and pretty. They have a nice lounge area with comfortable seating, great magazines, and spa water and iced tea. This is one of the more elegant spas in Calistoga. I have been to several others where the service is not as good and there is much less privacy. The pool area is great. It's a pretty large outdoor pool with plenty of lounge chairs and shades. There is a also a nice large hot tub. My 4 year old daughter had a great time in the pool. This is a nice place to enjoy a bottle of wine. We stayed in room 202, near the exit on the second floor. The room was not large, but was spotless. There was a very comfy king size bed with plenty of pillows. The bathroom was fine but had a couple of chipped tiles - not a big deal. Nice Aveda shampoo, soaps and lotion. The view was of a wall, but the wall was covered in ivy, giving the space a nice, cozy, private feel. While we could hear people out by the pool in the evening, everything was quiet by 9:30. My only two complaints about the room is that the TV remote didn't work. The hotel staff gave us 10% off for this. And when we looked out the exit door, we could see an empty lot next door that had a bunch of old broken toilets laying in it. Not too classy. The breakfast was delivered to the room and was just OK. I don't eat sweets or pastries for breakfast, so it wasn't too my liking. But there was also tea, juice, fruit and cereal bars (not the healthy kind). They also brought milk for my daughter. The service was overall very nice. The front desk staff was courteous. However, they wouldn't bring us up two wine glasses and a cork screw; we had to go down and get it. There is a restaurant on site which was packed. We didn't try it.

We were assigned room 231, A rectangular room with no view (no point even opening the blinds) Room was cosy, clean, had one bed, desk, one armchair, TV on top of a chest of drawers, bathroom was compact but clean. Design asthetic was quite traditional. Matress was a tad hard (I am a self confessed matress / bedding snob), Linens were clean but not luxurious. Did have some issues getting hot water (this affected shower & sink) - very hit & miss. We were booked on the vinotherapy package & the bottle of champagne (Korben brand - looked quite cheap - a shame really when the napa valley produces so much good sparkling wine) was in our room (shame nobody had thought to put it on ice) with glasses. Pool/Spa area was nice & empty much of the time so we had the hot tub to ourselves. Breakfast is delivered to your room (sounded like a great idea) - found the pastries to be hit & miss, somedays very fresh others a bit dry/stale. you also get a piece of fruit & a granola bar, coffee was very strong. Breakfast (continental) in bed sounded like a nice idea but in reality if was pretty average. Spa: As we had spa credit as part of the package we had booked for massages, Prior to arraiving teh spa had contacted us as they needed to change the date/time of our appointments so we arrived 15 mins before our newly scheduled appointments - nobody was maning the check in booth outside the spa entrance so we went inside to wait - after 5 mins were were quite brusquely told we needed to check in - we explained that nobody was there so we were then told to go to the hotel check in desk. Off we go to the check in desk where we are given a bit of paper with our therapists name & then returned to the spa. I had booked the hot stone massage - it was average at best, I asked for medium to firm pressure & got very little pressure, the therapist used masses of oil so I could barely feel the benefit, I could also hear quite a bit of street noise & the music kept going on and off - so the treatment room was not really a relaxing space. My fiance has a regular massage & he too was underwhelmed. It was a real shame as we had been looking forward to our treatments. Overall I am sorry to say the spa was not worth the money. Bar: We popped in planning to have a drink before dinner - place was pretty empty - after waiting over 5 mins we left without being acknowledged - Shame - the place looked nice but lacked service. The location: Was good you could walk to shops, restaurants etc. Parking: Limited. If none is available you have to park on the street outside but ensure you move your car by 11am as you will get a parking ticket. Overall the Mount View appeared very appealing from the website but was very average in reality.

There were three ladies at the checkout reception area. Not one looked up to say good morning or hello. We went up a couple of times and once again no acknowledgement.

Even though there was a mess-up upon our checking in (they still had us booked for the balloon) the front desk was very kind and told us not to worry they would straighten it out. We did 80 min massages in the spa (which we were the only people there on a wed afternoon!) I had Candace do a hot stone massage and it was incredible (best I've ever had in terms of hot stone massages! I swear I think I was floating thru time). The pool area with outdoor jacuzzi was great and we used it before dinner, again we were the only people out there so it was great! Had dinner at Bar Vino which is in/next to the hotel. Great food and great local wines! We loved that this hotel was in walking distance to other places in Calistoga. At the end of the day we did not feel like getting back into the car to go to dinner so having great dinners at Bar Vino and Brennan's (1/2 block away) was perfect.

The drive had been very warm (up to 104 degrees!) and we were very relieved to find the Mount View hotel for which I had made reservations. It was also our 30th Wedding Anniversary. We did not get upgraded, probabaly because I already had a nice discount from our Entertainment Membership. But, they had placed a bottle of sparkling wine, 2 flutes, and a card in our room. It was a very nice touch. The AC worked GREAT! We had a smaller room, but it was decorated quite lovely and the bathroom was a nice size. It is located on the main street and easy walking for the main part of the town. The pool area looked very inviting with lush plants surrounding the walkways and outdoor area.

Instead we opted for Brannan's across the street on 2 nights - the lamb shank is to die for :-) I'd go back, but would suggest that you request a second-floor room, as our ground floor room with garden view was a bit dark, and at times didn't feel very private. They also have Aveda toiletries, which was appreciated greatly by my Fiance. We also enjoyed Dr Wilkinson's Spa as well as the Sterling Winery. Both definitely worth a visit. Going to the Petrified Forest and the Old Faithful Geyser felt a bit like something from the Simpsons - \"come and visit the world's largest ball of string\" - they are that type of attraction.

They should give the guest choices; pretty much every morning the snacks stayed on our tray. There wasn't anything we liked. On our 2nd day we booked spa treatments. One of the therapist was definitely not qualified for the job, I felt we paid to much for her services. The other therapist were GREAT.

It was exhausting unloading considering the car was not too close and we had to walk up a flight up steps and down a long hallway.... However, everything did get better... The rooms cooled off (we had 2 - one for our teens), the pool was delightful, and the location in town and proximity to what we wanted to do in the Wine Country turned out to be very beneficial. The rooms actually were quite comfortable, very good beds with nice comforters, robes, and TV's with DVDS (which we didn't use). The next AM, we visited Old Faithful Geyser of California and the petrified forest - both very nearby. It turned out to be a very nice stay, and the front desk said they spoke to the maids about keeping the rooms cooler for people checking in...
