We used the Valcarca metro stop. Get off fourth stop from the airport (Passeig de Gracia), then change from the railway station to the metro (green line L3, direction Trinitat Nova) which involves going up to street level. Once at Valcarca, you want the right hand exit of two, to the route de Argentina. The exit is on the same level as the viaduct.

They did move us after the first night (although we were charged as if we spent the week in the larger room we did not want), but we had to vacate the first room by eleven and were not allowed into the new room until mid-afternoon. The rooftop pool area was not a terrible place to wait with our luggage, but we went to Barcelona to see the city, not the inside of the hotel, Also, although the balcony we finally got was lovely (with an amazing view), the shutters were closed by the maid -- although we asked in Spanish, English, and using the card one puts on one's door that the balcony door not be shuttered -- and got stuck. So we spent another half day waiting for someone to come fix the shutter allowing us to sit on the balcony. Finally, the stove did not work (using it tripped the circuit breaker).

The little grocery store downstairs was nice, as was the location and access to the metro; it was also quiet.

The room I had was quite basic with not much in the way of outlook but, it was kept clean, had generous space and fulfilled the requirements of my visit. It is probably best to cater for yourself and there is a local mini-supermarket store about 5 minutes walk away. The room had a double hob for cooking, a slightly noisy refrigerator, and cutlery, pans, cork screw, plates, etc., provided - although unusually, not a kettle. There is close access to a few shops and the L7 Metro line is the most convenient way to get quickly into the main city areas. (During my visit, a 10-trip Metro ticket for zone 1 was about 8 Euros but, be aware if you have children and/or buggies or wheelchairs, that some Metro stations have a lot of steps and some do not appear to have lifts). About 15 to 20 minutes walk from the hotel is the superb Cosmocaixa Science Museum - great for everyone, with plenty for children and adults to look at and try out with dinosaurs and interactive displays. It also has a good restaurant area. Across the road from the museum, you can set off for a trek up hill to the Collserola park towards the Collserola Tower (designed by Norman Foster and covered in ariels - and easily seen from the air if you fly into Barcelona) quite a steep walk up hill but, then a flat winding path for as many miles as you care to walk - also popular with cyclists. The hotel is ideal if you do not want to be in too much of a tourist environment but, with all the benefits to reach the busier areas when you want to.

A good tip is to travel in to the station at tibidabo as this is closer and a flater walk. The hotel is in a quiet residential neighbourhood which feels very safe. There are numerous shops and supermarkets very close. Our only issue was the daily commute in and out of the city Centre which for someone who commutes into London daily I found a bit tiresome.

We had no plans to visit Barcelona, but being unable to resist bargain flights, we booked this hotel via a link from this website through Venere.com. The exterior of the hotel does not really inspire a good first impression, but once inside the hotel any fears were laid to rest by the warmth of the welcome from the excellent reception staff. We were first allocated a twin room (at the quieter back of the hotel), and when we asked for an alternative room with a double bed, this was attended to instantly without any fuss or comeback. Our room was at the front of the hotel which was fine despite some traffic noise. Our bed was some distance from the window, and the road outside (a peak hour rat run) became much quieter later on and we had no problem sleeping. In fact the bed was so comfy that the only problem was getting out of it. The chair and sofa were also very comfortable. There was no fussy trimmings here, but everything was very practical. Although short of a fully equipped apartment, there was enough here for all your City Break needs (warm through and serve your purchase at the local deli, or to prepare a picnic) and the good size fridge was invaluable. There was no safe in the room but the free use of a safe was available at a secure location within the hotel with a 10 Euro refundable deposit for the key (Inquire at reception).The only problem we encountered was the heating could be overbearing at times, and the only way to temper this was to use the air conditioning (during a December cold snap!). For breakfast we fell in love with the wonderful crunchy bread and delicious patisseries from the numerous local bakeries. The cleaning staff here did a fantastic job, and the room was always pristine on our return. Only a tea towel that has seen better days preventing a perfect score for cleanliness. The location of this property in a mainly residential area may not be suitable if you like being in the thick of the action, but we loved it here. Close to Av. Tibidabo and Valcarca metro stations, a T10 (10 journey transport ticket), at 7.20 Euros is a must to get around town. You can even use it for your Airport Transfer from the RENFE station to the hotel for one journey!. We enjoyed unwinding by browsing around the neighbourhood shops, after a day of sightseeing. There are at least 2 good supermarkets, coffee shops, bars, and cheap eat places including the Luciana pizza shop (lovely light based pizzas to eat at the bar or take away); and also the very nice, yet not too expensive Molina Restaurant (thanks previous reviewer). If you stay here take a stroll up to the Puxtet park for breathtaking views. All of these places are under a ten minute walk from the Hotel. In conclusion, the Bertran offers very good accommodation at a good price in a stunning City, and please don\u2019t be put off coming by the endless reports of pickpockets and other tourist related crimes. In our opinion these reports are disproportionate and unfair, and the good people of Barcelona deserve better than constant suspicion, there is a reassuring large police presence all over the city. In all an excellent base for a short break in Barcelona.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "chester-le-street.county durham", "Title": "\u201cgreat value\u201d", "Author": "shorty5", "ReviewID": "UR20951733", "Content": "Just returned from a 4 day stay at this hotel, the facilities were great and good value for money. Rooms were very clean and you received clean towels everyday. The room we stayed in (208) faced the back of the hotel and was very quiet. It had 3 beds ( one being a camp bed) which was very comfy, a setee, easy chair, coffee table, dining table and 4 chairs, kitchen, fridge , television, plenty of wardrobe and cupboard space. The bathroom had bath with shower and a bidet , hairdryer and of course a toilet. Staff were very pleasant and the hotel reception recommended restaurant Molina - at pg.sant gervasi 65, which was only 5 minutes walk away- excellent. The waiter Oscar was very friendly, we even taught him some \"Geordie\". There is also a supermarket nearby. Breakfast was very generous with 6 items each of buns,sweet pastries, croissants. choice of fruit juice and tea and coffee, all served to your room at a time specified by you.The pool on the roof top looked very nice but small, but the view from there was amazing.
