Operator told me that they only had one HIE in all of Indianapolis. We drove by two on our way to this one! Upon arrival there were four or five scantily clad young ladies sitting on the sidewalk drinking beer outside the front door. It was approximately 12:30 am. My daughter and I were informed that there was no parking near the hotel and that we had to park a block away. It would cost $12.00. My daughter had already unpacked the bags onto the rolling valet so I took the car to the garage myself. Not a great idea! Midnight and city alleyways was not very safe. The night manager was not courteous at all. When I expressed my concerns about the parking situation he said, \"You haven't competely checked in yet, you could go somplace elsse you know.\" I assured him that at 12:30 am I wasn't going to be looking for another hotel. We arrived at our room which was clean, no complaints there but as we were opening the door a pack of teenagers in the bathing suits ran down the hallway screaming obscenities and nearly knocked us down. I assume that these creatures didn't get any sleep that night because every ten minutes or so they would return to our hallway, running, laughing, screaming and knocking on doors. I called the manager who said he couldn't control everyone in the hotel, but he would try to find them. Needless to say, they were smarter and much more energetic that he was and they continued to run rampant. My 17 yr old daughter went out into the hallway at 4:00 am and took care of the little hoodlums. Did I forget to mention the poor screaming baby above us on the fourth floor? Poor kid must have been there by him or herself because no one could stop the crying... After getting absolutely NO SLEEP, we check out at 6:30 am. I personally checked out returning the keys with eye contact and was never asked about our stay or anything.. I would NOT recommend this particular HIE to anyone, ever. I wrote to HOliday Inn to alret them to this problem, who sent my concerns on to the specific HIE's management... guess what? I haven't heard a thing. What did I expect?

The location is of this property is very easy to find and they have on site parking directly out the front door. There is a $12 parking fee each night. The front desk staff was very easy to talk with and we had no problems with unanswered questions. The entire staff for that matter was professional and polite throughout our entire stay. Our room was a double bed room with Lucas Oil Stadium directly out our 6th floor window. The room was very clean, neat and in order when we arrived. The beds were very comfortable and the A/C unit worked the entire time. There wasn't a fridge or microwave in our room. The pool was on the small side although while we stayed at this hotel there was never more then 4 people including us in the pool at one time. The hot tub was normal size however the jets didn't work for us during our stay. The pool area was clean and well kept. The workout room was equipped with several pieces of equipment of which I used the elliptical machine for a half hour one night and watched tv in the workout room. It was clean and well kept. The continental breakfast was the reason I gave this hotel a 4 instead of a 3. There was alot of different items to chose from and every item was fresh and had good taste. Overall, a clean hotel with polite and friendly staff means there isn't a reason for me to not bring my family back. However, we will probably try another downtown hotel if and when we return to Indy.

Decor in the property was new, modern, bright, and had a \"nouveau Art Deco\" look about it. From the pieces of sculpture/art in the lobby to the lighting and wallpaper, it was a comfortable public area. Hallways on floors were bright, clean, well maintained and comfortable. Rooms themselves were clean, comfortable, well-lit and continued with the boutique hotel feel about it. Flat-screen televisions were also nice. I had a comfortable sleep with the beds with comfy sheets and coverings. Bathroom was nicely decorated with (likely) faux granite countertops and nice sconce lighting. If you wanted additional lighting you could also turn on a overhead light in the bathroom. If you are going to Lucas, you literally cannot get any closer than this hotel. It is literally across the street. The rest of downtown is within about a 10 minute walk or very short drive (I would walk as opposed to keep moving a car and paying for additional parking, but that's my preference). Also, if here for Indy Indians baseball or part of the Indiana Convention Center (whenever Indianapolis decides to finish it), this will be a very convenient hotel to these also. Breakfast was your typical HI Express breakfast, an expanded continental option with hot items, cold items, and of course the signature cinnamon rolls. You should be able to get a relatively decent breakfast. Staff was all generally pleasant and was nice enough to let me store luggage behind the Front Desk between the time I vacated the room and time I left Indy, so I didn't have to leave luggage in the car. While I've so far been pretty much an ad for this hotel (but believe everything I'm writing), there's a few items I didn't perfectly like. You will have some street noise from the rooms -especially if you have a street facing room. If you're a very light sleeper, it may be a problem, but I didn't personally find it that bad. Internet is free at the hotel, though only wired from what I could see. My laptop did find wi-fi signals if from nearby (such as Lucas) for a fee. Parking is not free at the hotel, though for a downtown location not terrible at $10/night. Finally, there were a few very minor maintenance items in my room, but nothing that really took from the overall enjoyment of the room. Finally, more restaurants within a block or so would be handy. Right now, only a few fast food on the other side of Lucas and a small bar or two. It does appear a new place is opening next door to the hotel this fall, which will be a nice addition to the neighborhood.

It was downtown and I was willing to gamble given that it was one night and 90% of people from hotwire liked it. It is right next to Lucas Oil Stadium. If you take a left out of the complex and then two rights at 10am you can purchase tickets for a Lucas Oil tour at 11am. They will tell you where to park, it is down the road a little and to the right. $5 to park. You enter through the pro shop for your tour. The hotel I knew was updated having been a previous hotel at some point, you could tell that from the hot tub. The rooms look new, the furnishings are very nice and nice artwork on the walls. The king room with pull out sofa was next to the street and you could see the stadium. We had to keep the air on low all night to cover some of the street noise, it was fine for a night. The room had a fridge, mini sink and microwave. The shower was very easy to work. Everything was clean except for one stray hair on the bed, again, for one night and the price I paid, I wasn't complaining. When I checked in the lady was not as friendly as some other hotels I have stayed at and reviewed on here, but she checked me in and told me the hot tub itself wouldn't be open until 5pm because they were refilling it. Great, it is nice to know they clean the area. I have kids, the highlight of a stay in a hotel is getting to swim after a long day of sight seeing. At 515 we go downstairs and see an out of service sign on the the whole pool area. No! ( for my sanity ). I go to the front desk and a new lady had come in at 3 pm after I checked in. I asked her when the pool would be open and she asked maintenance and came back with an 8 pm reply. No smile, no sorry, no I apologize but we had to do this and I'm sure you understand. She didn't know I wasn't paying a full rate, and it shouldn't have mattered. Because I do understand things happen, it was the lack of friendliness overall on this trip that leads me to only recommend it for a night. We went to the pool at 640 to check and see perhaps was it open? And it was, we got in our swim before bedtime. We had a great time, it was clean and nice. They have a \"SuiteShop\". If you forget anything, or want ice cream or soda, they have it there. No milk though. I heard no sounds on a Monday night from any other rooms. We ordered pizza from a local Mancino's pizza place featured in the room directory and they delivered. I would recommend this for a one night stay, with family or otherwise. I think in general a lot of hotels don't seem to have the \"welcome to HIE thank you for staying with us, how was your stay etc? \" Just general friendliness I guess I want to stay, and since I'm trying to relax and make some memories with my family those are the sorts of places I just won't stay in more than once.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "White Bear Lake, MN", "Title": "\u201cNice stay in a jacuzzi room\u201d", "Author": "marty_erikksen", "ReviewID": "UR69286394", "Content": "We arrived late by train and were given a jacuzzi room - nice!

The room was in excellent shape. It was spacious, clean, well decorated, and had a flat screen TV. We had a great view of the stadium across the road. There were no events at the stadium during our stay. There was a coffee machine, with good quality coffee supplied. The bathroom was spacious, and never steamed up once during showers. Towels were always soft. We made us of the pool and spa, and these were very good. Well maintained, clean, and with plenty of fresh towels available. The sunbed area outside the pool is small, but got good sun. There is passing traffic nearby, and a view of the energy plant(?), but these did not interfere with our enjoyment of the sun area. Breakfast was very good, always a variety of options both hot and cold, and always fresh, replenished by helpful staff. There is wi-fi in the hotel, but it did not extend to our room (3rf floor). The room did have a socket for wired internet, but we did not try it. However, wi-fi worked fine in the lobby and dining area. There is also a computer and printer in the dining area, free for customers to use. There always seemed to be fresh coffee on tap in the dining area, which helped make this area a pleasant place to spend time. Parking was no problem, but has to be paid for ($10 per day, still cheaper than many places in town, although we did spot one nearby car park that was offering weekday parking for $5 per day on SOME days of the week, but not all days). The hotel is within walking distance of the centre of downtown, although some people might find it a bit too far to walk to Monument Circle. We found it fine, and also walked to White River Park and the museums and canal. The lobby has a useful small shop selling all sorts of things such as umbrellas and ready meals (which you could heat up in the microwave in the dining area). We chose this hotel because it seemed to offer the best balance of price and convenience of location for downtown. We were slightly apprehensive that it might be too far from the centre, but believe now that we made the best choice.

They also made the comment that \"Like most hotels, we wash our comforters quarterly\"...there is a \"comforting\" thought!

Lucas Oil Stadium is literally across the street, and RCA Dome is about a 2 block walk. The pool was clean with ample towels. The room was clean too.

We had a great view of the RCA Dome and of the new stadium which is under construction. The kids enjoyed staring out the window at the traffic, people, and construction. The hotel is in a great spot and it seemed like everything was just a few steps from the front doors. Our complimentary breakfast was great. The dining area was really nice. The kids and I filled our plates several times. There was a TV on so I could hear some of the morning news. I can only complain about a few things. The pool and hot tub are way in need of an update. The surfaces appeared dirty. I believe it was clean but just stained. Still, the kids loved the pool and the workout room. Also, our toilet got clogged twice and there was no plunger in the room. Not sure if this is a problem in other rooms. Parking, though free, seemed like it could really be a hassle if there is an event going on. It may be a good idea to get there early especially on the weekend. The lot is pretty small, and I heard the front desk clerk telling one guest to \"go ahead and park in the handicapped spot\".
