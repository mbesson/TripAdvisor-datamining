We were pleasantly surprised! The hotel is located right of the Plaza del Sol, so there are many restaurants and shops all around the hotel. We stayed in room 307. It was nice and large with plenty of closet/shelf space for luggage. There was a laptop for web surfing (as well as wi-fi), a TV, an exercise bike and a trouser press. The room was also clean, although not in the very best condition, and the bed was large and comfortable. The view from the balcony overlooked the street below with a great view of street activity and a beautiful church steeple. The bathroom was very nice too, although it seemed that design won over function there. The shower was a capsule shower with UV lights, I believe to help with tanning if that was your choice. We didn't use the tanning option, so I cannot attest to its function, but there was good water pressure, with varying water temperature. It certainly made showering interesting. It seemed that every 20-25 seconds, there would be a burst of burning hot water followed by a burst of icy cold water, and then 20 seconds of warm water. I know when I was in there, I had to keep the shower head focused on the side, and then rinse quickly to avoid getting burned! There was also a clear cut away in the frosted glass bathroom door that didn't allow for much privacy. This wouldn't be a great big deal, but the window was opposite of a mirror, so that we found that there was one small area of the room that didn't have a view on the toilet. This could be uncomfortable if you weren't staying with a spouse or other close family member, but it also allows you a chance to get to know your companions better; hey, everybody poops. One other thing that was annoying, was the light in the hallway. Our room was at the end of the wing, but the sensor that turned the light on was as the far end of the hall. When we walked to the room, the light would turn on, and then by the time we got to our room, turn off. Our key was sort of fickle to unlock the door, so it would take longer than a second, and we would be standing in the dark. Eventually, upon our return, one person would walk around the sensor, while the other unlocked the door.

There was internet in the room both wireless and a hardwired laptop came with the room. I have mixed feelings about the place as to whether to recommend it or not. The location is either good or bad depending on what you are interested in, and the room is OK, but not really up to the 4 star standard they are claiming, though the price is a bit on the low side for a 4 star so it really should be judged more against 3 stars or other hotels in that price range.

However: there is a HUGE difference in actual rooms. Ours was a \"executive/computer\" room and was excellent. Lots of space, in room computer with free internet, etc. etc. Friends of ours had a room so small they had to share walking around the bed. They moved out. Also, the hotel is directly accross from the # 1 club in Madrid...which opens at midnight and closes at dawn. Therefore, while a small balcony room seems nice, the noise factor is quite high from midnight to 6 A.M. Request interior/rear if you want to sleep soundly all night. The buffet breakfast at 12 Euro is , at best, OK, - and there are 2 cafes including a Starbucks, within 1/2 block for morning coffee/breakfast. Vast array of bars, shops, and restaurants within a 2 to 3 block radius, including all of Plaza Mayor. The staff was efficient and just OK on the friendliness meter. Caution: there are about 10 HiTech Petit Palace hotels within a 3 mile radius so proceed cautiously to find the best one for your needs.....

Madrid's hotels are quite expensive anyway and as this was one minute walk from Puerta del Sol, this didn't seem too bad a price. Given a room on the 1st floor and asked for a quiet room as having lived in Madrid, I knew this hotel was directly opposite the famous night club Joy Eslava and also the Chocolateria de San Gines, so noise would have been a problem at 5am in the morning. In hindsight I wish I would have asked for the street facing rooms. The room we had on the 1st floor had a tiny window which opened on to an interior courtyard with foul smelling drains which meant of course you dare not open the window. The smell whilst just about tolerable in winter, would in the usual Madrid summer be unbearable. Whilst it was hovering around 0 degrees outsidem, It's such a shame the hotel's air Conditioning system would only blow hot and not cold air to help alleviate the problem. The room was an odd L'shaped affair and very much on the small side, wood floors are actually of the laminate variety and to be honest you get the impression the hotel is trying to be too modern, but the end result is chintz. Shower worked ok, the hydro massage thing is a gimmick. TV had a good range of Spanish Terrestrial stuff, Canal Plus plus CNN in English and TV5 in French. Honesty Minibar Fridge which was nice and appreciated, though curiously no prices displayed in the room.

Metro right at the end of the street which we used to get to the airport on the way home, the ticket cost 1 euro! In a really bustly part of town and is perfect for sightseeing, but the rooms were still quiet and cleaned everyday!

Everything is within a 15min walk. Further up the road (2mins) towards Plaza Del Sol is another Petit Palace - I would try that next time. Arenal was pretty good for the price. The hotel is targeted at travellers in their 30's and young families. The staff is young, they offer free internet services and internal 'social' areas. Staff were friendly and good English speakers. I didn't notice any noise from outside the hotel. I did however hear people chatting away in the social areas the hotel has created. The room was a little tatty and unclean. The bedsheet covers were stained, the shower unclean (bits of red stuff on the shower wall) and some paint was peeling. I wouldn't like to see the results of an Ecoli test on some of those bathroom surfaces. However, I would stay there again. I figured I just got an unclean room and that happens a lot in hotels. For the price, it was pretty good, but I'll travel with disinfectant next time - just in case.", "Date": "September 7, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "High Tech Petit Palace Arenal", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d296931-Reviews-High_Tech_Petit_Palace_Arenal-Madrid.html", "Price": "$96 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Arenal 16</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Puerta del Sol And Mayor Square</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28013</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "296931", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/93/09/9309d7768382df269a5ffa7633fae1213large.jpg"}}
