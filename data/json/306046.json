This year by the end of the year we will have been to Spain, Italy, Sweden, Germany and France. This is a good hotel. We stayed for 5 days in a business double room (King size bed) facing the delightful park. Considering that it was Easter and the Hotel was full of kids we didn't hear a sound it was very quiet. The bed was clean and comfortable and the room was roomy and so was the bath room (no bath) It was spotless. The TV had BBC news and CNN. The breakfast was excellent. There was a cooked breakfast, fruit, cereal, fantastic assortment of fresh bread, quality jam and honey , meat, cake etc etc. The Park over the road was lovely and had a cafe for very superior snacks, coffee etc. On Friday just up the road at the end of Marienburgh st. there was a lovely market . The bus 200 goes from outside the hotel and will take you to the sttion and the centre of Berlin. The staff made a fuss of us because there are very few English staying here. It was very good and I would go gain. Their retaurant serves good food as well.

The hotel is very noisy, you can literally hear everything from the rooms above, below and next door. On top of that there is building going on right next door across the (dead-end) street, which starts at 6h30am. I had my window open (there is no airco) which meant I woke up with a bang from a big truck off-loading building material.

The communal areas are beautifully maintained, but unfortunately the same cannot be said for the sleeping accommodation. Our room was big and airy with a super bathroom and good furnishings, apart from the bed. The bed was old and uncomfortable and the fitted sheet had been mended. By the second day, the mended tear was ripped open again, but to our disbelief it was left on the bed. (At this point we asked for a new sheet and were given one with no delay.) We weren\u2019t happy that during our entire stay the bed was never properly made \u2013 the duvets were merely put back on top of the crumbled sheet. (see photo) The room was not vacuumed during our stay, and the crumbs from our first night snacks were clearly visible on the carpet and stayed there for four days. There was a sign in the bathroom asking us to hang towels we were happy to re-use, and to drop dirty ones on the floor. But twice the dirty ones were simply picked up and put back on the radiator! On a more positive note, the hotel is in a good location, about a twenty minute walk to Alexanderplatz, with good public transport links nearby. Make sure you visit the park opposite, with its charming water features and woodland walks. There is private parking available for 15\u20ac per day. This hotel seems to have two faces \u2013 plush, smart and efficient downstairs, and below average in the bedrooms. Overall we did have a good stay at this hotel, as the ambience downstairs and the friendly staff and lovely breakfasts outweighed our disappointment with the cleaning and maintenance of our room.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cThank you. it was a pleasure\u201d", "Author": "RikyCoh", "ReviewID": "UR64224751", "Content": "I loved my stay at victors for 5 days. very clean hotel and rooms, helpfull and nice staff, locating in a great place At the beautiful pastoral park that is appropriate for individuals and families and children, romantic and charming. the neighborhood many nice cafes, bus number 200 takes all the important places in town", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel - would happily recommend.\u201d", "Author": "TJDublin07", "ReviewID": "UR52392150", "Content": "We stayed at Victor's Residenz Hotel Berlin for New Years. We were just looking for somewhere good to base ourselves in Berlin for the celebrations. Nothing too fancy and luxurious, but a hotel that was in a good location, that was clean, modern enough and reasonably priced. I can say after staying at Victor's Residenz Hotel I found it to be all these. The hotel isn't going to win any awards for style etc but it was modern enough, very clean, spacious rooms, friendly staff and good room service. We had a room facing into the courtyard which meant there was no noise whatsoever. There is bus stop (Bus No. 200) just in front of the hotel, and the tram station(M4) just 5 min. from the hotel - it's just two stations to Alexandr. platz which is a good center. There is marvelous park in front of the hotel which is nice place to chill out after a busy day and very picturesque in the winter snow. The neighborhood is nice and quite as well. CON's The only con's I can think of are you can't get an iron and ironing board delivered to your room, instead there is an ironing room you have to go to. Although this was of little inconvenience. The pillows are poor (if your into that sort of thing!) but we just asked for an extra couple and they were promptly delivered to our room. PRO's: One big Plus from my point of view was the check out. The hotel has a stated policy that you must be checked out by twelve O'clock. As we were a little worse for wear after our New Years celebrations we checked out closer to one O'clock. At no time were we hassled by reception or room cleaners to checkout before we were ready. A big plus in my opinion.

So I didn't pick it by myself. I stayed in March 2009 and paid 300.00 EUR in total for two nights, which is quite a lot for the lousy non-central location and snooty staff. They all smile and are very helpful according to the company directive of course, but when you have paid and are not officially a guest of theirs anymore they give you a snooty attitude. Although the room was very spacious and clean with a very nice furniture and all (replicas of biedermeier, I think), the overall feel of the hotel is cold and unpersonal. I'd rahter stay in a smaller, less wannabe-posh establishment but with a warmer and frendlier attitude, including staff. I left my luggage after my check-out in the morning of 13.March 2009 at the reception luggage deposit. Alexander was a clerk who did the check-out procedure with me and was very kind and professional. Not so the girl receptionist who was there later that day when I came back to pick up my luggage in the evening at around 5 pm and the manager (peroxide blond lady). I asked the receptionist if there was a bathroom somewhere in the lobby because I needed to change my clothes before taking off to my next destination. The men's room, unfortunately, was located downstairs from reception in the basement, where she reluctantly pointed me. So I took my freshly retrieved luggage where my new clothes were (obviously) and went downstairs to change. I spent there about 10 - 15 minutes. On my way out from the toilet the blond lady manager bumped into me at the door when rushing into the men's room (!) apparently to check upon me with an angry expression on her face. Obviously she was informed by the receptionist that I am in the men's room too long AND with the luggage (Oh my god how daring of me!). Anyway, to answer the dissaproval look in her face I just said with a smile that I only needed to change (like I needed to explain anything at all to anybody) and headed back upstairs to the lobby to leave the hotel. When I was passing the girl behind the desk I said \"Good bye!\" with a big smile and waved at her but she gave me a poker face and didn't even said \"Good bye\" back! Nothing, just completely ignored me! while I was being polite and saying good bye directly and clearly to her. Instead she and the manager downstairs both gave me a snooty attitude! To a customer who has just paid 300.00 EUR to the establishment they work for the very same morning!!! What was their concern? That I might steal something from their shiny men's room??? I don't think so. Can afford my own toilet paper, folks! And I don't think pumping some of their liquid soap from the soap dispenser into a plastic bag would help me get through the economic crisis either.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cFour Star, with quirks\u201d", "Author": "Rowstarboard53", "ReviewID": "UR20234273", "Content": "After reading Trip Advisor reviews we booked our stay at Victor's Residenz Hotel in Berlin. The pictures helped me decide; the furnishings looked traditional but luxurious. The pictures were accurate; the furnishings are worthy of a four-star hotel. The bed was a bit firm for me but my husband thought it was comfortable. For some reason I thought the hotel was air-conditioned; while it is relatively new, it is not air-conditioned. Fortunately the weather cooled off and the temperatures were comfortable after our first night. As others have written, the television audio played in the bathroom, a feature I enjoyed. There was ample bathroom storage and, in addition to sufficient towels, the staff provided washcloths when we asked for those. There were tissues and a very nice hair dryer. Water pressure was good. Others have written about the location being a bit off the beaten path, as well as this not being a problem if one takes the 200 bus. We tried walking to various popular locations; this can be done (we did it) but is a long hike to anywhere. Ask at the front desk for the all day transportation pass; I believe we paid 6.2 Euros (each) for all day. Then we rode Ubahn, Sbahn & buses at will, going easily from the Bellevue district to the Brandenburg Gate to the Pergamon Museum and back to Victor's Residenz Hotel. Fare to and from Tegel Airport was between 20-25 Euros. One of the problems we had was a bit of inaccurate information from the front desk. We were told that the all day transportation pass was good for 24 hours when really it was only good until 3 a.m. the following day. My husband needed internet access; the terms we received from the front desk were in direct conflict with what we saw on the internet itself. Either way, internet access was expensive (10 Euros for one hour, 20 Euros for 24 hours, but 24 hour access might or might not have to be continuous, depending on the information source). The front desk told us that free lobby access would come next year. The first evening we had a drink at the bar; there was a very nice barman who made our time there enjoyable. One disquieting moment occurred when a waitress washed several wine glasses leaving the suds on as she dried the glasses. We stayed three nights; the second day we returned from a long day of sight-seeing to find our room straightened and cleaned, but our same dirtied glasses exactly where we had left those, and not all the towels had been replaced with clean ones. We brought down the glasses and were given new ones, but one had a spot on it. The same thing happened the next night, so we just used the wine glasses in the cupboard instead of going back down to the lobby. We had a nice dinner at the Italian restaurant down the street from the hotel -\"San Angelo\"- on our last night in Berlin. It featured wonderful Italian food as well as some Mexican fare, and seemed to be patronized by people from the neighborhood, too. Prices were reasonable and it was a good way to end our time in Berlin. Although we have traveled more than most, we do not regularly stay in hotels outside the U.S. so we may not be familiar with what should be expected. But we do know what we like in a hotel; we expect used or soiled towels to be replaced with fresh ones, and for used glassware to be replaced with clean glassware (that is, washed with soap, rinsed and dried). So while the furnishings and atmosphere, and some of the staff, far exceed usual expectations, aspects of room cleanliness could be improved. Advice: If the weather is warm enough to leave the window open, ask for a room off the street, if possible, as street noise is loud.", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Donegal Town, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cReally Enjoyed This Hotel Stay\u201d", "Author": "hecoba", "ReviewID": "UR16756066", "Content": "I travelled with my husband and we stayed 4 nights in Victors Residenz.
