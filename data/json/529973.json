Better said the price/output ratio was ok. I am used to these italian hotels, which means that a hotel is situated normaly in a flat-building. But this hotel was really exceptional, which you can also see in the photos. The furniture was older then I am (29), the bathroom was a nightmare. When i came in for the first time, there was a lot of dust on the table and the chair. Above the bathroom door there was a folding door (maybe used as a storage area by the chambermaids). By the window there was another folding bed, one of those guest beds which you can make out.The bathroom was very small, you can not even sit on the toilet without touching the wall:-D The shower was like 70x70cm and the spray head did not work, so we put it away and took shower only with the hose. And the most foolish thing was, when i was leaving the room (our room was directly opposit the reception desk) the receptionist told me, to switch all the lights off \"aslo in the bathroom\"! I felt like in a school hostel:-( The next time i am in rome, i better pay 20Euro more to get a better accommodation.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cNot worth what we paid\u201d", "Author": "scout1222", "ReviewID": "UR115550317", "Content": "Our one night stay here was a placeholder for Hotel Marco Polo who were experiencing plumbing problems the night we checked in. We were assured this would be equivalent - NO WAY. This is a one star hotel that cost $30-$40 less than our reservation with Marco Polo - so we did not get what we paid for. Had we paid the going rate for Hotel Gabriele, we would have gotten exactly what we expected. The room was not that well maintained - the wallpaper was peeling in spots, and the paint on the walls was scuffed. The bathroom, while tiny, was at least clean and in good shape. The mattress was only a smidge better than what you'd find in a sofa bed. And our frame was tilted, so I felt like I was sleeping on a slant. If you're cheap, but you at least want a room that is clean and not gross, go for it. If you want any sort of amenities, go elsewhere.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto,Canada", "Title": "\u201cNoisy Place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3945966", "Content": "We arrived at our hotel and when we first saw our room in was not fancy, but clean and adequate. The traffic noice however, was awful and we were unable to enjoy a good nights sleep the entire vacation. We did not get a telephone, coffee maker, hairdryer or a safe that worked as promised and we didn't have wake up service. There was no internet available for guest use as promised either. The breakfast was adequate, but certainly not filling. Unless you are travelling on a very tight budget, I wouldn't recommend that you use this hotel. The location was very central and we were able to walk to all the major attractions.", "Date": "September 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cGood location, reasonably good but don't expect too much\u201d", "Author": "Zackofnorway", "ReviewID": "UR3674006", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in early July, with my wife and 3 kids. Overall, it was good. Nice location, less than 5 minutes to Termini Station main entrance and many good eating places in the area. The room was clean and the matresses were comfortable. Breakfast was include, a donut and a cup of coffee/tea at a nearby cafe; modest but for me it's good enough to start the morning. Guests received 20% discount from Alfredo Ristorante, which is along the same road. Only 2 unpleasant experiences: no hot water on the first 2 mornings and the elevator did not work on the last morning after we checked-out (please note that the hotel is on the fifth floor).", "Date": "July 17, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Gabriele", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d529973-Reviews-Hotel_Gabriele-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$79 - $158*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Principe Amedeo 76</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "529973", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/80/32/8032f6fc3996a73d8ecd946803f92a3112large.jpg"}}
