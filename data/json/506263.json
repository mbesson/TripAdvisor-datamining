I was mislead by the words in their website and choose the family suite for our extended family. So when we entered the room, we are so surprised. There is only one living room with TV, sofa chair, table, microwave and refrigerator and ONE BEDROOM, with two queen-sized bed pushed together. Basically it's only suitable for immediate family. For extended family, you need to book two rooms instead. There are no extra electrical outlet in the room, if you need to charge you handphone, use notebook etc. remember to bring your own extension cord. The TV contents is very limited, only free channels so arrange your own. We were given two cards for the suite, however, each card controls the electricity of one room. So if any of your family member needs to come back later, either someone must stay up and open the door for him or he takes the card and leave one room black. The staff in reception is not so friendly. Our request of earlier check-in is turned down because there is people live in our room the last day. Despite they request guests to check-out before 10:30am, the cleaning job can only be completed after 2:30 pm. The location is excellent. Very convenient. A large food court, supermarket nearby, as well as quite a lot entertainments. We were given two free tickets. Each ticket entitled two people to enter water park, or 2 hours play in ExploreKids for 1 child. In conclusion, the resort is only good for BBQ. Probably it's the only place in Singapore, you can BBQ until 1-3 am. It's not a very ideal weekends getaway.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFun for gatherings\u201d", "Author": "desire348", "ReviewID": "UR126271202", "Content": "Room for 4 pax, comes with microwave but no proper table to do cutting of food.ppl are there to have gatherings and held birthday parties, so expect the amt of noise thruout the night.

The good thing is that there's a food-court, 24-hour McDonald's, taxi stand, and a mall within walking distance. On weekends and holidays, expect lots of rowdy people partying late into the night (even 4am). During business hours, the place is deserted! Housekeeping only comes once every other day (so don't throw your towels on the floor as you may need to reuse them!)

The faulty ice cubes maker would flip over easily and spill out the water. The ceiling fans unable to work from Power Select '1' position. The door frame of the toilet entrance had broken concrete.

Nice touches like plugs with built in international socket converter and the usual amenities like a large lockable cupboard, and reading light. The room was air-conditioned and had a fan. Bathroom was very spartan but clean as I said. Also nice in that there was a water heater for hot showers. The property itself is a large resort that seems to cater to families. Barbecue pits are available all over the place for outdoor cooking. A broad range of food options very nearby. Breakfast is included in the tarif in the form of a voucher redeemable at McDonalds and two other restaurants in the immediate area. Staff were courteous and helpful and were willing to give me a late checkout time. It cost just under 15 SGD to get there by cab from the airport but there is a shuttle from the Pasir Ris MRT station. I took the cab because I was arriving quite late and travelling alone but I took the shuttle and MRT the next day when leaving. Shuttle was on time and the driver was very nice.
