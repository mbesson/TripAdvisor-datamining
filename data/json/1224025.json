This place takes \"roach motel\" to the next level! I checked in and inspected the bed. I found a spider on the bed! I called front desk to request the sheets be changed. Instead they change me to another room. I went to the registration desk and the girl asked me to wait while she had someone check the cleanliness of this new room. It was not clean so she puts me in Another room. There were no \"clean\" rooms with a king bed so i got 2 queen beds. At a glance it seemed clean. I went to dinner. When. I came back I was ready to go to sleep. I inspected the 1st bed and it had an ant, so I figured, \"ok I will sleep in the other bed\". On the 2nd bed I find 2 bugs that were not ants! I called the front desk requesting to just be checked out. The employee tries to tell me that she had inspected the room and that those were \"just sugar ants\". #1 I know sugar ants! I was born and raised in Miami and I know what they look like. #2. What if they were sugar ants, WHY IS IT OK THAT THEY ARE ON MY BED?? She insisted she inspected the room so we went to inspect room together. The same bugs were on the bed and they were bouncing! fleas perhaps? She was not Authorized to refund me the taxes I paid. How crazy is that??? There wasn't even a manager on duty that I can speak to about my situation! The manager called me after I left while I was on a hunt for another hotel to stay at that night. By this time it was 11p! I just wanted a bed!! The manager continued to attempt to justify that the bugs were \"just sugar ants\". Was I supposed to be ok with sugar ants on the bed I sleep on?

He has an impossible task to do, but does whatever he can quickly and with a smile. The hotel is in a prime location, close to attractions and shopping. That's kind of where the good stuff ends. If you go there expecting to do some of your own cleaning, you'll be much happier! We were sent to this hotel from our original choice, telling us that there was a \"water break\"...good excuse for overbooking. It took an inordinant amount of time to check in with lots of confusion, despite that 3 people were working the desk. Room had no refrigerator or microwave. Coffee pot still had coffee and grounds from the previous customer. Ice bucket had standing water in it. Air conditioning didn't work until maintenance person fixed it. Hornets were building several nests outside our sliding door. There were no chairs outside the sliding door on which to sit and enjoy the Florida sun. The security bar on the sliding door was too short to do its job. No secure key entry to the building. Only 2 hangers in the closet. Lipstick kiss on the mirrored closet door. Grounds unkempt, with dead branches and trash here and there. Bedding was only a sheet and a light blanket. Blanket was dirty/stained. Carpet stained. Breakfast less than what you'd expect at a nice hotel. Scrambled eggs, juice and 1 toaster that was in use most of the time. Cafe not open at lunch time. This resort could be spectacular! It's well-designed and in a beautiful location, tucked back away from the highway. It's too bad the ownership has chosen not to invest in better upkeep and maintenance. One last thing...the staff seems to be working hard to make the best of their situation. Although the housekeeping staff could use some training or standards, they were friendly and willing to try to accommodate our requests.

(groupon)\u201d", "Author": "kris l", "ReviewID": "UR126571638", "Content": "I thought that I was getting a really great deal when I bought the 3 night stay groupon for 155. (which is supposed to be about 50% off) However, this place did not meet my expectations. When we first arrived, we noticed that there were about 3 other cars there. I was hoping for a resort to actually have business. I didn't mind as I figured everything else would be really great. Check in wasn't that bad, except for the fact that when I read the Q&A on groupon about the total fees, the person responding did not say there were resort fees. Oh well, no worries, but the check in lady that i had made the reservation with told me that it would be $51. Well it was $66. again, I'm thinking oh well this is a steal of a deal anyways. I was the only person getting checked in and the staff seemed friendly enough, but distracted. Also, I felt that they could have been more appropriately dressed. While driving to room I notice the ghost town and wonder if this place has an awful reputation or what. The steps to go upstairs definitely need some work done, then we went up and there was a lot of sitting water that seemed hazardous. Also, I think that in order to be able to get into the pod thing where your room is you should have to use your room key. I guess its just me, but I feel safer that way. The room was clean and met our needs. However, they did not have any sort of booklet or binder that describes amenities, room service, nearby attractions, food, or anything. I guess thats just a perk that I like. Also, they did not have any sort of channel guide for the TV. The \"on demand\" movies described in amenities on the website is NOT TRUE. again, oh well. I did not have a \"do not disturb\" door hanger either. That would have been nice so I wouldn't have been woken up by housekeeping, although the lady seemed friendly enough. Oh one thing about housekeeping is that I'm not sure if it was them or just the guests, but there were piles of towels in the hallways, I don't know, it was weird to me. we had to travel to different pods to find ice as the icemachine wasn't working in 2 places that we tried. :/ THE BEDS: are nice and pillows are mostly soft, one of them had some really hard spots that were uncomfortable. They only have sheets and then a small blanket folded at the bottom, no comforters. I personally get cold very easily and didnt mind their method of doing this, but would have appreciated an extra blanket in the closet or something. There were supposed to be several pools, but the staff said that basically only 1 was working. we didnt visit them, but i heard a disgruntled customer complain about it not being heated or even ready when i was checking out. There is internet, but it is a very poor connection, our phones could only briefly connect. We were glad we brought a computer which connected better. Overall, we made our trip a good time, so the little things about this hotel didn't offend us horribly. However, I do not understand what the resort fees are for, the pools are not working, there is practically no activity, etc. I also do not understand why there is a surcharge for a microwave and/or minifridge. We didn't have either, but it would have been nice. I have spent less on a hotel than what this resort wants to charge, and yet the hotel had both of those included, not to mention comforters, pools, etc. I would stay at this 'resort' again, if renovations were really made and some changes were made.

Given that we were in Orlando to visit the Universal Studios theme park, it's proximity to the I-4 expressway made it ideal. The positives, however, end there. We booked a 3-night stay at the Orlando Sun Resort because Groupon offered what we thought was a great deal...we were wrong. We ended up checking out a day early and in retrospect, the $155 (about half off the normal rate) was way too much for what we got. From the get go, our experience was a sour one; it took over 30 minutes to check in, and there were only two other groups in front of us. And the entire duration of our stay, we only ever saw one person working at the front desk. Once we finally did manage to check in, we were directed to one of the rooms located towards the side of the resort. On the short drive there, we couldn't help but notice that this place was a virtual ghost town, with no more than a handful of cars parked throughout. As for the room, well where do I start? There was a musty smell throughout the hallways and in the room itself. I would also love to know exactly what renovations were done to the hotel because they certainly weren't done to the rooms (or the lobby, or any other location that was visible to us). On our first night there, we had to switch rooms because the hot water wasn't working in the shower (it was working in the sink though...go figure). They told us to let the water run from both the sink and shower for 15-20 minutes to see if that worked, and it was only when the maintenance guy came and tried the same thing (along with flushing the toilet) that they decided to move us. Even then, the water pressure was horrible and the toilet didn't work properly. I don't know if if it was the musty smell, the chlorine-like cleaner they used for the towels and sheets, the pet-friendly rooms, or a combination of all three that gave my boyfriend horrible allergies that kept us in on the first night there (even though we would have much rather gone out, as far away from the room as possible). And to top it off, housekeeping was a virtual no-show, entering the room while we were at the park only to drop off some towels on the bathroom sink and not even bothering to empty the trash. Stay far, far away from this place. Whatever renovations they recently underwent were most certainly not applied to the areas of the hotel that needed it most.

I saw a Spanish male walking and asked if this place is open and he said yes but we have no electricity. Okkkkkaaayyyyy.

Then I asked what about the pools mentioned on groupon and they told me they are under constriction. Really I answered and then rudely was asked do you want to check inn or not. Because if I check you inn you will be charged and there is also a 18% service fee and $11 a day per person resort fee.
