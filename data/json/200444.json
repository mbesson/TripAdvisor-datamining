There is a shopping mall with media markt in that mall you will find an Indian Restaurant. The food was really nice and economical. Some suggestions from my side to the Hotel will be; Providing at least 1 ltr. of drinking water to every room/ person at free of charge, Some English TV Channels in the room - what we had was only the BBC & CNN - no entertainment !!! When we checked for an extra power adapter to our room, we were called to the reception... this i didn't felt nice. may be because of the lack of staff's or by the policy.

I did not complain, it was not so important to me, but the first one (that got the order) passing by my table saw it and asked me specially if there is dressing inside.

The amenities: Satellite TV and other standard amenities. The internet is not free, actually it is expensive. They have a safe paring lot, I'm not sure though if it is free or not. The food: The breakfast was not included (I had to pay additionally), so I cannot tell you how it is, but as I said I had a dinner at their restaurant and it was really tasty. The price was OK. The location: Really calm area. A big park is situated near and the air is really fresh. The center is far away, but I don't consider it as a problem because of the perfect Berlin's transportation. A common U-Bahn and S-Bahn station named Neuk\u00f6lln is 10 minutes away with bus. (The bus stop is in front of the hotel) And generally you can reach every point of the city from Neuk\u00f6lln with maximum one change.

I read a few bad reviews on trip advisor about this hotel but this hotel was nothing like it was described. It was excellent. It was a great place to stay for our 7 day stay in berlin, it was only a 10 minute train journey from all the major sites. the U-bahn is so easy to use, you will have no problem getting about. Berlin is an amazing city and this is a great place to stay A++++", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value\u201d", "Author": "Travelfanman", "ReviewID": "UR7626010", "Content": "I stayed with my girlfriend here for four nights in May. We had flown into Schonefeld, so this hotel was easily accessible by bus or the S/U-Bahn, even late at night. Our room was two single beds next to one another, with a bath and shower ensuite. The room was immaculately clean and was quite spacious. All the hotel staff we spoke to spoke English, and were very helpful. Breakfast was 12 Euro per person if its not included, we didn't have breakfast here and we didn't see the size of the portions, however there is a small cafe opposite Grenzallee U-Bahn station (the nearest station) that sells a huge continental type breakfast for 4 Euro. This is ideal as you'd be going that way if you're going anywhere by U/S-Bahn. As an aside there is a restaurant between the hotel and Grenzallee station, which has a large pizza/steaks etc sign outside (you couldn't miss it), which does food amazingly cheap (ie. 1.5 Euro for soup starter, 4 Euro for a pasta main course). The food was great here, mind out for the 3.50 Euro coke there though. In summary, the hotel was excellent, the location was good (although on a map it looks way out of the city centre it is a five minute walk to Grenzallee U-bahn station which connects you with the city centre), but the best bit was the price. It only cost us \u00a3120 in total, which for the standard of hotel I thought was amazing.

The Park Hotel Blub is in the peripherical area of Neukoelln, south Berlin, but it's very easy to reach both from Schoenefeld Airport (just one bus that takes you directly in front of it) and the center, as U-Bahn and S-Bahn are just five minutes walk away. On the arrival, a very nice and pleasant staff checked us in few minutes. As our room would have been ready at 4pm, we took a walk in the center of Berlin and went back to the hotel later in the evening. In the meantime, our bags were placed in a private room and we were given a receipt in order to take them back. The room, a double one with an extra bed and private facilities, was placed in the dependance in front of the main entrance. It was spotlessly clean and had a mini bar, a kitchenette, satellite TV, and there were a hair dresser and clean towels in the bathroom (these last were replaced with clean ones every day). Every day we came back late in the evening, and we always found a very helpful and kind staff.

There was VERY little air flow and the fact that anyone could peek in at anytime from the restaurant was very disturbing.
