Unlimited tea, coffee and toast was served by Sandra who was a breath of fresh air who could not do enough for us. Jay the owner made us feel like we were staying in a home. It was a guest house so perhaps it's name could mislead those expecting a lounge, bar etc but this was not a problem for us.

On arrival we were charged a slightly different price from the one quoted on the booking and given a different style of room. As my husband and I arrived at different times we did not realise the mistake until late that evening. Unfortunately the hotel has limited reception cover so no-one was available to speak to about this. To add to all of this, on arrival my husband was greeted by someone who opened the door but did not speak at all and just left him standing there! The rooms are over-crowded with furniture that serves little purpose other than aesthetics and made it difficult for two of us to move around and get to one side of the bed. The room was also quite hot and, due to the large piece of furniture in front of the window, it was difficult to ventilate it. The rooms also lack any bedside lighting so you cannot read in bed. The bathroom is adequate but strangely they give you a bottle of handwash instead of shower gel - not very boutique! Unfortunately the hoise created by other guests moving around is bad. Not the fault of the guest but simply due to very creaky floorboards and obviously no carpeting to muffle sound so we endured a very bad night's sleep. We left the hotel very early so missed breakfast (which is charged at GBP7 per person) but it sounds like we did not miss much given the reviews on here. I wrote a review of our stay at the hotel as requested by the owners but to date no-one has bothered to contact me nor have they posted it on their site, which is understandable, but clearly there is little point in providing them with feedback. Wimbledon doesn't have a great number of hotels (Antoinette is probably the only similarly priced one) so you are limited by choice but there are better options nearby than the Wimbledon Hotel and not worth the GBP95 we paid.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walsall", "Title": "\u201cExcellent for visiting the City\u201d", "Author": "Deborah R", "ReviewID": "UR116657023", "Content": "Beautiful Boutique style hotel.

Everything was always \"just so\", prices were fixed (and reasonable), and the people running it (family-run hotel) were warm and helpful. For this last stay in December (3rd week of December), I found that it all started to go wrong in the booking process. Calling and getting different prices from the same person manning the phone (ranging from 140GBP a night to 80GBP a night) was the first unpleasant experience. Since the prices quoted matched those of a Hilton in Central London, and somewhat protesting the inconsistent pricing, I booked the first few days of my holiday at the Hilton (internet and breakfast included). However, for my last few days, I had no choice but to stay at the Wimbledon given that my fiancee's family live close to it, and I was going to have a few late-night Christmas and New Year celebration evenings there. When I moved to the hotel, I was unhappy that I had been put in a basement room which smelled like stale beer, was very cold, and the television could only be watched if you were standing up (even sitting on the bed, it was so high up that the image was completely distorted). Outside the room, the carpet was dirty, worn, and not even held down in some places. The walls were peeling, and the yellowy-brown lighting was more akin to a cheap bar than a place you'd want to spend the night. Once again, it wasn't what I was accustomed to at the hotel, and even less so considering that most of the other rooms were empty. And certainly a shock moving from the Hilton to this, at the same prices. The next straw to hit the camel's back was the manager chasing me out the door one morning while I was running to catch the bus (which I almost missed because of him). The reason he was chasing me was to ask me for the key and payment because he thought I was checking out. I then informed him that, as per my reservation, I still had 3 days to go at the hotel, and wasn't going to check out just yet. Unfortunately, whereas before I used to recommend this hotel to everyone I knew, it has now fallen into my Hotels to Avoid list", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean and comfortable but don't have the breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "Lin6663", "ReviewID": "UR86484249", "Content": "Let me temper this review by saying that we really liked the proprietor who we found to be friendly and helpful, but this hotel has recently changed hands and the new owners are clearly still finding their feet. We were greeted warmly on arrival by the proprietor who checked us in very efficiently and quickly. We were asked whether we required breakfast (\u00c2\u00a37.50 extra per person) and were surprised that we had to order it by filling out a form the night before,specifying what time we wanted to eat it. The latter requirement being rather difficult to estimate since we were attending a wedding and really had no idea what time we were likely to get back to the hotel, let alone know how much of a lie-in we would want after the festivities! The proprietor was very helpful in arranging a taxi for us to the venue and he was chatty and interesting. He was due to celebrate Diwali with his family that evening and kindly offered us some sweetmeats he had on hand. Our room was right at the top of the building (a large converted house) so quite a trek up several flights of stairs and I would say that it isn't really suitable for anyone with mobility difficulties. The room, when we got there, was clean and comfortable and really nicely decorated. The en-suite shower room was very modern and clean and there were plenty of toiletries available. We had a comfortable night's sleep and had no complaints about the facilities in the room - the linen was scrupulously clean, there were tea and coffee making facilities and there were extra pillows if required. Having specified that we wanted our breakfast at 9am we made sure we were up and dressed in plenty of time and were sitting in the dining room by 8.50am. There was no-one else in the dining room when we got there and we were quickly greeted by a young woman who appeared from the kitchen and told us we could sit anywhere. She asked us our room number and having established our preferred tea and toast options she disappeared back into the kitchen, reappearing rather swiftly with these items. So far so good! At this point other guests started to appear and this is when things started to go wrong. It seems that this poor lady is responsible not only for showing guests to their tables but also for making the tea and toast, serving the breakfast and topping up the preserves, butter, juices etc. AND for cooking the breakfast itself Rather too many responsibilities for one person! Although we had personally handed our breakfast order to the proprietor the night before, it could not be found in the morning and from what we could gather some other guests\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 orders had also mysteriously disappeared. This really put the cat amongst the pigeons as the whole system fell down.This poor woman became confused and flustered and people started to randomly receive breakfasts. We were rather annoyed that others who had arrived in the dining room several minutes after us were happily tucking in whilst we were still waiting . When the breakfast did finally arrive I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry to say it really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the half hour wait \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cold, tasteless and very crispy bacon; cheap, overcooked sausages and cold baked beans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not great really. The toast was very nice though, as was the tea - just a pity that they were both finished long before the breakfast arrived! Put it this way - our breakfast was placed in front of us at around 9.20am and by 9.30am we had eaten as much of it as we liked and were in the car heading off on our journey home. In short, my recommendation would be stay here if you want a clean, comfortable, reasonably priced room, but have your breakfast somewhere else! Had we not decided to have breakfast at the hotel I think I would have rated it more highly on my review but having decided to eat there in the morning it did take the shine off things somewhat, as not only was the service rather disorganised but the food itself was not of a particularly good quality and therefore we ended up feeling a little ripped off.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "south", "Title": "\u201csmall but comfortable family run B and B/guest house, good old fashioned service\u201d", "Author": "harraby", "ReviewID": "UR76464403", "Content": "stayed at the Wimbledon hotel with other family members and a toddler ,staff very pleasant and helpful, bed rooms all clean each one a different style of decor, with en -suite facilities in each room some of the ensuites were smaller than others ,ours was quite compact., there were fans provided in each room ,but no air conditioning .
