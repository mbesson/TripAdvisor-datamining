{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Viva la Vincci Via I stayed at the Vincci Via for 10 days in October. My room was on the top floor (10) and I had spectacular views of the City. The room was very smart, the lighting effects really cool and the bed huge and comfy. It's a stylish hotel, very contemporary - (great bathrooms!!) Breakfast was good and worth paying for, although the restaurant gets quite warm - dress lite! The terrace is neat with nice loungers and shower facilities and if you can block out the sounds of the sirens up and down the Gran Via a perfect place to relax and catch the rays. Loved it!!", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR250826828", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "CityboyLondon"}, {"Content": "A great hotel! We stayed in the Vincci Via for 2 nights for a short break. The hotel was easy to get to from the airport and was very close to the metro station. We arrived quite early but got a room immediately. While the room wasn't the biggest, it was very well decorated and was very comfortable. The bathroom was fantastic! We didn't try the breakfasts in the hotel, however the restaurant across the road served a nice and cheap breakfast. The air conditioning was set to turn off once it reached a certain temperature and then the room would immediately heat up again. This was the only downside to a lovely stay. I would most definitely go back and stay in this hotel.

We stayed here for 2 nights as a birthday treat for my husbands 40th. WOW it is a superb, trendy, botique syle hotel with every mod con you could wish for, we were even upgraded to a penthouse suite for no extra charge. The location was perfect, only a 1minute walk from Plaza de Espana metro station and everything was within easy walking distance. This is the best hotel I have stayed in for a long time. The only thing I would say is dont have their breakfast...its far too expensive! Pop over the road to Zahara cafe and soak up some cafe culture for a couple of hours. The breakfast there was only 4 euros!All in all a perfect city break.

I was very impressed with this hotel. It's in a great central location. While check-in was a bit slow, the reception area is impressive with a cool, modern look.The route to the lifts takes you past the amazing marble staircase which is extremely impressive. Our room was on the 5th floor and was decorated in a very comfortable and trendy black/white design. The beds were wonderfully comfortable and the bathroom was large including double sinks. The variable mood lighting was another great touch.We made late night requests (11.30pm) for ice and extra towels while getting ready to go out and these were supplied quickly, even though room service was supposed to end at 11pm.We enjoyed the great Madrid nightlife which is literally on your doorstep.We tried to visit the room terrace but this appeared to be closed.

The hotel is in a good location (right by Plaza de Espana metro station \u9225?easy access from the airport), but also very easy to walk to all the tourist sites). Although our room wasn\u9225\u6a9b available when we arrived, the staff were very helpful, stored our luggage for us and told us when it would be. After a quick walk we were able to check in. As other reviewers have said the rooms are a little on the small side, but very well designed (and the bathrooms are lovely). Unfortunately we had a problem with the air-conditioning, but the staff couldn\u9225\u6a9b have been more helpful \u9225?and without us asking moved us immediately (to a better class of room) \u9225?although they did imply we would have to move again (we didn\u9225\u6a9b). The second room (a superior) was even nicer \u9225?not much bigger but it had a lovely terrace.If you stay here don\u9225\u6a9b miss a sit on the hotel\u9225\u6a9a lovely roof terrace \u9225?it\u9225\u6a9a not well advertised but is beautiful \u9225?a great place to sit with a drink. The bar is quite funky but is overpriced \u9225?but this is normal with hotel bars. As for comments on breakfast \u9225?why bother? We rarely do in cities \u9225?there are great places all around you can go for breakfast. Also unusually fro a Spanish hotel it has a lovely staircase that you can use \u9225?useful if you aren\u9225\u6a9b on a high floor (the lifts do take a while to come).Overall we really enjoyed the Vincci \u9225?and would thoroughly recommend it.", "Date": "Oct 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR692566944", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Aylesburytravellers"}, {"Content": "Great location, great decor, friendly staff...

I stayed at the Vincci Via 66 with my husband in November 2007 shortly after it opened. We had not originally booked this hotel for our visit to Madrid, having booked to stay at another hotel which turned out to be fully booked when we arrived there. The staff at that hotel were extremely unhelpful, even though we had paid before arrival, and we were left having nowhere to stay and had to find another hotel quickly. We had stayed at two other hotels in the Vincci chain on previous visits to Spain and had been very impressed with both. After making enquiries with the Vincci Soho in Madrid, which was also full, we were directed to the VIa 66 which did have a vacant room. During the November 2007 visit we had a wonderful, relaxing three day stay and the staff went out of their way to be courteous and helpful at all times, and the hotel was extremely comfortable. I made a return visit to Madrid in May 2008, taking my sister for a 50th birthday treat. I booked an Executive Room with terrace at the Via 66 and am so pleased I decided to return to this hotel. I have to say I do not have the same experiences as some of the other visitors who have reviewed this hotel. I found the staff on both visits unbelievably helpful (on the first visit the Receptionist readily telephoned the box office of the theatre opposite the hotel and arranged for us to pick up tickets - the Box Office staff did not speak English and I don't speak Spanish!!). My experience of the staff is that they always greet guests with a ready smile and hello. I have never entered the hotel without a porter being on hand to offer help with bags, or just to give a cheery welcome. The Manager, who I emailed before my visit to let him know I was making a return visit with my sister, had arranged for a bottle of Champagne to be in our room when we arrived - a really lovely, unexpected surprise! Our rooms were wonderful on both visits - fantastic decor and amazing, spotless bathrooms. The terrace attached to the Executive Room was fantastic - 10th floor with a wonderful view across Madrid to the hills on the horizon.My sister also had a wonderful time on her visit to the hotel and plans to go back to stay with her two children. My 25 year old son (who was also in Madrid at the same time but staying at another hotel) has said he will definitely be going back to stay there himself - he loved the rooms and decor!I have absolutely no negative comments to make about this hotel and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in a great location in Madrid. There are two Metro stations within a few seconds walk of the hotel, and the Palace and Plaza Mayor are a short, few minutes walk away.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR503475434", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "HappyF"}, {"Content": "all style, no substance (spa shut, roof terrace a let down!) We stayed for five nights whilst exploring madrid. The good things about the hotel: It is quite stylish, the rooms are clean and it is centrally located on one of the main roads.The less good:We partly chose the hotel because of the free sauna advertised on the website. When we tried to use the facility we were told it was shut and would not be open. The staff were incredibly unhelpful and frankly rude. The roof terrace was also a supposed to be a selling point. However, the unhelpful receptionists said that they were unable to provide cushions for the chairs (despite their presence in the photos) and it was not possible to request drinks on the terrace as they were understaffed and did not have a licence to do serve drinks on the terrace (again despite the photo)The rooms are comfortable and well represented in the photos, the only complaint being that the small glass screen on the shower fails to prevent alot of the water soaking the floor.
