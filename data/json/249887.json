I got a room overlooking the street below with 3 sets of windows. Bathroom was good, Bed was good. There were some weird rooms in the back areas with windows onto the stairwell that looked like they were inhabited by European backpackers that looked really nasty--rest assured there are nicer rooms if you are shown one of those. Basically I got a decent room in about the best possible location in Mexico City for the price one would pay for a lousy motel 6 in East Nowhere USA. When I look at it that way I cannot believe anyone would ever complain. The place is safe if you are not in one of the skanky rooms--advice-don't stay in a skanky room. The staff was average-not particularly friendly but not rude. Mostly young kids who spend alot of time texting their friends. One great benefit is the restaurant below which makes pretty darn good tortas and licuados when you need a little pick me up for very reasonable prices ($10 for two huge sandwiches and two giant fresh fruit drinks.) Of course the taco stands are even cheaper but hey I just walked down stairs and grabbed my food in no time. Less than half the price of the Hampton Inn around the corner and about 2/3 as nice so good value.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australind, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay here again\u201d", "Author": "Anne M", "ReviewID": "UR117847734", "Content": "Rooms very small and smelly, window loooking into other rooms.

I had to call to make the reservation because I didn't get an answer from them by e-mail.The bed was kind of hard and the pillows were kind of thin, but if you are like me and walk around the city all day long, it won't be a problem (you'll be too tired to notice it). We changed our room because the first one was too small, the staff kindly took care of changing all our stuff and everything was there.Advertising says free breakfast included, but I would recommend to have it somewhere else. The hotel's \"restaurant\" is at the top floor and it is too small for all the guests. This hotel is not the Ritz, but it is a nice place to have a sleep and rest.

The staff is warm and welcoming, and the desk personnel speak English. We had Room 613, I believe, a very small corner room on the top floor of rooms (only the breakfast room is on a higher floor). It was simple, with a king bed, with large windows on two sides. It was a little tricky maneuvering around the bed and especially, the TV set on the overhead shelf. There was a lot of street noise, as one would expect from the location on one of the Centro's busiest intersections. (That's why we carry earplugs.) I'm quite sure we paid over $600 pesos, so except for the location, it's no bargain. Breakfast was included as an additional option. At first we opted out, with myriad restaurants closeby, but as my wife had a bad cold, and I a lesser one, it was easier to stay in the hotel and have what turned out to be a very nice breakfast in the sunny breakfast dining room. (The excellent Jugos Canad\u00c3\u00a1 is next door; Caf\u00c3\u00a9 El Popular, almost across the street, and Caf\u00c3\u00a9 La Blanca about a block west, among others recommended.) The advertised wi-fi didn't work in the room, but the friendly receptionist set me up with a cable to hook me up in the lobby area. (This is a common problem with several Mexican hotels in which we've stayed. The wi-fi is advertised as a \"service\" but often doesn't work.) So, my impressions of the hotel may be clouded somewhat by the fact that both of us arrived tire and with colds. The location is unbeatable if you want to be in the very center of the historic part of the city. There are countless restaurants and shops of all descriptions within easy walking distance. Now I can compare the Hotel Canad\u00c3\u00a1 with the larger and much more spacious Hotel Gillow nearby, where we stayed in September, 2008 (see review). The prices are similar but the Gillow gives much more space and comfort.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Varazdin, Croatia", "Title": "\u201cPeople stay away from this hotel: 200 EUR stolen from the safe !!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "viajeroVZ", "ReviewID": "UR25453410", "Content": "AVOID THIS [--] HOTEL !!!!
