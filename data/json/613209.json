{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Very Pleasent Hotel I just came back from beijing. I stayed one week in this hotel and had a very good time there. The advertises and pictures of this hotel in the Internet are not good and the room pictures are old. I was worried to find a 3 star hotel with dirty rooms. But fortunatley it was a good 5 star hotel with very friendly and helpfull staff. the rooms were beautifull and clean. Housekeeping did a good job and everyday cleaned the rooms. The mattresses were changed only if you asked and that was because of energy conservation policies. The location was a little bit far from tourist sites or shopping areas but since there is no traffic in beijing and taxi is chip this wasn't a matter at all. There is a mall in about 10 min walk. A very good chinese restaurant mainly selling fresh sea food is in the right hand of the hotel (about 5 min walk) and in the other side of the street there is a Mcdonalds. If you take a taxi in 5 min you can reach KFC and Pizza Hot.", "Date": "Jun 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR175886762", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Roxana114"}, {"Content": "Damn Hotel...not even 3 star hotel We being arranged for 7 nite stay in HongKun Hotel in Beijing. And was being told by our travel agent it was classified as a 5-star hotel. We were very excited to learn about it. After check in, to our surprise, the room space was very spacious like an palace. But, after one nite stay in HongKun, we found out that the housekeeping department was not doing a good job. We had to wash our own cup after used. Bed linen was not changed after 4 days stay. Rubbish was not clear everyday in our room. Their bath, hand, face and foot towel were very horrible, it look like rag, dark spot all over and look like footcloth. How can it be classified as an 5-star hotel in beijing. Moreover, they do not have business center for our convenient, how do it attract business tourist to stay. Overall, I strongly disppointed with the services from the HONG KUN INTERNATIONAL HOTEL.", "Date": "Feb 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR117491887", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "gugubird"}, {"Content": "This is a very modern Hotel. I stayed at the Hungkun for three nights as part of a 2 week booked tour. I was concerned about staying here as there was no info on the hotel that I found on the internet other than the hotels spotty website and the one review on trip advisor that did not paint a good picture of the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised to find a modern, 4-5 star hotel, large very clean rooms, large bath, nice gym and spa, and very good buffet breakfasts. It is located far from tourist sites, but that was not a problem on a tour as we were bussed everywhere and on my free day I found that taxis are cheap. If I were returning I would prefer to be closer to the center of town, but that has to do with location, the quality of the hotel was very good.", "Date": "Dec 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR338304114", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "appraiserrick"}, {"Content": "Definitely Not Even a 4 Star Hotel We stayed at this hotel from May 7 to May 11, 2007. It was adverstised on the internet as a 5-star hotel. Far from it. It barelycan qualify as a 3 star hotel. The hotel is old. Eventhough there were recent renovations....it still looks and seems very old. The rooms were not particularly well annointed. The bathroom was substandard. The most annoying thing about it was the air-conditioning which made a lot of noise but did not cool the room. It is located far away from the main attractions and close to the train station. However, there is almost nothing to do around the hotel, although there is a McDonalds about a block away.", "Date": "Jun 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR802152060", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "HIHO-Traveler"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d613209-r16954068-Hongkun_International_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "613209", "Price": "$109"}}
