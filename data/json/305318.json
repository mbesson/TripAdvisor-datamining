{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Stay We had an upper floor suite overlooking the river. The room was large, quiet and well apportioned with flatscreen tv's and a jacuzzi. The property is located on the hill across the river from the main tourist sites. Overall, the hotel service was superb. They offer free shuttle rides in the daytime hours between the city and the property. Staff are there to help you and remember your name. On breakfast, the buffet was plentiful and the conservatory where served beautiful. Fresh orange juice, multiple choices for eggs, pancakes, bakery items, etc. Yes, the price is 50 Euro for two. The restaurant is in the lower level of the property and is very small. Seats are well spaced, and table size comfortable. Ask the chef for the relais menus as they are not on the carte. You have the choice of meat or fish and 5/10 courses and can mix match. The wine list is well chosen and Tuscan oriented as expected.Rail Italia had a stricke the day we arrived from Rome so we drove to Florence. The hotel arranged our pick-up and took care of everything for us. Our Uffizzi tickets were waiting for us. Front desk service is truly outstanding. There are no local dining options within 5 minute walking distance that are not bus tourist stands. So if you want to eat in city center, walk down the hill and cab back if you have a hearty dinner. All-in-all a wonderful stay.", "Date": "Nov 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR703246413", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Ralff"}, {"Content": "Disappointed On a luxurious two week tour of Italy, Villa La Vedetta is the third hotel we have stayed at. Upon being driven up to the villa we were pleasantly surprised by the loveliness of the villa and the view of Florence. However everything afterward was disappointing. The room (although we booked in the spring) was not overlooking Florence but instead the gardens which were nice, but not the view we paid for. The room we were given was small and outside of the elevator so quite noisy at times. Since the hotel is outside of the city there is nothing really close by (walking distance) so it seems we were taken advantage of with absurdly high prices: 238 euros for a dinner and 50 euros for two for breakfast which seemed to consist of the same stale breads and cakes every morning. At one breakfast I actually saw one couple turn away an order of poached eggs only to have the same eggs brought out to me. When I said they were cold the waiter brought them to the kitchen, warmed them up and brought them back out! NOT the way a five star hotel should operate. I agree with another person who signed their guestbook: Save your money, stay somewhere else.", "Date": "Sep 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR859324016", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BeauConnecticut"}, {"Content": "Outstanding!

To sit on the terrace looking out over the roof tops of Florence was magical both by day and night. We had a lovely stay in this small but well appointed hotel. The pool area had plenty of chairs and a shady bar area and breakfast served on the terrace was well thought. My one criticism would be the restaurant, where the food is very ornate. We tried twice to order lamb but was told it was not available however ,we were given a free dessert the second time by way of an apology. The bar menu is not very inspiring so if you do not want a full dining experience every night you are better off going out to eat.

Breakfast was excellent \u9225?we didn\u9225\u6a9b have an evening meal here because the menu definitely didn\u9225\u6a9b cater for vegetarians, but we found plenty of places to eat in the centre, and also a pizzeria a short stroll up the road.The hotel is set up above the town which is lovely because it was quiet, but the walk back up is quite strenuous (we did it once and then just used the shuttle or a taxi).The pool was fantastic with plenty of comfortable sun loungers, and we often had it to ourselves. (We didn\u9225\u6a9b find it too cold to swim in, as a previous review stated, and we are lightweight southerners!)We thought Florence was beautiful, don\u9225\u6a9b miss David at the Galleria Academia. Ask the hotel to pre book your tickets to here and the Uffizi, it saved hours of queueing. Call them before you arrive in Florence if you can. We asked on Day 1 of our 5 day stay and only just managed to get a slot at the Galleria. It costs extra, and you need to pay the hotel in cash, but it\u9225\u6a9a worth it.Definitely a place for romantic strolls \u9225?next time I\u9225\u6a92l take my husband, and I would definitely return to this hotel.", "Date": "Jun 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR327876286", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Mrs_ESussex"}, {"Content": "Perfect Getaway Absolutely amazing!

Our room in annex was smelly especially after rain. This was partially remedied by the application of deodorising tablets into the drain. There were deliberately no sink plugs to avoid overfilling sinks from the automatic taps; the management eventually agreed to supply the plugs from a local shop. The bath/shower surrounds were less than spruce and modern. Pool had to be cleared in the evening to avoid upsetting diners in the adjacent restaurant area. Dining area expensive and menu precious hence relatively few diners. Service around the pool was indifferent. Shuttle service was operated on a demand basis although hours of operation were rather limited. Breakfasts were limited and of poor quality; I thought the croissants were stale but the attending staff were not interested. Despite the small hotel size and exclusive scale tariffs, there was no senior management introduction and any sense of hospitality; merely dressing relatively inexperienced staff in some form of uniform is not good enough.

As the taxi dropped us off by the entrance, a staff member was there to greet us and leed us to the front desk: very kind and welcoming!! As a nice surprise, we were upgrated to a suite with view (we didn't specifically request it, but we appreciated the extra for sure!!!).Having heard great things about their restaurant Onice, we were eager to eat there at least once and, again, we were not disappointed: the food was incredible, beautifully presented and with great service.

We stayed at Villa la Vedetta in mid-November as part of our honeymoon trip. You can never have a bad visit to Florence, but staying at the Villa made it an even better experience. The rooms were very clean and well-appointed and the hotel and grounds are beautiful and very well kept. Our room was not in the main house but across the driveway in an additional building- still very lovely and convenient to all of the amenities. The view from the back terrace and pool is one of the best in Florence- you simply cannot go wrong here!There were a number of nice things about the room- good size, nice amenities, a spectacular jacuzzi bath and free internet access through the television. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We used the car service to go down to the main part of Florence and the front desk handled our train reservations for the next leg of our trip. The staff had a good recommendation for each of our questions and always smiled and greeted us (often by name) when we saw them around the hotel.The only possible drawback is location- it is quite a bit of a walk to the city center and the return walk is up a large hill. The last time we were in Florence we stayed closer to city center and it was nice to be able to walk 5 minutes back to the hotel, but it is worth the 20 minute walk for the superior view and environment. Not nearly as touristy and more quiet and relaxed. We did not dine in the restaurant as it was a bit overpriced and we had many other places to try. I recommend an amazing enotecca near the hotel called Fuori Puorta- excellent food and extraordinary wine selection. It's a ten minute walk from the hotel- more local with very fresh ingredients and reasonable prices.

First impressions were great. The view is spectacular from the bar/terrace and also from the poolside. However, we arrived at the hotel early, at 12pm and were told by reception staff that check in was not until 2pm. This was fine and perfectly normal for many hotels. Our luggage was taken by the porter but we were just told to come back at 2pm and not offered a drink or snack menu. We waited in the seated area outside for a long while but again were not approached by the waiting staff. I found this level of service strange for a 5 star hotel. Service in the bar in general was sluggish and if anything, understaffed. I found this remarkable, especially since there were always more than enough staff at/behind the reception area. That said, when our room was ready for check in, the manager had provided a complimentary bottle of prosecco due to us being on our honeymoon, which was much appreciated, and a nice gesture.The rooms were nice although not exceptional. Granted, we stayed in a standard room rather than a suite. The tap for adjusting the water pressure in the shower came off in my hand when I turned it. Very surprising. After my wife had a bath, the stopper wouldn't release to let the water out, so I ended up having to wedge a coin against it to remove the stopper. I didn't complain about this because it was a minor gripe but surprising nonetheless for a hotel of this quality. Breakfast was great, the best we had on our travels in Italy. The pool and jacuzzi and general pool area are beautiful, and the main selling point of the hotel. There is a gym on the top floor of the hotel, but it is more like a home gym than anything professional. Very basic. The restaurant is Michelin star and prices are outlandish as you would expect. There are very limited eating options in the hotel if you don't want to spend massively.There are a couple of quite nice restauraunts nearby, but it takes away from the hotel if you feel compelled to leave because of prohibitive pricing. As it happens we were not even tempted to splash out on the Onice restaurant in the hotel because it seemed to have all the atmosphere of a morgue. The hotel is very near Piazza Michelangiolo, which is a lovely square overlooking Florence with amazing views of sunset behind the Ponte Vecchio and the city.Overall, I enjoyed the stay, mainly because of the views and surrounds, and because it was my honeymoon, but the hotel is definitely not without its faults.", "Date": "Aug 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR322964822", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "NBRADY"}, {"Content": "Lost in Translation The shiny brochures of the Concerto hotel group, who own the villa, promise unique and unusual experiences when you stay at their hotels. And perhaps I should have paid more attention to the language of such a claim, which has somehow become lost in translation. At best, the villa is like a gorgeous meringue, offering the promise of sweet surprises, but delivering remarkably little substance and flavour. The staff range from sullen and unyielding to disturbingly smiley when there is a sniff of a manager around. Our request to move to a suite with a view of Florence (surely the whole reason you come to such a hotel?) was met with quiet indifference, and we were quickly made to feel like an inconvenience. Nevertheless, being cheerfully stubborn about the whole thing did result in a better suite with lovely balcony views over Florence. (Room No. 306 is the one to go for, by the way). Our request for a bottle of champagne in the room upon arrival was ignored, and so, in fact, was our do not disturb sign, with the maids quite determined to enter at a time convenient for them. But let's not go there.We did not venture into the city centre initially, preferring to enjoy the stunning swimming pool and jacuzzi. But there was a problem ... not enough sunbeds! Now, come on Villa La Vedetta! In a small, 18 room hotel, you could surely manage enough sunbeds for every guest? Space is not the issue! Some people even had to resort to lying on the grass between other sunbathers on a thin hotel towel. Others gave up and sat on the concrete steps. When you look at the pictures, do note how much room there is on the terrace, occupied by upright chairs. Managers should be aware that nobody seems to use these chairs because there is nothing up there! If you must have them, please relocate the restaurant up there and move it away from the small bar area. To get to the heart of the Problems La Vedetta I would like to use a practial example. On the second day of our holiday, we ordered a bottle of fizzy water in the pool bar area - it was over 90 degrees, and we were sunbathing. A bottle of still water arrived nearly 45 minutes later, following 3 reminders. The waitress was apologetic and obviously exhausted, as she had been serving lunch, drinks and even the outrageously over-priced breakfast that day. So where are all the other staff? Many people resorted to shouting, hello?, with one man uttering, Can anybody hear me? into the restaurant / bar area. Nobody could. So, I will ask his question more directly, and hopefully, more loudly on this website: Can anybody from the senior management team of the Concerto group hear me? If you can, please examine your staffing policy and training more carefully (do you have enough? Are you trying to cut corners?), provide a reasonably priced restaurant alongside your Michelin-starred one (we did eat here and found it stunning but slow, and not as good as the one at the Hotel Majestic in Rome that we visited afterwards), and for goodness sake, buy some more sunbeds. In essence, treat this beautiful hotel and its wonderful customers with the respect they deserve and stop providing a second rate service for first rate prices.
