The first night our bed did not have a mattress pad on it but the 2nd night we noticed the maid put one on. The refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker was nice. The safe did not work. Glad I did not have anything of value to keep safe. The breakfast was starch and more starch. Biscuits and gravy, variety of breads, frozen waffles, cake donuts, hot and cold cereals, orange juice, and coffee. Brought our own fruit to eat for breakfast. There was hot coffee in the lobby at all times-very nice. Did not use the pool as it was cool out. Did look nice though. The location was ok.

We arrived at the hotel at around 3am because we are very spontaneous and did leave our home until 10pm- and we live like 6 hours away. We arrived, and the door was locked, no big deal- we called the front desk at the phone outside- and Mike, the front desk manager opened the door for us to check in- he put in our information and the proceeded to collect payment. We were confused, because of two things: first, we put our credit card number online, and second, the bill was about $90 more than we were supposed to be paying. Mike said that Priceline does not charge the card- and they have to authorize payment. We showed him that we were supposed to get the room for $36 per night ( we were getting two nights) he tried getting $140 out of us, and then said that he was giving us that rate, but the extra was fees. The fees that he showed us did not make sense, and I've never had to pay these at any other hotel ever- and I've stayed at many over the years. Not only did the fees not make sense, but even those did not match up to the extra $90 he was charging us. We told him we would not pay, and we were going to cancel and stay elsewhere. Mike said this is standard, and that it's not his fault- he was pretty rude throughout all of this. We walked outside, and we're sitting in our car in the parking lot, calling Priceline, when he came out and all of a sudden the price had dropped to $117. We were expecting around a hundred because there was also a pet fee of $20 and sales tax, but even with the reduced price, we felt it was still high, and did not trust them. We finally got everything cancelled, and nothing was charged to our card, but it messed everything up- we looked for a hotel for 2 hours after leaving that would accept pets, but it's not easy finding that, or a room at 5 in the morning anyway! We ended up finding a room, but the check in time was at 3pm. We ended up sleeping in our car with our dog, for a few hours the hanging out until check in time. Ended up staying at the Dockers Inn, for one night, and it was really good. Oh, and all the extra fees Mike said was standard, this hotel did not charge- just the pet fee. AVOID lodge st falls!

The place was quiet, plenty of parking, the rooms were a decent size, with the beds and pillows better than most economy places I have stayed. The kids loved the cookies and popcorn available in the lobby. We did have a bit of trouble when making our reservations. What happened was my husband had heard an ad on local radio saying if you mentioned the ad when you called the motel you got such and such a rate. Well, when he called the motel they didn't know anything about the ad and wouldn't give him that rate. My husband called the radio station and talked to the advertising dept., luckily he got the gal who had dealt directly with the motel on the ad, and she called the motel for him and got it straightened out. It seemed kind of silly that they wouldn't believe him as it was the same rate people have gotten through Priceline. As for their advertised breakfast, the gravy is a very bland, plain white gravy mix; however, the biscuits are very nice, but they did run low on them both mornings we were there, and we were there early. There were always plenty of the yummy donuts though. I was a little disappointed that they didn't offer hard boiled eggs, which seem to be available on a lot of complimentary breakfasts these days. Also, the breakfast staff did not seem to speak English and was rather remiss in refilling things such as coffee creamer, sweetener, and cream cheese. I noticed a few people asking for things and they were pretty much ignored. One particular incident I saw was a guy showing the lady in charge of breakfast that they were out of biscuits and instead of her letting him know there weren't anymore she just turned and walked into the room they kept the food in. He stood there for a bit thinking she was coming back with more. Would I stay there again?
