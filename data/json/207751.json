Saint Honore and we could not have been happier. The location is superb. You are around the corner from the Louvre-Rivoli stop on the 1 line and three blocks from the Louvre and Palais Royal subway stop. The rooms were quite comfortable, roomy, and very clean. There are many different options for room sizes so when you make your reservation, call or research the choices. If you want a large room that is typical of most American style rooms, they have them but they will cost more which is typical of Europe. The standard room was perfect and appropriate for what we were looking for. The bathroom was much larger than most European bathrooms which was a plus. You have free wi-fi; only person can use the account at a time but the fact that internet is free, I think the limits are not a deal breaker. The staff is wonderful and attentive! All were so professional and helpful. They made our stay lovely. For travelers who like to spend most of the time outside of the hotel, walk the city and take public transportation, this is a perfect place. If you are looking for a hotel with several restaurants, a lively bar, and more amenities, this may not be the best option. Within 100 feet of the hotel are two local boulangeries that have great pastries and coffee for less than 3 euro. North of the hotel are some local places within 5 clocks--Rue de Montregeuil has a great market and you can shop at the local chocolatiers, wine shops, and bakeries. Streets like Rue Montmartre offer travelers the chance to roam through non-touristy neighborhoods. The cookware shops like Dehellerin, G. Detou, and A. Simon are also close by. Within a 15 minute walk, you can get to the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, L'Orangerie, and Jardin de Tuileries. In terms of restaurants, you have three great sandwich shops, Cafe Ruc, Cafe Bis, Cafe Saint Honore, and Le Petit Machon; all present local Parisian menus but cater to tourists. I would stay at the Best Western again in a heartbeat!", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Comfort and Cleanliness.\u201d", "Author": "eibhlin c C", "ReviewID": "UR126248100", "Content": "Excellent location adjoining the Louvre.

If you don\u2019t mind sleeping in a tiny room, that has anyway everything you need, this is possibly one good choice combining the most convenient location and reasonable pricing. Hotel has been probably made out of a very old building, nestled between two others, and from the narrow fa\u00e7ade you can already imagine the size the room will have. When you step inside all common areas are modernly furnished and d\u00e9cor is morbid and cosy. We visited during a very cold winter so when you step back in it\u2019s always nice to enjoy a hot tea in front of a warm fireplace (a gas-powered one). Pros: - Location, location, location. If you Land in Charles de Gaulle airport you take the RER B to Chatelet, then switch and take metro number 1, and hotel is just one stop away and 30 seconds from the subway station. Furthermore it is not facing the trafficked Rue de Rivoli but the quiet Rue St. Honor\u00e9. My room was facing an inner courtyard, meaning I had a good silent undisturbed sleep at night. As the name states, the hotel is just opposite the Louvre Museum and 10 minutes from Notre Dame. You also get a pretty good choice of restaurants nearby which are not too expensive and cater also for locals and not just tourists. I will recommend a couple: Pizza Oskian has good pizza (and I\u2019m Italian I can tell!) and is reasonably priced offering full meals from 15 to 19 euros including dessert. In the evening I recommend the tiny \u201cLe Petit Machon\u201d. Specialties from Lyon and lovely atmosphere. - Hotel is clean, staff is helpful, room was Ok and had all amenities. Internet is WIFI-FI and offered free of charge throughout your stay. Hotel is silent which means you can rest and sleep well. I was sleeping on the 4th floor and there was only one other room except mine. Cons: - Classic room is very tiny. Even though it is very nicely furnished and d\u00e9cor is also original two people will need to move one at a time or you will bump against each other! Being alone I had nothing to complain. It\u2019s true they have bigger deluxe rooms, 10 square meters more spacious, but you must be willing to pay much more to get one. Bathroom was also small but clean and you get only a shower, not a bathtub (which was fine with me). You get Lanvin amenities in the bathroom. - No complimentary tea and coffee and no complimentary bottle of water. - When we arrived at the hotel the man at the reception was on lunch break. I find it really extravagant that a hotel chain like Best Western cannot provide a replacement. We were ushered in by a maid and were left alone waiting for like 20 minutes. Then we decided to go have a lunch and left there our luggage and went back to check in after lunch. Being a 4 star hotel management should at least have two people at the reception alternating each other. Besides this my overall experience was more than positive. At the time of my booking my room was 175 euros. Good value for money considering service and location.

The problem was paying $300 a night for a small place with no services to speak of, banking on its location to overcharge. This has become a big problem in Paris generally. These small hotels are edging closer to what one might pay to stay in a chain or full service hotel without providing any of the advantages...no concierge, no bellman to carry your bags up, a squeeze in size elevator, and a breakfast that cost what we Americans pay for a good dinner at home, $27 (without wine.) I have visited Paris over 50 times. I love the city, but it is more of an economic challenge each time, and I find it difficult to be loyal to any hotel. We did spend years staying at the Holiday Inn Republique, but it has morphed into the Crown Royal and doesn't look the same.

The hop on and off open top tour bus stop in located there too which is great and the most convenient way to see the sights if your strapped for time like we were. The staff at reception where helpful and the room we had was clean. Our bathrooms was spacious for EU standards. Don\u2019t forget to take your electricity convert plugs. We forgot ours at home so had to borrow one from the lobby (need to give a 10euro deposit which you get back once the plug is returned). Breakfast wasn\u2019t part of our holiday deal and we were glad we didn\u2019t opt for it as it\u2019s an extra 19euro's per person!!!! Rip off - don\u2019t do it. You\u2019re better off popping into a cafe or bakery to pick up a few croissants to keep you ticking over until Lunch when you can enjoy the atmosphere and people watching culture of Paris. If you want to go to Disneyland Paris from this hotel for the day then make sure you get your tickets BEFORE you entre Paris as they are soooooooo expensive to buy on the day. We got ours on board the Eurostar from London for roughly \u00a348 per person. If we waited to get them from the Hotel lobby or the Disney Park we would have had to pay 170 odd euros!!! The Metro trains are really easy to use so don\u2019t be afraid. The closest Metro station was located about 3 minutes away from the hotel and is called Louvre Rivoli. From here you can get the yellow 1 train to the Chatelet stop where you can get the red A train to take you straight to Disneyland. From Louvre Rivoli you can also the yellow 1 train to the Champs-Elysees (great for food, shopping and Arc de Triomphe and museum vistis. Nothing to do with the hotel but a word of warning for when you go to the Eiffel Tower - people selling key chains and figurines will follow you everywhere and there are at least 10 people selling the same gear!! Very annoying. I wouldn't trust the guys selling water at the tourist places either...they are only for 1euro's compared to the shops/cafe's where you have to pay between 2.50-4.50euros but i would always go for the 2.50-4.50euros bottled water hands down every time - got a feeling they just fill the empty bottles with normal water and then seal the caps with glue....so you have been warned.

From there you can either a) connect onto Line 1 of Metro and get off at Palais Royal OR b) walk from Chatelet station to the hotel which is a 5 minute walk down Rue St Honore to hotel. It;s a lovely small hotel and very reasonably priced !!!!

The hotel is in a great central location with good access to the metro and RER services. The staff were all very friendly and spoke extremely good english. The hotel was nicer than I had expected with the rooms being large and spacious. There were only two downsides to this small typically french hotel. 1. The bedrooms were quite warm and the air conditioning wasn't great. Although the weather was hot during out stay 2. The rooms have a shower head connected to the tap which does work, however there was NO shower curtain!! therefore showering was a little difficult without soaking the bathroom. Other than that I would certainly recommend this hotel as it is well priced, very clean and generally a great little hotel.", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, hotel just okay.....\u201d", "Author": "Bobster2006", "ReviewID": "UR6811496", "Content": "As previous reviews say, the hotel is in a great location, so I will not witter on again about that suffice to say that they're spot-on. The hotel itself is not great. We we're lucky and had the only room in the hotel with a balcony (room 201). Others in our party who had reserved the same superior rooms got much smaller rooms at the back of the hotel. Seems that the majority of the rooms are serviced by 1 small corridor/stairwall and we did not see any fire escape route except out the window, and down the drainpipe. In general, the rooms could do with a lick of paint and some modernisation. They are habitiable though. You may find a wardrobe door hanging off or a socket not working but they're (just) okay as a base to explore. Breakfast was again, just okay, but be prepared to get the evil eye if you are still there 1 minute after 10am. Or arrive at 9.50am. Staff weren't that great either - \"Can I have a knife\" - \"No you can't\" (it was close to breakfast closing). No corkscrew in the hotel - it was suggested I purchase one down the road. Not to mention the non-existant honesty bar (the one with the non-existant corkscrew). But hey, the whole experience wasn\u2019t too bad and it certainly didn\u2019t wreck the weekend. Just set your expectations slightly lower than the hotel website. If you are arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport, you can get an RER train direct to Chatlet les Halles and then it\u2019s a five minute walk to the hotel.", "Date": "February 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cAWFUL HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "jazzymanchester", "ReviewID": "UR6550912", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel on the 30/12/06 for 3 nts, the hotel was very small and the first room we were put in was tiny and over looking a big generator (ROOM 111) We went to reception and they changed us very reluctantly to room 102 on the bottom floor, This room was more spacious but the room leaked every night with water through the ceiling dripping all night, When we informed the hotel staff they said the hotel was FULL and if we were not happy to change hotels, The tv was not working at all and the towel rail was broken, the internet sites were not working, if you are staying on the ground floor the door adjacent to your room bangs all day and night as it is the only entrance to all the other rooms, The lifts are 30cms in width tiny, The hotel staff were very unhelpful and couldnt be bothered with even a good morning, we enquired about places to go on new years eve and we were told to go out and ask at restaurants, not very helpful.........

We were not disappointed, as the location is perfect for visiting all the sights and the room was spacious and clean with pleasant decor. The problems we had were more with the service than the accomodation. When we arrived in the room, the TV did not work. I went downstairs to inform the receptionist that it wasn't working in our room. He told me that he knew this and none of the TVs in the hotel were working. He said they had rung and faxed their maintainancce company who hadn't responded and they didn't know when they would be fixed. When asked how long they had been broken a few days. Later that day my mum and I spoke to a couple who were staying until New Year and they believed that this had been the case for the past two weeks. This is not such a big deal, as we didn't come to Paris to watch TV, but it was very quiet at night and it is nice to watch french TV to see what is happening in the rest of the country and in Paris. In addition to this problem, the staff were really unfriendly and it was hard work to even get a greeting out of them, in either english or french. The breakfast was fine, but really just the minimum. The breakfast staff even complained rudely to guests arriving for breakfast at 9.40am, even though breakfast was served until 10am. All of the hotel staff gave the impression that they didn't want the guests to be there and everything was just too much effort for them before christmas. Accomodation-wise, the hotel is very well located, comfortable and cosy. Unfortunately these problems cast a shadow over the experience as a whole and we would not be able to recommend this hotel. We have stayed in Paris many times and know what to expect from capital city hotels. For the price of the rooms, you can do a lot better!", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newtownards, N.Ireland", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "wetfarm", "ReviewID": "UR5981186", "Content": "I would recommend anyone stays in this hotel based on my experience. Okay some people have reviewed that it is small...yes it is...but then again for the price you really wont get much bigger in the same location in Paris. We got a room on the very top floor at the front of the hotel, it had a lovely view and when you opened the window a lovely Paris breeze blew through the room. The room was not very noisy despite being at the front of the hotel. The location of the hotel really has to be its best point and should influence everyones decision as it really is superb. The Louvre is a 5 minute walk round the corner, the Opera a 10 minute walk straight up the road, the nearest Metro is a 3 minute walk, from which you are only 2 changes from Eiffel Tower. Slightly further away, walking again, you have Notre Dame - 15-20mins, Pompido Centre 10mins. This hoel really is a great base for any Parisien holiday, the staff are very helpful & friendly and will help with anything you ask and they speak good English. The breakfasts are alright though I have had better, though it is a buffet and the croissants are very nice, perfect start to a busy day in Paris. We went for 4 nights and ran out of time!!
