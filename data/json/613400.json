We are a couple who does a lot of international travel so we are pretty well versed on how to handle various situations. To begin with, the office had given me the wrong number for the man (Rocky) who was supposed to meet us; when I called the office number I got a fax line, and then after finding supplementary numbers on my bberry ( at a lot of expense for roaming charges I might add) , I finally got a hold of the 'manager' was rude and unhelpful. We had a booking for a two bedroom with a third floor terrance overlooking a canal...what we got was a tiny studio really for only one person, without a real bed, no real chair, only one electrical outlet that worked, the makeshift kitchen ( about a 2'X3' area) wasn't equipped at all, there was garbage in the hallways and, by the way, no canal view-- in fact what we had was a 20 cm by 20 cm window that overlooked garbage in an alley. This was most definitely a fraudulent misrepresentation of the apartment--definitely not what we were led to believe we would have. When we demanded that we be moved, the manager hung up on us and wouldn't take any other calls we made. It seemed that this was a scam that had played out before with 'Rocky' being the 'good' guy and the office manager being the bad guy. Rocky had warned us that even if we didn't stay there, the manager would put through the booking costs anyway... so we might as well just stay there. We did not stay.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cTotally diasappointed.. had to move to a hotel\u201d", "Author": "just-another-TA", "ReviewID": "UR8508301", "Content": "This was by far the most disappointing of apartments I've stayed in. Though we booked for 2, we booked a 4 ppl room \"just in case\" as we were told these apartments are stingy with room space.. They must have noted there were only 2 of us, so gave us a rather disappointing sized room (although we paid double the price) When we had a look around, the houses next to us were burnt down and really nasty. The area is not great at all, and the facilities were quite disappointing.. The \"NO INTERNET\" was even more disappointing as since we were no longer able to stay there (my husband has back problems; the bathroom was too too tiny and we had to change accommodation straight away), it was difficult to search for available accommodation (no refund from Manuela, obviously, nor any sympathy for my husband)- the worst thing was that I specifically emailed Manuela previously to ask for appropriate bathroom facilities.. she didn't respond but I hoped that would have definitely been taken into account- now I realise WHY she didn't respond. I would never recommend this place to anyone, it is very small, very claustraphobic. the kitchen and bathrooms are way too small and the main room is just not adequate for 2 ppl, let alone the 4 we booked for. Hope this review helps someone else. We ended up moving to a hotel next to san marco, (we didnt have any choice as we had to book it on the same day) but we had no regrets moving whatsoever.", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cfellow travellers beware!!\u201d", "Author": "CHATSWORTH", "ReviewID": "UR5324068", "Content": "I'm really not a complainer but felt that I had to warn fellow travellers about our experience. It's a bit lengthy but bear with me as it might save you some problems. We booked the apartment in Santa Croce as we particuarly wanted to be near the Piazzale Roma and the station. Heavy luggage, friends in area, etc. As this was an apartment I contacted agents a couple of days before we left to find out where to meet the rep to collect the keys and be shown around the place. Not a problem as have done this several times before in Venice. Realised thru e-mails that we were not going to stay in apartment we'd booked but to another one rented out by the company. Tried to rectify this but without success so had no choice but to go where instructed. Not a good start. Tried to resolve when we met the rep nothing doing.! I'll list problems with accommodation. Room not cleaned till after 7 pm, hot water not working till after 11pm, no proper bed just a really cheap sofa bed, no a/c and fan broken and not replaced, plug points broken and probably a health risk, no corkscrew, tin or bottle opener, surely basic kitchen equipment, drawers broken, shower screen and hose holder broken and shower needed a really good clean as did whole apartment, TV not working properly. Also other things wrong but these are main ones. Rep was pleasant but seemed very busy meeting guests, cleaning rooms, etc single-handed. Some problems were never resolved. Tried to complain to agents who agreed there was a problem with overbooking but we had to complain to VR directly. All very well, but we booked with agents and they should take some responsibility, especially for what's on their own website. Plus point, apartment was very quiet and central, campo San Toma is charming and just 2 minutes from vaporetto stop. And Venice is fabulous, of course.", "Date": "June 8, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Venezia Residence", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d613400-Reviews-Venezia_Residence-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$124 - $303*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Santa Croce E San Polo</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "613400", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ea/11/ea113b9c0ef845b43b6f5a0bfc6e7a9d1large.jpg"}}
