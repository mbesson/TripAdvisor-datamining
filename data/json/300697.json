Transportation from the airport is very easy to and fro. We took the train into Hong Kong Island and a cab back to the airport when we decided to leave. You have to visit the street markets when in Hong Kong. We plan on returning early 2013 and this is the place to stay for us.

When I followed up with them again to see if they have located it, they send the security to our room and moved the beds looking for it. They then proceeded to search through every inch of my son's luggage and wanted to start searching my wife's luggage when we stopped them. They made us feel like we are thieves when we needed them to located our lost item. They later sent a \u00a0bottle of cheap wine to apologize but my item is still lost and I did not expect to be treated like that by a 5 star hotel management. I asked to speak to the hotel manager but I only get to speak to the same assistant front office manager who came to search our room who insisted that they were providing us a service when searching through our belongings!

Service was at the Asian prestige hotel standard, impeccable. The executive room was spacious and well-appointed, with particularly nice bathrooms. Widescreen television with good selection of HK and international stations. Very nice bedside control panels for lights and motor-driven drapes. Pacific Place location is fabulous for meetings at the Pacific Place or elsewhere in Admiralty, and via MTR or cab is very accessible to Central (but see note below regarding outbound cabs). WiFi was free (or, at least included) and was satisfactory -- although I note that as a US visitor I would not have been able to stream any media and can't vouch whether the WiFi is good enough for that. The club-floor suite provides a nice full breakfast everyone (once again, with good service) albeit with a fairly paltry evening-hour service (cocktails ending at 8:30 p.m., for example). Did not use the business center, fitness center, pool, or any of the hotel bars or restaurants. Problems? There were some. First, the hotel is unfortunately positioned right on top of Queensway and very close to Harcourt and a result the \"better\" rooms -- facing the Harbor -- are noisy even on high floors, and big enough truck / buses breaking / idling can cause a palpable vibration. The noise isn't intolerable, but is annoying. Until and unless the hotel installs strong noise damping in walls and windows, I'd strongly recommend requesting a \"hill\" or \"pool\" view, and as high a floor as possible, and staying at the Conrad or Island Shangri-La if only harbor views are available Second, the lobby is distinctively perfumed -- this trend is to be despised. Third, the keys had a tendency to \"lose\" their memory or not be encoded properly to begin with; twice in four days I had to have my key recoded. Fourth, the hotel seems to be set up quite poorly in terms of getting taxis: two different times I was in 15-20 minute wait for taxis in the lobby, which is unacceptable for HK. The Conrad, Shangri-La and Pacific Place Mall taxi-stands (all within 100 feet of the taxi lineup for the JW Marriott) each seemed to get their share of taxis first.

We stayed 8 nights. The staff is most attentive. The check in was speedy and flawless. All of the staff from bell hops, restaurant serving staff to concierge and more are wonderful and most helpful. Really, probably some of the most attentive of any hotel I have stayed. Always a warm smile! The lobby offers sweeping view of the harbor and skyline of HK - very impressive. The room was spacious. We actually had 2 different rooms as we wanted a mountain view and harbor view. One room was a bit bigger. The bed was VERY comfortable - the linens were top quality and wonderful. If you are interested in small details, you will love the little compartment in the bathroom with numerous ammenities. After a day of exploring I had a blister and found Band-AIdes and forgot my ponytail holders and sure enough there were some there! Razors with shaving cream, toothbrushes w paste, bath salts, and nice shampoo and hand lotion products etc... We are platinum members so we are fortunate to be able to use the Concierge level that is 2 levels with unforgettable views of the Harbor. A fabulous breakfast was available. wonderful teas, coffees and anything you can possible imagine! It also offers a \"Tea time\" - again outstanding food - lovely sandwiches/ scones etc.. Evening - happy Hour with wonderful assortment of wines, champagnes, cocktails and delicious food! We tried the Chinese restaurant there - Very good! We utilzed the concierge on many occasion and they were extraordinary. A previous reviewer said they were not veryt helpful to them - we found the opposite and we asked some unusual questions! I did wonder why there was no gift shop as well. That would be my only complaint. It is in walking distance of Hong Kong Park and I highly reccomend walking there and taking a walk and enjoying this oasis so close by!!! The metro and buses are so easy to use here as well and an easy to walk to get to both. I enjoyed the Yoga class on Saturdays - very good instructor. The pool is nice and they give you a cold wash cloth and a glass of water when you arrive! We went a couple of times. The gym is adequate.

That said, My travel involves meetings that require a few needed components. First, I can't understand why a hotel like the JW Marriott has no on site gift shop. It connects to a large mall, but I don't need Tiffany, Prada, or any one of the other high end fashion stores that populate the mall. I need a gift shop that sells simple things like wrapping paper. Try finding that! Next, the Concierge is supposed to be the hotel problem solver. That's not the case here. When asked where I could buy wrapping paper the Concierge looked at me like I was from Mars, and was unable to help. Now, I don't want to sound as if the only important thing for most people is the ability to buy wrapping paper, but you may want to buy toothpaste, or something simple yet needed. Good luck! The rooms are ok but small. The Harbor view room I have has a bed with no backboard, but a bed level indent/shelf behind that makes sitting up in bed to watch TV or work difficult. The buffet breakfast is excellent, and about average in price for a hotel in HK. There are plenty of good restaurants in the hotel or connected mall. Then again, in a food paradise like Hong Kong, why eat in a hotel? I'm not keen on the location because it's a pretty good walk downhill from Pacific Place to anywhere, but cabs are plentiful and not that expensive. I've been to Hong Kong dozens of times before.

We had a good search around the hotels reviewed on tripadvisor, and finally chose the JW, one of the reasons being they were willing to accomodate our whole family of 4 in one room. This was not easy, as our kids are aged 6 and 10, and many hotels required us to book 2 rooms or didn't have beds big enough to fit us all. Two rooms would be okay if they were interconnecting, but some hotels couldn't guarantee us that either, so the JW was the final combination of the right room, price and location. We arrived having booked a room with a king bed with one extra bed, but they then offered us an upgrade (package, not free) to a harbour view room with 2 queen size beds, breakfast for 4 and a late check out. The price to upgrade was not cheap, but it ticked the right boxes for us definitely, as we had been a bit disappointed that we didn't have breakfast included when we booked online, and our flight home was late in the evening. The harbour view was a nice added extra, although it must be said that because of the hotel's location, the view is not a panoramic harbour view as such, quite a few buildings on the Hong Kong side in the way, but still nice. Overall we had a great time. The reception and concierge staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful. My 6 year old \"wants to stay at the JW a thousand years\" because they gave them both a little teddy bear each. We enjoyed the breakfast for the quality of the products, notably the dim sum selection, the fresh raspberries and blueberries, as well as a smoothie/fruit juice combo station. Only thing my husband noted was he didn't think the quality of the fresh coffee was up to scratch, but made up for it when we tried fresh tea instead the next day and got a pot of tea with fresh tea leaves instead of a teabag. Everyone comments on the extremely convenient location of the hotel on top of Pacific Place, and we would second that. Our earlier choice of hotel was one in Wanchai itself, but this actually suited us more, as it's a quieter location but still very convenient. Being a bit lazy and having 2 tired kids traipsing around, we ate inside Pacific Place 3 times in 3 days, twice at Zen restaurant, once at Ye Shianghai. Excellent food at both places, but quite pricey too. I don't actually think the shopping at Pacific Place is all that exciting, but it's convenient enough to go to any of the other big malls.

The room was not large, but was very clean, had plenty of storage, was comfortable and luxurious, bathroom was clean and well equipt, bedroom had a big screen tv, internet, desk and Bose music system. The staff throughout the hotel are friendly and go out of their way to assist, including those in the fitness centre. The hotel laundry is right next to the fitness centre, which is handy after a workout (offering same day service). It is a big hotel, with many wonderful features. The food in the restaurants is great, and the hotel lobby a relaxing place for a coffee. Had dinner at the Man Ho restaurant (level 3), the service was excellent and the food very special. There was a prawn dish that came in a wasabi sauce that was exceptional. I would highly recommend heading in for a bite, but remember to book. I would recommend this hotel and will certainly stay here again on my next trip. Having the Pacific place shopping centre and rail directly below the hotel is a great convenience, so makes this a great hub. It is an easy (mainly air conditioned) walk through to Landmark or the IFC mall. The hotel helped organise bookings at some great very popular restaurants elsewhere in HK (such as Yung Kee on Wellington St) and even placed a order for a few of the famous local delicacies to get us started. As with any hotel in this range the room service is quite pricey. The in room safe is too small for a laptop computer.

We have lived in Hong Kong before and chose this hotel for our first return visit. The hotel was revamped a few years back and rooms are still in good shape. Rooms aren't huge (typical for HK) but the rooms we booked had all the amenities you need - separate tub/shower in bath, small safes, electronic controls for lighting and drapes, mini-bar, DVD player, wireless internet, etc. etc. Beds are on firm side as preferred in this part of world, but us Americans still slept comfortably on them. Here are some tips about the hotel and why we chose it. First - if you're visiting HOng Kong for first time and want to stay on Hong Kong island, do consider this hotel. It usually factors into business travel plans, but was a great place for family too. The location is excellent - walking distance to central district - right on top of Pacific Place mall with great shopping, dining, Whole Foods type grocery - right on top of subway stop. Second - things clear out at this hotel most weekends, so rates go down and it's easy to use all the facilities. Pool and hot tub were nearly empty on Saturday afternoon. Third - we obtained the club level services, and feel it's worth it. Breakfast was the best food presentation - lunch and dinner are very light/limited. We ate breakfast in the lounge every day, and got snacks and drinks at other times. The view of harbour from lounge is fabulous. Fourth - the Fish Bar restaurant next to hotel pool is excellent for simple grilled fish. A bit pricey but a great casual experience. If you don't do club level, the breakfast buffet downstairs is also excellent, but also a bit pricey. We are Marriott Rewards members and the hotel really went all out to recognize that. The front desk staff was very helpful in making some adjustments to our reservation at check-in time, looking at our rewards account and determining best way for us to upgrade. In general staff was very attentive and provided great service.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunset, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cFabulous\u201d", "Author": "mamapapa64", "ReviewID": "UR127766025", "Content": "Great hotel......a little 'out of the way' but we learned you can walk through buildings to get to the Star Ferry and other central business places..............Stay stayed on the executive floor that provided cocktails and appetizers plus breakfast each day - well worth the extra.

It was a corner room with a great view of the harbour. It is very very clean and has a separate shower, bathtub, comfy beds, nice linens, desk, chairs, TV with lots of channels and a DVD player, fridge, safe, and kettle.

The lounge serves some of the best snacks all day long and you can have your breakfasts there too. However we find the breakfasts to be rather boring after a few days as they basically serve the same thing over and over again (this is a grouse I have with all Marriot's properties). We never tried any of the restaurants in the hotel- the best and inexpensive food can be found outside the hotel!

On my first visit, I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong. I preferred the location of the JW Marriott over the Hyatt. It's more central than the Hyatt which is located next to the convention center, The Marriott is located within the Pacific Place complex of shopping, restaurants and other hotels and is directly connected to the MTR at the Admiralty station which makes using the MTR extremely convenient. A tip however when using the Airport Express train is to get off at the Central station (last stop), and take a taxi to the hotel. While the you can transfer at Central station between the Airport Express and the Island Line to get to the JW, it's a long walk and you may find it difficult dragging luggage with you. I prefer taking the train over a car service or taxi. Not only is it much less expensive, you can get from the airport to central station in 22 minutes. It can take 45 minutes to an hour or more depending on traffic in a car. We arrived at the JW at 9:30 PM after a 17 hour non-stop flight from EWR. I had booked a three night stay using points. I'd suggest if you have them, this is a good hotel to use them in. The lowest rate listed on their website during our stay for a standard room was $600 USD per night. Being a Platinum Elite member of Marriott, our stay also included access to their Executive lounge. The thing I really enjoy about staying at Marriott's or Renaissance hotels internationally is the Executive lounge and The JW Hong Kong has one of the best I've ever been to (and I've stayed at a lot of Marriott's). The difference between domestic and international lounges is night and day. First off, they are open 7 days a week, not just weekdays like domestic locations. They also have longer hours. Generally between 6AM and 12 midnight. The (full) bar in the evening is complimentary as opposed to the limited honor bar at domestic locations and the food presentations throughout the day are wonderful. Again, if your a Marriott Gold or Platinum Elite member, access to the lounge is included as part of your Elite status although anyone can pay to access the lounge and I certainly consider it if I weren't an Elite member. Even though we arrived late, our room was not yet available. We were escorted to the lounge to wait and within five minutes, the concierge in the Executive lounge handed us our keys to an upgraded, harbor view suite (another perk of being a Platinum Elite member). The room had a living room/dining room combination with a large, built in flat screen HDTV. A large separate bedroom with desk and another built in flat screen HDTV and a bathroom that was a bit on the small side with a Jacuzzi tub, separate shower but only a single sink. But that was the only downside on an otherwise very comfortable room. They even had live goldfish on the dining room table! The JW Hong Kong has a very nice gym and spa located on the bottom floor of the hotel. All the equipment looked new and the gym space itself was very attractive. The locker rooms (both men's and woman's), reminded me more a Vegas spa than a business hotel. Wood lockers, steam room, sauna and whirlpool. The gym is a bit on the small size given the fact that this is a 600+ room hotel so it can get busy, especially in the early morning hours. But it is open 24/7. Besides the Executive lounge, we only ate at the Fish Bar and Grill which is located next to the rooftop pool. The restaurant is casual and open air and the food and service were excellent. Being that you're in the heart of Hong Kong you literally have thousands of choices when deciding where and what you want to eat. The food is one of the best things about coming to Hong Kong. The JW Marriott is a great place to stay when visiting Hong Kong and I plan to stay here on future trips to the city. Every staff member we encountered could not have be friendly or more helpful.

In my opinion this is one of the best hotels in Hong Kong, but more importantly, its location is superb. Located on Hong Kong Island, this hotel offers everything you need. First, it lets out directly into the high end Pacific Place Mall, and it sits directly above the metro. This means you can get anywhere in the city fast and easily by stepping down to the metro. While cabs are available, there are many times during the day when the metro is much faster and easier to get and if you want to go to Kowloon, the metro is a MUST. Second, the mall offers a range of eating options, from inexpensive, wholesome breakfasts at reasonable rates, to one of Hong Kong's best Chinese restaurants. It also lets you out onto the elevated walkways which allows you to walk to most of the buildings in the area without even crossing a street. The hotel has absolutely top-notch service, from the front desk to every staff member I met. They even have someone to open the exterior doors for you. The rooms are unique in design and layout, offering stunning views out of panoramic windows covering 2 walls of each room. You even have electric switches to open and close the curtains (either the blackout curtains, or just the sheers). It has gorgeous granite and stone tile bathrooms.

The person cleaning up noticed that we were impressed with the taste of the goodies and, without asking us, wrapped up the rest of them and gave to us! The lounge concierge told us that we would have a concierge floor level room without a view and we were disappointed, so she found us a mid-level room with a view which made us very happy.

The corner rooms are larger, but we did not get one on this trip; we were happy to get our view which was indeed spectacular. Years ago, when we first stayed at this property, it was a Marriott and then, eventually, it was re-branded within the Marriott family to its JW name and status. The hotel exceeds the JW Marriott standards. The outdoor pool is wonderful and opens at 6 am for the lap swimmers. It is glorious to be in the middle of the city and be able to swim in such a great pool. Actually, for pool lovers in Hong Kong, the pool at the Renaissance Hong Kong is even larger and grander ! The selection and quality of food in the executive lounge is among the best at any Marriott lounge worldwide and will dazzle even the fussiest person's tastebuds and eyes.

The executive lounge was a godsend and has s decent cocktail and dinner spread included in the price of your room. I especially liked the steak tar tar. Beware, the regular king rooms are very small. I called downstairs to have portable bed placed in our room and was told they had run out. I gave them a bit of temper, but didn't pursue it too much, since it WAS New Year's Eve and all, and things were bound to be bonkers all around. I settled for having a little mattress type thing brought up by the housekeeping staff. They laid it on the floor with some bedding. I thought having the channel guide printed on a bamboo scroll was slightly bizarre and probably too much kitsch. The elevators were more annoying than usual--since they use this weird electronic key instead of key cards, I was constantly fumbling with mine to try and insert it into the keyhole so I could access my room.

The JW competes with three other hotels in Pacific Place. The most positive point about the JW Mariott is the great staff. Mariott provides two days off for their employees which is evident from their engagement and \"can do\" attitude towards guests. They are engaged, friendly and always willing to help. Beds are comfortable, bathroom ammenities are excellent, towels are fluffy and the internet service is acceptable. Carpets are worn and the executive lounge - which was refurbished a couple of years ago - is showings its age and is still undersized for the number of people they serve. I feel so bad for the great lounge staff who are forced to work out of a kitchen the size of a closet. Food in the lounge and in the hotel in general is great- rather exceptional in some cases. The property has slowly degraded and needs investment. Standard rooms - even on the executive floor - are very small (even by Hong Kong standards) and suitable for only one guest. This hotel is functional but very busy and not a place you will experience luxury on any scale. It is popular with Americans and you will find large numbers of young families with strollers and kids running around. The gym - located on the lower ground level - is well furnished and very functional with dedicated staff who have been working there for a significant time. Their is no SPA and the mens locker room is small with and suffers from a terrible sewer gas smell with is sometimes so overpowering you must take your shower elsewhere.

Obviously we were not happy to be disturbed. In my opinion, this should have been done by 8:00 and never ever when the guests are resting in the room!

A really nice bar with evening entertainment and a number of good dining choices. Breakfast was good with both hot and continental buffets available. Pricewise it was in line with the usual cost of a major city centre hotel, so not cheap, but you get what you pay for. All in all, a good choice and I am now torn between my tried and tested favourite the Conrad, and the JWM.

This is far cheaper than a traffic congested taxi ride and the train is very comfortable and clean. Check when you buy the ticket at the airport terminal which hotels have free drop off.

We had an excellent stay at this hotel. The rooms are amazing - large and comfortable. The hotel is designed such that each room gives a feel of being a corner room - every room has two large windows. Our room over saw the hills and the conrad hotel with th epool below. There would be nothing else that I could have asked for in the room. The twin beds were large enough for each of us to sleep with one baby comfortably. The bathroom was large and had a shower quibical and a tub. The breakfast restaurant was the only one we ever visited given the young children. It spread is one of the largest I have seen and of excellent quality. They even have haggen daz ice cream which my kids froke out on. The service at this restaurant (and accross the hotel) is outstanding. The chef who cooks the eggs to order kept an eye out on most guests and was very helpful. He made us make sandwitches from the breakfast buffet to take away along with muffins and fruits etc so that we dint struggle with the kids for food at disney or ocean park or other places we went to during the day. We ordered room service every day and thought it was very good. Limited vegitarian options but they are willing to try and do things off menu. The location is nice and quite close to most places. Walk to the peak. Once station change to disney by train (or 100 HKD and 30 min cab ride). It has a popular mall under it (pacific) and is a 5 min cab ride away from IFC the most popular mall in HK. Highly recommended to all especially if your traveling with kids. Forgot to mention that they hand out small teddy bears to kids when they see them. My kids were begining to have a personal collection in all colours till we had to politely say we already have so many of them.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo, Japan", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location but otherwise nothing special\u201d", "Author": "jamesjustin", "ReviewID": "UR114326214", "Content": "I stayed here for a few nights for a quick end of the year getaway.

There was nothing not thought of. We stayed for 5 nights in a JW Suite. We wanted extra space as we took our two children (18m and 3y) We got picked up from the airport with a car organised by the hotel. As we got in to the car we were offered Evian water and a cool facewasher. As we pulled up to the hotel there was a lady waiting for us to escort us straight to our room. With two tired kids it was made so easy. We walked into the room, a really good size for Hong Kong. We had a living room and bedroom. The cot was already set up for our younger child. (Often at other hotels, although i always request a cot when booking it is never in the room when we arrive) As we arrived late this was fantastic service. There was a bowl with two gold fish on the table which our kids loved! We had access to the executive floor. Highly recommend spending the extra to have this option! Especially anyone with kids! Food plenty and really really good. Service was fantastic. As soon as the saw us coming out of the lift the would have everything set up for us exactly how we liked it. The staff were so lovely. They were terrific with the kids. Some hotels find kids all too hard. But they made everything so easy our kids were so well behaved party because of staffs attitude. My favourite thing about the lounge was the Lychee Martinis!!! All the food and drink served in the lounge was really good quality. The lounge was great with the kids as we could take them there for a snack anytime and also their daily milk intake! Plenty of food. The pool are really lovely. Staff, once again fantastic. Nothing too hard. Pool are really lovely. We had a babysitter twice, which was booked through the hotel. It was expensive about $30 an hour or maybe a bit more but she was good with our children and it made leaving them with a stranger a little easier. She bought some toys and some DVD's which kept the kids calm when we walked out the door. The hotel itself is in a great location, connected to a shopping centre which was quite fancy. The hotel was very clean and all staff were fantastic. They went out of there way to make everything perfect. There was always someone to help if you need. They even helped me by pushing the pram with the 18m back to our room while I carried my 3 year old as she was too tired to walk the last 50m! All in all, i have stayed at a lot of hotels and this was the best hotel experience ever! We have been back home for 3 weeks and we still don't stop talking about our experience at the JW Marriott. We plan to go back to Hong Kong (leaving the kids at home, for the first time) and plan to stay their again in a room on the exec floor. I highly recommend this hotel. You wont be disappointed! Another fantastic touch was during the middle of our stay i had organised a late check out at 1pm and when we went to settle the bill on the last morning after breakfast the lady said will 1pm be late enough (for the children to have a sleep). I can make it a bit later if you need. This was so helpful and no other hotel has done that for us! Once again the attention to detail was superb. Thank you! As to the room, it was lovely, bathroom was spacious. House keeping service was exceptional, The room was cleaned daily and then when they came in to do the turn down service we were often out at dinner but at that time they restocked towels and remade bed so perfectly after the girls had a afternoon sleep.

The Bank of China Tower and HSBC building were 5 minutes walking distance from Pacific Place exit. The walkway connecting Pacific Place to Queensway Plaza led to the tram stop too.

The rest of the hotel staff is also very attentive. We had arranged for 5 massages when we first arrived and the overwhelming reaction was that Coco was the best massuere. The rates were affordable and the amenties were great...steam, sauna, and jacuzzi.

I strongly recommend the sushi from the JW California Restaurant and Sushi Bar, and of course, no Sunday morning would be complete without a visit to Man Ho Restaurant for some authentic Chinese Dim Sum. The hotel is respectful of changes to guests travel clocks and has formulated their room service menu to allow patrons to order from either a breakfast of dinner menu at any point throughout the day.

The bathroom was large and clean, containing both a bath tub and a separate stand up shower. The room was replenished daily with all required amenities, from the usual bath products to a bucket of bath salts and a loofa sponge. Complimentary water and fruit was delivered every day. The only negative point in the room was the mattress quality. The bed was too firm for my liking which resulted in a poor nights sleep. The health club was clean and comfortable and contained all of the equipment needed to have a good workout. The locker rooms were equipped with both a steam room and a sauna to help you relax after your workout. There was also a tanning bed available which I did not have an opportunity to use.

Service, like in the rest of Asia, was impeccable. So why 3 stars? First off, I agree with the other reviewer who said the hotel is beginning to look a bit \"dated\" - very 90s. The rooms are VERY small, even by HK standards. Beyond Marriott's control is that a large building is being constructed in front of the hotel. We moved to 33 to see \"over\" the building, but it's not yet done. I don't think there are going to be many harbor view rooms in another 6-12 months. As a point of comparison, When I got to HK (frequently), I stay at the Langham Place, The Langham, the Intercontinental, and the Sheraton. I think the Langham Place delivers best value for money and also a sense of style and humor that makes it feel a bit like a boutique hotel even though it's 42 stories tall! Overall, the JW is a decent but not outstanding hotel. If you're used to Four Seasons, Ritz, etc, this JW isnt going to compare to those - the rooms just are too small.

Its proximity to the Island Line MTR station (at Admiralty) made getting to the office very easy (no transfers & was only outside for ~50m, which was good for this time of year). And on a couple of evening I took the tram back from the office rather than the train, while 2-3 time the travel time sitting on the top level of the tram showed several places to explore. Since I am \"Marriott Gold\", I had access to their lounge for breakfast & snacks, its the best Marriott lounge I'd been in (quality/selection of food, drinks, service) with a great view of the harbour. Many of my colleagues stayed at the Sheraton in Kowloon (as they were Sheraton Gold), they paid about the same room rate but had a much less convenient commute (& more crowded train). As for my room, it was basically what everyone else described and very well decorated. We did have a couple of quirks, since my wife was with me but working from the hotel, we were short a bit of power (but we were running 2 laptops, a routers & 2 VoIP phones but who else but us would be traveling with that much gear & the desk space was even sufficient for the 2 of us). While it may seem a bit strange to give a hotel in this price range '5' for value, given the price & level of service it is great value. BTW - some one else mentioned that if you were taking the Airport Express to get off at Kowloon Station & take the MTR, not sure why as there is a shuttle from the Hong Kong station (a few feet from where you get off the train) that goes to the front door of the JW Marriott every 20 min.

LOCATION The JW Marriott might be a surprise choice for leisure travelers, but its location right on top of Pacific Place Mall, with access to the adjacent Admiralty subway station, is spot on. One can go anywhere by Metro-- Central and Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui are easily accessible, and cabs are easy to catch. It is a long walk or a quick cab ride to the HK Academy for the Performing Arts, and the Convention Center beyond it. Ocean Park buses leave from Admiralty Station too. There are dining options at the hotel and in Pacific Place and the nearby Star Street. A Watsons drug store at Pacific Place is handy for things travelers need. The dining options are decidedly gourmet rather than discount, to go with the designer stores, but those with champagne tastes on a beer budget can take their pick at the Great Food Hall at the lower level of Pacific Place. This food supermarket has a great selection of food- fruit, ready to eat cuisine from around the world, cheese, chocolate, a gelateria, wonderful produce and seafood, even an olive oil bar and more things we could not take home. You can even score some foie gras if you feel like it. (Thanks to Marissa who helped us pick some items that we could take home with us.) For Catholics, Star Street also has a Catholic Church housed in a modern tower block. SERVICE Right after I booked our stay online, the hotel's confirmation email was filled with helpful hints, weather reports, and offers on how to make our stay comfortable. We booked limousine service via the hotel, and so top notch service began from the moment we exited from airport customs. THE SWEETEST THING: Steven Lo, Guest Relations Manager, sent up a tray of milk (on ice), chocolate, and cookies with a pretty greeting card after he found out that my parents were celebrating their anniversary. The everyday service was excellent. Executive Level booking allowed us to be welcomed by Tiffani and checked in directly in our room. Coolio and other staff members helped us with our luggage and our other needs, seemingly arriving like a genie when we needed them after a day exploring the city. The Executive Lounge concierge desk under Noel Arevalo's supervision helped us plan our excursions and took care of our travel arrangement questions. Agnes gave us the weather report and directed us to the wonders of Great Food Hall, among others. Helen took care of writing out our destinations in Chinese for our cab rides. Everyone was very helpful, all the way to express check-out with Caroline. The Lounge wait staff- Vanessa, Lorna, Minda, Tess, and others- were very welcoming. Going for Executive Level was well worth it for the Wi Fi and the dining options. For senior citizens or tired travelers, or even busy business folks, the generous nibbles for breakfast and evening cocktails were a good way to start and end a day of exploration (or work) without the effort of going out. The coffee was excellent, and the spread was well-chosen each day. My parents were definitely spoiled by the experience- the JW Marriott set a new bar for service. ROOM The rooms are 31 square meters, perhaps small but normal and comfortable by Hong Kong standards. But they do not feel tight at all because two sides are picture windows, with drapes that could be conveniently drawn at the press of a button next to the bed. In our case, we had a view of the mountains and some nearby towers (including the Conrad and the Island Shangri-La on the same complex), with birds swooping by. For seniors with difficulty getting in and out of a tub, it was a nice touch that the shower stall was separate from the tub. The toiletries (Nirvae botanicals) were also good- we especially liked the orange and sandalwood lotion. The desk was well-equipped for work, with stationery items like highlighters and sticky pads and staplers, in case one forgot to bring them along. Free in-room Internet access would have been nice, but the Executive Lounge was conveniently nearby anyway. (I don't know why a lot of high-end hotels do not offer free Internet, while, for example, the mom-and-pop places on Panglao Island in Bohol made the length of Alona Beach essentially one long Wi Fi zone.) BTW, the Executive Lounge also had computer stations for those who are not packing their own gear.

We recommend going there in the fall or spring. Winter nights can be cold and miserable for sightseeing, and the summer is tropical. This is the first review of the hotels we visited. We have included info about HK as well. Location: The JW is beautifully situated above the high end Pacific Place Mall and surrounded by skyscrapers, which can make you feel a bit trapped at times if you are like I and are from some desolate place like West Texas. It is convenient to reach by Metro, which serves most of the places you will want to visit. The very tall Conrad and Shangri-La Hotels are across the street. Hong Kong JW Rooms: We used Marriott Rewards points for two rooms during our stay of 5 nights. (Our son and his fianc\u00e9 had a separate room with a city view.) Room 1502- We had to take two queen beds because that was all they had with any view of the water. There room smelled modly when we arrived, but we were too jetlagged to do anything about it. A/C ran nonstop, and it still smelled moldy. Had A/C repaired second day, and it still ran 24/7. We requested another room after 2 nights. (My engineer husband certifies hospital OR\u2019s for humidity, etc., and said the HVAC system drain was plugged and would take a major effort to repair.) Room 1205- A/C ran just fine\u2026not that often and room did not smell musty. With the A/C off, we could hear the highway traffic 15 floors below us. King bed was wonderful, and we had a view of the water. Fridges in both rooms were great for storing cold drinks and yogurt. Unless you want to remain fully dressed, the sheers covering the huge windows gave some privacy during the day as most of us are not accustomed to having 100,000 or so folks staring in our windows from the skyscrapers too close by. Concierge Lounge: It was outstanding, especially for breakfast and just relaxing. We had luscious scrambled eggs and very thin bacon every morning with fresh fruit and so much more to choose from. Lots of ice and cold drinks as well as fresh juice and yogurt were available in the fridge. The staff were superb and beyond helpful. We really appreciated them after we checked into the Shanghai JW, which did not have the same level of service. Concierge dinners tended to be on the starchy side with lots of carbs, but Sunday night had wonderful sliced lamb and pork. The desserts were to kill for, especially the vanilla custard/cr\u00e8me brulee type filling with raspberry puree topping. Lots of Chinese food as well. Staff were quite attentive and spoke great English as did most the folks that we met in HK. In the Concierge Lounge, we met some very friendly guests from all over the world, and they each had interesting things to share. There are two computers available there and free wireless. There were books and music CD\u2019s to borrow and lots of room to spread out and relax. The free newspapers and fantastic views were also great. We did not try the hotel restaurants because we were out sightseeing around lunch time and the concierge lounge food more than met our needs the rest of the time. Gym: Excellent choice of workout machines and staff that knew how to provide custom exercises with the equipment on hand. I needed leg adduction and abduction exercises, and they showed me how to do them without the machines in my regular gym. You will need to workout if you are eating the luxurious concierge lounge food! Pool: Incredible outdoor pool for laps although it can get busy on weekends. Empty during weekday business hours. Staff are extremely helpful offering water bottles and towels when they walk by. If you are a small to medium sized person, you can buy Tyr black swim suits at the pool. Otherwise bring a decent suit because you won\u2019t easily find your size in Hong Kong. Weekend Free Tai Chi classes at 9.30AM in the pool area: This was our first tai chi class, and we loved it. It felt great to stretch the day after a 15 hour flight. The instructor was patient with us five beginners, and the pool landscaping and view are unbelievable. Where to go in Hong Kong: Our first choice is the Museum of Art. The Wu Guanzong modern painting exhibit on the top floor was first class. The gift shop offers prints of many of the paintings. The second floor calligraphy and third floor porcelain statues will make your heart beat faster they are so captivating. We visited this museum twice, which is something we rarely do. Lunch in the caf\u00e9 was excellent; we had the pork chop special for 8USD, and one meal would have been plenty for two people. In nice weather you can sit on the lovely sculpture garden patio and enjoy the view of Hong Kong Island across the water. Please allow extra time for this museum, shop and caf\u00e9. Peak Tram Visit: Like every other tourist in HK, we took the Peak Tram just before sunset and spent 3 hours on top of the Peak. For the asocial, gourmand crowd, the Peak Lookout restaurant patio has a wonderful view of the harbor with no buildings obstructing the view. This will make you feel like you are in Micronesia or Hawaii, and not surrounded by 7 million pushy consumers. Be prepared for the long death march through zillions of stores as you circle umpteen times to take escalators up through each level of the main building on the Peak to the rooftop lookout. There must be a way to fake a handicap and take an elevator up because if you are not a shopper, this can be the tour from hell and calls for a tranquilizer before hand to survive the crowds. We wish someone had told us this before we endured this form of torture. If anyone in your group has a fear of heights or crowding, this is not the place to take them. Buy the video and stay away. It is not the place to have a major behavioral meltdown as I did just putting my head in my lap and enduring two hours of noisy, smoky hell after a lovely quiet meal on the patio. Beware that the smoke from the Burger King at the top is quite strong at the viewpoint. This has to be one of the worst places in the world for a smoky fast food dive. If you want a clear photo from the top, good luck. The clouds and haze are pretty much continuous, and the crowds at the railings ruin most of your shots. Take a full size tripod and stand on the highest level, not next to the rails below. We stayed in HK five days hoping to get a clear shot from the top, but it was cloudy/hazy most of each day. If you are quite lucky and the gods are willing, the views of city night lights are astounding from the top. Traveling from HK to Shanghai our next stop: There is an easy way; just take a plane from HK airport to Shanghai. It is expensive because this is priced as an international flight. Or if it is not raining and you have the time, you can spend 3 hours riding three different buses from HK to Shenzen where we caught a plane to Shanghai. We saw some amazing views during the 3 bus rides to the Shenzen airport; the roads circle HK about ten times it seems, and the views are stunning much of the time. HK is one of the largest ports we have seen anywhere in the world. The bus switches from the left hand side of the road to the right when you leave HK and enter China, so you change buses after you clear customs at the border. Yup, HK is a separate country from mainland China, whose citizens must get a very restricted visa for a max of 7 days to visit HK. Star Ferry ride from HK Island to Kowloon: We loved this short trip; take a hooded rain jacket as it can be quite windy and cool on the open ferry in the water even on a typical hot, muggy HK day. Before the outstanding Metro arrived, everyone took the Star Ferry, and it did seem like a visit to ancient times. The Metro: We loved riding the Metro because it is so beautifully built, and we don\u2019t have one at home. Take the JW elevator downstairs to the lovely mall below the hotel, and you will see signs to the Metro. It reminded us of the wonderful subway systems in Seoul and Tokyo. Rambling through Kowloon: Do allow at least a half day to take the escalator up the main hill in Kowloon. There are wonderful galleries and lots of restaurants for relaxing. You will have to stumble down the steep hill or get a taxi back, but sights are hard to beat. Be prepared to see more of humanity than you may desire. Most of HK history was violent, and historic structures have been replaced with neck breaking skyscrapers on most blocks. In closing: A fall or spring visit to HK can be a real treat with a stay at the JW. Take your workout clothes and swimsuit as well as sturdy hiking shoes and be prepared for a very physical trip. HK is not the place for folks who cannot walk uphill or do lots of stairs. We really looked forward to returning to the safe, comfortable cocoon at the JW after a day of rambling around HK. This hotel provided a fantastic base for the first part of our China vacation.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201c5 STAR ALL THE WAY!\u201d", "Author": "Yvonne M", "ReviewID": "UR63603375", "Content": "I usually have pics to post with all of my reviews however photos could not describe this amazing experience at the JW Marriott.

On check-in we were told that they had a special offer running that would get us a newly renovated room with \"spectacular views of the harbour\" for just HK$300. We quite liked the idea and signed up for the same. Imagine our dismay when we realised that the hotel itself is not really \"on\" the harbour front. The view that our room offered was of a cluster of high-rises with the sea visible through the spaces between them. To add injury to the insult, we found that they had charged us HK$900 for the \"view\" and not HK$300 as promised. On enquiry they said that it was their per-night rate and not a gross figure. We should have read the fine print it seems. THE POTTY RUNNETH OVER As disgusting as that might sound, it is the most accurate description of the first morning we woke up at JW Marriott Hong Kong. Took a dump, tried to flush and ... well ... let's just say the waters just kept rising. After a messy ten minutes of trying to avoid a calamity, we called the maintenance guys who fixed it. Said that the cistern handle was broken and that the commode was choked as well. We have never experienced or heard of something like this happening in any five star luxury hotel in the world. ENGLISH ANYONE We understand that despite being a cosmopolitan city the general population of Hong Kong isn't too comfortable with English. That's quite acceptable when it comes to taxi drivers, shopkeepers and the average joe on the street. But when you are being served at the coffee shop of an international hotel brand like JW Marriott, it is simply unacceptable. Three out of five servers either couldn't comprehend or couldn't respond to simple requests like \"could you get us some cold water?\" or \"is this vegetarian?\" We finally had to wait for the Captain (the head steward) to serve us. However, even that was an ordeal in its own. Read on. CULINARY NIGHTMARE So we order a pizza at the coffee shop. When it arrives we see that it's not baked properly (the underside was still doughy!!) After spending a good two minutes in making the Captain understand what was wrong with the pizza, it's taken away. It is brought back overdone, almost charred. We decide not to push our luck and to try and have it. It tastes bad and we ask for some dried oregano. The Captain is stumped. \"What is that?\" he says. We finally write it down for him on a piece of paper. He leaves and comes back after five minutes and says that they don't have it. We ask for some Dry Chilli Flakes. He brings us red chilli paste. We ask for Tabasco. He gives us a blank look. We raise a white flag and surrender to the now cold pizza.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, good location, worth its value\u201d", "Author": "qtcupid", "ReviewID": "UR40606404", "Content": "i stayed in this hotel with a few friends during my stay here. we shared a room for two nights with two double beds. we loved the room, comfy beds, big bathroom, full amenities, large windows with amazing view, large tv. the room is kinda small for 4 ppl, but given that it is Hong Kong and every square footage is precious, we have no complains. the bathroom is luxurious with tub and shower stall, you can also listen to the tv from the bathroom. it is also located conveniently near a large shopping mall and access to the MTR. great for shopping and meeting up with friends. i heard the high afternoon tea at this hotel is popular and excellent, but didn't have time to try it out. i will definitely recommend it to others, and will stay again next time.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Coast", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel - worth every penny !!\u201d", "Author": "RLAK", "ReviewID": "UR40246434", "Content": "I recently stayed here with my friends and there was nothing we could fault.

As a lot people have pointed out, it\u2019s pricy, and for the price, the amenities and service are just not up to scratch. For a basic room that lists at upwards of 400USD/night, I think that I could expect to find a bathroom devoid of traces of the previous occupant\u2019s toothpaste in the sink or his use of the toilet. (Apologies to the faint of heart, but I am referring to urine stains, floating scraps of toilet paper and pubes.) The gar\u00e7on d\u2019\u00e9tage who brought my welcome tea was back in a flash with a bucket, sponges and brushes, but still I shouldn\u2019t have had to ask. So my stay got off to a bad start and things haven\u2019t improved much. (I checked in yesterday, and am still here.) The welcome tea was a nice touch, but the fruit plate served with it, and since replenished (an under-ripe banana, one mealy apple and two dry oranges) was completely uninspired. Wouldn\u2019t a couple of lychees, a slice of dragon fruit, or even a mandarin orange (for example) been more in keeping with the alleged calibre of the hotel and the destination? After a long trip, I don\u2019t think that a little bottle of shampoo for my shower would be asking for too much. Some shower gel would have been nice. Instead I found two bars of soap, two shower caps and a sewing kit. And a rather handsome canister of bath salts. So I can soak my weary muscles, just not wash my hair. Amazingly, when the room was made up today, again no shampoo, gel or conditioner was provided and I had to call for some to be brought. While I\u2019m on the subject of the room, I was told that I was \u201dupgraded\u201d to a recently renovated one. The mustard upholstery is pure 70s. No, not Asian gold. Mustard. The renovated room is entered with a metal key (no key chain). The wooden furnishings are scratched and scuffed. The light control by the bed looks like old Otis elevator buttons and if you use the do not disturb button, it will provide a red, bedside night light, right at eye level. You cannot turn on the room lights from the door (which means that you cannot turn off everything as you leave either). There is no socket to plug in the electric kettle that sits on the mini bar. Making a cup of tea means carrying the kettle over to the desk. (By the way, having paid extortionate mini-bar prices the world over, I find 88HKD (over 11USD) for a litre of ordinary water excessive. And the two complimentary bottles of water that should have been in place when I arrived were not there. I only learned that they should have been when I found them there today. The four (why four?) \"At Your Service\" buttons on my phone failed to work, and voicemail button connected to the operator, then stopped working altogether. I had to call from the house phone to get it fixed. The safe malfunctioned just as I was leaving for dinner (and needed my wallet). The bed was made with loads of pillows. I made my choice and left the unused pillows on the armchair. When I came back this afternoon, there they were, sitting on the armchair. Couldn't they have been put in the closet at least? I haven\u2019t seen any of the other rooms but at very least the moral of this story is don\u2019t take Room 814 if you\u2019re stuck here. I was greeted warmly and my bags were efficiently whisked away before I had both feet out of the cab and from there I was escorted to reception. But then I had to wander all the way back to the front door after checking in to locate my bags and someone to take them (and me, as at reception no indication had been given as to what direction I might set off in) to the room. On my way there, I dodged a couple of room service platters that had been put out after dinner. Fair enough. But the fact that the same dirty dishes were still sitting in the hallway two hours later is more evidence of lack of attention to detail. I tried out the gym today. Decent equipment, but all pushed into a cramped, windowless space. There are a jacuzzi, steam and sauna room (though again lack of detail means no hose or shower in the steam room). Overall, I found the hotel\u2019s public spaces cavernous and a little soulless. But I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll stay and I\u2019ll survive. But I won't do it again.

The JW Marriott at Pacific Place, Admiralty district, is by far the most elegant. It is correspondingly expensive. It is best suited for the well-heeled buiness traveler, and its proximity to many of the financial service and banking institutions in Hong Kong make it ideal for this type of customer. Staff are extraordinarily attentive, and a wide variety of top-notch cuisine is available in eight on-site restaurants. I suggest the Fish Bar for a casual, open-air dining experience near the pool, and check out the seafood buffet at lunch in the Cafe. The adjacent Pacific Place shopping center also has many nice dining and drinking options in addition to its luxury-brand shops. Lovely Hong Kong Park is a five-minute walk, and the Admiralty MTR station at Pacific Place gives you easy access to most of the rest of the city. The one downside I would point out is noise. The massive lobby is spacious, airy, and has magnificent viewing day or night, but it is open to several floors, including Q88 wine bar, the Lounge, and the Cafe. Thus, it is usually very noisy in these places. You'll have to go elsewhere for a quiet discussion or intimate meal.

Some residents seemed never to leave and to almost hold court in the lounge which was intimidating. Breakfast spread in the lounge was ok, afternoon tea was provided in the lounge (which we didn't take up), hors d'oeuvres also and cocktails as well as night time chocolates. Must mention though that this was the first executive floor we'd stayed on where we did not have the option to have breakfast in the main dining room or the lounge. Would have liked to have had the option. Lounge staff in the food area could be brusque but other lounge staff were wonderful. Swimming pool was overlooked by the \"Fish Bar\" restaurant which meant that swimming and sunbathing area was not private. This was most obvious when a wedding reception was held in the Fish bar with some of the wedding guests animatedly watching the sunbathing hotel guests. Some of the hotel facilities, sauna etc were closed for the renovations, which when coupled with the noise, means that this hotel does not merit a 5* rating at this time. Location is excellent, proximity to MTR etc very convenient. was our room worth an extra $800 HKD a night?

As far as I\u2019m concerned, there really are no other hotels in Hong Kong. Over the years, due to meetings, etc., I\u2019ve stayed at the Renaissance Kowloon, the Regal Kai Tak, the Regal Chek Lap Kok, the Island Shang, the Kowloon Shang, and the Renaissance Convention. When Mrs. Gardiner and I lived in China, we were here at least one weekend a month for two years. Without question, then, I consider this property my home in Asia. All that said, I walk in here after a two year absence, knowing that I\u2019m not known, and that their records and tribal memory are erased. Check in at the front desk was fast. Because my flight was late, the Exec Lounge was closed. Because I knew I had to catch some emails and at least one phone call, I asked if/where I could get a glass of wine\u2026 \u201clounge is closed, bar is closed\u201d was the initial answer. Fortunately, a Front Desk Manager (Joshua) walked up and solved the issue\u2026 \u201cMr. Gardiner, I\u2019m sorry you arrived too late for the Exec Lounge\u2026 please have a wine out of your mini-bar, and I\u2019ll have it comped.\u201d Excellent response! Rooms have, frankly, not changed in the 15 years I\u2019ve been through here\u2026 change in furniture colour, but that\u2019s about it. Beds are Marriott Revive now (ditch the big, hard, square pillows, please?) and very comfy. Toiletries are a house brand, linens are very nice. Good size desk, with power and 100mb internet access at hand. TV is a (compared to everyone else!) smallish tube style. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll fix this on the next reno. These are not the largest rooms in Hong Kong, and every room is a \u201ccorner\u201d with varying degrees of view. What with the smog these days here, a Mountain View Room is cheaper and fully sufficient. If you\u2019re in HKG for a view, either pay up for the Island Shang or the Intercon in TST, or plan to be here a day after a Typhoon scrubs the air. Location is excellent, though\u2026 the hotel (like the Island Shang and the Conrad) sits atop Pacific Place, probably one of the most high end malls in the region. Elevator to the ground floor and you\u2019re 200m to the MTR station. Excellent taxi rank on the Pacific Place traffic circle. Bus and Tram services are easily grabbed from the bridge between Pacific Place and Queensway Plaza. Hong Kong Park (and the Peak Tram) is behind the Shang (short walk) and all of Central is one MTR stop away, on one of the better subway systems in the world. My meetings went well, and I returned to the JW in the late afternoon. The Exec Floor munchies were as lavish as I remember them. No less than 3 hot dishes, and a huge variety of veggies, chips, nuts, popcorn, etc. This switches over to desert stuff after 8:00p or so. Breakfast is an impressive spread as well. I was especially pleased to see kids allowed. They were all well-behaved, but many hotels no longer allow their younger guests (even though they are included in room rates) to visit the lounge. Good job! The staff in the lounge includes several Filipina\u2019s who\u2019ve been with the JW for years\u2026 they really make the place feel like home. I had my dinner at Fish Bar, a restaurant wedged into the pool courtyard on 7. Service was very good, and the \u201cbucket of shrimp\u201d I had was certainly a gracious helping, Staff very helpful, and the windows and heaters kept the area comfortable. Food here is reliably good. I asked to have a pair of slacks and a shirt pressed overnight, and they were picked up at 10:00p, and, as promised, returned at 5:30a so I could head to the airport. I ordered room service coffee for 5:00am, and it was delivered promptly. (Although the celadon pot they used was stylish, it didn\u2019t do jack for keeping the coffee warm.) Thankfully, the lounge coffee machine opened at 6a. Complaints? None, really\u2026 one very minor one: at check in, they ask what newspapers you\u2019d like. I checked off the SCMP, WSJ and the FT. My first morning I got USA Today! Second morning, I got nothing\u2026 This is a really small issue, but certainly irritating for a hotel charging HKD3500 a night. Mrs. Gardiner and I, with Kiddo, will be back in March, and we\u2019ll certainly bunk here\u2026 no question. My ultimate valuation is whether I will spend my own money to stay in a hotel\u2026 and the answer here is YES\u2026 I\u2019ve done so before, and will do so again in March.

The food and the drinks in the lounge were good, the service good, and the location, over the Pacific Place, outstanding.

As others have mentioned, the location is great. It's above an upscale shopping mall, Pacific Place, and the Admiralty MTR (subway) station. Access to the MTR without even having to go outside was a real advantage. The shops in the MTR such as Pret a Manager, 7-11, and Starbucks were very nice to be near as well. There were also banks with ATMs in the MTR. It was beyond convenient. The other reviews mention that the rooms are on the small side, but most are in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated area's on the planet. We had 2 adults and 2 children in one room for a week and it was slightly tight. What saved us was that we were on an \"Excutive\" floor. That gave us access to a large 2 story lounge on the the 35th & 36th floors overlooking the harbor. Every morning there was a free hot cooked breakfast buffet with chinese and english foods to choose from. In the afternoon they put out wine and very good snacks, and after dinner ,coffee, sweets and after dinner drinks. Sodas and waters were available at all times as were 2 internet ready computers, play station video game with assorted games, board games and a range of newspapers and magazines. I highly recommend getting a room on an excutive floor. Our room had huge windows with drapes that closed with the press of a button by the bed. The beds were firm but comfortable and the tv was fine. There were 110v outlets so no need to bring a power converter from the US. The pool was lovely and warmly heated when I was there and the jacuzzi was hot and very clean and nice. The robes and slippers they give you were perfect to wear down to the pool The gym was very clean and well equiped as well. I would not recommed the chinese cuisine restaurant in the hotel. Very expensive and nothing special. The harbor view is not worth paying for either. There are plenty of harbor views from the lobby. The only complaint I could make is that the concierge gave incorrect information. For example they told us the Giant Budda on Lantau Island would take 1 hour to get to and it took 2 hours. The directions they gave to the peak tram were terrible. And there are people wandering in the lobby who pretend to be concierge but are really selling time shares so beware.

Easy nearby bus access to Stanley Markets (outside Pacific Place Mall, next to Marriot) and Ocean Park (outside MTR, follow the signs). One train stop to Nathan Rd; one train stop the other way and a short walk to the Peak etc etc. Tip: The MTR has it's own shops - a bakery, very small 7-11, a Starbucks at the end, good for snacks, even a light breakfast. You can buy an Octopus card from the Customer Service desk. Caught a cab to the Harbour (Star Ferry) - this only cost $6AUS one way. The area: Quiet, we had mountain views and overlooked the pool, with a very quiet street in front, wouldn't of seen much of the harbour even if we had been on the other side due to the pollution. Our room was an oasis of cool and peace in the bustling heat of Hong Kong in Sept. Very good nights sleeps. The room: typical five star, electric drapes and lights, excellent housekeeping, the lady cleaning our rooms was a hit with our kids leaving extra fruit and mints. Great customer service everyhwhere. The restaurants: Excellent breakfast buffet including customised smoothies; lovely Fish Restaurant looking out over the pool. Also great restaurants on LG level in Pacific Place shopping centre. We loved Thai Basil (ate their 3 times), not cheap but not ultra expensive. The Pool: very clean, kids loved it. Nice cocktails.

The hotel is centrally located in Pacific Place in Admiralty and a mere 5 minute taxi ride from the Airport Express station. The hotel occupies one of the 3 towers at the Pacific Place, the other 2 being Shangrila Hotel and Conrad. I like the lobby of the hotel which spills into a lounge area which has huge floor to ceiling windows that offer you a good view of the traffic below and the waterfront. As the celing is very high, it looks as if you are in a giant fish tank looking out. You have a view because the whole complex is set on an elevation. The hotel lobby is connected by elevator to the upmarket shopping mall below so this would be a good place to stay during the winter or summer sale period so you can conveniently dump your shopping bags in your room or have them sent to concierge. We were given a harbour view room on the topmost floor (room 3504). I used my Marriott Rewards points for free accommodation but paid extra for an upgrade to the harbour view room. I should not have bothered because with the smog enveloping Hong Kong these days, you hardly get a view. You can just see the lights of Kowloon across the harbour but the smog rendered the mountains behind Kowloon invisible even during the day. The glass panes of the window are set at an angle and protrude like a bay window for you to enjoy the harbour view. However, from the window you can look directly into the rooms of your neighbours to the left and to the right. So if privacy is what you seek, you have to draw the curtains. As you enter the room, you go through a narrow passageway which leads to the suite itself. On the left of the passageway is the built in closet and the mini bar and on the right, the opening to a standard sized (ie. small) bathroom. The suite itself is also small and I would not say that the d\u00e9cor is anything to shout about. There is a comfortable king sized bed with a mirror behind the headboard (I suppose an attempt to give the illusion that the room is bigger). There is no plasma TV but a conventional set in a TV cabinet which comes with a set of drawers. This is placed opposite the bed. Next to it is a desk with electrical outlets for both 240 and 110 V, as well as internet connection. There is a single seater sofa with an ottoman and a coffee table next to the desk. All these furniture add to the cramped feel of the room. Perhaps I am used to bigger hotel rooms and am therefore am a bit spoilt. I think that the rooms are also probably beginning to show its age. There are a number of restaurants/bars in the hotels but I did not have time to patronise them. I did use the pool located on the 5th floor which closes at 11 pm everyday. The pool is supposed to be heated but it was definitely not warm enough the evening I tried it. There is however a hot jacuzzi next to the pool where you can submerge and treat yourself to a hydro massage and admire the tall towers all around you. Despite my comments above, my experience staying here was good. Service here is very efficient and invariably accompanied by a warm smile. Upon check in, they promptly sent a pot of Chinese tea to the room.
