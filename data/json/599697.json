We were on the second floor, right on the plaza, which we thought was going to be too loud. However, the windows are double glazed, so the noise is quite minimal, and if you do as the Spanish do, it won't matter anyway - because you will be out late. They pack the tables and chairs in the plaza up around 1-2am - so its not busy all night. The rooms were big enough and very clean. The bathroom was modern and fresh towels were provided daily.

Our room was tiny, but the great view at Plaza Santa Ana with its magic life opens from the small balcony. Hotel location is really fantastic. It\u2019s walking distance to everything in the city. The Prado and Thyssen-Bornemisza museums are about 10 mins walk, literature lovers will enjoy Cervantes monument (there are 2 in the city :) and Lope De Vega museum located in few steps from the hotel. Hotel staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Thank you very much to Ammar at the Reception, who provided us with good maps and knowledgeable recommendations for sights, flamenco and other interesting facts about Madrid. Free Wi-Fi at our room was very fast. The air conditioning worked well. Good soundproofed windows perfectly block the huge street noise, but at the same time bathroom walls are thin, and you can hear water runs and other noise from neighboring rooms. Also it can be much noisy on weekend night, when a lot of guests back to the hotel at the early morning. Room safe-box is chargeable, you need drop down a cont in 1 euro every time when you want to close the safe. The main negative impression we had from our stay were carpet moths in our room :( Continental breakfast included in the room rate is 100% continental, but it was ok (a glass of fresh orange juice, coffee with hot milk and one pastry of your choice). And it\u2019s not a problem to eat in the city, there is plenty of bars and restaurants around. For a short stay, the hotel is ok.

We saw the reviews on Trip Advisor and decided to give it a try. Wow! Serendipity! There were prompt responses and friendly emails to and fro when we were making our initial enquiries. The greeting from 'Mercedes' on the reception was both charming and informative and we were delighted to learn that we had been allocated a room directly overlooking the Placa Santa Ana. When the shutters and double glazed windows were open we were able to enjoy and soak in the atmosphere of this lively square but once they were closed there was no disturbance at all either during our afternoon siesta or at night. We opted for the accommodation without breakfast because we know there are many options in the area but did wander in to the adjoining Miau cafe on the first morning to see what they had to offer. With no pre-amble the waitress told us to \"Sit!\", so we did - and waited for her to take our modest order of a croissant and coffee each. Two large glasses of orange juice arrived. Even though we declined them she left them on the table. We told her we were staying at the hotel but we weren't on the breakfast option and asked if we could have \"Dos croissantes y dos caffe con leche, por favor -\" adding \" two coffees and two croissants please\". She didn't acknowledge our order at all. A cup of TEA and ONE croissant arrived. We got up and left - as I thought the next plateful to arrive might be bacon and eggs for my strictly vegetarian friend!. We were surprised to see some positive reviews of the breakfast/cafe on Trip Advisor when we returned because it seemed to us that the woman had neither a good command of Spanish NOR of English and was programmed to dish up whatever the 'breakfast' was supposed to be for any likely looking hotel guests. Apart from the Cafe, our stay at the Miau was delightful. ALL the receptionists were friendly, helpful and professional in every way. The room and bathroom were perfectly adequate in every way and the maid was unobtrusive but attentive. For example, we arrived in the early evening and hadn't wanted to go hunting for extra pillows. When the room was \"done\" the next day, the blanket in the wardrobe which we had used to raise our pillows had been replaced by two additional pillows. The Hotel Miau is ideally situated for the metro, art galleries, flamenco and some excellent shops. It is not a luxury hotel but it was spotlessly clean, quite well appointed and excellent value. We will certainly be back to the Hotel Miau and my only reluctance to writing a Trip Advisor review is that too many other people will discover it and we won't be able to get a room when we want to return.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Paz, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cSix weeks in Europe and this was by far the Best for the Price!\u201d", "Author": "nblapaz", "ReviewID": "UR118432649", "Content": "Traveling with my 82 year old mother and 65 year old friend.

To our surprise we came across the Hotel Miau for a 5 night stay in Madrid. We were given a corner room that overlooked the Santa Ana Square with the lively atmosphere that comes alive at night and makes you just love Madrid. There are three large window with small balcony. The sound reduction is perfect as the windows have double pane with shutters and then an inner enclosed cutting off all sound. The beds were not the most comfortable but what could be expected for the price range. The room was huge and gave us a lot of room to spread out. The bathroom too was large. We did not come to Europe to stay in our room but this one made us enjoy our location. The hotel is clean and service is excellent. English is spoken and everyone is willing to help you get to know and love Madrid, which we did. There is a lift to all rooms but only two can go up at a time which was a little problem for three of us. Maid service was great and kept the room clean and tidy. We did experience a problem with the toilet not wanting to fill and told the front desk. It was late so they brought up a bucket to put water in it. I would of thought they would have a look to see if they could get it to work. Well, my ex was a plumber so I looked at it and was able to get it working but they still had someone the next morning come. There is a restaurant next door that gives discounts to the hotel clients.

Afraid of the often mentioned noise issue, I asked for a room not facing the street. Unfortunately, they did not have one available (only few do not face the street) but assured me that the nights of my stay (Monday and Tuesday) meant noise would be minimum. Perhaps it's true not many party Monday night, but many due cue up to enter the paring garage under the square just below the hotel windows in the morning, and a large percentage of them enjoy honking the cars' horns. Noisy! Very noisy! The room was small, recently refurbished (marble in bathroom, new fixtures), but the carpets were stained, the windows feeble wooden frame rooting away (which undoubtedly made the noise issue worse). Smell is also a problem in the rooms - it seems that ventilation shafts are shared to an extent that I could smell the moment my business colleague put on his after-shave in the morning. I could also hear him come in at night, plus anyone in the hallway, as the walls are paper thin. Breakfast is taken in the adjoining restaurant (entrance around the corner): a choice between three kinds of pastry with a hot drink and a glass of orange juice. Fine for me, but some complain.

We arrived late, tired but looking forward to a nice few days in Madrid. We'd seen the pictures on their webpage, and read the information. So we were in for a nasty surprise. The room was small, the carpet dirty and stained, the coverlet over the bed was dirty. And the noise was absolutely horrible. DO NOT believe the hotels' claim on it's webpage that the rooms are soundproofed. Ours was not. There was standard, single plate glass in the french windows and thin wooden panels to shut out intense traffic, drunks singing and arguing, police cars with their sirens on. The location is faboulous, but you will do a lot better in living in any hotel 100 or more meters away from Plaza St. Ana. That way you can enjoy whatever goes on as long as you like, and you can leave the party and people honking their carhorns when you wish. And there were no clotheshangers.
