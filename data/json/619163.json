We finally got a room and went up in the elevator that I was afraid to breathe and I thought it can't get worse, but it did : the room was so small that our luggage didn't even fit in. It had no window and reminded a bit of jail. It smelled awful, everything was dirty, the tv wasn't working, the A/C wasn't working, the bathroom was a hole in the wall with a toilet seat that was moldy. After looking at the room, we left instantly, there is no way anyone should have to sleep in a room like that! The manager was the rudest person I have ever seen.

Did not argue as very very exhausted on entering the room the it was small pokey, there was dust and dirt in the corners of the room. The rooms did not look like they had been properly vacuumed in 6 months. The window did not open to allow fresh air as it a hotel that allows smoking. Even the reception area was very very smelly. We stayed one night only as we could not get a reimbursement for the night. When I complained about the smell, it was ignored. The included breakfast was in a downstairs room called the basement. The breakfast on offer was what looked like to be chicken nuggets cereal and toast. the breakfast area also smelt bad. After this overnight stay stay in the morning, I quickly packed and my son was violently ill. Vomiting all over the place. On leaving I told the reception staff that their hotel was the worst I had ever stayed in and I work in remote Northern Territory Aboriginal communities and have seen very rough accommodation.

The air conditioning was good........the beds were ok The breakfast was very very limited........ there was jam bread,, juice, bled egg and some new Indian dish every morning (we stayed 3 nights there) There was also only 1 type of juice all days.....not very exciting !!!

Locked fire exit and faulty fire alarm system. The location was ok and the room was so feril that it did motivate us to stay out and about longer! I would stay cheap backpackers rather than here again. The staff were nice enough and the mustufa shopping centre across the road is excellent. 5 minute brisk walk to the metro.", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "BKK", "Title": "\u201cVery bad Hotel ever in my life time...\u201d", "Author": "budgetT", "ReviewID": "UR6929201", "Content": "I booked this hotel with accomline.com website and got very disappoint with this hotel ... 1. smell bad all the way from Lobby to your room...Don't look over this point smell bad can ruined your trip believe me 2.

Due to the peak holiday season, we couldn't find a room in a new hotel fast enough and ended up suffering 4 days. Firstly, let's start with the location - Syed Alwi Road in Singpore - this is THE busiest street in Little India due to Mustafa Centre. Its absolutely crowded and there's no space to walk anywhere - neither pavements nor the road. And its dirty. So, if you are in Singapore for a vacation, give any hotels on this road a wide berth. The Aspinals is right opposite Mustafa Centre entrance. And if you stay here, you'll never EVER realize you were in Singapore... 98% of people you see are Indians, Bangladeshis, Srilankans et. all. The Hotel itself has a nice wooden Swiss style lobby. But that about ends there. You are greeted by moustached Indian Punjabi ladies whose english communication skills are limited to \"You have to pay XX Dollars\" and \"Your Room No. is XX\". Any other query is met with blank stares...maybe zombies are cheap to hire or something. We paid S$89 for the Double Room, including taxes and breakfast (tea, bad juice, bread, butter, jam ONLY). But when we saw the room, I ran on down and asked them again if I'd gotten a Single Room or something. The Rooms are really pigeon coops - the size that we saw in Star Cruise Virgo - I would estimate the rooms are just 3x3.5 or less. The bathroom is double the size of an Airline Toilet - yes, it really is that small. Sort of extends your Economy class flying experience to your Hotel. There are NO TAPS in the bathroom, only a wall mounted shower and there is NO WATER MIXER. What that means is that you get Scalding Hot water one second and Cold water the next. It takes fine tweaking of the 2 controls just to set the temperature right everytime. And since the bathroom is so small, my wife accidentally knocked the shower tap while walking in and got scalded with hot water. She was going into the Bath to put on lipstick because besides the 8\" inch mirror there, there is NO MIRROR in the room. So, if your wife/girlfriend was planning on going out looking decent, combing their hair etc. then tough luck - there is only one mirror in the Bath. The Bath itself is about 1m x 0.8m size and that includes the WC, Bathing area and Washbasin. There is one small (really small) cupboard and one study table in the room. That leaves no space to keep your luggage because it sure as hell does not fit in the tiny cupboard. Traversing the room itself is interesting because 2 people cannot walk around at the same time. There is space for ONLY ONE one normal sized person to walk around at one point of time. Housekeeping was daily and we didn't believe it until we were there on 2 days to experience the housekeeping routine. It takes less than 5 minutes for housekeeping to cleanup and after that you really don't notice that they did do the job. If we hadn'twitnessed the event, we wouldn't believe anyone did housekeeping at all. The TV was included but I wonder why since there was no cable - just a few local channels in the local language. The hotel is located in Little India but the management expects tourists to understand the local Singaporean language, hence no English channels. Breakfast was a joke and we didn't expect it otherwise. There was some bad quality orange juice, tea, jam, bread, butter and cornflakes. No, there was no other cereal - just cornflakes. We tried the breakfast the first day, then didn't bother after that. Anyway, we tried but couldn't find alternate accomodation due to peak season. When we finally did, we ran out smiling. And the happy ending - the hotel we finally got CLASSIQUE HOTEL was a pleasure and a great find. Its on the edge of Little India and just about 500 meters from Aspinals Hotel. And it costs just S$70.
