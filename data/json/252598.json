There was quite a big traffic in the street inf front of the hotel, but it was really quiet and confortable. The front desk service was really good, the room was really clean and confortable. Far from typical inconvenient rustic hotel in Mexico. We took taxi to visit many touristic sites in Mexico city. It is really recommendable hotel.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGood price - convenient only to metro\u201d", "Author": "NCtravelz", "ReviewID": "UR104157393", "Content": "I didn't research this one as well as I should have. I thought it would be near downtown Coyoacan and the Saturday Market and it wasn't. The hotel is near a highway and you can't walk anywhere. There's really nothing to do in the area without taking a train or cab. It was conveniently located to a metro stop which makes it very easy to take the train to the Zocalo for the day. The hotel itself was fine. There's a mediocre restaurant in the lobby. We were upgraded to a room with a jacuzzi which was very nice after a long day of sightseeing. The only problem was the young football team staying at the hotel who ran up and down the halls all night and then started banging on doors at the crack of dawn. I would stay here again ONLY if the price was much better than the other Holiday Inns in DF. It seems like this location is only good for tour groups with buses.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful inside, terrible outside\u201d", "Author": "LindaAt", "ReviewID": "UR67408953", "Content": "When I booked this reservation, the hotel was named \"Holiday Inn Coyoacan.\" As we wanted to explore the recommended towns of Coyoacan and neighboring San Angel, we reserved a room for 2 nights. We were so disappointed when our taxi pulled up to the hotel and it was right on the main highway, in a dicey neighborhood. While the hotel is very nice and clean, cozey, and service is excellent, we will not stay here again. If you are a tourist and want to explore the plazas and quaint restaurants in nearby Coyoacan and San Angel (which are about a 10 minute taxi drive), then this hotel is not for you. If you are a businessman/woman, this might be perfect. Also, we took the hotel \"taxi\" (a van) into San Angel and it cost $14.00. When we returned, we took a local taxi, and it cost $4.50. DON'T USE THE HOTEL'S \"TAXI\" IF YOU CAN HELP IT!!

Travel with an infant is tough and when we arrived from San Francisco CA (where we are from) to Mexico D.F. it was so busy with the traffic it was so nice to arrive and be greeted at the hotel, assisted immediately with our luggage and check-in was very helpful they even had the baby cot ready in our room. Everything from the bell boy to room service was well above our expectations (and we are picky as travel often). The room was exceptionally clean and the housekeeping staff did a good job to keep up with the mess our little one makes each day! We felt very safe there and happy to come back after a day of sightseeing. By the way, if you have not been to Mexico City- GO! It is a wonderful, unique, beautiful place. People are so helpful and this hotel is near Coyoacan which is a good district that is not too much in the busy hub of the city- you can visit Frieda and Diego's house and hang around the nice cafes or stroll in the town square. The hotel has room service and I would add that the food blew me away. I loved having some nice caldo soup, guacamole and a beer at the end of a long day. I felt it was not just a 'holiday inn' like you imagine plain a somewhat boring. It was great.
