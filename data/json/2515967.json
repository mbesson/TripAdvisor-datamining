The concierge was also extremely knowledgable and it was no trouble for her to find out additional information for our more unusual requests. In-room dining and housekeeping also provided excellent service. If you're in San Francisco for more than a day or two I'd recommend the muni multi-day pass which come in 3 or 7 day passes which give you unlimited rides on the cable cars (otherwise v pricey) as well as the v cool but slow f line and the underground. Our favourite days were spent cycling over the GG Bridge (do it) and taking the muni underground to ocean beach, walking in the sea and getting lost in golden gate park across the road.

I stayed at the Ritz Carlton for the first few days -- I'd stayed there over a dozen times in past years so looked forward to returning. For reasons I mentioned in my not-so-flattering review of the latter, I moved to the Four Seasons and found it to be the predictable respite it has always been: high quality contemporary design, the finest materials and a discreet staff (for contrast, I criticized the Ritz Carlton staff for their \"happy talk\" intrusions to the point where they will interrupt your conversations with colleague to insert some vapid, memorized blather). At the Four Seasons, the staff act like adults who are there to make your stay comfortable and efficient. They are there when you need them and keep out of your way when you don't. The public spaces are very comfortable with excellent seating areas where you can have private conversations with friends and colleagues. One complaint -- the bar/light dining area adjacent toe the restaurant was very noisy, the music so loud we had to move back to the lobby for conversation. The rooms a very comfortable, the bathrooms large and well equipped -- but the room are the one drawback. I've found the Four Seasons chain to be among the good ones offering thoughtful, elegant contemporary design. The rooms here seem very boring, dull, lacking in any design imagination. One negative annoyance, nothing grave but it does matter -- for $500 a night, I don't want to be charged for wireless. The Four Seasons (and the Ritz, for that matter) persist in the highly offensive habit of trying to hit you for $14.95 a day for wireless. The answer is \"no\" -- be sure to let the front desk know you have no intention of paying for wireless, and they'll understand. Also, the pettiness extended to the business cents,r that seemed to be metering my internet usage, printing, etc. Again, \"just say no.\" Otherwise, the Four Seasons persists in offering the best design, comfort and discreet service of any North American chain. And when in San Francisco, it's vastly better than the tired and confused Ritz Carlton or the Mandarin Oriental, the latter's San Francisco outpost being an exception to that chain's usually elegant hotels.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hollywood", "Title": "\u201cAlways Great!\u201d", "Author": "RussFilice", "ReviewID": "UR125465441", "Content": "Spent a wonderful weekend in San Francisco (2/24-2/26).

The spa and jacuzzi is located inside the Sports Club LA, so when it closed early at 1pm, we were basically out of luck to use the facilities. I'm guessing they could have staffed it differently or told guest that amenities would be lacking on Christmas. Forget about a nice hot jacuzzi! Our room had a view of the top of the Armani Exchange store on Grant and Geary Street and city lights. It was clean and comfortable. There's no coffee maker or press in the room, so you'll need to run downstairs to the Coffee Bean. I'm not sure if i'd stay here again, wasn't quite the Four Seasons I was expecting considering the critical amenities are shared with another company that has a different operating schedule.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cWow, what a city, what a hotel\u201d", "Author": "LexingtonRose", "ReviewID": "UR121996971", "Content": "My husband I stayed here for 4 nights to celebrate my 50th birthday.

Nevertheless, we did not want to pay even more than we were paying, so we declined. The room was nice. It was on a high floor facing away from Market street, which I suppose is quieter, but not completely quiet as you can still hear sirens, for example. We could also hear our neighbors through the connecting door. Luckily there were not many people on our floor and it was very quiet floor. We never saw any housekeeping staff at all. That is a nice feature. Many times we have stayed at hotels and the housekeeping staff is always in the hallways. The breakfast was at the hotel was pretty good. That is the only meal we ate there. The gym is a huge two story facility with about every piece of equipment you can imagine, but it is a local gym which services the hotel. So while it has everything you need, it also has a large clientele working out there. It's nice that it has a pool, but at the same time, I had to wait for a lane to open up.

We had to call housekeeping to have the room made up when we returned around 2:30 and it hadn't been done yet -- then they came by only 3 hours later to provide turndown, which we had to postpone. They also forgot to deliver the waters they offered - only remembering when we had to call a second time to get a replacement fan for the one that rattled (the second one rattled as well). They were super nice but sadly, like so many hotels these days, one can't help but feel they are probably overworked and understaffed. On the plus side, the rooms are very spacious, clean and comfortable and the bathroom was large with nice L'Occitane products. The location is good as well. Overall we had a completely nice stay and the price was very reasonable for a Four Seasons hotel, but perhaps that's because this hotel feels one star below other FS properties.

I was originally due in for only 1 night, but I live in New York City & due to the weather & Hurricane Irene, I had to extend for 2 nights & I was so comfortable during my stay! I was swiftly checked-in by Joel & was upgraded to a really lovely King Premier room, #916. The room was on the corner & had a cool little alcove with a desk & a long hallway leading into the room that really gave a nice sense of space! I loved it! The beds at the hotel are so perfect, I slept so well all 3 nights. The bathrooms are roomy & have cool marble floors, plenty of counter space, amazing deep-soaking tub & separate shower/WC & the typical robes, slippers & L'Occitane products found in all FS properties. My view was of SOMA & is my preferred view at the hotel. The other side fronts Market St, which is nice, but I love being able to see city, mountains & bay from this side of the hotel. The window cushions are also nice. Everything always smells good & everyone at the hotel is nice & efficient. I would like to especially mention Dennis at the Front Desk, who helped me in extending my stay & was able to keep me in 916 for the duration of my stay....he was so nice, incredibly efficient & made me feel at home! Thanks Dennis!! I would also like to mention Kathrin & Rowland from In-Room Dining...they are always polite & very accommodating with special food requests. Each morning I looked forward to the Juice of the day! they have amazing blends:) The hotel is also super quiet & incredibly calm. On each stay, my room has been so quiet & you can't hear anything! very well-insulated building, which is much appreciated in my opinion. The lobby & check-in are on the 5th floor, so you do have to take 2 elevators to get to your room, but this makes me feel very secure. The ground level is a really cool, modern & airy space, with very friendly doormen (always someone to greet me & hold the doors open...amazing job guys!!) & modern artwork, as well as the entrance for the Four Seasons Private Residences. Modern Art is everywhere. Housekeeping did an amazing job on servicing my room everyday! it was spotless each day & so nice to return home to. I really love this hotel. Aside from The St. Regis on 3rd St., it's the only Hotel in San Francisco that I will stay at!!

Overall a great value with the extra night free and some preferred partner benefits (breakfasts plus one lunch). Everyone was very nice and gracious. The doormen were particularly welcoming and helpful --snagging cabs and providing useful dining advice. The concierge staff were very nice and helpful with directions but didn't really come up with anything i hadn't already found on on open table or interested in getting reservations to places i couldn't. The room was clean and spacious, lovely bathroom (pristine deep soaking tub-- but no bath salts) and great shampoo products. The room darkening drapes actually overlapped (most hotels seem to have an annoying gap)- big plus. And the window seat was just delightful. Cozy spot to read and look down at the kaleidoscope of Market Street traffic. As manager noted in response to another reviewer, coffee makers & teapots were available on request (but if you don't think to ask... ). Unfortunately the turn down people don't seem used to the idea-- they'd take away dirty mugs but didn't replace them (promptly remedied with a call to housekeeping, but i'd already made the coffee when i noticed...) Oh, another nice thing that could be better-- lovely new TV but many channels not HD. And the written channel listing provided was out of date-- the channel guide on the tv itself was more extensive. And charging for wifi is probably a big profit center but tacky. Less expensive chains provide it gratis. Restaurant was also a bit uneven. The smoked salmon benedict was absolutely perfect. In fact the breakfasts were all lovely, foodwise, and generally timing wise. But one day service was less attentive --maybe it was one particular server who was inattentive--the day she was serving it took forever to get breakfast. We also were disappointed with lunch -- (same day, same server)--- we ordered the soup, asked if it was vegetarian, were assured that it was. and it came served topped with distinctly unvegetarian bacon! We sent it back (i hate being put in the position of having to send food back!) but we could overhear the cook being upset that he hadn't been told to omit it. Waitress seemed indifferent to the error. the rest of the lunch was adequate but not up to the list prices on the menu. it may have just been a bad day or the A team on vacation.

The Moscone is a block south, so it's a perfect location for conventions there. And MOMA is right there too. The entrances are slightly hidden, and coming back to the room is like a series of retreats into another world, with the first floor street lobby, then the fourth (I think) floor main lobby--beautiful--and then the deeply quiet and peaceful room. It's difficult to resist stopping in the bar for a drink--it's a beautiful room, with a good wines by the glass list and little pistachio green snacks that are delicious and addicting.

Was looking forward to staying with Four Seasons due to the glowing reviews / reputation and it being our first time with the hotel chain. Alas, when we checked into the room we found the room decor a bit tired and worse, there's this dubious patch on the carpet in front of the couch that's coloured, wet and sticky. Called the front desk to ask for a change of room - was put through to the front desk after 2 transfers, girl babbled something and before I caught what she said, hung up on me!!! When I called back again, was told they're \"fully committed\" so cannot offer a change of room but that they'd get housekeeping to come take a look. Didn't happen. When we went for dinner, on the way we popped by the front desk and asked again. This time, the guy said the same thing - they're fully committed, but offered us a change of room the 2nd day, supposedly one on a higher floor. However, \"the 2nd day\" has passed but we've not received anything from the hotel and by now, we've pretty much settled in and too lazy to repack. But still, the quiet is disconcerting. So yesterday we got housekeeping to get us a towel to cover up the gross patch so we won't step on that disgusting sticky substance (again!). They very nicely came and apologised etc. and said they'd have to do the cleaning with a machine and it'd take couple hours to dry. So we said fine, do it in the day time when we're out; When we came back today late afternoon, the room is all made up but the patch is still there! We had to call housekeeping again and this nice old man came with a bucket and spray and proceeded to try and remove it right there and then. Which is rather inconvenient for us but he was apologising all the way and really nice about it so that's not too bad. Finally he said they'd have to use a machine to get it cleaned properly and he'd make a note. Which is exactly what we were told yesterday and nothing got done! I know this is not a serious matter and most of the hotel guys were accomodating and pleasant (except the first girl who hung up on me!!!). However, this is nothing I'd expect from a hotel such as the Four Seasons. Not the dubious sticky patch on the carpet and certainly not the messy, inefficient, ineffective followup that hasn't appeared to have solved anything at all up to now. That being said, the bed's very comfy and the bathroom generously sized. And as we're celebrating our anniversary and hubby's birthday on this trip, they gave us complimentary sparkling wine and strawberries which were a very nice surprise (though not on the actual date, but that didn't matter).

My favorite hotel in the world in the Four Seasons Chinzanso in Tokyo, so almost any hotel is bound to suffer by comparison. Still, I hadn't expected all the problems with the hotel that is ranked in guidebooks as one of the two top hotels in San Francisco. The bed, amenities, bathroom, standard of cleanliness were all what one would expect from a Four Seasons hotel, which is why I gave it 4 stars. The room was very ordinary in terms of decor, the best features being a window seat and an alcove for the desk. But we learned after going to bed that we had \"paid\" for that extra space by being next to the service elevators, and the swooshing woke us at 5 a.m. The sound proofing was so bad in the alcove that we could hear a phone ring as if in our room and loud voices. The heat came in through the air-conditioning ducts at the ceiling level, so our faces were hot while our feet were cold. And we couldn't keep the heat at a constant temperature. And though we were on the top floor of the hotel, the residences were above us and we had noisy people overhead. Also the black-out curtains overlap nicely, but then the morning light comes in over the top of them. Watch out for Room 1716! The staff was incredibly friendly. Not just smiling \"Good mornings\" but a real attempt at a conversation. But the friendliness in the end didn't make up for all the glitches in service, ranging from a robe without a sash, a caller being told that my husband wasn't registered at the hotel despite assurances to me that he had been, a higher charge for local phone calls than listed in the room (I was given a credit when I complained). And then there were the odd charges in the restaurant. I ordered chicken soup my first night and was given a bowl that was more stew than soup for $12. My husband ordered it for lunch and it came in a flat soup dish with less in it. On our final day we were again given bowls of it, but mostly broth. We were unhappy, and then learned we had been charged only $6 per bowl. A server told me that I could order a half portion of oatmeal for breakfast, but if that's so, why isn't it on the menu? And way before we left, I asked to have our luggage collected at 11:45 but had to call twice more to get anyone to come.

You'll make a series of turns to get around the side of the hotel, then drive down a poorly marked alley to reach the valet area. You can either valet or park in an adjacent self-park garage. Once parked, registration was quick and easy. I was given a south-facing room on an upper floor, with a nice view towards AT&T park. The room itself was quite nice.

Every single staff member that I spoke with was helpful and personable. The food (both banquet food in the ballroom and room service food) was great, although certainly not inexpensive.

One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because I have read many reviews over the years about the unique level of service within Four Seasons properties. This trip provided an opportunity for us to become acquainted with the brand. Unfortunately, our first impression was not as favorable as I had hoped in regards to some service on our first night. We had arranged car service privately, and when our driver pulled up to the covered transportation area, we were not greeted or offered assistance with our bags. This was not a significant problem since my husband keeps straps to tether the bags in the top pocket (which helped to get them inside without a cart), but it was surprising. Thankfully, we were warmly greeted upstairs for check-in. We stayed in a Deluxe Room, which was clean with a comfortable bed, soft linens, spacious bathroom with separate shower, and a dedicated work area. I did not take pictures since the room was just as expected given the photos online and on their website. After getting ourselves settled in the room, we went downstairs to go out for dinner. We had read about the courtesy car service (another reason we had chosen the hotel since we had dropped off the rental car) and asked the doorman if we could get a ride to dinner. He said it would be a twenty-minute wait, which was no problem, so we had a seat on the bench. He was not familiar with our restaurant, Nopalito, and when I mentioned it was on Broderick, he seemed ambivalent about taking us, so I explained that it was within their 3-mile radius. When the driver returned and we got in the car, it was clear in the doorman\u2019s verbal and non-verbal communication to the driver that he seemed a bit put out at our destination. We were not sure why, so we just went ahead with our plans. Upon arrival at the restaurant, the driver gave us the phone number to call for a return trip back to the hotel and gave us two names to ask for when we called; he recommended we call 10 to 20 minutes before we were ready to go. Partly because of the doorman\u2019s behavior as we left, I made sure to tip the driver generously before we went into the restaurant. Near the end of our meal, my husband called the number he was given. He was told that it was a busy night for taxi drivers and the courtesy car was therefore busy. (Being busy was understandable, we knew this service is first-come, first-served; this is why we did not mind waiting.) My husband said the wait was fine since we were enjoying the night out, even when he was told the car would not be available for at least an hour. The Four Seasons staff member then responded by saying they could not guarantee they could pick us at all and said we should get a taxi. We got a taxi and the drive back to the hotel was considerably faster; it was less than ten minutes straight down Market via Fell and just over two miles, so I am not sure that the original driver was familiar with the route, which may be why it seemed out of the way to door man. In conversation with the taxi driver, he mentioned what a slow night it was. This was a surprise given what we had been told by the Four Seasons staff member. Given this detail, and the sense we had earlier that the staff member seemed out of sorts, things just were not adding up. As soon as we arrived to the Four Seasons I picked up a lobby phone and called down to ask the wait for the courtesy car - a surprising twenty to twenty-five minutes. At this point we felt lied to by the staff member. There was neither an hour plus wait for a car, nor was it a busy night for taxis. If they did not want to provide service, they just should have said so in the first place. I could not recall the name of the primary doorman my husband had been in communication with, so I immediately went to the front desk to ask to speak to a manager so that he/she would have an easier time figuring out who we interacted with that evening. The manager on duty that evening called me when he returned from his break. He listened to our experience; he apologized for the lack of assistance with our bags at the beginning of our stay. In regards to our experience that night, he explained that the courtesy car does not provide pick-up service. During a previous trip, we were at a different hotel with both drop-off and pick-up service, so I had assumed this was normal. (And when we visited another Four Seasons property in December, their service ran in both directions.) I can appreciate if the policy is different in San Francisco, however we were given the phone number to call for pick-up by their personnel and were never told that they do not provide this service. Instead of telling us the story about the taxis having a busy night and the exceptionally long wait, the truth (that the car does not provide pick-up service) would have been a welcome piece of information. Instead we left our stay feeling like we received service that was much lower than what we had expected in a Four Seasons property, and that we had been lied to by a staff member. I continue to be baffled as to why the doorman did not just come out and tell us the facts from the beginning or refuse to drive us, instead of the strange experience we encountered. On a positive note, the people working downstairs on our last day in the hotel were friendly and helpful. Our luggage was stored and we did receive assistance loading it when our car arrived for the airport. While the manager that night listened to our experience, I was not sure that he fully understood the gravity of how poorly this reflected upon the hotel as a first impression, so I sent a letter to the GM when we returned. After I completely an online survey that was sent to me and asked for the GM to contact me, he called to say that he received my letter and had sent a response (dated November 18) with an invitation to come back and enjoy lunch at the hotel. He asked where we live (near the east coast) and noted that it would be difficult for us to return for lunch. He responded, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to think of something else then,\u201d as we closed the call. This seemed vague, and I had not heard back from him several weeks later, so I called and spoke with his assistant. She called me back to offer lunch at the closest Four Seasons property, a few hours from our home, which we have no plans to visit. When paying $500/night for our room in San Francisco and experiencing some of the worst service to date during our travels, this gesture and response was not what we expected from such a service-based brand. Based on another Four Seasons stay last December in another location, I am hopeful that the experience in SF is not a norm for the brand, but we will never choose the Four Seasons San Francisco again when our travels take us to the west coast.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cgreat four seasons service and quality; not so great neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "kakapo888", "ReviewID": "UR92607854", "Content": "I've stayed in this hotel multiple times over the past 12 months.

It was such a wonderful stay, per the usual FS quality. Pros: 1. Excellent location! We didn't even rent a car (parking rate of $55/night), took cabs everywhere, avg cost of $10-15/trip ($35 for SFO). We walked to Union Square for high tea at the NM Rotunda, shopping, spent a morning at the Ferry Bldg (blue bottle coffee- a must! w a warm toasted Noah's bagel). Oh, and for you foodies out there, we couldn't get a last minute reservation at Gary Danko but we squeezed into Quince (w the help of the concierge) and it was excellent! 2. Room-super comfy, clean, big bathroom, robes/slippers, etc. 3. Service-excellent quality Cons: 1. Spa-While the massage was great (I had a prenatal, hubby w deep tissue), it's part of the LA Sports club (connected directly via elevator to the hotel) so we didn't have the usual \"spa\" feeling in the waiting area and the sauna/steam room was in the locker room. If you're a big work out fan, this is a great gym w a huge pool that as a guest you have free access. 2. Weather-just remember it's about 5-10 degrees colder compared to LA, esp at night! 3. Movies on Demand-this is a small point but can you believe it costs $17.95 to watch a new release?

My wife made reservations and was told about the special, but when we checked in, they had us down for the full rate for both nights. The manager corrected the problem quickly, and that was the only glitch in what was otherwise a great stay. Parking was relatively expensive at $55/night.

The Four Seasons lived up to its reputation in every possible way. Checked in early at around 11 a.m. not expecting a room until later on; however, service was prompt and the front desk immediately showed me to a room without making a fuss. In fact, it was only upon checkout that I found out they had upgraded me from a Superior room to a Premium room in order to accommodate my early check in. I liked that the person who checked me in did not make a fuss and did not make a huge presentation of upgrading me. The room was large and comfortable. Housekeeping was very competent; forgot to lock up my jewelry and did not have to worry that any would be missing. Turndown service was also very efficient. My only complaint would be the lack of complimentary bottled water. The Ritz Carlton would display them freely and replenish as needed; at the Four Seasons, only one bottle was provided during turndown. The location was convenient and easily accessible to Union Square and other attractions. Everything was within walking distance... providing great exercise without having to go to the gym! The gym is an external sports club, so there is no 24 hour access. However, it does have great classes and the equipment are state-of-the-art. The business center in the hotel provides complimentary internet access for an hour each day, which is sufficient for me to check in quickly with the office. All staff were polite and helpful. Service was efficient and I had a feeling that I was well-taken care of. Doormen would always greet me and call a taxi for me.

As with any type of enhancement, the hotel was able to better position itself against other new hotel openings. Everything looks fresh in the room; although, there were minimal to no changes in the bathroom. I have previously reviewed this property and I have given the property high marks all around. I wish the hotel installed the small flat-screen TVs in the bathroom but that is more of a want than a necessity. The hotel was finally able to get a traffic signal at the end of the driveway when turning onto 3rd Street! It is now easier to leave the hotel because you are not at the mercy of another gracious driver who lets you turn onto the street. The hotel\u2019s valet parking is upwards of $50/night which is consistent with most hotels in the area. I suggest unloading your luggage in the valet area and parking the car yourself at Jesse Square Public parking. The maximum rate is $25 per 24 hour period. Keep in mind there are NO in-out privileges and the garage is subject to a posted open-close schedule. If you need your car in the middle of the night, you will be out of luck. As guests of the hotel, you are allotted one hour of internet use in the Business Center daily\u2014nice to catch up on e-mails and the sort. For guests that wish to contact the Concierge prior to their arrival, I have found that catching them in the morning is better because during peak times, they are often inundated with calls from in-house guests/people in the lobby. I really wrote this review to dispel the notion that the hotel eliminated the Concierge. For a hotel of this caliber to do away with the Concierge would seriously undermine its ability to take care of their guests. The hotel simply merged the workspace of the two, independent departments. Each respective department carries out its own separate duties to provide services to the guests. While I believe the hotel is evaluating its options of whether to relocate the Concierge back to its original quarters, in the interim, not wanting to waste perfectly good space, the hotel opted to install a computer for which guests can print boarding passes. This is a hotel, like many businesses, that unfortunately is susceptible to the downfall of the economy and had to make arduous choices to remain competitive (and the Concierge move was one of them).

I was quite pleased with the hotel. Other's are right to say that it's an odd building not typical to Four Seasons but it's a \"City Hotel\" and not a \"Resort\". I found the location quite convenient, the shopping is just outside the door. I did not plan an itinerary for my visit and so I immediately seeked the advice of the Concierge. He was a Concierge and not a Front Desk Agent and I knew this because he wore the \"Gold Crossed Keys\" on his Lapel, he was a Les Clefs d'Or Member. He disclosed insightful tips of the city and made worthy recommendations that made our stay memorable. The hotel is close to Westfield's Mall with a gourmet type food court that we frequented a lot, it's near the Cable Car Roundabout where we took the cable car pass Lombard to Fisherman's Wharf, near Union Square where we hopped on a Double Decker Bus to tour the city, it's about 4 blocks from Chinatown Gate, a mile from the Ferry Building, it's on route of the F-Line which is perfect to take for a quicker ride back from Fisherman's Wharf and a 15 minute walk to AT&T Park. All this was discovered from a single trip to the Concierge and he drew it all out on a Four Seasons City Map, which was also a handy tool to have. He was not the only pleasant and friendly staff member we encountered. The Front Desk Agent was polite and understanding as we arrived quite early and she worked as quick as she could to prioritize our room for an early check in. The housekeeper informed us that a marathon was to take place the following day and therefore warned us about traffic in the area and even told us what time to expect the traffic to subside. LA Fitness was a wonderful amenity located within the building with a great snack shop/deli. The room was spacious and comfortable. View was not as important as a quieter room since we tend to sleep in every morning and therefore a room on the 6th floor without only an upward view was perfect for us. The shower amenities were top of the line too. All in all, I am glad that we stayed in the Four Seasons Hotel San Francisco.

Despite this drawback, which to me is minor but may be important to others, The Four Seasons is without doubt one of the top 5 best hotels in the city. The service is fabulous, the food terrific, and the location for walking where most travelers want to go can't be beat. It is without doubt on the pricey side (for instance: 2 beers, a glass of red wine and one small filet mignon (a la carte) was $100 -- reminds me of Tokyo, but I suppose Tokyo would be even more expensive). However, in this class the room rate itself is quite reasonable, and unlike other hotels, guests may use the four story Sports Club/LA (in the same building, with its own entrance for hotel guests) for free. Other hotels have no such amenity attached, and if they send you to one of the upper end health clubs, there is a day pass charge.

The best part was, its not your typical mall food. No panda express here. Unique eateries of all sorts. This was just the first day. The wonderful staff continued to amaze us.

Management should put much more user-friendly information on its web site about how to arrive by car -- it is convoluted. (3) Once you find the right place to take your car, the parking is awful. At $52 per night, it is a rip-off. And if you agree to pay that extortion, you should expect perfection, but that's not what you get.

It was our first time at a Four Seasons as a family and we were treated very well - no problems. I used to be a meeting planner and have stayed in grand hotels and done plenty of site inspections and am used to the best and I am very picky. I considered this a very nice city hotel, but nothing grand about it, and the outside is down right grim with it's gray facade. I also found it a pain to get to the driveway with our car manoevring the SF streets to get onto Stevenson instead of Market. But these things were minor in the grand scheme of things. We arrived early and they were able to get our room ready for us by 12pm so we didn't have to wait long at all, which was much appreciated. The front desk people were very polite and welcoming. Perhaps it was because I was friendly to them as well. You'll get better service if you treat people nicely and smile. The lobby was very nice, although, I did find that being on the 5th floor and the separate elevators to get down to the ground level irksome after a while. Two steps every time instead of one. Our room was clean and well maintained and high up with a nice view overlooking Market Street and Grant. Just what I'd expect from a city hotel. It was large and we still had plenty of space even with a King bed and a cot. I never heard any noise or voices from any other rooms - very quiet. Large bathroom and great soaking tub and separate shower. Sleek, simple yet understated elegant decor throughout as you'd expect from a Four Seasons. It's not like a Ritz if that's what you're after. All the service staff who we met were cordial and did a great job cleaning and preparing the room for the night with slippers, straightening up and replenishing the towels and ice. Cabs were sometimes hard to get at night, so if we were close enough to walk, we usually did or went across to O'Farrell and got a cab ourselves, which was faster if there was a line for a cab (as was the case at the dinner hour.) We loved having our breakfast everyday in the dining room and didn't think the service slow at all. It was leisurely - we were on vacation - we didn't want to be rushed, it was just right in my opinion. The coffee was awful, so I switched to pots of tea daily, but the juice was constantly replenished and the fruit plate was amazing. Unfortunately, the toast was always lukewarm, never enough to melt butter on and we were charged for bacon that we never got one day, but when I pointed it out on the bill, they were very apologetic and corrected the bill immediately. One day we opted for room service with breakfast and they forgot my son's yogurt with his fruit plate, but otherwise it was exactly as I ordered. Service was excellent and at the time I ordered it for. Meticulous set up in our room and it was taken away shortly after I called to have it removed once we were finished. Just as I would expect from a Four Seasons. The health club was great, as was the ladies locker room - a real bonus with a sauna and steam room. I was there at various times of the day, and never was it very crowded. Tons of classes to choose from that are free as well. Plus, when you sign in to the club, the Four Seasons gives you free water and headphones for the machines. Water was also provided gratis at the valet parking when going out for the day. These little freebies left us with a lasting impression, I didn't feel nickle and dimed. In fact, upon check out when I reviewed the bill (habit from my meeting planning days) there were no surprises, it was just what I expected, with no hidden or unexpected expenses. In fact in came in under what I had estimated. We took advantage of the summer special of one free night with every two paid nights. Between that and the complimentary breakfasts for two daily, we had a huge savings! It was one of the reasons why I chose this hote in the first place over the one of the other grande dame hotels in town. The car valets were especially friendly to us and got to know us over time. Tiny gift shop, but they have razors which is all we needed during our stay. All in all, we had a really pleasant experience at the Four Seasons although I think I expected something on a grander scale. Still, the location was great, close to Union Square, lots of good restaurants and shopping at the Westfield Mall.

I am comparing it to the other urban Four Seasons hotels we have stayed at over the past couple of years as well as to the other San Francisco hotels we've stayed at recently. The lobby of this hotel is on the 5th floor. You enter into a nondescript ground floor space, take one elevator up to the lobby, and then have to move to a second bank of elevators across the lobby to get to your room. No quick and easy exits from this hotel, and that got irritating fast. The lobby and public spaces were elegant, but there was no wow factor like in so many other Four Seasons hotels. When we checked in we were upgraded to a view room, which was generous and appreciated. However, the view is not much - just looking out to Market Street and up Grant Street. No San Francisco landmarks were in sight. (Compare this to the view room we were upgraded to in Sydney, which looked out at the harbor, bridge, and opera house). I wouldn't recommend paying more for a view room in San Francisco. Our room was nice - comfy bed, good linens, flat screen television, soaking tub, etc . But really it was no nicer than the room at the Le Meridien San Francisco that we stayed in about 18 months ago (which was half the price). Breakfast was included in our rate. This was the first Four Seasons we've stayed at without a breakfast buffet. Their buffets are usually impressive (as well as being fast) so that was a disappointment. We ate breakfast in the restaurant the first morning and the service was painfully slow. We ordered breakfast in our room the next two mornings and it was delivered ~15 minutes late both times. The staff were professional and helpful in our interactions with them, but - due to the way the hotel is set up - it was mainly just the doormen that we encountered. This hotel offers a pretty anonymous experience, which some might prefer, I guess. We had to pay for internet in our room (per usual) but this Four Seasons also charged for use of the business center, which was unusual and unwelcome. One big perk at this hotel is that guests have access to the Sports Club LA, a large gym with a junior olympic sized pool. Much better than your typical hotel fitness room!

Throughout San Francisco, there are an abundance of five star caliber properties from which to choose. Over the years, I have had the pleasure of trying most of these options, yet the Four Seasons now remains number one on my list for a variety of reasons. Regardless of your travel purpose, the Four Seasons is certain to exceed your expectations on every level. Located on Market Street, in the heart of San Francisco, this property offers a central local from which to launch your vacation plans or conduct business. Most everything is within walking distance, including some of San Francisco's finest shops, restaurants, convention centers and more. The building itself is a contemporary multi-use hotel/condo structure built in 2001. The hotel lobby is located above street level, which gives a very secluded yet residential feel. All valet parking and luggage services are provided on the ground level. Upon checking in, we were warming greeted by a staff that was aimed at pleasing. Our request for a corner room was accommodated prior to our arrival. We reserved a superior category room, but were upgraded to a deluxe category room with a corner Yoruba Buena Gardens view. The room was oversized, and perfect for relaxing or doing business. The decor was simple and inviting. Although the St. Regis San Francisco might provide a more exciting take on room decor or features, we felt that the service and general comfort of the Four Seasons experience was better. The lobby bar is fantastic, offering a variety of creative drink options, and just a great atmosphere for socializing. Four Seasons guests have access to the Sports Club LA, which is just an elevator ride from the lobby. The Club houses an upscale fitness center along with a Spa for guests as well. Overall, our experience was beyond memorable, made possible by both the excellent service as well as the comfort of the rooms.

The crib that I requested was the typical 4 Seasons crib, and the complimentary doll that comes with it was of a crab. Very cute doll, but my daughter was afraid of it. The bed was spacious, but a bit too soft for me because of my back problems. Second, I must compliment room service. The food was amazingly good compared to other Four Seasons hotels. I was expecting a mediocre breakfast like that in the NY 4 Seasons, but this hotel's food was delicious. Their breakfast and all day dining selections were good, and my wife especially loved their picnic baskets. The picnic baskets were great for our city tour and our flight home. Third, the location was great. Minutes from Union Square and the Westfield San Francisco. Chinatown was not too far away and I enjoyed the atmosphere of the hotel's location. There were vagabonds and homeless people around the area, but it was not as bad as New York. The staff and security at the entrances did a good job. They knew our names, helped us to hail a cab, provided directions, and always greeted us with a smile. I enjoyed my stay because the service provided was professional without any attitude.

When we were shown to our room one hour later, we were given a SMOKING room (complete with several ashtrays) that was extremely small. (If this was an upgrade, I can't even imagine what our original room would have been--A utility closet?) The room was clean and comfortable, but it reeked of cigarette smoke, much like a Las Vegas hotel room. Because we had waited so long to get the room and we were only staying two nights, we decided to stick it out rather than requesting a switch. That evening while we were waiting for a cab in front of the hotel, we were pleasantly surprised when an employee ushered us to the back of the hotel to be driven to our restaurant in the hotel's town car. Unfortunately, once we made it to the area where we were supposed to enter the car, another employee apologized for the mix up, explaining that the car couldn't take us because our restaurant was outside the hotel's one-mile radius and that we would need to head back out front to try for a cab again. This was irritating, to say the least. The next day after we returned from the day's activities, we discovered that our room had not been cleaned and our breakfast dishes were still there. We called housekeeping and waited, but 30 minutes later we called again. After the second call, housekeeping arrived promptly. We did have good luck with turn down service and room service and all the staff we encountered were extremely polite.

To start with the few cons, we thought pay internet was a little absurd considering the high price. And the style of the lobby was a little stodgy. The bathroom was also rather small. The lobby/front desk/parking maze can be a bit confusing. It took us a couple days to go smoothly from our car to our room. But, these are all pretty small points.

The room itself (Premier Room -Market Street View, 14th floor) met our expectations but could not compare to the similar category at the Jackson Hole property. This is a big city hotel, on the contemporary side. The first room we were shown had a \"bay\" view. We asked to be switched to the Market Street view. The bay was in view, but distant and not at all picturesque (working cranes, etc.). For the price of the room, not what I was expecting. City view was fine, but I couldn't recommend the hotel based on the view from the rooms. Concierge desk was helpful in securing theatre tickets quickly and in making reservations for us at restaurants that had been recommended to us ahead of our visit to San Francisco by friends. We ate at Scoma's in Sausalito for lunch, Piperade for dinner, Seasons for dinner, and Perbacco for dinner, Mocca (on Maiden Lane) for a very casual lunch, and Bistro Boudin for chowder and a drink overlooking Fisherman's Wharf.

I am not a moaner. I read the reviews. I bought the ticket. I got burned. This place is cruising. There is a casual demeanour in pretty much all of the staff which indicates they are having it really good. Which is fine..unless you're the customer. Not good enough. And I am..paying more than $600 per evening so I do at least feel entitled to a view. Trust me..and by way of illustration only ..the concierge service on my visit..was almost inaccessable. Too too busy. I tried 5 times in person and by phone today to reschedule my weekend--this is a KEY reason I overpay for hotels when on business ie to get a concierge service that works rather than makes concilliatory noises . I won't bore this site with the details but its been utterly amateur how I've been handled. Whenever I called someone in this hotel whether on front desk, room service, concierge... they speed at breakneck/smallprint pace telling you they need to call you back. Not good enough. The choice of food is not good enough either--its a short uninspring room service menu and theres 1 ..not very busy even on a Friday evening restaurant....where (and I only say this because thats what this site is about) the staff are just 3*. When I arrived I had to physically grab someone after 10 minutes milling about who in turn grabbed a girl who was in mid 'hilarious' conversation with a colleague. I genuinely have had 'paralllel universe' moments reading the other reviews of this place--eg I went to the back hotel entrance to get a taxi to Sausallito and was told there was none and I should walk out onto Market St and get my own--I did this and got a cab at which point a hotel employee appeared to close the cab door for me and seek a tip!!!! I promise you..it would be funny if it were not true. . I have stayed in Four Seasons all over the world (indeed had an incredible family vacation at Jimbaran Bay in Bali in April) so its not a rant. 100% GENUINE CAR CRASH OF A STAY..AND I HAVE NOT EVEN TOLD HALF OF IT..

It has the understated elegance that I have found at other Four Seasons Hotels like Prague and New York. It is not a grand hotel but rather a modern contemporary one so there is really no wow factor. There is however outstanding service and amenities including what has to be one of the best hotel gyms. The hotel connects to Sports Club LA, the San Francisco edition and it is really a nice gym and spa as well as pool. The hotel bar is quite nice with a piano player and I thought the lobby was elegant. The hotel is in a great location right near the best shopping without the headache of Union Square. It is also only a small distance from Chinatown and by extension North Beach with its fabulous Italian Restaurants.....both areas are nice safe walks. The service is absolutely outstanding and even better than other Fours Seasons I have stayed at. Exemplary would be the best way to describe it. The food in the restaurant is very good but not fabulous especially for San Francisco which has incredible dining choices. Room service was fast and efficient and breakfast was good each morning but nothing off the charts. My only complaint which would give me pause in staying here again is that it is not sufficiently sound proofed. I am a relatively light sleeper and sleep with ear plugs. However even with the ear plugs I was awakened by sirens each of the three nights I stayed here and I was on the 11th floor. Many 5 and even 4 star hotels that I have stayed at have sufficiently sound proofed the rooms so that you don't hear sirens from the City. I realize San Fran is a noisy city but I have been in hotels in the world's noisiest cities and not heard the city from the room with the windows closed. I would have expected The Four Seasons to do the same and note that it has in NY. I am not sure why it was skipped here but it is a significant shortcoming in my book. I have stayed in a total of 6 hotels in San Fran. I would say The Four Seasons and The Fairmont are my favorites in this City. However I will proably keep looking. On the whole if I had to choose between The Four Seasons and The Fairmont I would probably chose a room with a bay and bridge view at The Fairmont. That view is just incredible and makes up for the difference between the Fairmont being a 4 star and The Four Seasons being a five star hotel. Just be forewarned that The Fairmont is an old grand hotel that is a bit worn around the edges in the old part which houses the lobby and the restaurant. The newer tower has the remodelled rooms that offer views of the bay and bridge if you request and pay for it. That is the place to be in that hotel. I am tempted to try the Huntington on my next trip to San Fran. It has great ratings on Tripadvisor and is on Nob Hill right near the Fairmont, The Mark Hopkins and Grace Cathedral which is a cathedral that is really worth looking at. In sum The Four Seasons is quite nice. It has some very strong qualities but I can neither state that I would definetly stay or not stay there again. If you are not a light sleeper I suspect the noise might not bother you although I do note that another reviewer commented that bells from a nearby church woke him up.", "Date": "June 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cOver the top\u201d", "Author": "hotchr", "ReviewID": "UR7804140", "Content": "Here on business for one night.

Also after having stayed at the Ritz a mile down the road and the Argent same block and other nice hotels in SF, I was looking forward to how this hotel would measure up. The hotel itself is about as impressive as any hotel in terms of public areas and room quality. Service is top notch and nothing was less than perfection. Downside of the hotel is that kids cannot use the pool at LA Fitness which is connected to the hotel. However if that is a deal killer for you, the Marriott a couple of hundred feet away is available-complimentary. LA Fitness is as good as it gets for a work out facility. The location is great for kids because of it's proximity to the Metreon which has movies, free summer concerts on the lawn, the Zeum, great play area and bowling. Although you do have to go outside to access these kid friendly activities, it's convenient and a can't miss for the kids. Wife enjoyed Union Square shopping and the city of course has endless entertainment options. If you don't want to spend the $44-48 for valet parking, many nearby options for $20+. Since it's a city hotel, don't expect a warm and fuzzy feel to the hotel. It's geared for business travellers, but will also work for vacationing families who want to be right on Market Street. It is what it is, an impeccably run hotel with no bad surprises, but then again for the special weekend rate is $500 with tax,parking etc. for the basic room you shouldn't expect anything less. We spent the extra $ for a deluxe room so I can't comment on basic accomodations.

We stayed there this spring and, because the entire decor is so elegantly understated and integrated, it wasn't until we'd been there several days that I began to notice how unusual the art was. After I'd begun to look closely at the paintings and the discreet brass plaques identifying them, an employee noticed. She gave me an illustrated brochure with a map of the hotel and numbered locations of the various pieces. A guest can spend a delightful hour or so following the map. (My favorite painting hangs behind the reception desk--but my companions didn't all agree.) The accompanying photos of one of the few flower displays in the hotel show the simple elegance of the property.
