They also allowed animals and this was the worse I'd seen as one person had three dogs in one room. I asked the front desk, how does that go when they check out and she claims that they shut the room down for 30 days to be cleaned.

The hotel is cheap for a reason! I arrived at the hotel having travelled throughout the USA and stayed at many budget hotels along the way. This is by far the worst I have ever experienced. The hotel is located in a less than desirable area. There is barbed wire around the walls of the place, there was a car in the car park which had its window smashed. We entered our room via the back entrance which was full of rubbish. The room stank, it was filthy in the bathroom, dirt all up the walls and on the floor. The bath was also dirty. The carpet was covered in blood stains I didn't want to even imagine what happened there. The bed linen had cigarette burns in it, smelled awful and was dirty (and we were in a non-smoking room). The chair in the room was covered in stains and the heater didn't work. I did not feel safe at this establishment at all and would never recommend it to anyone.

A Hotwire bargain, I was told that my ground-floor request was unavailable, but after the butt incident, two ground-floor rooms were suddenly available. The difference was amazing. The first room, besides reeking of smoke, was really decrepit, even to the silver backing on the cheap stuck-on bathroom mirror having peeled off to 6 inches around the edges, the sink chipped and the bathtub horribly stained, I was afraid to look in the kitchen. On the ground floor, however, it was a whole different property, clean and new with decent lighting and smelling fine. The desk staff was pleasant enough, and the head of housekeeping even took me to inspect the new offering, which was a nice touch, apologizing for not having stocked the room with dishtowels yet.
