Christine at front desk was extremely patient and friendly with me and gave me all the information and suggested some places I could visit while in San Diego. The room was nice and clean and I do love the kitchen in the room. Will definitely come back. Just wanted to say Thank you to Christine and all the personnel (sorry I forgot names) I have met in there. I will definitely stay in your hotel again and will suggest it to friends and family.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cHome Away From Home\u201d", "Author": "Keith B", "ReviewID": "UR128080910", "Content": "I just wanted to write a quick note about my stay. Everyone there made me feel very comfortable. If every I had a question our a problem, they were always ready to solve it and won't blow you you off until it was taken care of. The staff day or night were always polite and professional. I would recomend the san Diego location to any body. NOW MY NEXT REVIEW. I am now working in Santa Barbara where your SD staff tried to hook me up with your extended stay here. I spoke with Lindsey who gave me a deal on a room,but only until June 1. I told here we would need at least 4 rooms maybe more. She told me 2 differnt times she would speak to her up above on the June 1 rate increase problem. NO CALL BACK. So feeling like I could be out searching in June for a place to stay for 6 months, I decided to buy an RV. Now I stay at an RV Resort,where my cost will not increase. THANK YOU LINDSEY ! If your other places where all like SD I think you would be better off. Maybe use the staff at that location to be a training center on how to treat your clients and prospective clients.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Ana, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Viraly C", "ReviewID": "UR127957829", "Content": "My work is using this hotel for a few employees for 7 weeks.

We have stayed now for 4 weeks, 3 more weeks to go. I was very pleased how the hotel is after reading some reviews. The hotel is newly remodeled, some rooms have granite countertops. It is clean, new paint, new carpet, new toilets, new floor in kitchen and bathroom, new flat screen tv's, free internet :), free parking, free breakfast goodies and great customer service from all staff. We often need to check-in early, with no problem. We have stayed in a queen room and a king room. I highly recommend the extra $5 to $10 a night to stay in the king room; the room is much bigger and the bed is bigger and more comfortable:) They have an on-site laundry room which is always open and cheaper than the laundrymats in town. Every unit has a full size fridge and a few eating and cooking utensils & flatware. Save your money on the more expensive hotels and save it for the great restaurants in town :)", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cvery nice hotel and calm\u201d", "Author": "Amara Venakta M", "ReviewID": "UR127209787", "Content": "Staying in homestead was a good experience.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were all recently renovated with a very nice, modern look, and the place honestly felt like a home away from home. If any issues arose, management got on them right away to make sure they were taken care of immediately. The kitchen is another good feature, helping the room feel like home while also controlling dining costs during your stay. The location is ideal too as it's situated right between the 805 and 15 freeways, with the 56 just slightly to the north - this made it really easy to get anywhere in the San Diego area. This Homestead is a great, low-key place to stay and I definitely recommend it to anyone needing to stay in San Diego.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Hospitality and smiles\u201d", "Author": "Regis P", "ReviewID": "UR126200070", "Content": "I stayed at the Homestead in Tigard Oregon for 18 months for buisness and moved down to San Diego on buisness .
