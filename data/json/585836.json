Usually I stay at the Marriott West India Quai, but this time it was fully booked an the company reserved a room for me at the Hilton. It is a very nice hotel for business travellers, spacious room (much bigger than the ones at the Marriott), very clean room and toilett, excellent room-service with a lot of options, and also a very good breakfast. Of course that room service and breakfast are too expensive, but I know it's the rule a this type of hotels. Negative points: Bed - not as comfortable as the ones from the Marriott or other hotels like Sheraton or Intercontinental. Windows - windows are locked in the rooms, and is not possible to open them, not even a bit, which is horrible for people who prefer a bit of fresh air instead of the air conditioning.

What a great find!! The boutique feeling of the Hotel is very much like the Tower Bridge Hilton, with similar furnishings and overall design and with the added benefit of the attitude of the staff, you would not think that these are part of a worldwide chain. Turning to the Canary Wharf Hilton, the location is pretty good with access via a footbridge to Canary Wharf Underground Station, rather than opting to walk down the road to the Docklands Light Railway, as the interchange between the DLR and the Tube at Canary Wharf Station actually means you walk further!! The rooms are spacious and the furniture and fittings are all still in good shape; we were fortunate enough to be upgraded due to our Hilton Honours Status and the Executive Rooms here are larger than at Tower Bridge. The Photos here on Trip Advisor do the place justice and give a very good representation of what you get here. The real gem of this Hotel was a very large Executive Lounge with excellent staff and services and a fantastic view of London. I particularly liked the silhouette of the London Skyline etched on the Executive Lounge windows. One tip is that just down the road and across from South Quay Station is a Tescos Supermarket that is open every day (including Sundays) from 7am to 11pm. Very useful for those things you might leave behind All in all this was a great find and will be a strong contender for our repeat visits to London", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSpacious clean rooms, excellent location and great facilities.\u201d", "Author": "sydneyshopgirl", "ReviewID": "UR125876370", "Content": "I stayed at the Hilton Canary Wharf for 3 nights with my husband as part of a 10 day holiday in London.

Canary Wharf has such a modern vibe to it.

The staff were quite helpful and instantly provided the room thereby saving us the trouble of leaving the luggage and traveling into the city. The early check in was a good start and we made our selves comfortable in the large spacious room. The bed was comfy but at the edge of the bed,one could hear the mattress spring moving around which was a little disconcerting. The views werent that great as there were tall buildings all around, I guess there must be other rooms overlooking the river, so opt for those. The bathrooms were very funcitonal and there was a big tub which was a boon to us as we were dead tired on arrival. The AC was comfortable and although the outside temperature was close to -2 degrees, the room was a cosy 22. My girlfriend wanted to use the internet to get some work done but we were told that it would be 15 pounds for a day's use!! Considering that most hotels these days offer free wireless or atleast a couple of hours of complimentary usage, this was a shock. It was way overpriced and something you dont expect from a hotel in the business district of London. We had a decent morning breakfast, with good options and a spread that is expected from a star hotel like Hilton.The food was fresh and filling. The location is amazing with a 5 min walk from the Canary wharf station on the Jubilee line and is quite safe even at night. There are many options to eat and shop nearby if one wants to explore. Jubilee place is right within the station and there are a few other bars and cafes within walking distance.

You couldn't hear anything outside or anybody in the corridor. It was wonderful. The breakfast was included in our hotel deal and it was delicious. There was alot of choice, from a fry to cereal and fruit. It's self-service too so you can decide how much or little you have. The hotel seems more like a business hotel but it is perfect for travelling too.

My first impressions on the first day were of a hotel that overall had very high standards. The staff were very friendly, helpful and the hotel was extremely clean. The ambient temperature in every location was perfect, whether it be in the room, corridor, foyer or breakfast dining. The hotel room was very quiet the first night, the bed was a amazing, very comfortable. However, the second nights stay was spoiled by people in the room next to me. I was out in London all day from 11am to 10pm visiting galleries and museums and when I got back I just wanted to go to bed and sleep. Next door it sounded like they were having a bit of a party and enjoying themselves much at the expense of other hotel guests. They were going in and out of the room at what seemed like every 10 -15 minutes and letting the door slam shut, laughing loudly and playing music. I did give them the benefit of the doubt, thinking the noise would stop and they would go to bed. This did not happen and went on until I phoned the front desk at 2am and was told the hotel would speak to them. Thinking the noise would now end, I tried to get some sleep. Sadly, the noise continued and I phoned the desk again at 3.30am and was once again told they would check it out. The noise continued until I gave up and phoned the desk again at 4.10am and asked for a room change. I was then moved to an alternative room at 4.30am and eventually got to sleep around 5am. This was obviously not a very nice experience and it was compounded by the night desk manager's over sight at not dealing with the problem in the first instance when first reported at 2am. Needless to say, i was shattered afterwards for a good few days. In the morning when checking out I complained about what had happened to the Front of House Manager who was very apologetic. The outcome of this spoiled nights stay, is that I received a complimentary nights stay to be arranged when suitable to use in the future. This was the correct action and the only action by the Hotel and in fairness to the Hotel, they did show consummate professionalism when dealing with the incident the morning after. It is obviously with regret, that it was not dealt with properly the night before. So my stay was a mixed bag, the first day and night was amazing and I was highly impressed by this Hilton, but sadly it was spoiled by the extremely rude, selfish and ignorant behavior of the people in the room next door. I will be returning to stay at the Canary Wharf Hilton in April, as I do believe this was a one off incident and the Hotel have re-compensated me for the inconvenience caused. p.s. if you are staying at the Hotel I would recommend a visit to the London Docklands Museum in Canary Wharf.

BOOKING: through Hilton's official website, taking advantage of a promo, we booked an executive room for two nights with a pre-paid, non-refundable rate. Breakfast in the restaurant and executive lounge access were included. LOCATION: once rough areas, the docklands and East London are now a super-modern, beautiful business (but not only) area. CHECK-IN: quick and pleasant. Staff were always smiling and helpful. The reception is large and, just like the restaurant, with a lot of sleek limegreen glass. ROOM: we had been in a standard room previously and had an executive room this time. Not too much difference: they are medium size, ultraclean, in beautiful warm tones, all very modern and elegant. The marble bathroom is extremely nice too. The plus with an executive room consists of getting access to the executive lounge, offering free breakfast and refreshments. Since breakfast was included in our rate, we had it in the restaurant directly. The lounge is one the best I've been to, along with those at the Hilton London Tower Bridge and the Hilton Stockholm Slussen. It's big, with a beautiful view and plenty of quality food and drinks. You can make a real meal out of it. There are computers with free internet access too. SERVICES & AMENITIES: conceived as a business hotel, the Hilton London Canary Wharf has all the possible business & meeting-related facilities but since we were there for the weekend and not for business we did not try anything of that. We did try the gym and sauna. DINING: the limegreen-glass decorated Cinnamon Restaurant & Bar is chic, beautiful and coloured. We had great Hilton breakfasts there. Selection and service are very good. TRANSPORTATION & DIRECTIONS: very well connected with central London both through the underground (Jubilee Line) and the DLR (Docklands Light Railway).The DLR is next door. We used the underground instead. Exit the gorgeous Canary Wharf underground station, turn left, go through the building and the nice footbridge. The hotel is just there. It takes no more than 5 minutes. BOTTOM LINE: We were very positively impressed by this hotel and very happy with our stay. Maybe I would not strongly recommend it to people going to London for the first time because it is a bit far from the main tourist areas. Let's put it like this: after your first visit to London, this is one of the best possible places where to stay. If you prefer the West End or being in the middle of the action (this part of the city is particularly quiet on the weekends), please note that you are very well and rapidly connected to it by underground. Of course it is an even more perfect choice for those having business in the Canary Wharf / Docklands area. TIPS: Hilton is great but usually pretty on the expensive side. Since this is mainly a business hotel in a business area, rates tend to be high on weekdays; you will usually find good and sometimes really great rates for weekend stays - take advantage of that! 10-15 minutes on the Jubilee line (or DLR) will take you to Stratford, the heart of the action of the upcoming Olympics, and to the recently opened Westfield Stratford City, the largest shopping mall in Europe.

My only word of advice is to be slightly cautious if you're driving to the hotel and leaving the car overnight in the carpark. Make sure you take your room keycard with you.

Canary Wharf is a great place to be especially at the weekend when it is handed over to the tourists. We were upgraded to a deluxe room as we had requested a high floor and we were on floor 11, one below the executive floor and it had a great view of the city. The room was large and had everything we needed. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable. It was not the largest bathroom considering the size of the room which was strange but was adequate. There were a couple of missing items such as slippers to go with the bathrobes and no camomile tea but I had taken both of these with me so no need to request them, just a bit surprised but I am sure this was not typical. The room was very clean and decorated in the Hilton style which I find just a bit drab. The breakfast was very good, the food was hot and you can have omelettes made to order and cooked whilst you wait.

I therefore filled out a best rate gurantee form as advertised on the hilton website http://www.hilton.co.uk/HiWayWeb/appmanager/portals/customer?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=pg_customer_cs_best_rates however never heard anything back even though I then emailed twice and rang the customer service line twice. Not exactly great considering i'm a hilton honors member. Also found that whilst in the hotel when I visited the health spa facilities (complimentary for hilton honors members) that there was a sign saying 'u6's may only use the swimming pool' when in fact there is no pool there is just sauna, steam room and gym. And these weren't staffed which I found a little dangerous. HOWEVER, these issues were far outweighed by the positives. I had booked the room for me and my mum as an xmas treat and we arrived at around 10.45am and did not expect to be able to check in however we were pleasantly surprised when we were informed that the room was ready and that we had been upgraded to the twin deluxe room. I believe this must have been due to me been a hilton honors blue member. The room was very spacious and the beds were extremely comfortable. A nice chair to lounge in and also a desk for business use (however the lamp didn't work, didn';t report as didn't need to use the desk). The washroom was great as it had both bath and shower and nice to see a hotel that offers conditioner as well as shampoo. The room was very quiet no disturbances had a great nights sleep. Waking up to the views over the city and river was fab too (we were on the 10th floor). We checked out at arund 10.30 and the process was quick and efficient, we then left our luggage with the concierge whilst I went to a job interview and collected them a couple of hours later.

It was SUPER value for money! We also got told at reception that we had been given a complimentary room upgrade from our basic room to an Executive room on the 12th floor. - Our room Upon arrival to our room, we walked in and the first thing we saw was the arrangement of balloons, my cake and my card, this was lovely and inside the card was my voucher for 2 free drinks. Our room was much bigger than expected, very large bed, nice bathroom, with shower and bath separate! Nice window view over the river. - Executive Lounge This was GREAT value for money, well worth it! This included: All Day Refreshments - Schweppes Lemonade, Tonic Water, Sprite, Coca Cola, Diet Coca Cola, Red Bull, Sugar Free Red Bull, Milk, Cream, Water, Sparkling Water and a selection of fruit juices. Tea, Coffee and a coffee machine that does cappuccino etc. There were also a selection of nuts etc out all day, there were little bowls so you could dish these up yourself and have little nibbles on your table. Breakfast - Croissants, Pastries, Toast, all spreads for toast, different breads, cereals, meats and cheeses, yoghurts, bacon, sausage, egg, tomatoes, hash browns! Great breakfast, was very impressed with this. Along with this you get all of the refreshments above plus Orange juice, apple juice, cranberry juice and tomato juice. Lunch - This was a selection of wraps and small baguettes, cheeses, breads, ham etc. Lots of cakes and biscuits, fruit. If I really had to pick 1 negative about our whole stay, it was that there were a few too many cakes!!! Normally, this would not be a problem, but I am on a diet and at lunch it was hard to find something (other than cakes!) that I liked as I'm quite fussy, so I found myself having a banana for lunch. But to be honest this did not matter one little bit, as this lounge is only for 'light refreshments'. Dinner - This was a selection of canap\u00e9s, our first night, we had sushi and other canap\u00e9s and then there were also some cocktail sausages and onion rings, the second night not sure too much on what we had as we didn't really look at the food on the second night as we were going out, but I think it was canap\u00e9s and a selection of chicken wings and spring roll type things. Then for a few hours in the evening alcohol was included. This was fab, as it was help yourself, just like you would at home! I don't really have much else to say about the hotel, other than I was so impressed and pleased with this and have already recommended it to family and friends who will be booking.

My king sized bed was comfortable and the room was spacious with chair and ottoman in a seating area as well as a desk and desk chair.

We went and asked at the excecutive lounge and they asked us to wait whilst they found out what happened.

Breakfast on Sunday morning was busy but staff did their best not to keep people waiting more than a few minutes. The food quality (choice of continental and English cooked buffet) was indeed very good and set us up for the rest of the day. Our rate included breakfast, which was just as well as they charge a hefty \u00a320.95 each for the cooked breakfast otherwise. Not having been to Canary Wharf before, we found plenty to see and do after checking out of the hotel and leaving our bags with the concierge for safe-keeping. There are a good selection of shops, restaurant and pubs and contrary to popular belief the area was far from being deserted at weekends. The excellent Museum of London at Docklands was also well worth seeing. We returned to central London on the Thames Clipper boat service (\u00a35.50 single to Waterloo), for which the quay is approximately 15 minutes walk away from the hotel - not as convenient as the tube but worth it as a on-off just to see the river from a different perspective.

All 4 of the rooms I used had a v.poor mobile signal on bberry, phone and ipad (all vodafone).

No wi-fi - now expected like TV and running water by most of us. Dont mind paying for in room high-speed internet line when really needed for work but expect wi-fi throughout. 3. TV - small table top of limited quality (during Wimbledon !) - 37inch+ quality flat screen is standard expectation these days in a business hotel I also noticed the restaurant seemed to have about 5-10 customers most evenings with the occasional larger group although I experienced a v.good standard from staff/service/food - menu is varied but the same every single night and perhaps slightly over-priced given competition on the wharf - might not be persuading the many regular business customers to eat in much - a missed opportunity ?

This room was even more spacious than the one we previously stayed in, and was in excellent condition without any of the minor maintenance issues we had noticed before. One big advantage the executive rooms here have is superior bathrooms - the presence of both a bath and separate walk-in shower was very welcome. Cleanliness was up to the usual high Hilton standards. Overall, the offering was among the best value in London and certainly at the top of the 4* bracket. Service was excellent almost everywhere. Staff always greeted us in corridors & lifts and we were made to feel quite a lot more welcome this time than last time. However, there was one exception. We weren't sure if being upgraded entitled us to Executive Lounge access or not, and when we attempted to enquire discreetly at the lounge, the male staff member there took great delight in announcing loudly to the whole room that we didn't have access. I notice FatCat153 experienced similar treatment to this, evidence that it's probably necessary to send the lounge staff on a tact refresher course. I think I've said enough about the location in my previous review, however I need to stress again that the quality of restaurants in the area is generally very bad - The Gun is the only reliable choice nearby.

We asked a policeman though and it turns out it's only about a 5 min walk.

We arrived at around 1.30pm and checked in no problem and we told that we had been upgraded to an executive room. We were really pleased and went up to our room on the 13th floor (in a super speedy lift!) and found a fab, large room with a great view and lovely Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, bathrobes and slippers and complimentry water. The bathroom was huge (with a seperate shower) and all very clean and comfortable. We went out for a few hours that afternoon and got back to the hotel at around 5.30pm to find chocolate cake and balloons in the room with a card from the management saying Happy Birthday. I thought this was a lovely and very kind touch and my Mum loved it! We had dinner in the restaurant that night which was very tasty. There was then a power cut for a couple of hours so we stayed in the bar, but the staff took fantastic care of us, provided complimentary drinks and kept us updated about what was going on. A few people in the bar were getting a bit annoyed but it was not the hotels fault (turns out a lot of the area had been without power!) and we felt that they did everything they possibly could to make the situation easier! The whole thing was dealt with in a completely professional manner.

Ice machine in the lift lobby on every floor such a US style boon, much better than ordering up ice each time you needed it.

A room service charge is like being charged thrice for the privilege - once to stay at the hotel, second time for the food, third time for them to bring it to your room. They don't hide it as a service charge for tipping purposes as the chit you sign still has space to add a tip, so its cash that drops straight to the bottom line for the hotel.

With that said, from the minute I checked in I was impressed with the well trained staff. Check in was painless and fast. I threw three items to the dry cleaners on the first morning after check in and they were done by the late afternoon and delivered in gorgeous suit bags--completely first class. Third night I was feeling a bit under the weather--went down to the concierge who recommended a fabulous Indian restaurant, Bengal Quay, which was steps away from the hotel. He didn't have a menu so he walked me over to the restaurant and waited there outside until I ordered! When I told him I was returning in 15 minutes to pick it up, he told me that was nonsense and immediately arranged for the food to be delivered to ME. After I got back to my room he phoned (about 30 minutes later) to be sure that I had received it.

The Docklands Light Railway is a dream to use and takes you right into the city of London from just a 3 mins walk from the hotel and could not be an easier walk with a wheelie suitcase. Check- in was welcoming and very efficient - they had already upgraded me to an Executive floor room before I even asked. The room was very large but maybe this was because it was at the end of the corridor. All the usual amenities you would expect although the towels were not particularly fluffy. The view from the window was excellent - towards the London Eye, although it was a long way away! I was concerned about the noise, but there was no need as it was incredibly quiet and peaceful. I ordered room service and did not eat in the restaurant for lunch - club sandwich was nice, mostly because the chicken was succulent. The toast was a bit dry. This was an overnight business trip, and did not return to the hotel until 23.30. One of the disadvantages of the area is lack of cafes/restaurants/coffee shops that open that late. There is a small centre of shops 2 mins walk from the hotel with the basics but I guess these are only open during the day. The Executive Lounge was closed, and I was hungry but I found a lovely chocolate dessert in my room - just what was needed! After a great night's sleep, breakfast in the Executve Lounge - good selection. I didn't use any of the leisure facilities, and internet connection is cable only in the bedrooms, not Wi Fi.

On arrival I had a little bit of trouble finding the entrance to parking garage, but after hanging around like a lemon for few minutes I drove up to a big \"garage door\" and spotted the hotel intercom and the concierge buzzed me in. There was plenty of room to park, and for \u00a320 per night I thought that was reasonable for the neighbourhood. I went upstairs to reception and almost had to beat the concierge off from taking my meagre luggage, they were very service focused! The receptionist was really polite and friendly and helpful and check in was painless. There are three spacious and very smooth lifts (never been in a Mitsubishi lift before) and the corridors upstairs were wide, spacious and nicely decorated. I was shocked when I opened the bedroom door; the room was really large for a London Hotel. Nice modern sleek lines, and a very comfortable bed. Internet was \u00a315 per night, which I thought was a lot so didn't bother, and the phone signal was a bit intermittant too. We were going to head into Canary Wharf for dinner but one of our colleagues was late so we used the hotel restaurant instead. I'm veggie and there were a couple of options for me which was encouraging. The waitress (I wish I'd noted her name) was delightful, very charming and helpful, bringing some warmth to the slightly sterile environment that the modern design of this hotel restaurant. The food was superb, nicely presented, tasty ingredients and some imaginative combinations. For dessert I ordered the trule test of a restaurant, the chocolate fondant. It was perfect, slightly crunchy on the outside but moist on the inside and very very chocolatey!! I had a good night's sleep, and it nice looking out of the window and seeing the bright lights of docklands. Shower was good, and nice bathroom sundries. Checkout was easy, quick and painless (and firiendly). If you turn right out of the hotel entrance on foot, you can walk across to Canary Wharf, which is pretty impressive if you've never seen it before. If you turn left however you'll end up in Millwall Dock, which is interesting but a bit more urban and \"everyday\" in places. There were quite a few lads on bikes wearing hoodies hanging around, not doing anything wrong, but just a warning if you find that kind of thing intimidating (I'm sure there is no need, they looked pretty harmless to me). I paid \u00a3184 room rate (plus VAT), \u00a320 for parking and \u00a345 for dinner, so my total bill was close to \u00a3300.

The condition was pretty good, some of the veneer on the wood was showing early signs of splitting at the corners and they'll want to address this soon. Really good rooms though and the carpet is much less of a horrid pattern than most hotels. Bathroom was also nice, a reasonable size and the standard of furnishing fairly high for a Hilton. Limescale was beginning to build up on the hinge of the glass shower screen and this should be sorted sooner rather than later. Check-in was pretty bad. The woman on front desk didn't do a good job of making us feel welcome at all and was basically quite robotic in her service attitude. We were happy to get a quiet room as requested though (but no high floor despite a mainly empty hotel). Having said this, my companion did get some *much* friendlier help at the front desk on the last day of our stay when I was struck down by food poisoning, including giving us a late check-out. When we came down on checking out I had to sit in the seats in the bar a while to recover before getting on the train, the bar staff gave us very odd looks for this which isn't what I expect from anywhere. Breakfast was better than at most London Hiltons but I urge you to avoid the restaurant in the evening - read my review of Cinnamon Restaurant and Bar. I recommend (as with all hotels that leave it on a breakfast buffet) that they research better ways of stopping bacon from becoming leathery, their strange containers don't work at all. Locationwise, it's Canary Wharf. Good for docklands, not so great for centre. The DLR is very nearby though, with an interesting little swing bridge to cross to get there.

Although I had a comfortable bed, my sleep was occasionally disturbed by the intrusive sound from the air con unit. I eventually had to get up and turn it off completely but then awoke earlier than intended, to a stuffy and warm atmosphere, not being able to open a window even if I wanted to in the middle of Winter, which I really felt like in order to breath more easily. I looked forward to my inclusive breakfast but it was spoiled by my supposed hard boiled egg pouring out over my plate as soon as I started to remove the shell ! I don't like my tea too strong but I had to ask a waiter for a fresh pot of tea with two tea bags as one in a pot, that held enough water for three cups, was a little TOO weak for me, it would have been nice to have a choice as in most other establishments of this category in preference to a 'take it or leave it' expectation. I also resented the idea of having to wait 15 minutes in the long queue for a cooked breakfast, served painfully slowly and inadequately by just two staff, and for a potential couple of hundred guests too ! I thought my dinner the previous evening was bad enough, I had the 'special offer' set menu for \u00a323+ which was 50% inedible due to Patti that tasted off and potato that had a strong taste of cooking fat that was long overdue for a change and made me feel quite sick. Having survived all that (but not without an upset tummy for two days after), I had to convince Reception that I was charged an additional \u00a34+ for something I didn't have at dinner, even though it had a completely different table number on the bill ! Nor that I had drank a small can of diet Lemonade from my minibar, such drinks of which I especially deplore due to their inclusion of harmful 'Artificial Sweeteners' (Google the detrimental health effects of Aspartame). However, for anyone whom maybe hard of hearing and not too fussy about their food or final bill accuracy, as far as London hotel prices are concerned, I consider \u00a385 room and breakfast plus \u00a320 secure parking fee not too extortionate, it's just a pity attention to detail and customer service, to me at least, appears to be very lacking and, on the whole, more reminiscent of a 3 star establishment.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood value in London\u201d", "Author": "SwedishMagnus", "ReviewID": "UR95707902", "Content": "We chose this hotel because they had a very good weekend package and because we had never stayed in Canary Wharf.

The room carpet seemed a little dated, the room was big but seemed quite empty, it seemed like it could use a little sofa or a second lounge chair.

It took us approximately an hour and 80 GBP for getting to the hotel by taxi from Heathrow airport.

Our room on the 13thfloor, great views of river and London, room is spacious and newly decorated in minimal design. The bathroom was also large and had bathtub and shower. We had breakfast at the Execytive Lounge on the 14th floor and it but it was delicious and with many choices (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, cereals, yoghurt, croissants, really nice cappuccino!) I would like to mention Maria from the concierge desk for her kindness and attention during our second evening when I came up with a bad cough and fever. She immediately sent someone to buy a thermometer (as they didn't have one!) and she was really helpful to cater for our needs. A BIG thanks to Maria and the guy (can't remember his name) who went out at 8 p.m. to buy me a thermometer!) Staff deserves congrats!!! As for the location, it is very good for Canary Wharf as well as for tourists who do not mind staying off the main London center and its hussle. Bond street is about 30 minutes by train (Jubille line) and the hotel is linked through a bridge that takes you to the Canary Wharf Underground station and shopping mall in just a few minutes.

This a a great hotel with several transport links to central London so I'd have no hesitation recommending it for business or pleasure regardless of it's location. Canary wharf is stunning if slightly soul-less and and eeriely empty at the weekends but the Hilton has a wonderful aspect and it boasts superb views over the Thames and the City. Turn right out the front door and cross the footbridge to reach Heron Quay or Canary wharf DLR stations, the lattter accessed via the shopping mall which also leads to Canary WHarf Tube station but beware that the Jubilee line is notoriously unreliable . The DLR is an excellent alternative but there is a long walk to change lines in Bank. Left and left again out the front door brings you to South Quay DLR station in seconds. London transport options are extensive but also expensive! We didn't check the river transport options but will definitely do so next time! The hotel is ultra cool and the staff are excellent. Updgrade if you can because it is well worth it for the executive lounge access alone. We were initally offered a 14th floor executive suite with large L shaped living/dining room for \u00a399 per night which plus tax was a wee bit too rich for our budget but happily when we realised that room was non-smoking they readilly \"down-graded\" us to a smoking Junior Suite which was more than adequate and at \u00a349 extra per night it was more much better value. Our base room price was \u00a3104 including taxes. The top floor suites should be cheaper. The executive lounge is wonderful. It serves a splendid breakfast buffet which includes cooked options such as bacon, sausage, scrambled egg and hash browns, as well as a massive array of cereals, fruit and pastries.Not quite the full English but much more than continental! Afternoon tea comprised cuccumber/salmon sanwhich slices and huge selection of cakes & cookies. To cap it all there is a happy hour with a free bar and hot canapes between 6 and 9pm - magnificent! Remarkably the free bar included several types of bottled beer & wine including a superb sparkling Austrailian and every type of spirits including Baileys - all pour your own. The highly attentive staff immediatley replaced any empty wine/spirits and were not at all offended if you asked them to do so - so the booze really did flow freely and thankfully only one idiot abused it. This guy desrves a special mention. He was a pig. He hogged the bubbly to the extent that he actaully drank it by the neck at one stage shortly before he and his wife were politely expelled in a quite proffessional manner. Perhaps this could've and should've happened sooner because he was clearly attracting attention and annoying all of the other guests. It wasn't until he started eating directly from the buffet with his fingers and drooling over the food that he staff finally sprank into action. None-the-les the young girl in attendance handled things with aplomb! Saturday 29th of August 2010 FYI. We wont let this incident sully our memory of the otherwise excellent ambiance in the executive lounge which was a perfect retreat from which to watch planes banking over the city as boats whisk up and down the Thames and the sun sets over Tower Bridge and the London Eye. We will return for this reason alone. This Hiltons minor faults are the extortionate internet rates at \u00a315 per day altough this is slightly negated by the three free computers in the exec lounge. Also, I booked two consecutive nights seperately when I realised my wife could accompany me and I could extend a Friday business trip through to Sunday. This caused untold, unecessary and frankly unacceptable confusion. I explained this during a FORTY minute phonecall prior to our arrival, again upon check in and AGAIN when we arrived back second day to find we'd been locked out of our room. Finally, as cash paying customers who had fully prepaid for our stay we were appalled to be asked for an additional cash deposit on the second night. We ate out and spent quite a lot of money else where as a result which probably worked out in our favour because drinks in the hotel bar are extremely expensive. None-the-less the Hitlon Canary Wharf is an excellent Hotel and we look forward to returning despite these very minor flaws. In-fact it is now our first choice destination in London!

So far, I have always liked the Hilton's I have stayed at (London Bridge and Park Lane) and the Hilton London Canary Wharf was another enjoyable place to stay in London. I would say that other than location, this is probably one of the Hilton offering the best value in London - especially if staying during the week-end. As Canary Wharf is somewhat of a business area, rooms are available at deep discounts for week-end stays As a Diamond member, I was upgraded to the executive floor. The executive lounge experience is nice with great staff and a decent assortment of food throughout the day (breakfast, tea time, dinner). I was particularily pleased with the breakfast and tea time offering. One thing that I was not too impressed with though is the iBanh service that is used for web browsing (complimentary) in the lounge. It is a bit sluggish and prone to bugs... The Hilton London Canary Wharf has a contemporary look and the rooms reflect this. Room size was good and the bathroom + amenities were superior. Although I did not use it, the hotel also features a complete gym. There are some decent views from the hotel / executive lounge and you might be able to get a few great pictures with a poweful zoom. Location is not that bad if transit is operating normally. It is less than 5 minutes from the South Quay DLR station, less than 10 minutes from the Canary Wharf tube station (Jubilee Line - which will bring you along the most major sights) and approx. 15 minutes from the Thames Clipper boats. However, if you are there during a week-end and that the Tube is shut down for repair, it could take you twice as much time to where you need to go.

I could not have been more wrong. In the two months I stayed, I had repeated trouble with their front desk staff and billing office. Their policy is to allow your bill to accumulate to a certain point and then pick an arbitrary date on which they would charge a certain amount. This is difficult for business travelers as we often have to itemize our bills and account for every expense on the date it was incurred. I explained the problems this practice was causing me to the billing office and front desk personnel and asked if they could notify me when they were going to charge me so I could prepare my finance reports. All I got in return was a blank stare and \"I'm sorry\"...no explanation or acknowledgment that this practice was causing one of their long-term guests issues. Furthermore, the billing office charged my corporate card 14 times in one day when trying to secure payment (per their idiotic billing protocols) despite my asking them to delay by 2 days so that I could secure additional credit. These 14 charges amount to well over $20,000 and caused my card to be declined for several days. Again, when I expressed my discontent, all they could offer was a blank stare and an empty \"I'm sorry\". The pros of this hotel include a decent gym and modern rooms.

I pushed the boat out and went for the King Size Executive room on the weekend rate. I booked on he Hilton website an hour before we arrived, very smooth and efficient. I didn't like the fact they add the tax on afterwards so the prices do look a bit misleading to start. The check in process was quick and easy. I could have gone direct to to the 14th floor to check in at the executive lounge but the ground floor reception was empty. Reception looked quite small and could be congested during the week but on this saturday it was fine. The onsite basement car park is \u00a320 per 24 hours on a first come first served basis. The concierge was helpful and gave us a local map and offered to point out where we wanted to go. The hotel is conveniently located for all the central Canary Wharf shops, restaurants and bars. All are a short walk away. Our room on the 14th floor was a good size, clean, new and modern. It had everything we needed, including a good view of the river and docklands skyline. A couple of small bottles of complimentary water were gratefullly received and a nice touch. The flat screen TV needs to be bigger but was adequate. TV channels were OK and included Sky Sports 1 and 2 which is an added bonus. The lighting was good and the blackout curtains were very effective on a bright sunny morning. The bed, duvet and pillows were good quality and gave a good nights sleep. The excellent bathroom was large with a separate bath tub and large shower cubicle. The toilet was a bit close to the wall at the side but this is only a minor problem. The power of the shower was a bit disappointing but it did the job. Complimentary toiletries from Crabtree and Evelyn were high quality and put to good use. Bath towels were large and fluffy, in fact too fluffy and bits came off! This is a minor fault that will presumably sort itself out. In addition there were big bath robes and slippers. We used the exec lounge for complimentary afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks. The lounge is comfortable, has great views of the city and had very pleasant and friendly staff. They could do with a few more comfy chairs as i suspect it gets busy during the business week. The food and drink selection were fine and in my opinion worth the extra cost. We used the bar on the ground floor after we had been out for a meal at Jamies Italian (see my review). The bar is a modern style and best if you can grab a comfy sofa rather than the square stools, or high bar stools which look a bit uncomfortable to a man of my age. Service was OK but they looked a bit understaffed and had to clear the table for us to it down. I assume they have more staff during the business week when it gets busy. I made the mistake of pre-paying an extra \u00a315 for the two of us to have the full breakfast in the ground floor restaurant. The exec lounge only does a continental style inclusive breakfast, or so I thought. They did actually have hash browns, bacon, sausage and scrambled egg which would have been enough for us. The full price for breakfast in the main restaurant is \u00a320.95. Call me a tight wad but that price is extortionate and the quality at best was average. I had to get my coffee replaced because it was served luke warm. Maybe a one off and the waitress did apologise. I should have asked the chef to fry some fresh eggs for me. I mistakenly took the dried up ones on display and they were not good. If they want to charge top dollar for the brekkie they need to improve the quality and choice considerably to get anywhere near value for money. If I return I would eat out or upgrade to the exec floor again. The hotel is modern and stylish and has a boutique look and feel to it. Despite one or two little niggles I would return to this hotel and upgrade to the Executive floor if I can afford it.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newbury, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat luxury in the heart of Canary Wharf\u201d", "Author": "bpbindaas", "ReviewID": "UR69049880", "Content": "I was here in July 2009 on a business trip with one of the \"high banks\".

So I have some experience with the city and hotels there. I stayed at the Hilton London Canary Wharf for six nights using a Hilton Hhonors reward. I wanted to stay at the Hilton Park Lane (where I've stayed before), but they would not guarantee me a non-smoking room, even though I tried to make the reservation seven months prior. I stayed in an executive floor room and had use of the executive lounge. The positives for this hotel are that it\u2019s quiet, the maid service is very good, and it's rather new so most things are functional. The bathroom had a separate shower and tub, which was nice. There was a safe in the room. The worst thing about the Hilton London Canary Wharf, in my opinion, is its location. I'm told that this is the new financial center for London, and if you have business here, it would be convenient. But if you're visiting London, as I was, it's a terrible location, sort of like staying in Newark to visit Manhattan. You'll waste from 15 to 30 minutes getting to and from central London to stay at this hotel. And while the area is obviously one of intense recent development, it seems to have been hit hard by the current economic downturn as most projects are stalled and there is a plethora of empty offices, storefronts, and residences. At night, the area is dead, and there is really nothing of interest for the tourist here. As for the hotel itself, it's modern, but lacks charm. It's a triumph of cold design over comfort and functionality. The lobby consists mainly of a few chairs and couches with many little ottomans appropriate for small children, but not adults. The rooms are similar, but, for London, they're fairly decent, but nothing special. The thermostat in my room did not work so I had no heat the first night, and the room was very cold. They \"fixed\" the thermostat the second day I was there, but it would only heat when turned to the maximum (24C) and then the heat would not turn off. So the room could be kept at 60F or 90F, but not between those extremes. There is very little space for putting things (other than in the closet). The bathroom has no practical hooks for towels, so I had to use the clothesline for hanging towels. Several of the towels had holes in them. There is a hairdryer supplied, but you can't use it in the bathroom because of the plug type; instead, you have to use it by the desk at the extreme opposite end of the room. There is a refrigerator, but you're not allowed to use it for any of your own items; it's only for things the hotel wants to sell you. The lights on and near the bed are impractical and difficult to read by. There is a small flat screen TV, but the picture quality of the one in my room was so bad that it was unwatchable. Internet connection is \u00a315 a day, but there's free access in the executive lounge. When I checked in, I was asked if I would like a daily newspaper, and I requested the \"Financial Times\" but I never received a paper, even though I saw them delivered to other rooms. The executive lounge is small and, with a very few exceptions, the food was mediocre at best. This lounge was nowhere as good as the one at the Park Lane, where the offerings for tea are exceptional. As for the personnel, they were a mixed bag. Some were nice and helpful, others were simply nasty. For several of them, English is a second language and I found them very difficult to understand. At no time did I think any of them cared about me or whatever I was inquiring about. I found the concierge particularly unhelpful. I've stayed in several executive rooms at Hiltons in various cities and used the executive lounges in these hotels. In my experience, the Hilton London Canary Warf is the worst of these. Overall I'm very sorry that I stayed here and I feel as if I've wasted an award stay. While I understand that different people have different expectations and interpret experiences in different ways, I could not recommend this hotel to anyone in good faith. I chose to stay here when I couldn't get a non-smoking room at the Park Lane because of the TripAdvisor reviews and ratings which, when I made the reservation, placed this hotel at #7 in London. Although the rating has now dropped considerably, it is still rated way too highly in my opinion. Having had several negative experiences at Hilton properties during the past year, I'm thinking of abandoning the Hilton program altogether, particularly as they keep raising the points for free nights. This stay was 240,000 points, and it takes some time to get this, more than this stay was worth to me. I'm also questioning the value of the reviews on TripAdvisor as all the positive reviews for the Hilton London Canary Warf make me think that I was in a different universe.", "Date": "June 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southport UK", "Title": "\u201cComfortable Hotel in a good location\u201d", "Author": "Stef1940", "ReviewID": "UR65724273", "Content": "The staff were very helpful on check-in and the rooms big clean and the bed comfortable.

Canary Wharf as a location is great too, there is a really nice shopping mall nearby with many high street shops (like Boots, Waterstones etc...) and a food court, and as a bonus at weekends it's very quiet! although during the week there are some 70,000+ workers in the area, so guess it could be a little manic!

It was very clean but I immediately noticed that the bed was quite small and low. In other Hiltons around London, the beds are very big but this was notably much smaller than the others which I was disappointed about. Another problem was that the fan kept switching itself on no matter how many times we would switch it off so throughout the night, it was very cold. Usually at breakfast, after being seated a waiter/waitress immediately offers either tea or coffee and introduces the buffet selection, however this was not the case as we waited for a while until getting fed up and eventually asked if we could have some tea. The breakfast had lots of choice of fruit/pastries/ cereals etc. however the hot food did not look very appetising. The dirty plates were not removed from our table either which meant we had very limited space. So overall the breakfast service was not up to standard.

The view wasn't the most scienic, with a lot of construction work going on, but I can't fault the hotel for that, nor was any noise heard because of it. We decided to go for the dinner and breakfast package, which we felt worked out as good value for money, at \u00a350 extra.

And the breakfast was a really excellent buffet, with something to suit all needs (the breakfast costs \u00a320 each if not prebooked). The staff were extremely helpful, especially the concierge, who can provide you with plently of transport maps, cinema times, tour intineraries and general know how. As for location, the hotel is very well served by transport links. South Quay DLR station is about a 1 minute walk from the hotel, where you can get to almost anywhere in the docklands area. Or you can walk for no more than 5 minutes to Canary Wharf tube station, from where you can get a tube directly into the city center, or if going to the o2, which is only one stop in the opposite direction. Canary Wharf is mainly a business district, but does also have many good places to shop, eat and entertain. About 5 minutes away form the hotel, is the Canada Square shopping center, which boasts many high end and budget shops and also a large Waitrose (grocery store). They also have an ice rink outside, which is great fun and costs \u00a39pp. A further 5 minutes away is Jamie's Italian (Jamie Oliver), a fantastic restaurant, at a really modest price (Main, side, drink = approx \u00a315 pp), but be aware that the restaurant does not take reservations, so a wait can be common, but worth it!

It took us only 20 minutes from bagage claim to check-in of the hotel. We were invited to check - in upstairs, since we got upgraded from standard guestroom to an executive room. The room had everything we would expect from a decent hotel room with a very good bed on the positive side but no possibility to open the window and an uninspiring view of a highrise under construction on the down side. Very surprisingly the hotel does not offer WiFi in your room, only cable connections ad GBP 15 p/day. I would like to stress though, that we were very positively surprised about the consistent very high levels of service we encountered. All members of staff we met went out of their ways to accomodate our requests concerning pE later check-outs or special requests for housekeeping. After a stressfull day, this cannot be valued enough. Location of the property is good. DLR South Quay is in front of the hotel and Canary Wharf tube station is a 5min walk via the footbridge. The nearby mall (Canada sq) has a decent amount of shops and restaurants and if you intend to self-cater there is a 24h ASDA Supermarket 8mins or 1 DLR station away.

The service was really good from the moment we stepped into the hotel to our checkout. The twin rooms, we occupied were a standard for our first stay and an executive for the return trip. Both types of rooms were good and spacious. The beds were comfortable but the mattresses were thinner than some of the other Hilton hotels we stayed in the USA. The bathroom in the standard room had a glass door in place of a shower curtain and one had to push out the glass door in order to step in or out of the tub. It appeared a bit tricky initially to whether to push the glass door in or out of the tub and how to support oneself after a shower. However, once we got over the first shower, it was alright. In the executive room, there was a separate shower and a bathtub. Just an observation though not a problem for us ( we sleep late at night), was one evening we heard footsteps coming from above our executive room on the 13th floor. On checking we found that our room was below some private rooms in the corridor next to the 14th floor executive lounge. If you are a light sleeper, avoid being assigned those few rooms. The staff we encountered from the people manning the concierge desk, reception, executive lounge and ground floor restaurant were not only helpful, friendly and warm toward us but were also perceived to be \"nice and helpful\" to each other. People could be professional and go about doing their jobs but the staff here appeared to be really working as a team. At the reception area one evening, I saw a guest who had just arrived being greeted warmly by a staff member from the concierge desk. However, the guest was really rude and ignored the staff member, who just smiled and went back to the desk. I thought that encounter was handled very well by the staff member, who probably did not take it personally. There was a good spread for breakfast and lots of fruits during our stay. There was access to the Executive Lounge throughout the day until 11 pm with snacks, drinks and free internet access when we stayed in the executive room. The DLR South Quay is situated next to the hotel and is convenient for trips to the Docklands area. The Tube is about 5 to 7 minutes walk away... a short walk from the hotel, over a footbridge and into Jubilee Place and across the road to the station to take the Jubilee Line. The short walk was more enjoyable on days when it was not so windy. On windy days, we took the DLR from South Quay to Heron Quays just one stop away and changed to the Tube or vice versa on coming back to the hotel. This was because we used the Oyster cards which allowed us to make unlimited trips, capped at a certain amount daily. The DLR stations are not manned and one must not forget and just get on the train without tapping the card at the \"Touch In/Out\" buttons. We were also told to place the card over the \"Touch in/out\" button at the DLR stations for at least 2 seconds for it to register, when one of our cards did not validate at the South Quay DLR station. The location of the hotel is quiet, away from noise and crowd of Central London. It is a fairly long ride by Dot2Dot to and from Heathrow Airport but we enjoyed the sightseeing along the way.\"", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, Virginia", "Title": "\u201c#1 choice to stay on our next visit to London\u201d", "Author": "ZetaOne", "ReviewID": "UR31436627", "Content": "My husband and I traveled for two weeks on vacation in Europe.

Out of all Hiltons in London this is likely in the Top 3. Still not quite 5 stars as such since in my books those are reserved for those \u00dcber Luxury pampering hotels such as Peninsula or Four Seasons. IMHO a bit too far away to really compete with central London hotels as such, but this one is far superior to Hilton Docklands nearby. Review is based on one night stay in May\u201909 (background of spending 80+ nights per year in different hotels around the globe) Location: Personally I would say this is a little bit too far from the \u201cnormal\u201d sights of central London such as Oxford Street, British Museum etc. Also Heathrow is quite a long way from here. If the intention is to use the City Airport (maybe 15min DLR light railway ride away) and spend time in o2 Arena or Greenwich then of course the location is really ideal. Nearby is Canary Wharf mall, a couple of pubs and restaurants. Room: As HHonors Diamond member I was upgraded to an Executive Floor room in 13th floor which was OK size (globally speaking, big in London standards), very modern and spotlessly clean (as was the rest of the hotel). Welcome package included two bottles of water and a small selection of sweets. Bathroom was quite large with separate sections for bath and shower. Some noise from the DLR train even in 13th floor since the DLR track is basically hugging the hotel wall, apart from that there was very little noise. Service: The Executive Lounge was quite big and had a relatively good offering, including warm \u201clight evening buffet\u201d with rather large assortment of different complimentary alcohol beverages (between 6pm and 9pm). Lounge offers some nice views from the 14th floor towards Thames and central London sights such as London Eye. A special honorable mention must be given to the lounge for serving also the wonderful London Pride in addition to the normal tasteless bulk lager beers, first time ever in any Hilton Lounge! Check-in and check-out handled in the lounge. Etc: Breakfast in the lounge was quite OK, better and more extensive selection than in many other lounges encountered so far. Obviously downstairs in the \u201creal breakfast\u201d there likely would be more selection but for me this one did its job just fine. Didn\u2019t try restaurant or gym so cannot comment them.

The main area had the double bed which was really comfortable, a desk, a lounge chair and a flatscreen tv as well as two double wardrobes and ironing facilities. There were the usual tea and coffee making facilities as well as a minibar which we didn't use as it was quite expensive. Be warned that the minibar is computerized and if you move or take out an item you are automatically charged for it. I made this mistake but went and told the lady on reception who was very understanding and said she would remove the charge for us (I don't think I am the only person who has done this!) The location of the hotel is really close to Canary Wharf and it restaurants and bars although the hotel also has its own bar and restaurant which we didn't use only to have our breakfast. The breakfast is fantastic with a huge variety of food on offer including a full english, toast, cereals, yoghurts, fruit, the list goes on! I was really impressed that the food was colour coded so that you could see what was high in fat, low in carbs etc. Overall our experience at this hotel was super, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were fantastic. I would say that if you want to be nearer to the sights then you would probably be better off staying in the centre of london as this hotel is nearer for the O2 than say the London eye having said this, there are very good transport links to the centre of london and all its attractions.

Price... Hilton were having a half price sale so we treated ourselves, it was 99 GBP per night, not per person.This price was for an Executive room over a weekend for 2 people. (One tip is check at lastminute.com they tend to have the best prices despite Hilton itself saying its full). Location... The Hilton it does say its situated at Canary Wharf but...if you are getting the DLR (Docklands Light Railway -its free to use with an underground pass) get the DLR to South Quay. The DLR South Quay railway is right next door to this hotel. It takes about 8 minutes to get to Greenwich or in the other direction about 15 minutes to get to Covent Garden/London Kings Cross. The Check In We went to the desk downstairs at midday despite check in not being until 3pm. Thankfully our room was ready and we signed some documents downstairs and we sent upstairs to the executive lounge for priority check in. At the executive lounge, floor 14, we were shown around and had our lounge privlages explained to us (in broken English). *room deposit warning<One thing I do need to point out is, they need to take a 100GBP deposit for the room for if you have room service or take anything out of the mini bar. We don't have a credit card so this money was taken off our debit card. We were on a tight budget so that 100 was earmarked for our spending in London so in effect we were 100 GBP down. We were told it would be credited to our bank account when we checked out, however it took over 48 hours to reach our account> Our room We were in room 1308. It was a twin room, it had small lcd tv, reading lamps, main lights, comfortable seating, office area and also a view to the docklands and river to the left. There was a mini bar, tea and coffee making facilities (with a teapot!). In the bathroom there was a sink,bath and seperate shower, lots of Crabtree and Evelyn toilteries. White towels were provided aswell as waffle dressing gowns and slippers. Every evening our beds were turned down, new dressing gowns placed on the bed along side the slippers on the floor and chocolates on the pillow. There was also sparkling and still water complimentary also. Very comfortable beds, pillows a bit soft for me. From our room we did not hear any sound from the nearby DLR. (When compared with a bedroom downstairs, a double the double was only slighly larger and had a better view of the docklands river. The bed also had scatter cushions on it 1217.) Room Service <price 3.50 GBP per room service> We decided to order room service, an anti-pasta and a Chinese/Thai soup. My husband wanted an egg stired into his soup and the kitchen team were fine with that. Unfortunately our order arrived but we recieved penne pasta not the anti-pasta. We called down and explained. The head chef called us back to apologise, he gave us a free glass of white wine to make up for it and the new anti-pasta plate was there within 10 minutes. I would have prefered more bread with the anti-pasta but I like my bread. The food that was served was delicious and the catering team very accomodating of our requests. The waiting staff was very professional also in coming into our room <and didn't look agast at the state it was-we're very messy!> Executive lounge Our room included breakfast at this lounge or in the Cinnamon restaurant downstairs. We took it downstairs. The executive lounge has free computers and wifi. Aswell as comfortable chairs and dining areas. During the day soft drinks and tea/coffee with biscuits are available. 3-5pm afternoon tea is put out- one or two to different sandwiches and 2 different cakes aswell as dried fruit and nuts. No scones however. Again soft drinks and tea/coffee/ hot chocolate. Between 6-9pm alcoholic drinks are available free of charge (at no other times are they available) crisps, olives, nuts, dried fruit are set out also. I would have preferred alcholic drinks to be available the majority of the day as in other executive lounges I have been to. Also possibly more comfortable seating areas just four sofas for the whole room. The executive lounge team were very accomodating when we brought two guests in for a late afternoon meeting. They throughly looked after us all, clearing our tables and topping up the teapots! Breakfast Our breakfast was included with price we ate downstairs for it. When we arrived for breakfast we were shown to a table and brought tea and coffee as well as orange juice. There was a vast buffet... sausage,black pudding, haggis, scrambled egg, fried egg, bacon, beans, tomatoes, waffles. cold meats, smoked salmon or smoked makeral, smoothies, three different yogurt types, meusli and granola breads, croissants, danish pastries, muffins, fresh fruit of mango, pawpaw, melon, oranges, fruit compote, strawberries. Five different cereals and five different fruit juices. I think the Hilton claims they have 150 items on their breakfast buffet, I didn't count but there was more than enough to satisfy the majority of appetites be it business, leisure, low fat, children or special occasion. There was also a menu you could order from if you wanted something cooked to order this included kippers, porridge, poached eggs, waffles and eggy bread. We went at 8am both mornings and we didn't feel rushed and there were only about 10-20 guests there. Although on a Sunday the hotel advises you to go down early as its at its busiest between 8.30 and 10am. The Gym We did not use the gym/sauna or steam room. If you want to use these, tell reception when you check in so your key can be activated. Business Centre The hotel does have a business centre with computers/fax machine available this is avaible on floor 1. Close By Within a 5-10 minute walk is a fantastic dim sum/chinese restaurant called The Lotus Floating Chinese Restaurant (just google), they have a set lunch Mon-Fri for 11 GBP which includes a platter of various starters, main course and dessert. There are also other eateries including Cafe Rouge and Wagamamas close by. With the DLR being on the doorstep you can get to any area of London quickly and easily although obviously don't go during rush hour if you can. A day pass on the DLR and tube is about 5 GBP for zones 1 and 2 which is great value if you are exploring London on a budget. If you have some spare time over your visit and you're a foodie, go to Borough Market open Thurs,Fri, Sat -London Bridge Station tube. Fantastic for organic and specilist foods It was a very good stay and the concierge was very informative on the local area. The location was very good as it was away from the fast pase of the city. The only things which made me mark the hotel down were the 100 GBP deposit and the alcholic drinks only available at certain times in the lounge and the very poor selection of food in the executive lounge.

I booked it with the 50% discount in january, but even with the normal rates this hotel is worth every penny!

Not only do these have a bot more room and bigger bathrooms, but also you get acces to the executive lounge, which was a real gem! ROOM: our room was extremely spacious for London standards! Cosy king size bed, free coffee and tea making facilities, slippers and robes, minibar, room service menu, free newspaper en free bottle of water every day. Also turn down service some nights. LOUNGE: thi is the real plus side: in this lounge they serve breakfast but also snacks and drinks for free! Well worth the upgrade fee! During the day they had biscuits and cookies out, fruit and you could make coffe or tea of just grab from the fridge with sodas. Around 3pm, they made for High Tea with sanwiches and cakes. After 6 pm they put out hot snacks, cold snacks, cheese and crackers, potatoe chips, fruit and nuts. AND in the evening also alcoholic beverages could be picked, for example Corona, other beers, wines, liqours. Apart from the free drinks and bites, we loved spending time in the lounge because of the coziness, quietness and the awesome view over London, especially nice in the evenings. Now, for people who spend every minute out and about, this lounge might not be worht it for you (closes pretty early on weekends, 9 pm) But if you are like us, and like to spend some time in the hotel, just relaxing and lounging, this is a must! LOCATION: Canary Wharf is up and coming. Sure, it is a 15 - 20 minute DLR ride from Bank to South Quay, or you can go via the underground, but it is a nice area in itself too. Not only for the O2, but also the area itself is nice. Visit the malls near the hotel, the terraces on South India Quays, stroll alongside the water, wtach the hustle and bustle of financial London. A great Indian restaurant is just alongside the hotel. Lots of nice restaurants in the neighborhood. But: if you are a great clubber maybe you should consider being more centrally located. The hotel is really no further than 5 mins walking from the underground, if you ask the porter/concierge, they will tell you how to walk easily. And if you want, the DLR station is NEXT to the hotel, so even closer. STAFF: that was also a real 5 star experience! The staff of this hotel is very friendly and extremely helpfull. The concierge guy downstairs always was happy to help, give tips, draw maps of where to go, arrange taxis etc. The lounge itself has also a staff member which went out of their way for us. FURTHERMORE: the breakfast was by far the most elaborate I have had. And you could even order more stuff, so we did order pancakes and they were nice and freshly made for us. A convenient system was in place for people to pick healthy of low sodium, or low cholestorol options etc. The fitness and business facilities we have not used, but looked good. Overall the hotel was spotless and nice, airy and roomy. I really can not find anything wrong with this hotel, but keep in mind that we are not big party people and we did not mind some public transport to get to and fro the city.

Staff: Professional, friendly and outgoing. Transportation: Very easy, with the DLR rail stop directly outside whisking you into the popular neighborhoods of central London in 10-20min.

We got the Underground to Canary Wharf which was ok. There was some maintenance work being done on some of the Underground lines which meant it was a bit tricky. We had to get on the Northern line which took a while for us to grasp but once we got our bearings we were fine. This would have been easy on the metropolitan line if it were not for the maintenance work. You walk through a shopping precinct at the Canary Wharf underground stop to get to the hotel; there is an exit for the hotel by paper chase. You cross a bridge over the Thames and the hotel is there on your left. The entrance is very modern and clean. We arrived at the hotel at around 1, as check-in was 4 we were apprehensive of if we were ok to check-in. The reception said our room was ready and we got our card and headed to the eighth floor. The room was very spacious and had a nice bathroom. It took us a while to figure it out but if you turn the tap right the bath works and if you turn it left the shower comes on. We went shopping in the precinct after checking in and had some dinner at one of the caf\u00e9\u2019s there are plenty of shops as you go through for all your needs. There is also a Krispy Kreme donut shop which is well worth a trip especially for the apple and cinnamon flavour. We had booked to see the Lion King that evening and once we were changed we headed back to the underground and after about 15 minutes we arrived at our stop and it was very painless. There is a flat screen TV in the room which is handy when you\u2019re waiting for your girlfriend to get ready. There is also a writing desk and chair so you can relax. The hotel also included breakfast which had a full fry up, cereals, fruit and tea, coffee etc. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants easy access to central London without staying in the hustle and bustle of the city centre.

I was initially concerned about the fact that the hotel was a little out of the way, but having travelled thee it was no more than 15 minutes away from London Waterloo by Jubilee line. The area surrounding the hotel reminded me alot of the La Defense area of Paris. The buildings are stunning, especially when lit up at night and the river runs through the middle. There is a large plush shopping centre adjacent to Canary Wahrf station and many restaurants, pizzerias and bars within the immediate vicinity. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were seen immediately by reception staff who were pleasant, hepful and courteous throughout. We were given the keycards to our room on the third floor and made our way up in one of the three lifts. Adjacent to the reception area was a restaurant which was modern, spacious and looked extremely nice! The room itself was airy, bright, clean and modern. Upon entering, the bathroom was on the left complete with complimentary towels, shower accessories and even some scales!! The bedroom itself was brilliant, better than in any of the photos on the site! There was a widescreen freeview tv, free tea, coffees and water as well as the option of room service and breakfast the following day. Both myself and my girlfriend were extremely impressed with the hotel and both agreed it was of very high quality. I would recommend this hotel to people of all ages due to its fantastic location and top quality rooms.

There was also a good choice of cereals and breads. The bar is average price for a city hotel and had a good choice of cocktails and snacks. We didn\u2019t use the restaurant (some nearby places were cheaper) but the menu looked good. The bar area is open plan and minimalist, with big comfy sofas \u2013 very pleasant. As for location, this hotel is not in the centre of London, but out to the east in the modern financial district. It is a few mins walk from the tube station (Jubilee line \u2013 takes about 15 mins to South Bank), and about 15 mins walk from the river taxi (which is an excellent method for getting to London Embankment or across to Greenwich). There is a seemingly endless amount of shops, fast food outlets, and cafes in the nearby (underground) shopping mall, where weekdays you can mix with London\u2019s financial whizz kids from the Canary Wharf buildings. Not to be overlooked for eating out is the small array of restaurants along the water\u2019s edge at Westferry Circus (where the river taxi stop is) \u2013 especially nice at night when you can see the lights of the City buildings reflected in the water.

If there is anything negative to say about the hotel it is that it is located right beside the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station (South Quay) \u2013 a real boon when you don\u2019t want to walk anywhere, but slightly annoying for noise when the trains start up in the early morning \u2013 I imagine this could be more of a problem if your room is on a low floor facing the elevated line, but for us it wasn\u2019t really noticeable.

The bathroom was spacious and clean with separate bath and shower. We went back to the executive lounge for the happy hour (from 6:00 till 8:00 p.m.), with all kinds of alcoholic drinks for free. The quality of the food presented with it was surprisingly good, with a variety of cold and hot items. There were even healthy snacks, grilled vegetables on a stick. In the lounge are two computers available for free Internet. We had an arrangement with breakfast and dinner. For the dinner they offer a 3-course meal and we could make a choice of about six for each course. The food was absolutely delicious and also service here was great. On both evenings Geerjanneke from the Netherlands and Hoon from South Korea served us, two enthusiastic young persons with the proper skills and dignity. There is a good wine selection, the first evening we had a bottle or red wine, the second we made our choice by the glass. It was expensive, but not extremely and the quality was very good. Only the tables are rather small in the restaurant. On return we found our bed prepared, two bathrobes and slippers and some chocolates. Breakfast was outstanding as well; we had it in the Cinnamon restaurant with our arrangement. What we saw in the executive lounge was also good. Going to Greenwich with the Maritime Museum and Royal Observatory is very easy; the station for the DLR (sort of light rail) is next to the hotel. Also going to the center of London is no problem, with the Jubilee line it is only about 12 minutes to Westminster station (Big Ben, Changing of the Horse Guards etc.). As I mentioned before we had a superb weekend and would choose this hotel whenever we would be in London again. Also rates are very reasonable during weekends, the DBB rate is very attractive.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent - surprisingly spacious\u201d", "Author": "Naniwa", "ReviewID": "UR19570526", "Content": "Stayed here for a meeting and was pleasantly surprised.

The rooms are large and comfortable, and a nice touch is that bottled water is waiting in the room when you arrive, and replenished on our second day. The price of the bottled water in the hotel has been commented on elsewhere, but if you ask the restaurant staff for \"tap water\" they will happily oblige. We loved the buffet dinner which was included as part of our room deal for the first night - possibly the best buffet I've ever seen with a wonderful selection of starters, main courses and desserts. Having just returned from a holiday in the States where healthy eating was not high on the agenda, it was great to be able to help myself to a variety of fresh vegetables and fruit. It was also nice to help myself to two desserts! The service at the restaurant was good. We were so impressed with the dinner buffet, we opted to dine in the hotel again on our second night. The breakfasts have been commented on in other reviews, and I have to agree they are great. A great selection of cereals, full cooked breakfast and a large choice of fruit and continental-style breakfasts, and loads of cakes and pastries. Absolutely fantastic. We had a couple of problems during our stay, but these were dealt with in such a professional and courteous manner, it would be harsh to even mention them. A few of the other reviews have raised points I'd like to cover... The hotel, in my opinion, is not difficult to find. It is right next to South Quay DLR station, and just a short stroll from Canary Wharf tube station. I didn't have my stopwatch with me, but I find it hard to believe it was even a 5-minute walk, it is literally just round over a footbridge and then through a building's foyer. There is certainly no need to get a taxi from the hotel to the station, as one reviewer said! The restaurant is not like a caf\u00e9. I found it to be a stylish place to eat, wih fantastic food and excellent staff. There is a safe in the bedroom, and whenever I was around the hotel entrance there were at least two members of staff on duty, so I don't know why security should be an issue. The only time we were aware of the DLR noise was when drinking in the bar on the ground floor. We didn't hear anything from our bedroom, and weren't even aware of it in the restaurant although I guess you probably can hear it from there if you listen out for it. I find it quite funny that two constant themes seem to crop up in reviews for this hotel - firstly, that it is not conveniently located and is a walk to the Jubilee line station, and then secondly that it is too noisy because it is situated next to a DLR station. I used to live in the docklands area, and loved using the DLR. Jubilee line might be quicker, but the DLR is so much nicer as the trains run mostly above ground.

Both times I started the week with breakfast in the hotel - and after seeing what it costs, I decided to pick up breakfast in one of the shops in the underground shopping center that runs under the office buildings. I do have to say that the hotel was extremely generous with an ultra-late check out (5pm-ish) for a very minimal charge. This made a huge difference as it allowed me to relax, workout, shower, etc. in the comfort of my private room before departing on the very long haul back to Australia (and work would not have paid for an additional night for this purpose). I would request this hotel again for this reason if I went back to Canary Wharf for work and this is the reason why I'm giving it an above average.

The Friday evening buffet style dinner also came as part of an excellent value - pay in advance package - with a great variety of starters mains and puds. As usual the bottled water was way over priced,but as the rest of the food and service was so good this seems a minor moan to be expected in all city hotels unfortunately. A previous reviewer is right in that the area all around Canary Wharf is a building site at the moment -but the rooms are so comfortable to sleep in with good size TV and generous beverage tray - and most people who visit London do not stay around the hotel all day looking out of the window. The DLR station is right opposite the hotel and all the lines were working fine when we were visiting. You can be in the greenery at Greenwich within a few stops or to the Tower of London in 10 to 15 minutes - just be careful which train you get on - the instructions are a little confusing but this is not the fault of the Hilton. The station is not manned so an oyster card would save a lot of confusion with tickets if you are there for a few days. The Hilton staff are young, smiling and efficient. However, I will be contacting the hotel to suggest that they add more local maps and knowledge to their information base - nobody could give us information as to where our friends holiday townhouse was - just two or three blocks away -and we had to go ask a local estate agent! These are just small niggles which did not spoil our stay - the towels and bathrobes were replaced each day - I dropped the shower head - the taxi we ordered arrived in 3 minutes flat - a brand new estate . Just a note if you are driving to the hotel - they have garaging but due to the one ways and constuction work around there seems absolutely no parking elsewhere and and our cab from Kings Cross could not find it - so you will need good directions too.

This was an excellent deal and great value for money. Our meal on the Friday night was a buffet and it was lovely, plenty of starters, main courses and deserts to choose from and as much as you want to eat. At breakfast there was everything you could possibly think of, it was fantastic and kept us going all day! The hotel itself is very modern, we had a standard double room which was huge! It was really nicely furnished and the bathroom was lovely. Both spotlessly clean. I rate the standard of this hotel very highly, I really felt like it was a weekend of luxury. The staff are so nice and friendly and always greet you with a smile. Towels were changed every day and they have a turndown service. We came back in the evening to find the curtains drawn, bed turned down, little chocolates on the pillow and bottles of water on the table which are complimentary. When we arrived there was a bottle of still and a bottle of sparkiling water on the table which was complimentary. When the come in to turn down your bed they provide more if you have used what is there. This was a really nice touch. We chose this hotel because it was close to the O2 Dome, where we were seeing Prince (who was great!). It's an ideal location for the Dome, as the Jubilee line is a couple of minutes walk from the hotel and the Dome is only 1 stop away. Canary Wharf is a really nice area with a shopping mall, bars and restaurants nearby and the area itself felt very safe. Some people mentioned that it's a bit out of London, but we didn't find this a problem. It's a lovely area to stay in and with the tube station so closeby you can be in the centre of London in no time. We flew into London City Airport and took the DLR (Docklands Light Railway) to South Quay which is just outside the hotel. If you're going out and about buy a day pass for the tube, this day pass includes the use of the DLR. Our friends drove into London on the Friday morning, parked at the hotel car park, which is locked up and completely secure, and didn't leave until 5pm on Sunday and they were only charged for 2 days at \u00a315 per day. We had a fantastic time staying at this hotel and I would definitely stay here again. I recommend it to everyone. The only thing I was suggest is to ask for a high floor, as the DLR runs alongside the hotel and I would think that you would hear a bit of noise from this if you were on a lower floor, we were on the 11th Floor and didn't hear it at all.
