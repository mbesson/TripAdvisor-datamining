Last year turkish great hotel chain company \"dedeman\" release this hotel to the best western. Before releasing hotel had acceptable management even, over the expectations. After best western took control of management hotel staff did not change but their mentality changed. They are look like a summer intern and do not care about anything. Staff's skill terrible and they are rude. Tea and coffee smells chlorine from the water. I asked them to control their waters and tea smells chlorine. One staff answered me i dont know because i did not do tea. Also extra bed is about the 150 cm. Its like a comedy and the bed sizes looks like children's bed but its NOT !!! :O Never go there !!", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel if you want a short getaway!\u201d", "Author": "Seda_au", "ReviewID": "UR115889788", "Content": "We have enjoyed our stay at Best Wetern Sile Gardens Hotel. The service from reception to the restaurant and the cleaners were all great with helpful and smily staff... The only problem we had was with one of the staff members which we highly disapprove that person Mr. KUMSAL to be representing the hotel. He has used our good intentions to his own way to earn some extra money by giving us miss information. For that reason i will think about coming back to this hotel twice. But for everyone else I would like to give big thanks for their great service.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "norfolk", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel great pool friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "NorfolkMum", "ReviewID": "UR81638275", "Content": "We hired acar and drove from the airport in Istanbul to the Dedeman. When we turned off the main road we worried it looked like we were driving down a track to no where. But what a suprise a lovely hotel great staff wonderful views of the Black Sea even if it was a 15 min walk to the beach but than this is Turkey and we were not allowed to cross a track need the hotel which would have meant a 5min walk. In the indoor pool you have to wear a swim hat but outside no hat needed. The food was great very good choice at breakfast. Iam sure the fact that my partner is Turkish really helped to make this a great stay as I did not hear anyone speaking English.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antwerpen", "Title": "\u201cdisaster in Sile\u201d", "Author": "Dutchie4050", "ReviewID": "UR69422658", "Content": "Because there are a few guests It looks like a ghost hotel.
