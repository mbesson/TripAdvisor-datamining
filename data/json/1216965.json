At first I had a room that I didn't know it was a triple. I was on my own and that space was probably just enough for me! Furniture and bathroom very modern, a big shower. It all depends on the kind of trip you're doing. I won't suggest it for sure to people coming from the opposite side of the world, with big heavy luggage as there's not even space where to put them. It could be fine for a couple staying for a few days only, for a weekend, expecting not be able to walk around the room!!! Kitchenette is fine for 2 people, to have something light, to have breakfast. The triple studio has got a full double bed+a single bed pushed together. The double studio has a bed which is slightly smaller than a double. It's about 74 inches long so be ready to have your feet out at night. Drafts of air passing through the window but you can low the curtain and usually rooms are warm enough even if heating doesn't seem to work properly. In the first studio the heating control panel displayed EE, that, written just below it, meant there was an error. Same thing for the second studio, but the one in the bathroom was not working in this case. BUT, as I already wrote the room was always warm enough. A lot of soap and towels provided such as glasses and dishes etc... Fast Wifi also provided even if when it was out of order and I just went to ask the secretary if she knew it was having problems she didn't even look at me saying that nobody complained about it..... Same thing when the lift was temporary stuck on floor 1 as I have been waiting for a while, she just told me that probably somebody was getting off on that floor. She didn't care at all. If you have problems try to talk with the man that is at reception, much worthed!!!! Good good location, just a few steps from 3 lines of tube and from beautiful Hyde Park. Last problem could be that the fire system works in all building, in each single room. So each time some smoke reaches it in any way, you'll have to wake up and run downstairs and nothing happens....I think fire system is very useful but this way I had to run 3 times, twice at half past midnight and once at 9 in the morning. Annoying if you're sleeping. I would suggest it anyway to those who can adapt to possible small inconveniences.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cCertainly no magic in this stay\u201d", "Author": "Alan S", "ReviewID": "UR123189783", "Content": "The 3 bed studio was the size of single hotel room with a single bed squeezed up against a double with no access to the double from either side. the room as so small that we could not get all the luggage and ourselves in.

Well,it is hidden in the wardrobe so u cant really cook a big meal. It is fine for cooking something quick and small. Good news, they fixed the lift just 2 days before our departure, which was 3rd November :-)) I read few complaints about the noise as well. It is an old english building so well u can hear your neigbhours sometimes, so they will hear you probably. Not a big issue really.

Check in was fine at 43 hotel next door. Staff was not giving everyone the cold shoulder, as if they do not care whether you do business with them or not. Not that we paid a lot, but $150 a night is still not super cheap. Bathroom looks modern, but plumbing sucks. Everynight we would have to turn on the water, wait for 5 minutes before any water would come out and for it to warm up. As for the bed, it's a really really cheap bed and very uncomfortable. First two nights, I couldn't fall asleep because of that. Also another weird thing is that the hotel room does not even have a phone. Which hotel in the 21st century does not have a telephone??? The walls are super thing too. There was a young Italian backpacker next door and I was able to hear every word they said. That said, a couple pros. The linens and towels were clean.

Yes, it is conveniently located but with such good transportation you can stay somewhere a little bit away from Oxford street - try Kensigton or City or Westminster area.

I had booked the 39 Suites through a third party site, central-london-apartments.com. They had phoned me the day before I was supposed to be there to tell me that the credit card had declined when 39 Suites had tried to authorise a night's stay prior to my arrival. I must admit I gone a little crazy with it that week (it being my birthday, the reason for this weekend away) so I wasn't suprised. I gave central-london-apartments another set of credit card details which went through fine, and they sent me an amended reservation. That was Thursday 25th. As I say, I got there on the Friday 26th and reception couldn't find my reservation. It turned out that when they received the same amended reservation with the new card details they had cancelled it instead. After much to-ing and fro-ing, them calling central-london-apartments.com then telling me that they were fully-booked and that there was nothing they could do, they finally find my amended reservation, with the word \"cancelled\" through it that one of their staff had done. They realised it was their mistake and miraculously found me a studio, what I had originally booked. I was given room S15 on the third floor, just behind the lift. The rooms aren't very big and it really is only suitable for one person, two is a squeeze. I don't know if it was just my room or what, but where to start. The closet/wardrobe was a tall thin unit, with a mirrored front which was cracked and broken. It was unsuitable to put your suitcase in. There were no shelves and it contained maybe two hangers. It did have a safe inside which was handy. The bed, although fine mattress-wise, had no mattress protection cover on it that you get at most hotels, just one thin flat sheet that kept on coming loose as I slept. So you can imagine all the bed bugs inside the mattress. All the faucets were loose from their fittings. The shower faucet, the sink faucet and even the little kitchen sink faucet. The blind at the window was broken so I couldn't raise or lower it if I wanted. Luckily it was a hot weekend so I didn't mind having the blind down to keep cool. You can tell the apartments were hastily made and put together with cheap labour and fittings. There were also dark water stains above the door and along the exterior wall. Not brilliant. Even one of the spotlights in the ceiling was coming loose. And don't laugh, but the toilet was too high off the floor. It's one of those more contemporary built-in toilets, not a traditional one with a cistern, so it was built too high into the wall. I was actually perched on tippy-toes when sitting down, if you know what I mean. And I'm 5ft 10ins so that's saying something. The location was fantastic. Around the corner from Hyde Park with the nearest tubes being Queensway (Central line) and Bayswater (Circle and District line). Queensway was very handy for going shopping at Westfield Shopping Mall, Bayswater was handy for the Museum of Natural History and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Lots of shops, restaurants, bureau de changes nearby. The little Tesco's directly across the Bayswater tube was very handy. I didn't let the state of the apartment deter me though. A bit of shopping, a bit of culture, plus music (Glastonbury) on the telly and I had a fantastic weekend on my own. All in all, I loved the location, not too impressed with the apartment. I'd stay in the area again if I want another weekend away from home, but I won't stay at 39 Suites.
