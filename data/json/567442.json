This Pension is no way near the standard of a good hostel, the room looked nothing like those online, the room was tiny and the bathroom stunk of drains. the bed was ok but from sitting on the bed I could touch any wall it was that small. The furniture was low standard MDF from the late 80s and the safe could be picked up and moved. No wifi as stated, breakfast unless you were up at 8am a very limited choice. My advise dont go find somewhere else to stay. It has a good location, but for the price dont believe the photos or the information supplied by the owner.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SC", "Title": "\u201cABC Berlin was a good deal\u201d", "Author": "KandC40", "ReviewID": "UR7818923", "Content": "ABC does not take credit cards, but that was made clear to us on check-in. The breakfasts were some of the best of our 3 week stay in Europe; the only place with fried and scrambled eggs. Parking was behind a locked gate - both safe and free. The host suggested a very interesting Turkish restaurant near the hotel. The food was good and inexpensive. The Chinese place near it was also good.", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Pension ABC", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d567442-Reviews-Pension_ABC-Berlin.html", "Price": "$68 - $130*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kurfurstenstrasse 20</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10785</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "567442", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/48/79/4879b560f6d446d4d508c5ef5ad15bc11large.jpg"}}
