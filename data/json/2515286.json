Nestled on a tree-lined street just tucked away from the main road, La Villa is a newish boutique hotel that encompasses Parisian chic and warmth. The entrance/reception to the hotel is rather non-descript, and there are at least 3 other similar hotels on the same block on Rue de Jacob, but La Villa comes across as one of the newer ones. I like hotels that are understated, minimalist, spotless yet with an eye to detail. La Villa is all that. The room itself is a cosy size, with a small bathroom that has a bath-tub and a designer sink - try and figure out where the water come out from! Our room has a French window that overlooks the street - just your typical view of your typical Parisian side-street, but for the Francophiles, this oozes charm only the way Paris can. The room itself was spotless. The only thing was that our of the 40 or so TV channels, only about 2 (BBC and CNN) were in English - but that's France! Being a small boutique hotel, La Villa has a tiny bar next to the reception and a breakfast area in the basement. For the price of breakfast, I'd highly recommend heading to the many cafes and restaurants nearby. The location of the hotel couldn't be better. Away from the hustle and bustle of main street Blvd St Germain, but there are a number of cosy cafes just outside the hotel (and a tea-room that sells amazing macaroons right opposite). We discovered a quaint little Parisian restaurant that does amazing food (du Pied de Fouet) just round the corner. A couple of minutes walk from the hotel and you get to the heart of St Germain des Pres, with many bars, restaurants and cafes with al fresco dining set up just for people watching. I forgot just how walkable Paris is. It's easier to wander around on foot than to battle the maze of the metro. A 20 minute walk will get you to the Latin Quarter, where plenty of cafes and restaurants abound for which are considerably less expensive than St Germain. All in all, I loved this little gem of a hotel, and will most definitely stay in it again.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "glasgow", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location and Stylish Decor\u201d", "Author": "glasgow77", "ReviewID": "UR122484276", "Content": "Stayed for three nights over new year. On arrival we were told there were problems with the rooftop room we had booked and we were therefore upgraded to a junior suite. Suite was lovely - seperate sleeping area and sitting area, quite modern. On the 5th floor and was really quiet at night despite being so central. Only minor negatives I have with the room were that the small bottles of mineral water by the bed which were there on arrival were never replaced (for the cost of the room would really have expected that) and the over-bath shower in the bathroom was a bit dated and not that powerful and the bath quite high and difficult to climb in and out of. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel so can't comment on that. Did have drinks in the bar on a couple of evenings. Once service was excellent and the next night think we may have been served by someone who wasn't used to working behind the bar as he wasn't sure what gins they stocked and served it with no ice and no lime/lemon. Other than that staff in the hotel were all friendly and helpful despite our very rusty french! Would definitely recommend this hotel.

The rooms are spotless, modern, chic and have double glazed windows that you can open for fresh air.

It is a little noisy with the windows open but this did not disturb us that much and much preferred to sacrifice a little street noise for fresh air. However, I have to confess that it is the location of this hotel that I absolutely love the most. Right in the heart of the Left Bank, easy walking to the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower and the center of Paris. Great streets to explore and stroll through, soaking up the atmosphere. Great cafes, boulangeries, restaurants, art galleries and shops all around - so you are never short of somewhere to stroll to and have a meal, snack or drink.

We took the Eurostar service from the new St. Pancras terminal and found the journey simple, fast and so much better than flying. We had originally booked another hotel in an area close to Les Halles, but having been put off by negative reports on the neighbourhood decided to look for somewhere in St. Germain des Pres. Leaving it to the last minute (just over a day before departure) our options were slightly reduced and after much internet searching we found that La Villa St. Germain could offer us a superior room at a reduced price of \u20ac 230 (regularly \u20ac 285). We happily booked this and are we glad that we did. I had requested that they give us the best room at the price quoted because it was a special occasion and on arrival the charming receptionist showed us to a junior suite (normal quoted price \u20ac 445) which she said that they would like us to have for our wedding anniversary - for the \u20ac 230 they had quoted. Our rooms (longe and bedroom) were decorated in creams and browns and situated on the first floor with a double aspect looking out onto the rue Bonaparte and the lovely rue Jacob. Large by Parisian standards with ample storage space, smallish bathroom with tiny bath but extremely strong power shower. There were a good selection of toiletries etc, large fluffy towels and massive bath robes. There was a safe for valuable and the double glazing made the room both quiet and warm - it was very cold in Paris but with clear blue skies and sunshine. The hotel is situated right in the heart of this buzzy area in the fashionable 6th arrondissement and the nearest metro was a 5 minute walk away. 10 minutes walk to the Seine and about 20 minutes to La Musee D'Orsay. Lots of interesting shops and here are two eating tips. The hotel web site recommends the Bistro de Paris in the rue de Lille (about 8 minutes walk away) and we found the food, prices and service excellent in a traditional setting. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as we usually find this over priced, so we found an excellent artisan boulangerie Eric Kayser at the rue de Bac about 10 minutes walk away. Wonderful cakes, bread and pastries and great for a coffee & croissant for \u20ac 2.50. In summary,Trip Advisor reports of La Villa St. Germain have been patchy and we can't comment on the 'more ordinary rooms' although we did peek into a couple that were being cleaned and they looked fine. All we can report is a wonderful place to stay for a special occasion, very comfortable, ideally situated and with friendly, helpful staff without exception.", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cPretty, modern hotel in good location in St. Germain\u201d", "Author": "spinesrgn", "ReviewID": "UR8505592", "Content": "Hotel is in very good location.

We were very surprised because we booked a superior room at 285EUR and were awarded this suite which costs 445EUR! This was a real surprise! The suite is very large and has 2 disctincts rooms, the bedroom and the \"sofa room\", the rooms are separated by a sliding door. Bathroom and toilets are separated. The overall design of the room is very \"classical trendy\" in brown colours. Nice but not nothing special. The bed was 2x2 (meters) and it was 2 mattress. Overall the room was good, but definetely not at the regular price of 445EUR. Bad point of this room: The streets below are very very noisy!! It crosses rue bonaparte and rue jacob, and bot streets are noisy at night and even on saturday morning, the garbage truck was there at 7am... Breakfast is charged 15EUR and is fair. Usual stuff. Hotel staff is very friendly. Hotel location: the hearth of Saint-Germain. Metro line is 2 minutes walk from the hotel and is line 4.

The hotel staff was extremely helpful, spoke English comfortably, enjoyed my halting French, made reservations each night for dinner and arranged airport transportation. I found the hotel to be well equipped with relatively large rooms for this area (if it is within your budget, go for the higher end rooms for a little more space) and compact but well equipped bathrooms. I enjoyed the hotel's design--udated French with muted colors. The room was very quiet (double windows) and seemed well-ventilated by the A/C system; I never tried to open the windows. I did not have breakfast at the hotel because the it seemed quite expensive (compared to the local cafes) and the dining room was in the lower level of the lobby--I prefer drinking coffee and people watching at street level.
