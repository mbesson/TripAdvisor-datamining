Actually, we were supposed to stay in a nearby hotel but there was a mix up with our reservation so we were put in this hotel. We got a room not in the main building where the reception and the breakfast room was, but just down the street in the same row of the buildings in the newly done annex. Our oom was on the lower floor, (below ground level) down some very tricky steps. But the furniture was all new, it still had that new wooden smell. There were two beds, small modern TV, small bedside chest of drawers and a big table/chest of drawers with a mirror. There wasn't an actual wardrobe for our clothes. We had the coffee/tea making facilities. I have to say I was disappointed with the bathroom, cause it wasn't really a bathroom, it was a wet room. there was just a shower on the wall and a shower curtain so the water would be all over the floor, it wasn't separated. And the washbasin was on the small side. But we got clean towels every morning and the room was also regularly cleaned. The door of our room resembled more to a vault door. We had the key to the room and to the entrance of the anex. The breakfast was at the main building. It was a good old-fashioned English breakfast. The best quality of this hotel is its location. It's virtually 1 min from King's cross station and St Pancras' station. There are also small food shops around, as well as Mcdonald's, Burger's king and other take away options. And a post office. Supposedly it's also 20 mins from the British museum but we didn't go there on foot so I can't really say if that's true.

My room (#8) was a few doors down from the main office on the ground floor.
