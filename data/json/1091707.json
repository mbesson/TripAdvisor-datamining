{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nothing like the internet ad Beware these self contained apartments look great on the internet but are dreadful. These units were not clean i.e dirty dishes , dirty wash cloth, no drying tea towels, smelly bathrooms and to top things off a dodgy hot water service which gave us intermittent hot water.The locks on the doors very difficult to use and required servicing or lubrication. The apartments are right outside traffic lights on a noisy street.", "Date": "Jun 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR400399162", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "NurseyMelbourne"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1091707-r17274637-Waters_II_Apartments-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "1091707", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
