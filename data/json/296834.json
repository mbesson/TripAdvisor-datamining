The only safe looking socket was not usable because in the right connector was a broken plug.

The negatives are essentially down to the archaic dutch architecture that's such a feature of the area. The building is narrow and high which means that the rooms are tiny with little in the way of facilities. No views, not much natural light and quite stuffy. Worst of all, a significant number of the rooms can only be reached by means of staircases that seem to have been designed by MC Escher.

Staff were helpful but there was a slight language barrier but hey, can't complain about that, afterall we were speaking english and not their mother tongue! The reception was quick and well organised and the hotel remains open 24hours and the reception area was always clean and tidy.

This hotel is not in City centre as web site would have you believe, its quite a long tram ride away from centre.. I'm no prude, cheap and cheerful will do me BUT this 'hotel' was ridiculous. The room was absolutely tiny. No storage space whatsoever. The view of a canal as promised was unfortunately hidden by scaffolding and netting, that spanned the entire hotel frontage. And as for the 'SPECTACULAR' (their words not mine!!) dining room, what a joke. Small cramped and RATIONED!!. Only 1 cup of coffee(or tea) per person, tiny selection of cooked meats and bread rolls and to make things worse i was given an eating slot of 9.30 am, which meant half the morning was gone before i'd eaten. To be fair the 2 dining room staff were helpful and polite but that wont be enough to make me stay there again. I wish i'd read this site before i booked because i would have stayed elsewhere, and if your'e reading this seeking advice, mine would be GO ELSEWHERE!!!!!!!!. Andy. Preston.
