But when we get there, some things did not please us so much. First was that we have to check out at 10 am (no problem, because almost all hotels have the same politics), but they could not have our luggage until the time of our flight. This meant that if we stayed in this hotel, we would have to take our luggages out and let them in the termini until our flight time. Next point - air conditionning was not included in the price - and it was really needed in september!!! It was like 10 euros/night to use it. Breakfast was not included also. So the cheap would be expensive. After thinking about, we decided not to stay there. It was better to stay in a hotel nearest to termini (this was about 5 or 6 block from the station), and some hotel that would not cover 10 euros for air conditionning, and that could save our luggages until the flight time. Conclusion - we first went to this hotel, but due all those things we started seeing another hotels nearby termini, and as we found (hotel Corot - this I recommend), we went back to this hotel and told the guy that we would pay, but we would not stay. For our surprise, after telling it to him, the told us that he could have our luggages... only after we tell him that we would not stay. For me, this is not a very good attitude... so we decided to pay the guy (as it was the booking politics) but we went to the other hotel... the best thing that we did...", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cagliari, Italy", "Title": "\u201cTerrible!!\u201d", "Author": "Pingk", "ReviewID": "UR103135992", "Content": "First we had to wait 2 hours for the receptionist, he is not usually where he should be.

Checking the web, this hotel appeared to fit our need compared to the crazy prices we were getting on the web. Eurorooms was only \u20ac75 a night, no breakfast! We had the thought it would be something like \"Etap\". Nope. The staff (Fabio) was very helpful. The locale was excellent since it was near \"Termini\", the main rail terminal. We knew via Palestro as a relatively quiet area having stayed in the Hotel Romae on the same street last year @\u20ac69. Wow, Romae wanted \u20ac133 in '09! Eurorooms, with a number of young adult customers, was quite spartan. It is a place that is strictly for the non-picky customer. The elevator was creaky and upon landing on the 4th floor, you must lug your gear up a flight of stairs to the office on the 5th floor. Graciously, Fabio helped us. Yes, we maybe should have spent more on lodging and have things more polished. Our kids don't appreciate our miserliness anyway. But, we were about to serve in a chaplaincy on a luxurious 10-day cruise and did not wish to spend a bundle on a hotel since we must pay for everything but a portion of the cruise. We will often get ourselves into such lodging. Most Americans would turn up their noses at places we hunker-down in. We take it all as a challenge to stay in humble, yet clean, places like Eurorooms. Just be aware, folks, that this is not a fancy hotel!", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIt a syndicate!\u201d", "Author": "Augt", "ReviewID": "UR20997006", "Content": "I've booked Eurorooms thru hostels.com. Basically Eurorooms and the other hotels located at 87, Via Palestro and nearby are part of a syndicate which passes over customers to other hotels (giving reasons like toilet not workings, or not giving a reason at all). The hotels all have a shared breakfast room. I was given a room at Hotel Cambridge which is located inside the same building of Euroroom. Hotel Cambridge was supposed to be a 3 stars hotel and it does not deserve it. The private bathroom that we booked had only have a wash basin and a shower and does not have a toilet. We have to use a shared toilet at the end of the common corridor. The room smells and you can only watch one channel on the TV as there is no remote for the TV and the buttons on the TV have dropped off. The only saving grace for the hotel is that it is located within walking distance from the main train station.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Eurorooms", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d570541-Reviews-Eurorooms-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$73 - $119*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Palestro 87 int. 21</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "570541", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/79/3b/793babdce6e7bbb9cec16309b80044c51large.jpg"}}
