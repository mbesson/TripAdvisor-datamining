The room was very clean and there was a cleaning service everyday. The room was absolutely tiny though. There was no room to move around as the literally took up the entire room. Half the door to the bathroom was blocked due to a bedside table. Also, the doors may as well as been made of paper. We were kept up a few nights due to talking and a tv in the reception. The hotel is in a great location, off the main drag but extremely close to the main attractions. If you don't mind having a room were you are shuffling around furniture to move its a good place.

And this is the only positive point. Incredibly small rooms like cells, bathrooms are the same size as toilets in aircrafts! Never met such rooms before in any other country. A double- room prepared for us (a couple) was on the 3rd floor, too tiny & tired with scuffed walls with awful view from the window. Next morning changed to another room on the 2nd floor - same picture, but better view to the street, however very noisy, could hear everything happening at the reception, on the stairs and in neighbour-rooms. Pictures on the booking sites do not reflect the real condition.

My wife and I are retired and are definitely value seekers and this hotel was perfect for us. Comfortable and clean, elevator and very close (5 min. walk) to the historical sites; we could not of asked for more. We found excellent food at two different restraints just around the corner. Ergin and his staff took care of all our needs and the English spoken was excellent. On the negative side, the rooms are not large which was not a problem for us but for those who have excessive luggage it could cause some problems. The lack of internet accessibility is a bit inconvenient but Ergin help me find an internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 close by. For those looking for value, clean rooms, and walking distance to the historical sites you will be well served here.

He confirmed our request and asked a prepayment for 1 day, and instead of 60 euro per night as was written on site and!-in his confirmation letter-he asked prepayment 100 euro, moreover, we ordered transfer that supposed to be free from airport (cause of promo-action), but he added the cost of 2-way transfer to total sum. after i have pointed out this subject he apologised and assured me that he will charge 60 euro and 1way transfer will be free. it was alarming symptom but we decided to tempt fate. to tell the truth he didnt charge anything from my card cause of some technical problems and allowed us to come without any prepayment. Driver met us in airport at mentioned time, didnt take any money for transfer and took us to hotel fastly. here we met another \"small\" problem-we were settled at single room that was so tiny so we hadnt any place to put our 2 cases, the wardrobe was so closed to bed wich took all the room space so if not the sliding doors on it doors couldnt be opened! we asked to change the room of course and got a fabulous answer-they didnt have double rooms at that night! so we had to spend night with my friend at one bed, thanx they gave us extra blanket at least. anyway i cant complain cause next day they changed our room without any question, even asked if we like the new one. it was quite big to place all our things, cosy and clean, so we stayed there for whole holiday. hotel was quite new, with quite new sheets and towels, blankets were really marvellous)) i cant say anything bad about stuff-all of them were friendly and polite, always asked if we enjoy our staying, greeted us and wished good night. room also was being cleaned everyday. meal was quite good though repetitious, anyway we never stayed hungry. while being at the reception i've heard the quarrel on the same subject between reseptionist and guests-they also booked double room and were settled in a small single room and manager seemed to not allow them to pay less. Meanwhile the location of hotel is good, its situated near all main sightseeings, the price was low, and Istanbul is so excellent and fantastic city so i cant say that we were disappointed with holiday cause of hotel, just wanted to warn agaist some unpleasant things that could happen and wish everyone to be careful while booking the room in the hotel.

Based on the hotel's website, I foolishly thought this hotel represented good value given its amazing location and new/clean looking rooms on its photos. Arriving on an easyJet flight to Sabiha airport, the hotel agreed beforehand to pick us up at the airport at an agreed cost of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac75 return. I confirmed this arrangement in both email and phone correspondance. However, surprise surprise, no one from the hotel was there to pick us up and much time & money was wasted on catching a taxi to the hotel. As you can imagine, this got our trip off to a terrible start. When we arrived to the hotel, there was much apologising but we were more interested in compensation and asked for the hotel to refund our taxi fare which the staff at the reception said the needed to have consult management... We were there brought to our 'double' room on the 1st floor and when the door opened, our jaws nearly fell to the floor. The room was the most tiny room that we have ever seen. The double bed had a gap of less than 5 cm between it and the walls! Our window opened to the room which contained the heating unit for the hotel and so there was no light at all. We knew noise would be an issue because the room was directly next to the staircase but so were all the other rooms and hence, did not bother to ask for a switch. Alas, the noise at night was so loud that it was impossible to sleep. The noises included ppl walking up & down the stairs, the sound from the downstairs reception (phones and general chit chat from staff), the sound of the toilet flush and fans from the next room, the noise from the upstairs breakfast room (4th floor)... It was impossible to sleep without being woken up by sounds throughout the entire night.. We had initially booked for 4 nights but after the awful experiences, we had to move to another hotel. Thankfully given the airport fiasco, the reception staff had no choice but to agree to our cancellation without needing to pay for the 3 remaining nights. None-the-less, at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac55 per night, it was extremely expensive considering this hotel is more like a 2 star hostel.. Having said that, as it was Easter we quickly found that most hotels in Sultanahmet were charging \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 plus /night. We would like to warn everyone not to stay in this hotel at any cost.. It will be the worse decision given the noise, the tiny rooms, the poor service and rip-off cost. There are plenty of hotels in Sultanahmet, all are within close walking distance to the blue mosque/aya sofya so dont let the location of this hotel convince you that this is worth a go because it simply isnt..", "Date": "April 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zuerich", "Title": "\u201cDon't take this Hotel\u201d", "Author": "peterzrh", "ReviewID": "UR25955913", "Content": "I have visit this Hotel with my Partner in March. When I arrive with my Partner, Receptionist was looking very bad to us. One german and one turkish man. I thought, he has had a big problem. He didnt speak any normal word with us. Only wanna see both passports and ask very urgent to pay the amount of EUR 35 for one night. He gave us back the passports, no receipt and no word to anybody of us. After arriving the room, we found a very very small room, nice furniture, but not enough place to put our bags on the groud. It was a smoking room. There was no ashtrey so we asked for it by phone. The brought us a tea trivet. I was really shocked. Bathroom was small, but normally okay I thought, before I have looked under the washbasin. It looked like somebody had pissed to it. ( look at picture ) Next morning as we checked out, same receptionist. He didn't say any word to us. No good morning, no thanks for staying here, nothing. Only take the room card and turn around.
