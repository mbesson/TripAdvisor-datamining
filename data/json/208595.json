It's not a motel so it's worth the money you spent. We had typical european breakfast included, which is coffee and pasteries, but it's nice to have something in your belly before walking out for your adventure. Ask the front desk for advice on local eateries and best way to see the city. Although, the Filipino girl that works there seemed clueless and made many mistakes.

We stayed at the triple room and were given only one key and were denied the second key. The doors can only be unlocked from the inside with a key - a major fire hazard if you're scrambling to find a key to get out in case of a fire emergency. Keeping that in mind, when I wanted to go out without my 2 friends who wanted to stay in, the front desk offered me to lock them in the room and take the key with me. That's ridiculous in my opinion as they wouldn't be able to get out if they needed to. When we asked for directions, they looked outraged at the fact that they needed to spend 2 minutes of their time explaining to us how to get somewhere and wouldn't repeat it twice after speeding through it just to get rid of us.

You're just steps from Las Ramblas, and all it has to offer. The front desk people were friendly and hospitable, and as we had a back room (204) there was no street noise at all, except the occasional barking of a dog and the ringing of church bells. There was some ambient hotel noise, but because I had read reviews here I downloaded an hour of gentle ocean sounds and looped it on my iPod - the white noise effectively dampened anything that might have been irritating. The room itself is sparsely decorated, all hard edges and thin scraps of fabric. It's serviceable, but understand what you're getting: a smallish hard room with little in the way of creature comforts. The bed, as mentioned by other reviewers, is shockingly uncomfortable. The matresses are like bricks, they have no padding or springs or give making sleeping on them feel like you are sleeping on the floor. After the first night I wrapped the blanket around the mattress and covered it with the sheets for a make-shift mattress pad which was only slightly better. If you are a side-sleeper I would avoid this hotel altogether; you will be miserable due to sleeping poorly and waking up with aching shoulders. The breakfast was small, but again it was about what I expected. The coffee and roll were excellent, the singe slice of meat and cheese was all I needed to start the day. If it had been larger I probably wouldn't have eaten it anyway; with so many wonderful places to eat in Barcelona, why waste valuable tummy space on a continental breakfast? Important tip: The doors do not lock automatically. When you leave your room (or when you're in it) you have to use the key to lock the door behind you. This is probably a fire code violation and definitely a safety concern. The first night we didn't realize (honestly, who would?) and slept with the door unlocked. We almost left the door unlocked when went out, but luckily I had to go back for something and noticed.

We had booked to stay in an apartment on the outskirts of Barcelona, however, on arrival we were absolutely disgusted by the apartment and only stayed the one night before finding Hotel Cortes. We had been wandering round Las Ramblas asking in a few hotels for prices, and this is just at the top of Ramblas, just off the main street down a quiet side street, this was the cheapest hotel we had been into and the reception even gave us the key and let us go have a look at the room before we booked it for the next 2 nights which we thought was really helpful. It cost us \u00a3130 for 2 nights and this included breakfast. I usually won't stay in anything less than a 4 star hotel, so was a bit aprehensive about stayng in a 2 star, but anything had to be better than the apartment we'd stayed in! The hotel actually surprised me! The rooms were basic and a bit tired (which is what you'd expect form a 2 star), but very clean and tidied daily, and they were also extremely spacious, as was the bathroom! I stayed ina 4 star hotel in Barcelona in January 2008 and had about half the room of this hotel The breakfast wasn't anything to write home about, just a selection of pastries and some oranage juice, but there was a gorgeous bakery a few doors down where we got some really nice stuff! The location is probably one of the best things about this hotel, it is right off Las Ramblas so you're in the heart of everything and is the perfect base for exploring. To be honest when staying in somewhere like Barcelona all you want is a good base as you go out and eat in the city and you're out all day seeing the sights, and this hotel is just that.

The hotel is basic, but clean and the location is excellent, close to all the action. From the airport we took the AeroBus, which cost 3.75 euros each and drops you off at Pl. Cataluyna \u2013 very easy and straight forward, it is then just a short walk to the hotel. The breakfast they serve is a good kick start to get you going for the day (Bread Roll, Croissant& Pastry, Cheese, Ham, Orange Juice and Coffee). There was always plenty hot water for a shower or bath. We stayed in room 201, which was spacious and overlooked a small courtyard. For being so close to the bustle of the city the room was very quiet which made for a goodnights sleep. The location was ideal for the sightseeing. We would recommend taking the bus turistic, which is an open top, hop on hop off bus service which takes you to all the sights, again leaving from Pl Catalunya. There is a north and south route and for 23 Euros you can use this for 2 days. We visited the Sagrada Familiar (go early and take the lift up to the top for amazing sights of the city), Parc Guell (lovely for a stroll in the Feb sunshine), Barcelona FC\u2019s Nou Camp Stadium (hubby loved this as a die hard football fan and was an amazing sight compared to his home team\u2019s Goodison Stadium, also the European Cup is based here as Barca won it in 2006 \u2013 even have your photo taken with it ), Cathedral (Lovely courtyard with geese!!) and the Picasso Museum (lots of his early work, great to see how it evolved). Would recommend all these and to spend sometime wandering around the Gothic Quarter and sitting by the harbour if the weather is nice (which it was while we were there, getting to around 20 degrees at midday \u2013 such a change to the British weather in Feb.) Would also recommend trying to get a table at El Quattre Gats (\u201c4 Gats\u201d), we had a lovely meal here and the atmosphere and service were excellent. Also ate at Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, which you know what your going to get, but has become a bit of a tradition for us to visit one in every city we go to. For those of you who like shopping there is plenty available \u2013 El Cortes Ingles in Pl Catalunya is huge, Sephora for smellies is nice and there are many Mango & Zara shops dotted about. All in all we had a fabulous few days in Barcelona and would not hesitate to go again and stay at the Hotel Cortes as there is still so much more to see and do in Barcelona.
