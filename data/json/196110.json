{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved Torre Bellosguardo -- but be advised !!!! Prior to making a reservation, I contacted the hotel and asked them to make sure that they could accommodate our request ... primarily, that is was accessible for someone with minor physical limitations ... the room they gave us had a small platform bed, the worst nightmare for someone who gets up in the night ... Additionally, they appeared not to have the reservation for the party we were travelling with even though the deposit had been charged to the credit card and paid. After a minor hassle, they gave them a room that apparently was an upgrade. Without warning, they were charged significantly more, even though the mistake was the hotel's. The hotel is a destination in and of itself and we thoroughly enjoyed the building, gardens and the magnificent views and wonderful peaceful atmosphere. However, service and maintenance is lacking. The breakfast was expensive and not as good as it could have been.

The boys had their own beds made-up in the sitting room, so we all slept so well. The hotel sits on a hill overlooking the city with absolutely glorious views of Florence, including the Duomo. The gardens and location are just superb and the palazzo itself is magical. All the staff were incredibly courteous and helpful.It has to be one of my favourite hotels in the world; I have travelled a lot and am also quite particular. The bedrooms and reception rooms are full of lovely old pieces of furniture but don't expect perfection. The sheets are cotton and there was plenty of hot water but if you mind about creeking floorboards and the odd spider web - you would be missing a magical experience but would be happier in a five star in the centre.Finally, if you do not have your own car, you will need to be prepared to pay for taxis.

My husband and I traveled to Italy in celebration of our 25th wedding anniversary in June 2006. I researched our accommodations extensively and selected Torre di Bellosguardo for our four nights in Florence because of raves about its location and as a romantic indulgence. We began our trip in Venice and then traveled by train to Florence, arriving at Torre di Bellosguardo on the afternoon of our anniversary. As many others have stated, the villa and its grounds are beautiful and the view of Florence from the pool and from our room was exquisite. Only because the hotel is so exceptionally lovely is this not a completely unfavorable review.Unfortunately, the incredible location and inherent advantages of this lovely, historic building are not matched by the service. We found the men who manned the front desk and who had apparent responsibility for responding to guest inquiries to be indifferent and seemingly aggravated by even simple requests. It seemed as if just about everything was either beneath them or too much trouble. Similarly, on the two mornings we went to breakfast on the covered loggia, the setting was lovely, but the service was chaotic, if sincere. One or two young girls were apparently racing back and forth between the terrace and some room at least two floors above carrying identical items to each table. It took forever, even for the continental breakfast, and we felt sorry for the overheated girls and the completely disorganized scheme they seemed compelled to follow. The last straw, however, was the recognition, on the morning of our departure, that the very itchy rashes we had developed during our time in Florence and attributed to a change in detergent, perhaps, was in fact bedbug bites! Call us slow on the uptake, but neither of us had ever had an experience of this and so we didn't recognize the signs--or maybe we just didn't want to believe that something so unpleasant could be happening in an expensive hotel. We assume the bedbugs were living in the upholstered headboard of our room's antique bed. Really repulsed, we were relieved to be heading off to Rome that day.This hotel has the location and physical plant to be one of the extraordinary small hotels of the world.

However the combination of a lack of air conditionning and no nets or screens on the windows led us to a week of very little sleep - open windows attracted the mozzies, whilst closed ones enclosed the stifling heat. We suffered alternate nights of over heating and mozzie attacks, dependent on which evil we decided to give into. There also seemed to be a problem with understaffin, and their service was very hit and miss. Some staff were great but others weren't. The lack of staff meant that often the pool bar was unmanned during the heat of the afternoon, and service in the hotel bar appeared to de dependent on whether the receptionist had time to leave their desk or not. Not a great impression for guests. Also, we were told that we could have food brought up from the local restaurant by ordering it through reception, but the one night that we decided to avail of this service we were told that we were too late (8pm). Apparently another room had already ordered food and a hotel staff member had just left to collect their order, and he wouldn't go back for us. There was a taxi strike in Florence and it was a long steep walk to the nearest retaurant and back! Being pregnant and overheated I gave dinner a miss instead. Any other hotel I've been to would have done their best to accomodate us, but not the Bellosguardo. It's not as if we got the rooms on any deal off the internet - we paid the full rate.

Bellosguardo offers a sense of civility and exclusivity that one rarely finds at hotels, yet the service is genuinely friendly and down to earth. I find myself wanting to return to Florence for as much as what Bellosguardo has to offer as the city itself.", "Date": "Apr 28, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR453720975", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "finaljudgment"}, {"Content": "Errol Flynn Never Had It So Good On a hill overlooking the city's medieval towers, at the top of twisting narrow cobblestone roads, there's a small castle like luxury hotel that is peaceful and quiet and, believe it or not, like stepping back in time. A walk to your room makes you think Errol Flynn stayed here. After a busy day in town, seeing all the sights, enjoying a wonderful dinner, this is the place to come home to. Here, you and someone you care about (immensely) can fall into each other's arms under a canopied bed behind ancient and huge wooden doors. Words can not describe it adequately. My wife loved the work out area, but I loved the scenery and views, the garden, and the pool. We came across this place by accident and fell in love with it before ever staying there. Staying there only fulfilled the dream. Now we can't wait to go back.", "Date": "Mar 29, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR566525315", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "RonDayton"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d196110-r20844807-Torre_Di_Bellosguardo-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "196110", "Price": "$347"}}
