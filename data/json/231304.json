This year we were wanting to find a hotel with decent value in San Marco area with no avail and with too much cost. Then we came up with this hotel that we stayed previously. As we knew exactly where it was located (Just off the vapporetto stop \"Rialto Bridge\" and there is an alley way between the Rialto hotel restaruant and the other buildings) and its services, we booked the hotel right through hotel web page. the money value wise, the hotel was decent- despite the fact that there was no lift and we had to climb up the stairs 3 floors all the times, we loved this hotel. Like others say, the room is specifically small and the shower and washroom is seriously small. However, I think it is well suited for young couples or married couples without kids. If you're travelling with kids or family with 3 persons or more, then this hotel isn't probably nice hotel to say in. But if you're enthusiastic enough to climb up the stairs up and down, and wander the alleys of Venice, then this hotel is definitely a must stay hotel. The vapporetto stop is only few steps away from the hotel, the rialto bridge is only a street across, and small piazza and all the good restaurants and souvernir shops are around the corners of the hotel. Yes, it is behind a big streets, but it is very safe to walk around Venice at night, and it is not dangerous at all. hotel staffs are nice, but didn't bother to ask much as we pretty much knew the area. the hotel TV is extremely small like a monitor screen, but it worked fine in my room.

We got there early in the morning, and as check in was not until 2:00 pm, we checked our luggage with the front desk and agreed to return later. The staff was quite friendly at this point, taking our eight (!) heavy suitcases upstairs for us so that we would not need to lug them through Venice. However, that is pretty much the only good thing I can say about this hotel. Upon our return at 2:00-ish, we were given our keys and directions to our rooms. We climbed up the stairs to find that our suitcases had been stashed in a hallway. As had toilet paper, wine bottles, and assorted other junk. I suppose with hallways that are so dimly lit (lights are on motion sensors and flicker to life as you approach), the staff assumed no one would notice? We came to our room - number 21 - first. As we opened the door, the room looked small but charming. Cute furniture, wood beamed ceilings, murano glass fixtures. Then the smell hit us. My husband thought it smelled like used cat litter, I thought it was body odor that someone had tried to mask with very strong air freshener. We were both wrong - but more on that later! We turned on the air conditioner and opened the windows, hoping that some air circulation would remedy the stench, and left. Up we went to my sister's room. Hers, number 32, was on the top floor. It was small, but she did have a nice little balcony (off the bathroom), so she was pleased. It was a bit musty up there too, so they opened the windows before we left. We spent a long, lovely afternoon walking around Venice. After much good food and good wine, we decided to turn in for the night, so back we went to the Graspo de Ua. We all went to sleep in our respective rooms, and all had miserable experiences that night! As soon as I turned off the lights, my husband and I heard a loud dripping sound. I turned the lights back on, and lo and behold, the ceiling was leaking. It was not a small leak, mind you, but a steady stream of water pouring from the ceiling onto the bed and floor beside it. The smell got worse! I guess the leak is a regular event in room 21, and the mold/mildew was awakened when it started again! We decided that the wetness and smell were unacceptable, and my husband went downstairs to ask for a new room. He was informed that the hotel was booked solid and that the leak happened all of the time - it was just from the shower above us and it should pass in 15 minutes. Apparently dirty shower water dripping on their guestdoes not phase the staff at Hotel Graspo, and they told my husband to look in the linen closet for new sheets. He found one and some towels. We spent the night on one sheet, under towels. And no discount was offered.

EasyJet holiday. The low price of the package, and some damning reviews on TripAdvisor, meant our expectations were correspondingly low, although to be honest we've travelled a fair bit and don't faint away if an inexpensive three-star hotel in an old European city has modest-sized rooms, a lobby smaller than a football pitch, no lift (oh, those inconsiderate builders a few hundred years back!) or the nearby streets are, you know, narrow and old-looking. Ahem. All things considered, then, we turned up hoping it didn't smell bad and that our bed had sheets on it. So what a lovely surprise! We got several times our money's worth. All three front-desk clerks we met were nice, ranging from solemnly polite to smiley and considerate... above and beyond thoughtful actually; when we returned on our last evening to pick up the bags we'd left in their care (2 euros for the day), the afternoon clerk asked whether we'd like to use the washroom before we went. All were very patient with my less-than-perfect Italian and perfectly helpful when we turned up before check-in time on the first day. They're renovating at the moment, but our lovely room (18) was clearly recently redone. It has wooden beams on the ceiling, its own lovely little balcony (shame we were there in January!), a small but spotlessly clean and modern bathroom (heated towel rail, new towels and all) and a minibar with low priced drinks. Yes, it helps if you like standard 18th-century-style Venetian hotel decor, but it was lovely for what it was. And yes, it was a small room - as you would expect in this city (or NYC or London for that matter). But we weren't at the Marriott nor did we expect it to be. As has been noted, the location couldn't be closer to the action - it's surreally central, just a few metres from the Rialto, tucked down an atmospheric alleyway, almost being like backstage at the brilliant theatre that is Venice. Yes, it took a few minutes to find, since I'd forgotten to print out their map, but it is marked with a sign on the pavement on both ends of the alleyway, and if you want a city with no navigational hiccups you won't be in Venice anyway. The ongoing renovations didn't bother us - on our last day, we came down a few flights of stairs to see practically the entire second floor reduced to a building site, but we hadn't heard a thing before 9am, and the morning clerk seemed honestly concerned that we hadn't been inconvenienced. Which we weren't. We didn't eat breakfast there, since it's always more fun to go out and find your own, especially in the Rialto... so I can't say whether they're still (gasp) trying to serve tinned fruit salad, but we overheard some other folks from the UK on our first morning there saying that the breakfast was nice and generous. Considering that as we were there as part of a package and thus the hotel was making very little money from our stay (other than filling a room they might otherwise not have filled in a very quiet week before Carnival) we never for an instant ever felt like anything other than regulars they were rather fond of . When we left saying we hoped we could afford to come back when we didn't get a super-cheap package deal, the smiley afternoon clerk said they were happy to have us regardless of what we had paid, and that if we did want to come back, we should be sure to mention that we had stayed there before and we'd be offered a discount. It's a tourist city, folks, and you can understand why tourist facilities in such places are overpriced and underwhelming, and why the people working with the public, especially in hotels, get indifferent or even snarly. I feel honour bound to note once again that this hotel was a real little gem and the folks were charming. Of course, it also depends on the attitude you bring to it.

The hotel itself leaves a lot to desire. There is a tiny little lobby leading directly to a set of stairs.. and more stairs.. and more stairs.

We felt sorry for the young Indian guy who lugged heavy cases up and down the stairs all day for guests - we tipped him personally 5 euro each on the day we left. The room is on the small side, but okay. However, the beds were hard as rocks and were skinny singles - the type where you almost fall out when turning over at night. The upside to the bathroom was that it had an electric exhaust fan to take away the steam (we only encountered two of these on a 6 week holiday throughout Europe & UK). The downsides were that the bathroom was small and the shower tiny. The water constently changed from too hot to too cold and the shower was so small that you had to wedge yourself into the corner of the cold glass to avoid being burnt or frozen from the water. I can't remember how many times I elbowed the glass due to the confinement. The breakfast was awful and the cleanliness just so, so.

The saving grace was a small balcony with a roof top view and a direct line of sight to the bell tower at St. Marks.

Not a good start!! We felt uneasy about the place immediately but still checked in and went to our rooms. We had to walk up 3 flights of steps with huge suitcases with no one to help us (no lifts either!) The room was tiny but we were willing to live with this as we had been told that was the norm in Venice. The room was \"quaint\" but old, and I read in another review that they claimed to have recently renovated - and we agree that cannot be true! The bathroom was ok, very tiny and my partner (who is not a huge man, probably thinner then average) found that the shower was so small that when he turned around he would bump the tap off. My mother was in a different room by herself and her bathroom was actully bigger, but the shower head was situated in the bath so she had to sit down to have a shower! On the second morning (the day we checked out) my partner had a shower and came out about a minute later and told me to hurry up and get in as he had the shower on full and only a trickle was coming out. It stopped completely before I could get out of the bed. The breakfast was terrible, we ate out the second day. There was something wrong with the milk and I was unable to eat my cereal or drink my luke warm coffee. I didn't have a problem with the serving lady like others have had though. The staff were not that helpful and we had to purchase a map of the city. We extended out stay in Venice from 2 nights to 4 nights and when we asked about whether they could accomodate us they quoted us $150 Euros for a triple room. We actually went to The Rialto who welcomed us in their beautifully large and professional reception and were able to offer us 2 rooms at $90 Euros each and whilst that is more then the triple room, we needed our space!!! When we checked in the Rialto the concierge gave us a map and showed us great places to go and recomended where to take Gondella rides etc. The also had lifts for the first two floors!
