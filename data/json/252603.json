For 35 USD you can have a king size bed in a large, clean room, with private bath and bottled water. The staff are exceedingly helpful. A bargain-priced restaurant and bar is on the premises. As with many areas in Mexico City, you always have to be careful in Mexico City's historic district, but if you don't want to pay Zona Rosa prices or shop at expensive shops, I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Jan 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR811317686", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "billygoat33"}, {"Content": "Not an option for New Year's Eve For New Year's eve we make a reservation to have dinner in the Gran Hotel Diligencias and was a bad experience. We supposed to pay $800 pesos (almost 80 dollars) per person for a dinner that could be two options, Zalm or Meat with Lobster sauce. We had a reservation for 16 guests and the Hotel asked in advance for the preferences of the guests. We order 1 zalm and 15 meat. I dont know what happened but they brought zalm to everybody, when we asked them to switch the food almost an hour later, they brought us, a raw meat, 3 shrimps, greasy french fries and some tinny pieces of brocolli. Was a terrible experience because the dinner arrive almost at 1 am, and was something that we didnt ask and they didnt offer in the menu for that special night. The guests didnt eat the bad food and we had to pay for it, they just gave us some discount.So, besides of be a nice hotel, the restaurant was not a good option for New Year's.", "Date": "Jan 14, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR951626455", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "isaHolanda"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d252603-r23219390-Hotel_Diligencias-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "252603", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
