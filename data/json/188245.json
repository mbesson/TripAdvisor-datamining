Included Continental Breakfast: It ran for a decent time from 7 until 9:30am I had no idea that breakfast was included until Celene told me as she was handing me the room key. It was a nice perk. The breakfast room is located down stairs from the main reception area. Has approx 12 small tables and seats for about 25. A few different types of cereals, some whole grain and white bagels, white and brown breads and a few choices of small pastries (tiny muffins and 3\" fruit danish) just the right size. Of course there was coffee/ tea / apple and orange juices. There was also an array of newspapers available on a side table. Internet: There is complementary wifi and they provide the password OR for a minimal fee you can use their computer in the main lobby. I was told by the morning reception it was $4 for 15 minutes. Rooms: Comfortable room, with a firm bed. Contemporary decor newly decorated. The pillows were very comfortable. Clean carpet. Bathroom was small and dated with white tiles but adequate. Shower stall only - no bath but that worked for me for this trip. The building is secure with access only through the main lobby or at the sides with room key access only. It is on a very busy stretch of Kingsway and we had a room close to the main road. With the windows closed the noise from the road was not a problem. But the noise from the stairs inside the building was a bit bothersome. Next time we stay I would definitely ask for a room that is not directly beside the stairs. The hotel has lots of rooms at the back away from the roadway in a residential area. Other than the stair noise that ALL the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and positive.

The room that I had was fairly large, but had a tiny bathroom. Why they refurbished it with a lot of wasted space in the main room while scrimping on the bathroom, I'll never understand. That said, I paid about $50 a night, and that suited me just fine. The location is very interesting, despite the occasional professional lady making her obvious rounds. I mean, this IS a liberal area of a liberal city, and I saw the same thing in other areas. The main road on which it is located has some FANTASTIC restaurants along its length, from fantastic Pho to incredible Indian. The proliferation of restaurants catering to many different types of Asian foods has to be seen to be believed. There is even a groovy Bollywood style theater with a balcony that shows Indian movies WITH English subtitles! That said, I found the service to be somewhat lackadaisical. As I was meeting my girlfriend there, and she was going to arrive first, I asked the main reservations office for Days Inn to make a note requesting that she be allowed to check in upon her arrival (the reservation was pre-paid in order to get the good rate). I also called the hotel directly and spoke with the desk person to ensure that there was no problem with her earlier check-in. Upon her arrival, of course, NO RECORD of my request. I had to pull over on I-5 and call the hotel directly. They finally acquiesced, but gave us one of the least desirable rooms at the front (noisy side) of the hotel. Also, one BIG ISSUE that I have is that, after the first day, they charged my card with a $50 deposit for damages and incidentals WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE OR AUTHORIZATION. Now, I really don't see the point, considering the fact that no other hotel in which I have stayed has ever charged me a deposit in case of \"damage and incidentals\" (there was no mini-bar, so I am not sure what incidentals they meant). However, to charge my card, even a measly $50, without my authorization is simply not acceptable business practice. When I complained at the desk, the lady kept explaining that it was simply a deposit that would be refunded. I let her know that I understood the concept of a deposit, but the point was that no one had informed me of the charge. She simply kept repeating her explanation of a deposit, without addressing my actual concern. The deposit was NOT included in my pre-payment to Hotels.com. It has now been four business days since my check-out, and the payment has yet to be refunded.

NEVER AGAIN!\u201d", "Author": "bebe_escape", "ReviewID": "UR80229962", "Content": "Well this is going to be a long review. We booked online originally for one day (A Sat) then decided to do two days a Friday and a Saturday. Well we first called the hotel they were saying we couldn't add another day to get their special, then they said we couldn't cancel and rebook either as our reservation wasn't refundable. So we called the guest services on their website, the lady was very nice and worked out a deal for us so we could still get our two nights at the hotel, so we thought. We show up at the hotel on Friday to find out we are only booked in for one day instead of the two we had booked over the phone. Somehow this non-refundable Saturday night was canceled and refunded. We stood there arguing with the hotel manager and the two staff members for over an hour, they wouldn't help us at all. Apparently they were sold out, I then asked their manager to contact their guest services to correct this situation as we had booked for two nights. We spent another hour or so over the phone and all that they kept repeating to us, was that we only had booked for one night as per their computer. Which is fine, if that was correct. We had booked for two nights and the manager or guest services refused any further help. I asked the situation to be escalated further to the guest service manager. At which point the hotel manager said they had two rooms available now (in the last 2 hours they somehow found an extra room here n there) which he then said we could book it for $119 instead of the $89 we were advised over the phone. Not only did he not price match what we were guaranteed, he then pretended like he was busy through out this whole ordeal in his office (which btw the blinds were not close and he was not busy at all sitting there looking outside of the door). Long story short, this was the worst experience as far as customer service goes. The manager should of honored the price that we were advised over the phone as this was the agents fault at Days Inn office, just because he wanted to make more money on someone else booking it. His values were wrong, instead of insuring the clients are happy with this HUGE dilemma that they have caused us, he saw an opportunity to make more money. It was disgusting, the lack of care he had towards the situation, he did not even apologize in reference to the situation. He then just walked out of the office and left his two poor staff members to deal with the situation, way to show team effort and lead by example boss! Now lets get to the fun part, we walk into the room. It was dirty, the bathroom needed to be cleaned and yeah the guest attendant that was left there felt bad for the situation and at least he said sorry about the whole mix up. I think he should be the manager and not the other guy. The breakfast was nothing but a few 2 inch long muffins and juice and toasted bread/bagel. Nothing fancy. We did finally get a call back from the manager at the Guest Service Office, in which I told her my concerns and she said that we should book the $119 and that they would refund us the difference because the manager didnt want to do it so guest services offered to do that for us.. except by this time we had booked a night for $86.00 at Travel Lodge in North Vancouver (close to downtown even more than this other location) WHICH by the way, highly recommend it.

At 2am on one of the mornings some of the guests staying were having an argument, this continued until 4am when they had obviously burned themselves out.....i was thinking that maybe the night desk clerk was asleep because these guests were running freely up and down the complex, slamming doors at each other that could have been heard by someone standing in Stanley Park, I know its not the hotel's fault that guests were arguing but it is their responsibility to be looking out on the complex at night and resolve any such issues, it was not just myself that had to listen to it, several people at breakfast were also complaining about it. Very drab and depressing room decor and in desperate need of an upgrade with some fresh, lighter colours. I was travelling alone and i did not feel safe in the room at all.....the door had a gap when locked that you could push your finger into. The telepone crackled really badly whilst on the line. The wireless internet is not on a secure network. The desk clerk in the morning along with a manager watched whilst i again struggled out the door and down the stairs with 3 suitcases....thanks. As someone has previously mentioned this place is not wheelchair friendly.....or suitcase wheeling friendly.....strange for a hotel right? Whilst i was waiting in the lobby i heard another guest arguing with the staff about the fact that they had requested by email to stay another night at short notice and that they had agreed a rate, the staff would not honour it and were not taking any reponsibility.....yes i did not know the full story and these guests could have been trying to pull a fast one but i noticed that one of the other reviewers on here had also had some problem with rates etc over email so i put this in to make people aware.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cLack of Communication!!!\u201d", "Author": "rlacjack", "ReviewID": "UR41108801", "Content": "Although we arrived well before check in, the staff did allow us to leave our luggage at the front desk.

Its high season and cruise ship season in Vancouver right now, so getting a hotel under $175 is hard to find. I had stayed at this motel back in 2001 for one night and remembered it was clean. That is all I needed for one night. I paid $93 plus taxes on a AAA rate. This motel is definately only worth about $49 anywhere else in the world, but this is Vancouver during cruise season! Parking is down the side and back of the motel and you walk around to the front. There are a few stairs to the check in desk. There are NO ramps and it is not wheelchair accessible at ALL. Keep this in mind if this is something you need. The lady at check in, Rashma, did not crack a smile the whole time. She was the most miserable person I have ever encountered working at a motel. She wasn't rude or anything to us, but seemed to have very little patience for questions and just seemed stressed or something. I had requested a ground floor room with 2 beds. We had this no problem. I strongly suggest you request ground floor rooms. Some rooms are 'underground' - you take stairs down to them and some rooms are up a level on the 2nd floor. Even to get to the ground floor rooms you have to go down about 5 stairs. Not a big deal for us, but for wheelchair people this is not happening - this place is not wheelchair friendly at all. The room was small, but adequate. Beds were extremely comfortable and there were 3 huge fluffy pillows on each bed. So this was very good! Desk with chair and free wireless (but its sloooooooow). Coffee pot in the room. The really odd thing was the size of the bathroom - it was soooooooo tiny that when you use the toilet you are crammed in a corner between the walk and the edge of the sink. There was a shower stall, no tub. Our room was very quiet. No noise issues at all. A very funny thing was the 'pay movies' advertised on the website. On top of the tv is this old old movie box. On one of the channels you had your choice. If you press button 1 on top of the box you can get Big Daddy and some other movie from back in the mid-ninties for 4.95 or if you press button 2 you get 2 porn movies for 5.95. Interesting in room movie selection. They do have full cable with all the channels. At night, I decided to get the coffee pot ready for the next morning so I could just flick it on. I pulled the glass carafe out and it was broken! Someone must have broken it and put it back carefully - I pulled it out and a huge piece of glass fell off and just missed my foot! I called the front desk to tell them and the girl working seemed pretty indifferent about it. I asked for another pot and she said they were in storage and it was too dark to go in there. I told her there was glass all over the floor and she said \"oh I will make a note of it for housekeeping tomorrow\". HUH? I put a towel down there so I didn't walk on it at all. Also, note that the vending machine is a little off. My daughter put in $1.25 for reeses pb cups and she got a hershey's almond bar. She doesnt like those, so I put in another $1.25 and she pushed the button for some chips, and out came the reeses cups. At this point we were laughing and wanted to see what happened next, so I put in $1.25 for a hersheys bar, and out popped chips! So its a mystery and be prepared to eat whatever happens to come out! The next morning I was checking out early and Rashma was on the desk. Oh joy! She still had the miserable look on her face from the day before. She was on the phone with someone making a reservation and I couldnt believe what I heard! She said to the person \"Listen you are going to have to hurry up I have guests checking out and its very busy for me!\". Then she read back their reservation and asked for a credit card. I guess the person said they had to go get it. She says to them FIRMLY \"When calling to make a reservation you need to have this information handy when you call. I am very busy and have people checking out and really don't have time for this! Why could you not call in the afternoon like most people? Is there a reason you are making a reservation early in the morning? I am very busy!\". OMG! If someone did that to me I would have hung up and called the days inn head office! I was shocked. She then got the info and hung up and rolled her eyes at the phone. I just smiled and signed my bill. She only gave us our McD's breakfast vouchers after I asked. I would stay here again in a pinch if I needed ONE night. I couldn't stay here for more than one night due to the squished in toilet alone. But its a good clean stopover motel.

We booked two non-smoking rooms in the Days Inn ( adress) in Vancouver, BC, Canada. When we checked in , we discovered the rooms stunk like cigarette smoke! We were very surprised because we had selected \u2018non-smoking\u2019 on web site we used for our reservation. We walked back to the reception desk and explained the situation to the person on shift. The gentlemen, named Ron, explained that there was nothing he could do. Apparently to him, no apology was necessary. He let us know that they were completely booked and that he really was not able to be of any further assistance. His attitude and rudeness were shocking. We requested to talk to the manager so he called him and spoke with him on the phone. After he hung up, he said that there was nothing left to be done, that we were free to check out and that we would not be charged. I asked him about this TWICE to confirm his statement. So, in light of not wanting to spend the night in an unpleasantly smelling room- we left, however, the real motivation for us to leave was mainly because of the way this man had the audacity to speak to us- his customers After returning to Portland , my girlfriend realized that there was a charge on her credit card for one night in both rooms. She called the hotel and the staff told her that Ron had made a note in the computer that we were informed that we were going to be charged for the night. We tried to talk to the manager again, but he told us that we didn\u2019t have any proof of what we were previously told. He said, and I quote, \u201c I am not going to let you not pay for these rooms\u201d. He said that there is a late cancellation fee that we were required to pay. I agreed that I was aware of this fee but that the issue had to do with Ron lying to us, then going out of his way to make a note in the computer that he had told us otherwise. I made a claim with the Days Inn customer service a few days ago. I called back today for a follow up. The manager of this hotel told them that we selected smoking rooms because they were cheaper. That was another lie. I am so frustrated and shocked by this behavior that I am going to put our experience on every possible search engine. If you do decide stay at this unprofessional establishment, take a recorder with you, just in case they are as dishonest with you as they were with us.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina", "Title": "\u201cSimply the BEST\u201d", "Author": "Belladoll", "ReviewID": "UR6574944", "Content": "This was simply the best play to stay.

We found this hotel because the reviews looked reasonable, and they had rooms available when others in town closer to downtown did not, at any price. One lady in our group broke her leg weeks prior and had a terrible time dealing with all the steps - up to the lobby, down to the rooms, down to the parking lot. There was more room in the closet than in the bathroom, and they were paying for a deluxe room, but one wasn't available. At least they had a room - the hotel cancelled our reservation because we were told at the desk there was a problem with the credit card. When we asked why they didn't contact us, they said they get bad credit card numbers all the time and they deal with this problem by just cancelling the reservations. Plus they had no rooms available. They called and found a room for us at the Eldorado three blocks down, for less money, and $5 off per person towards breakfast every morning. With the same credit card that the Days Inn had problems with - we figured they got the numbers mixed up or something. The two ladies ended up checking out the next day and went to the Crowne Plaza Hotel Georgia. When we checked on the fellow, who ended up staying at the hotel, that we were coming to pick him up on the last day of the trip, we were told he already checked out. Before we had a chance to ask if he was in the lobby, the phone was disconnected. He ended up walking and eating with us at the hotel we were at a couple of days because he got tired of McDonald's and didn't want to be alone.

I booked the hotel through their website and the price was great for Vancouver. Getting there I realized that it was not right in the downtown area and had previously booked a rental car, however, once I arrived and realized how close all the public transport was, I cancelled the car. Myflight into Vancouver arrived quite early in the morning (approximately 9am) so I had called the hotel from the airport to see if it was possible to store my luggage there until check in at 3pm. The staff at the front desk advised me that my room was already vacated and had been cleaned so was welcome to come check in anytime and they did not charge extra for that. Upon my arrival, the room was as I had booked-furnished with a king bed, desk, phone, high speed internet, bathroom, and a huge closet with luggage holder and clothing rod/hangers to hang clothes. The room itself did not have a coffee maker, however, the lobby had fresh coffee 24 hours a day and vending machines for specialty coffees, pop, and snacks. The room was also spotless and was cleaned daily during the five nights I stayed. The hotel itself is located on Kingsway Avenue with buses going directly to Stanley Park in one direction and to Metro Town Mall in the other. There was a McDonalds next door where the room price included a continental breakfast there. There is also a large Petrocan with a Tim Hortons next to that. In the area there are many restaurants and cafes on Kingsway within a 5 to 10 minute walk. The skytrain terminal is also a 5 minute walk from the hotel and this takes you directly downtown or to connections to China Town, Granville Island, and any of the other tourist areas you wish to see. The hotel also provides maps with specific directions to everywhere, which I used throughout the entire stay. Honestly, I can't say enough about the service at this hotel. The staff there were fabulous and knowledgable. All were friendly and assisted with any requests no matter what they were. While the hotel itself is not a five star hotel, the service definitely is!!!!", "Date": "June 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2848096", "Content": "This is a great place to stay if you want to be in Vancouver without spending a lot of money.

The area is nice, right next to a McDonald's and other restaurants. Well-maintained courtyard at the hotel where you can sit outside your room. Quiet. Rooms are small, but clean and well-kept.
