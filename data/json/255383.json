There are beautiful walks along the cliffs and it is possible to walk from Coogee to nearby Bondi. There is a very good choice of restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel.The hotel is a 15 minute taxi ride from Circular Quay (cost about $25.00), and is therefore ideally located to both see the city and to relax by the pool or beach if you want time off from sightseeing.Whilst we were there the hotel was hosting a couple of conferences, which seems to be commonplace for this hotel, and you can expect some minor reorganisation of the public areas to accommodate the conferences, although that did not cause us any problems.

The bathroom was clean with a large spa bath and nice toiletries. The location of the hotel is perfect for the beach. All you have to do is walk downstairs and cross the road and you are right on Coogee beach. Given it was the middle of winter, there weren't many people around despite it being around 20 degrees. The beach is clean and there it is a reasonable shopping strip nearby. It is also patrolled by lifesavers and so quite safe to swim. There were a number of people doing laps out in the water. There is also one of the man-made pools down one end of the beach which is more protected. We had dinner in the restaurant on two of the three nights we were there. The first night was Friday night and the menu read really well, but the food we had was perhaps not quite as good as we might have expected. It wasn't bad or anything, just probably around 7 out of 10. Saturday night was a completely different story with a fantastic seafood buffet, with loads of fresh seafood and other food.

My husband and I and our 8yo daughter shared a lovely ocean view room, which was incredibly clean, well-supplied and was a good size for the three of us. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the restaurant was yummy, but what sets this hotel apart is the relaxed sea-side atmosphere. We alternated between the beach and the hotel pool - both fabulous. It's a great hotel to combine a seaside holiday with Sydney city sightseeing - best of both worlds. We did the sea path walk from Coogee to Bondi Beach (approx 8-9km) via Clovelly and Bronte Beaches - some of the most spectacular views around! We would highly recommend this hotel for families with children - they made our daughter feel very welcome, and although there are no play facilities at the hotel, there is an wonderful playground just north of the Coogee Lifesaving Club, the beach is safe for children and also has a sea bath (sea swimming pool. We would defintely stay at the Crowne Plaza again.

The location was perfect, right on the beach and on the main drag in Coogee. Good directions by the staff so we came straight to it and went straight into the underground park. So easy. The reception area was very grand and impressive, lots of polished marble and big flower arrangements. Our room was nice. Smallish, but comfy, new and clean.Lovely bathrobes! The bathroom was quite spectacular and beautifully appointed. They seemed not to have cheaped on anything. everything worked.

Arriving in Coogee in a tropical downpour. We had made other hotel arrangements with a view of the ocean, but found the hotel below our expectations. Leaving our bags at the hotel we wandered down to the beach to discuss the situation. We had no real option but to accept that we would have to stay at least for one night at the below expectations hotel. After travelling for nearly 40 hours we were in no mood to seek an alternate hotel. But as we turned to walk back up Coogee Bay Road, we saw to the south the Crowne Plaza, it looked so secure and welcoming. Turning to me with that look in her eyes, she said let's stay there instead. Upon entering the reception we knew we had found the perfect hotel. Our request for a room was met with a very soft and polite( as only Australian women are ). Sorry there are no vacancies for tonight, but we'll fit you in tomorrow night. Accepting our fate we turned to leave the hotel, but only to hear the voice of a girl we came to callour guardian angel, say. But perhaps we can fit you in somehow tonight. She took us to room 607, what a view, we took it at once and promtly checked in. Collected our bags from the the other hotel. We had intended to stay only a week in Coogee, we stayed 21 days. Simply because the Crowne Plaza and Coogee made us feel at home, a place where we could relax, a base from which we could explore Sydney and eastern New South Wales. Would have stayed in Coogee so long, had we had been at another hotel? possibly not. It was for us the perfect hotel, the courteous friendly staff, the location, the expectations that each new day brought, the beach and surf, the seaside cliff top paths and the good old village of Coogee. But we have most of all, wonderful memories of the sunrise pouring into the room, the soft sea breezes cooling the night and the constant quiet rolling of the surf. We will return to Coogee and to the Crowne Plaza.", "Date": "Apr 20, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR542250594", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u9287\ue218\u4eef\u9287\u5d83\u501e\u7477\u20ac\u9287\uff43\u4ef8\u9288\ue218\u5157\u9288?..   showReview(19924921, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 7, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR616122391", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u6d93\ue15e\u7e3e\u95ae\u3123\u4f00\u9287\u5098\u5020\u6942\u6a38\u4e9c\u9289\u6d96\u5110...   showReview(19918855, 'full');", "Date": "May 22, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR251576767", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d255383-r23331658-Crowne_Plaza_Hotel_Coogee_Beach_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "255383", "Price": "$221"}}
