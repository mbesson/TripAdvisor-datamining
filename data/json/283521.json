When walking into this hotel, you have to climb a flight of stairs. The reception was small and decent, nothing special. So when we arrived they gave us a room on the same floor of the reception, I think it was room 108. We walked through loads of boxes and wet carpet, seems like a storage area. We had a private room, it had 2 twin beds, private bath, great room size, a window that didn't open and a view of car tires in a parking lot. Prior to going to sleep, I was using the laptop and with the glare of the light, I saw a bug going up my chest (and it wasn't a little bug, it was like a size of a roach. My boyfriend informed the manager to request for another room but he said he wanted to see my bites first. Seriously!!! Only if I caught the bug, I would personally hand it to him...So eventually, he was nice enough to accomodate us to another room which was the attic (which had 4 twin beds) and this room was cleaner and it was a shared bathroom. Unfortunately, we had to move to a different room the next day because it was reserved. The other rooms where in a different side of the building in between they money changer. This room was smaller and a bit dusty but had the best view of the city. Windows did open, so I had great ventilation. Honestly, the location is the best and has so much beautiful sites to offer. Unfortunately when I got home, I had a bites on my back due to bedbugs :/.

I found this place while searching for a decently priced hotel right in the heart of the Damrak. When I first arrived to the hotel it looked like I had made a bad decision. It was barely visible, snuggled amongst restaurants and stores. There was one small entry way with a small sign which was the only evidence that this hotel was actually there. The first thing that greets you when walking through the doorway was a steep staircase. This leads to a small lobby which contains a reception, computer that is used for internet (which wasn't functioning during my stay), and bathrooms that are frequently visited by the customers from the restaurant below. After checking in, I made my way to the second floor where my room was located. There isn't an elevator in the hotel so again I had to walk up a steep and cramped staircase which can be difficult if you have heavy luggage. I felt sorry for my friend who had a huge bag and was located on the third floor. I finally made it to my room and once I entered I wasn't disappointed. The main and obvious drawback of the room is the size. It is quite small but is still comfortable. There is enough space to put your luggage and move around. The bed is twin sized however is extremely comfortable. The bathroom is smaller than I'm used to however I did have plenty of room to utilize the facilities. They had a small plasma TV hanging on the wall with a few channels however the signal seemed to have had some issues. There weren't many issues and the issues that were present were minor. I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel particularly in the rooms themselves. Every morning to early afternoon you can find about three people working diligently to make sure the hotel is spotless. From vacuuming the carpeted staircases to scrubbing your bathroom floor. The hotel does have free wi-fi but you have to be in the lobby for it to work. I found this hotel to be a little expensive but compared to hotels in the surrounding area it is a great deal. Looking out my window I could see the infamous Grasshopper coffee shop. The price and location definitely make the few small things I had issues with tolerable. I would stay here again and recommend it to others.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Graz, Austria", "Title": "\u201cBedbugs.

Although we arrived earlier than the stated time for check in, we were given our keys and allowed to enter our rooms as long as the cleaners had finished cleaning. The rooms were small but did have an en suite. The room did smell of something funny but it wasnt too far from the canal so we ignored it and soon got used to it! The room was relatively clean and was convenient for our type of trip. On depature the next day, the hotel manager allowed us to leave our luggage if we wanted to but instead to be on the safe side we took it to the Central Station and placed it in the luggage lockers there.

It's the most depressing place. So much so my boyfriend and I did all we could to stay out for as long as possible! So the journey begins with a really narrow staircase, where the steps are all uneven so beware, and then you are greeted by a man, whose face has never seen a smile before, on reception. He will ask you for your passport so he can take a copy (apparently this is normal in Amsterdam). Everything is a grey, dull colour in the reception and our room was no different. As we entered our room, the dark grey curtains were shut and we basically had 2 camp beds pushed together. We had those itchy brown (at least it wasn't grey) camping sheets as duvets. We actually kept the curtains closed after looking at our view (another wall and some pipes) so we understood why they were shut in the first place. I was terrified to open the bathroom door, but as my expectations were so low, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It was very squashed and the door didn't shut properly, but I couldn't find any bugs or anything. The only good thing about this hotel is the location!

I literally burst out laughing when I realized The Orange Tulip had landed itself on tripadvisor.com. I want to start this review by saying that I am not a difficult lady to please. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start at the beginning!! I wound up staying at the Orange Tulp, not the Orange Tulip, as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was not evident in the sign. The first thing I noticed was the bags, upon bags, of garbage that graced the front door of the hotel. I felt a little worried at that point, but I figured its Amsterdam, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that big of a deal. I had seen photos of the hotel, so I felt okay walking into the situation. There is a ridiculous amount of stairs. Very narrow stairs. I had trouble maneuvering up them, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a small girl. There is a lot of stairs. We counted and the total number of narrow stairs to our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was 87. Yip, 87 stairs, after exploring a city all day is rough. Check in was easy. The staff was friendly enough. But, I only stayed one day, and that was our only interaction with the staff, so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really speak on how great or lack there of, they are. So, 87 narrow stairs later, we get to our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I use quotes every time I write \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because; it was far from a hotel room. It was a disgusting square of walls that magically contained 4 beds. It was small. Really small!! There was also absolutely no view. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not kidding when I say there was MOULD on the walls, on the baseboards. There was no washroom in the room, only a communal washroom down the hall. (Actually downstairs, and down the hall, as that once we unlocked the door to the room, there was another flight of stairs that brought us to the attic). The washroom was the most disgusting, vile room I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen in my life. I backpacked through Europe, and stayed in hostels, and a couple great hotels, and a couple AWFUL hotels. This one, by far, took the cake. This is a list of the things that were included in the shower room: mould, dirty boxers, hair all over the floor, and hair ties, and whatnot. The water was cold. It smelled like it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been washed in about a month. The toilet room was worse. It smelled worse, had slightly more mould, and actually made me sick to my stomach. This was a year and a half ago, and every now and then the girls and I will still burst out laughing about this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The bed sheets did look brand new, but the beds were really uncomfortable. If I can give you one piece of advice, book elsewhere. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not even that cheap, we paid like 50 bucks Canadian each for one night \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so 200.00 Canadian for the room a night \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 honestly, you can do better.

They claim that rooms are small (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truth) and very clean. The latter is very doubtful fact, because I was bit every night more and more by some bug, spider or I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what, obviously living in the room. I had such a bad reaction to those bites, that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have stayed one night longer and immediately when I came back home I had to take pills against the allergic reaction. The recovery in order be able to leave my home and go to work (or to any public place) took one week. This bad experience does not confirm their statement about tidiness. Towels were indescribable colors from washing, I assume. Blankets and pillows were better avoid touching at all - dirty from using, with burn and spit marks on them. Only white bed linen looked clean. No comments about furniture, if those remains of some things could be called furniture at all. Cleaning stuff was showing whenever, leaving strange sets of clean towels, for instance 2 big and 1 small; 2 big ones; no change at all, etc. The room was very small, indeed. Furthermore, the doors to the rooms are so thin that it is no doubt if someone would lean on a bit harder, they would easily break. The light from corridor was coming through all night long. Furthermore every sound was as everything would have been happening in our room - the door was not able to stop neither: the light or sound and, in fact, did not give any feeling of safety. The window view was to the roof where many chairs (assumingly from the bar downstairs, which serves breakfast) are stored. One morning we woke up from the big noise - there were people taking some of those chairs somewhere, fortunately not directly through our room. The breakfast was simply awful. There was no service, food (when it finally arrived) was far from good, and I will put it simply as it was - bad. First we got to choose coffee, tea or juice. I am used to Scandinavian breakfast type, where you take coffee with juice for the start, plus as much as you wish. But there it meant one OR the other, so we got 1 cup of some drink (they called it coffee) and 1 glass of juice for two persons. Then, after a long time sitting and waiting at a dirty table (which I cleaned myself) came food. No menu, no choice, as you might guess. And the taste was according to the service provided. When I asked about menu (not much else was to do while waiting, so I decided to find out what we are waiting for exactly) and why they did not say we get only one drink each, bartender said that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually asked about their rules and put it so that our breakfast is \"on the house\", though we paid for it since it was included in the payment for the hotel. Anyway, it was clear that why to try harder if they already received our money. We did not eat at that place ever again, but went to have breakfast in town instead. The smell of the entire place is some mix of toilet and cigarettes, like in a cheep public toilet at some train station (not every). Not surprisingly after we discovered that people from so called restaurant, where obviously is no toilet, run to the toilet at the reception. This discovery ruined any rests of feeling about being safe in a hotel (even like this). One positive thing was that our room was one staircase up. The staircase where I barely managed to carry my one week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luggage up... In short, the hotel experience was the worst I have ever had and the sickness those bites gave me shadowed our otherwise wonderful trip. We will definitely never go back to this hotel and, in fact, I am concerned how I book hotel in the future - in descriptions most of them look if not good than at least ok, but in reality it can vary, unfortunately. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how this one can be called a hotel and where from it got two stars, when actually in reality it looks like one of the cheapest hostels. The owner does not want to invest anything in renovation that at least would bring it to some bearable order.
