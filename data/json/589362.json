My first issue was that they did not have enough staff on reception. I had to wait what seemed like an age to get someone to check me in. This also presented problems. My visit was for business we had booked a meeting room and this is where I took real issue. The meeting room had been booked by the office. A few mistakes were made by the office with regards to timings. I had wanted to have our food that had been ordered in the same room and at the start of the meeting - 1pm as opposed to 3pm that the office requested. First of all i had to plead that they serve the food at 1pm. I had to be put through to some manager who eventually got the kitchen to agree to the time change. 1pm came and went and there was no food. I had to keep coming out to speak to the waiter and the elusive manager on the phone. Rather than continue to bore you with the detail I again had to plead to ask that the food be brought on to the meeting room. Food that had been ready at 1pm eventually got to us at 2.38 pm! Obviously some items were cold. The manager on the phone said the waiter could not take instruction from me as he was \"only a waiter\". Surely in a business centre there should have been someone that could issue instructions. All the issues led to me having to come out of my meeting about 5 times - not good. I could go on but they really need to improve the way they handle customers. Yes we got things wrong with the booking but they were not insurmountable issues. I also deal with customers and they make mistakes but the mark of good service to my mind is how you handle things when things go wrong. On a positive note I really liked the Italian restaurant - great service and food. Probably where we got the best service. Rooms are ok. Breakfast not bad.

But, if so, why did they promise immediate check-in? What I did find surprising was that I was expected to sit in the hotel lobby for as many hours as it took for the staff to find me a room. There appeared to be no system for dealing with early arrivals such as myself (separate seating area, snacks, a shower...). I waited for 2 hours and only got into a room by harassing the over-worked front desk staff. There was no acknowledgement by any manager that I had received a less than satisfactory welcome. My room was very small by Dubai hotel standards but otherwise okay. My room safe malfunctioned (with my passport etc inside it) on the last morning.

The chose of hotels in Dubai is amazing so I relied on Trip Advisor. I decided to stay at Radisson Blu, Media City. This hotel was outstanding thanks to the staff, facilities and location. Several write ups state this hotel is for business travelers only which is totally wrong. We arrived at 09:00 from the UK and our room was ready, not only that we were upgraded. The front office staff could not do enough for us, so after a quick shower we were on the 8th floor sun deck, enjoying the sun. After a brief discussion with the hotels Concierge we decided on our plan of attack regarding sightseeing. The Concierge pointed us in the direction giving us handy hints. The hotel offers shuttle services to several of Dubai's attractions including The Mall of the Emirates. We utilized the shuttle service on a couple of occasions which enabled us to familiarize ourselves with the area. The hotel also offers day passes to a nearby beach club which we also utilized; this beach club was amazing, not over crowded like several of the other local beaches, quiet, beautiful swimming, good bar and restaurant. After a few days we discovered Dubai Marina was about a 10 minute walk from the hotel, the walk is also through some beautiful parks. In fact there are several nice parks in the surrounding area, which surprised me, we enjoyed walks through most of them in the beautiful Dubai weather. Walking was no problem because this has to be one of the safest cities I have visited. Taxi's to all the major attractions such as Buj Al Arab, Atlantis, Wild Wadi, Souk Madinat from the hotel were about \u00a33 (20 Dinar). The hotels location is away from down town but trust me this is much better, when you do the us trip you will see enough of down town. The services within the hotel were outstanding, breakfast was superb, the Italian restaurant was different class, the spa was top drawer, and the bedrooms have outstanding black out screens, which means you can sleep a bit longer but that\u2019s what a holiday is for. The 8 days we spent in Dubai were superb thanks to the staff at Radisson Blu Media City; we thoroughly enjoyed our trip and will definitely be back.

Pool: Was not used as it was Ramadan, but would be relatively small. Bars/etc: The hotel has a few other bars/eateries as it has both a west & east tower. I did try the sports bar on the 2nd floor and it was alright. Overall, a decent business travel hotel providing the basics for ~USD110 (corp rate).

Two tasteless dishes (lasagna and ravioli) and a somewhat uninspired staff. Loungebar was loud and open for smokers, so we had a beer and hurried out. We had a massage at the spa which was also ok.

I was booked at the business room which was great by all means. very comfortable, very clean, very friendly staff, free internet, quick check in and check out. you can basically get anything you need in this hotel. The only downside I would say that the spa was not that good, i've experienced better massages in other hotels. But overall this is still one of the best hotels ever. I would definitly come back again when travelling on business and highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lebanon", "Title": "\u201cgood for business travelers\u201d", "Author": "LebanonLittle", "ReviewID": "UR52333851", "Content": "good hotel for business travelers only.i wouldnt reccomend it for peoplr traveling for vacation or luxury", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cCheaper better options close by -would not recommend.\u201d", "Author": "Smiley_Richard", "ReviewID": "UR50228924", "Content": "Good points - free internet and location handy for business in Media City Negatives - Room is very small and feels pokey, decor is very 70s will faux leather, scratched MDF furtniture and looking a past its sell by date.

I will definetely stay there again on my next business trip due to the proximity to my client, the facilities for business travellers and the smiley helpful staff and service. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement and I am listing some minor findings. Breakfast is good but could definetely get better (e.g. increase cheese variety, more frequent fill-up, extend serving after 10:00 that buffet is abruptley closed etc). Hot dishes should not be so over-cooked. Air-conditioning output facade in room was dirty with black mud stains which was spoiling the overall very good atmosphere, making you feeling worried about filtering conditions.
