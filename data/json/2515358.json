Check-in after 11pm is ALWAYS a painfully slow process. The man who handles the front desk (Keith?) can't seem to locate a reservation, scan a credit card and get a key handed out in less than 5 minutes (or at least it seems that long). I have seen some improvement over the past 6 months or so but it is still slow. My last two stays I had no acknowledgement of my Diamond status, or welcomed back, or any of the \"extras\" such as bottled water and cookies. The service does not compare well with other Hilton properties I have stayed at. The property itself is a \"standard\" Hampton Inn: Clean, comfortable, predictable. The location is on the Airport side of the road and can be noisy if you are on the runway side of the building. The biggest issue is a late check in. Since I am usually just passing through, coming in at 10:30pm and leaving at 5:30 am, any delay has an impact. It will take the shuttle about 15 minutes to reach the airport although the trip to the hotel is just 5 minutes. When you add the length of time it takes to check in after 11pm, it can be 30-40 minutes from curb to bed. The Hilton and the Doubletree are closer and seem to have shuttles more regularly so you may want to check the pricing between the properties and choose accordingly.

The housekeeping staff are absolutely wonderful. The rooms are clean and the breakfast meets the Hampton Inn standard. The check-in was very disappointing, it took an extremely long time.

She was clearly getting frustrated at the computer and communicating with her co-worker in a manner that I would consider unprofessional in front of a guest. I was asked what floor I would like to be on so I selected the highest floor. However, she failed to advise me that there was construction on that floor and my room was about 1 of only 2 rooms on the floor occupied and that all around me would be construction. I had to climb over construction debris just to get to my room...literally....CLIMB! The worst part was that it was late afternoon and I had a dinner engagement so I wanted to nap so I could rest up. Unfortunately, it was next to impossible as the sound of table saws and other construction noise could be heard all around. At the end of the day, all of the debris was cleared out of the hallway but the construction started early again the next morning. Lucky for me, I had to be out of the hotel early. What disappointed me however is that despite the debris being cleared out of the hall, there was still saw dust and bits of dirt right in front of my door! Nobody made an effort to even vacuum the entrance ways of the rooms that were occupied. As a result, I ended up dragging in saw dust into my room! Upon check out, nobody asked how my stay was and what frustrated me even more is that the agent automatically put all of the charges straight onto my credit card without reviewing the bill with me or giving me a choice of how I would like to pay. Typically, I find Hampton Inns to be very good but I was very disappointed with this property. To make matters even worse, I wrote a complaint to the property via the Hampton website.

We had stayed at the hotel before and had a good experience. The hotel has ample free parking and the hotel lot feels safe although it is not gated. We parked very close to the front entrance of the hotel which may have contributed to our feeling of safety! Check in was a breeze. The clerk also offered a list of local dining locations and said that the on demand shuttle was available to take us anywhere on the list. Our room was spacious and clean, and so was the bathroom. the king sized bed was incredibly comfortable with very soft linens and good pillows. We noticed some TV noise from an adjacent room but it didn't disturb us. The hotel offers an outdoor pool, fitness center and continental breakfast. We didn't make use of any of these, but noticed that the breakfast included some hot items (sausage, eggs and biscuits on the day we were there) as well as the usual doughnuts, cereal, yogurt and toast. They also pack items into \"breakfast to go\" bags that you can grab on your way out. No idea what's in there, but seemed like a great idea for travellers! The on demand shuttle was great. We returned our rental car the night before our flight and the driver came and picked us up at the off-airport rental location within a few minutes of our call. We used the shuttle to get to the airport in the morning and it was prompt and efficient as well. You can't reserve the shuttle, you just go to the lobby about 10 or 15 minutes before you need a ride and it works pretty well. We had to wait 5-10 minutes for the van to return from a trip but since we had allowed for that we were not late.
