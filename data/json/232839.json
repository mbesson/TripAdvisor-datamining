However, in this case the service negatively impacted my stay and left me with a sour taste. The location is quite good...not great - there still is a short walk to almost any good sight seeing or hang out location, but quite good considering the price. The room was as expected - very small, bare-bones, and a bit dingy. Again, expected. The service however was sooooo awful. This only became an issue because my reservation was messed up. I had prepaid for a triple through another service but they had me down for a double. They made no attempt to help me resolve this saying I would need to get a refund from the company I paid to (Agoda). They wouldn't give me a receipt for anything (including the tax they asked me for before leaving), wouldn't call Agoda, wouldn't call a manager. I understand I paid a different company but they have authorized that company to take reservations on their bahalf....it is THEIR relationship and they should have made a twinge of an effort to help me resolve. I spent way too much time trying to get ANYTHING showing I had stayed in a double not a triple so I would have something to go back to Agoda with. If the Hotel wasn't going to help me at LEAST give me info to help myself. Additionally, my friend and I asked for a regular taxi to the airport in the morn (specifically said no need for the limo service). However, they had arranged the limo and we were on a time crunch to get to the airport and were stuck with the 50EUR bill.

When the bus driver had pulled over to drop our group off, there were no bellhops to attend to the luggage, so I had to carry up our bags from the street up about half a flight of stairs to the lobby. It was overbooked, so they merged our one Double and one Triple-sharing rooms into the Junior Suite on the fifth floor. The elevator was cramped, and could accommodate only three bags and one person. BUT THE VIEW OF THE VATICAN WAS SPLENDID! My sister got a Triple-sharing room, which was actually a loft type unit a bed at the loft, and a fold-out sofa bed on the main floor. The stairs that connected the loft were pretty steep. so if you have poor eyesight or have poor leg-muscle control, request for a standard double-sharing room instead. All-in-all, the rooms were of a decent size. We hope they used electronic key cards, but instead use old fashioned keys attached to heavy weights. We ended up leaving the keys at the front desk every time we would venture out into the city. Because of this security issue, we left our luggage locked in the rooms, instead of using the safe. The air conditioning also didn't stay on the whole night. It was fortunate that the evening was quite cold, so I opened our room windows. UNFORTUNATELY, the birds outside kept making a quacking noise that sounded like people talking loudly. I asked the front desk receptionist about the air conditioning unit the following morning and he said this was a common practice among hotels. I also inquired about this at the Hotel Anglo Americano right across the street, and they said THEY LEFT THEIR AIR AIR CONDITIONING ON 24-HOURS A DAY! But that most old hotels turned off their units at night. I didn't ask why they did this, so maybe anyone reading this review can just comment on this fact later on. The LOCATION was good, as the METRO STATION was a block down the street, as were 24-hour cafes/trattorias (the GELATOs in ROME are TO DIE FOR!!!). There is also a convenience store next door, so you can save an extra Euro on the cans of Coke, instead of drinking the ones inside the room refrigerator. If shopping is your thing, then you can easily walk 10 minutes to the Via del Corso (although walking the whole strip of Via del Corso will probably take you about 30 minutes from the Piazza Venezia all the way to the Piazza del Popolo). The Fontana de Trevi were also a 10-min walk away. The Colosseo was about 30 mins away on foot.. For first time visitors to Rome, the METRO subway system has an optional 24-hour valid ticket for 4.00 Euros. This saved us a lot of money. A WARNING: THE SUBWAY IN ROME HAS A LOT OF PICKPOCKETS! The train car was quite cramped when we went in. My sister caught some girl with her hand inside her purse, and a fight/shouting match ensued. The pickpockets were working as a team, with the 20+ year old girl picking my sister's purse, whilst another 10 year old girl was working on my mother-in-law's purse. They do not look like vagabonds, but are actually quite decent looking. You cannot hit/physically hurt them, as this would get you in trouble with the local police. What else dd I miss? The tap water is potable. The gelatos were the best. The Italians are a gorgeous people.

We were exceptionally tired and were greeted with a 'sorry no porter to lift your heavy luggage up the flight of stairs to get into the hotel lobby' and therefore had to do it ourselves Our rooms were dark, gloomy and the size and shape of a shoebox with a small double bed in the middle and barely any room for our suitcases. Mine and my sisters bed sheets were stained with blood and other unidentifiable stains, upon using our bathroom we found someone elses pubic hair on the basin, and two pairs of mouldy slippers were provided (for our convenience of course). When we informed the night time receptionist he proceeded to raise his voice at us, and give my mum bed sheets (which were too small for our bed) to replace the dirty ones herself. The view from the window was lovely, it consisted of metal bars followed by wooden panels which we couldn't even open. The breakfast was even better. The food lacked variety and the quality was poor. The floor of the dining room was sticky which left us questioning the general cleanliness of the kitchen. My mum would not let us eat there so we were forced to go out and buy breakfast at a nearby restaurant. We all had a fairly sleepless night due to the tiny bed being inadequate for my sister and I to share, and the yelling coming from the reception area.

Whatever your budget may be, when you travel you are entitled to a clean and friendly environment which quattro fontane just simply is not. DO NOT STAY THERE p.s. in our search for another better hotel, we came across a hotel/serviced apartment building only a few doors down which provides large suites with a clean, big kitchen and bathroom each as well as a living room for only 250 euros per night (less than quattro fontane). The suite we saw could accomodate up to six people (more with your own sleeping bags as there was alot of space).

if approached ask to meet them at a locla police station. these fake police will flash an id but so quicj you cant see it they dont have uniforms . there are plenty off police around(real ones in uniform) if in doubt ask for them to accompany you to one of these visible officers. read trip advisor about pick pockets and poeple using distraction tactics to riffle your wears like bunping into you with an ice cream or ruffling a newspaper in your face. we were aware of all of these and we never had any problem with any but its best to be aware then you will probably like us be ok. back to rome. we went in the keates musuem which is on the corner at bottom of the spannish steps. its a small house and the lady there gives a good talk on keates. we walked to the cemetary which is by the pyramide where he is buried it was a lovley walk. we also visited st paulo a most beautiful church which is in this area well worth a visit. its a fair walk about 3 km from coloseum but well worth it/ there is transport to this church but the walk is where you actually see rome. we would definatley go back to the same hotel its good value for money and down the road from hotel is a shop which sells paniinis and for 3 euro each panini we had a lovley picnic in rome each day. in the evenings we went to a local supermarket and got a few cans of beer etc and we enjoyed these back in the hotel with our feet up but tip dont buy from the little shop a few doors down from hotel as we were cheated a couple of times they overcharged and short changed us and when you are not used to euros one is a bit slow to suss. also they didnt never give us a reciept from till and this is illegal in italy. we enjoyed a visit to castle st angelo and along the river tiber you can see some sellars selling wears but beware you will see the dancing mickey mouses seemingly dancing to the boom box music they dance without strings!!!!i dunno how its done but its a scam dont buy them cos when you get home you cant get em to dance . i looked it up after on internet and they warned you not to buy. luckily i only spent 2 euros the original asking price was 5 for the 2 mickey mouses", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWe were pleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "AnnieGrant", "ReviewID": "UR36191812", "Content": "We started our honeymoon and first trip to Europe with 4 nights at the Quattro Fontane, an 18th restored mansion.

We spent our first 4 nights in a room with a loft with very steep stairs, however it was clean and quiet. The breakfasts were typical of those we'd experienced throughout Italy - cold meat, cheese and breadrolls with croissants and cordial and coffee. The 18th Century renovated Hotel is situated within easy walking distance to the Trevi Fountain, the Forum and the Pantheon. There's a small deli/takeaway store located just a few doors away where you can buy food, a bottle of wine or an ice cream. The Red tourist buses stop at the bottom of the street, so it's in a handy location for sightseeing. After doing an Amalfi coast tour, we returned for our last night in Rome in a very spacious room on the top floor with views over Rome to St Peters (yes, we heard the barking dog in the apartment adjacent to the Hotel). We didn't have any problems with overbooking and enjoyed our stay. I'm sure there are more fabulous places in Rome, however this Hotel is 3 star and you get what you pay for.

The reception staff were very helpful and ordered taxis etc which always arrived within minutes. The main plus point for the hotel is it's location. It is a short 2 minute walk to a main square which is on the route of the hop on hop off bus services. We only used this once as we walked to most places. If you are planning to go to the vatican and the colloseum, which I strongly recommend you do, you can book cabs to get there early, which were very reasonably priced.

Our group ranged from 11yrs to adult and everyone loved the tour. The Colleseum is also a great visit, but again, get there for it opening at 9 or you'll queue for ages.
