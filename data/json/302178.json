Landed at HKIA and went to this hotels counter at the airport. It would cost us HKG$200+ per person to arrange Hotel transfer to the Hotel in Shatin. Very helpful Regal staff directed us to take the A41 express bus which costs HKG$22.90 each (or so) Bus stopped near a subway and the hotel was just in front of the other side of the subway.Tell the bus driver and he will alert you as to where to get off. Check in was efficient and took less than 20 minutes. Room was nice and clean and all modcons worked.Just be aware that if you do your internet in the room..you will be charged. Free wifi is only in the lobby or the poolside. Had Tim Sum lunch in the hotel's restraunt. Good. A bit pricey.Check your bills before you pay. Had two additional items in ours which we did not order or ate.Amicably settled with Captain. Place was full, maybe thats why the confusion?Next table had about the same problem. Management should look into this. Buffet breakfast was reasonably good if you do not have to eat it 5 times over.Menu should be rotated. Management should look into this also. Acessibility to ALL over Hong Kong and Kowloon places very convenient by Bus or MTR. Hotel provides a shuttle every 30 minutes to Shatin Station.Lots of buses from just out side hotel to Shatin Station.Good to take a stroll along the river thats just in front of the hotel. Staff in all departments we encountered were service oriented and pleasant and informative.Check out took a little longer, about 40 minutes.A bit too long.They have a holding adjacent room for Groups but the floor staff did not attempt to\"herd the sheep\" The check out area was swamped by the groups cheking in and checking out. Maybe Management may consider using the 15th floor Regal Club for FITs to check in and out during peaks?

Some had very modern and well-appointed rooms while others had ageing rooms that were badly in need of refurbishment. On the 15th floor, the rooms were were very bright and comfortable but quite narrow. They had mirrors everywhere, including on the ceiling, possibly to help them look bigger. Rooms on floors below 15 were bigger but were not as modern. Some of the rooms on the 9th floor seemed to be in bad shape - some were even smelly. In the worst cases, my team mates requested (and received) a room change. On the other hand, one of the best rooms was 901 which is a corner room with views over the river and the hills. There was a lot of inconsistency between rooms in what was provided and whether electrical fixtures worked. However the staff were very friendly and acted quickly when issues were pointed out. I should add that the room rate we received was good value and the breakfast buffet had a good selection of Asian and western food. The location at Shatin was great. It was close to two MRT stations and a bus to Nathan Rd stopped right outside the hotel. It was an easy walk to the Shatin shopping malls and the hotel provided a free shuttle bus to the Shatin Centre and MTR station.

Response to our requests took much longer than we expected. One night when our kid was in the shower, he realised there was no shampoo in the bathroom. Apparently it had been missed out. We called housekeeping to request the shampoo. They said they would bring it over. We thought the housekeeper was on their way so asked our kid to wait for a while in the shower but it was after half an hour when the housekeeper finally arrived with the shampoo. We had already asked our kid to forget about the shampoo so he resorted to using the bath gel to wash his hair instead. Another instance of poor housekeeping was when they forgot refilling the minibar with drinks, we called, but we had to wait for one hour. We only had the drinks brought to our room after making a second call. That was again far from satisfactory. A few other times we also had to call housekeeping to request for items they had forgotten to provide us when making our room. Despite the above disappointments, we would say the staff were courteous and respectful in general. On the other hand, the hotel provides convenient shuttle bus service to the town centre, airport and other places. The only thing I have to complain about the shuttle bus service is that the airport bus advertised a 'Free WiFi' on-board the bus. There was none. The new iClub room we stayed in had a nice modern design but was a bit too small for a family. There is barely enough room to walk to the other side of the room and we tripped over the bed a couple of times. The distance between the bed and the wall is only about a foot wide. The room also did not have a proper sofa and coffee table area for us to sit down and relax. There was only one small desk and one chair for three of us and that's all. The bathroom with a glass wall and a glass door looks modern but the drawback is that it does not provide enough privacy. The television was a pain. Due to the limited space, it is installed on the ceiling meaning we had to look up to watch TV. Our necks were sore after a couple of days! There were not enough power sockets in the room (only three with one already taken by the alarm clock) meaning we had to take turn to charge our electronic devices. Also, one of the power sockets in our room was dangerously loose. The WiFi service in the room was pretty good except for the fact that only one device could access it at a time making our Internet browsing quite inconvenient. The iClub buffet breakfast provides good food but is almost the same every day making it very boring as our family stayed at the hotel for two weeks. Despite the above disappointments, we would say the staff are courteous and respectful in general. On the other hand, the hotel provides convenient shuttle buses to the town centre, airport and other places. The only thing I have to complain about the shuttle buses is that the airport bus advertised a 'Free WiFi' on-board the bus. There was not any. The rooms facing the river provide spectacular and breathtaking views. The location is very convenient as it is located near restaurants, bus stops and shops. It is near walking and bike paths which can be an alternative route to the town centre apart from the shuttle bus. In conclusion, our stay at the hotel was average as it had its good and bad sides. In the future we may consider staying in another hotel.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cHORRIBLE. WORST EXPERIENCE.

Nothing compares to this horrendous experience at this supposed \"4-star\" hotel. If it means anything, I am writing this right now in the lobby of this hotel (still with a few days to go in this hellhole) because it is just this bad. Allow me to elaborate thoroughly: On our first day upon arriving... 1. The one thing we noticed right away was that all the sheets had this unbearable, musty smell. It was clear that the sheets on all three beds were not cleaned thoroughly but instead smelled like the odors a previous person left. 2. Halfway through a shower, one of the bathtub faucet knobs fell off, rendering it useless. 3. Halfway through watching TV, the sound automatically mutes, then unmutes a few minutes later, only to continuously repeat this pattern. 4. The air in the room would sometimes smell like urine when no one had used the bathroom. If you can believe it, THIS ALL OCCURRED WITHIN THE SPAN OF THREE HOURS. Needless to say, we requested a new room. But to no avail. In our new room... 1. The sheets continued to smell HORRIBLE. Imagine if you had to sleep in sheets that somehow made you feel like a sweaty, stinky person had just slept in those sheets. 2. The cleaning lady never cleaned the bathroom properly. There was always grimy dirt that was visible behind the toilet and hair on the floor. 3. We came back one day and noticed that we did not get shampoo, so we called reception to request some. A housekeeping lady came knocking and told us, word-for-word, \"Sorry, we ran out of shampoo. So, please just use water to wash your hair.\" There was nothing else. No effort, no mention of when there might be shampoo or offering to get it some other way. With regards to other things... 1. They charge a ridiculous amount and have needlessly complicated system for wifi in the rooms. 2. Sitting in the lobby using their free wifi, I have seen two people yelling at the employees because of inefficient service, with one taking his entire family and leaving the hotel. There was absolutely no effort on the staff's part to reimburse, apologize, or try to stop this man from leaving. From a \"4-star\" hotel, this is just bad service. 3. There are people crowding the lobby at all times of the day. Which isn't so annoying, until you've spent a night sleeping in stinky sheets with faucet knobs falling, crappy service from staff, and realized that you paid way too much for this hotel, if you can call it a \"hotel.\" CHOOSE ANOTHER HOTEL LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFirst trip to Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "Locutus233", "ReviewID": "UR132199453", "Content": "This hotel was very nice and the service was great. When we arrived the hotel had doorman who was waiting at the door and helped us with our bags. He asked us if we were checking in, and unloaded our bags from the cab allowing us to check in and then brought them up to our room. The check-in experience was great, no deposit required, credit cards accepted. Provided us with everything we needed. I think we ended up with an upgrade room as we were in a regal iClub room. The room looked nice from afar, however when you got up close the white leather they used for the furniture was not completely clean, probably not the best choice of colour for hotel room furniture. The AC worked too well, and had to be turned off at night, it apparently ran during the day preventing the windows from fogging up due to the climate in HK. Which meant the room was extremely cold when we came back at night. The room has a mini bar fridge this stopped worked about 2 days before we planned on leaving for home. The hotel also had a self service laundry located on the 8th floor, it requires $15 in coins per run. The machines are Japanese. You can buy soap at the corner store down the block but its expensive, like $40. In addition to run the dryer at at a lower temp I had to run two cycles to get my clothes dry. (from what I understand, in HK and Japan you can only use certain types of laundry soap, most North America soaps are probably too harsh for the water system). Like most of HK this Hotel has a salt water toilet flushing system, but with a western style toilet. The bathroom had a weird layout, no shower curtain just a piece of glass on part of the bath tub. The bathroom looked the most dated part of the room. This could just be because of the materials chosen. The bathroom completely fogs up including the mirror when you take a warm shower. There isn't too many places to hang things in the bathroom. We used the pool a few times in the hotel and had trouble finding a place to hang all our swimming gear to give them a chance to dry other than above the toilet on the towel rack. The humidity in HK is very high so drying things takes a long time. This hotel also has lots of tour groups mostly from mainland china. They seam to be contained to the lower floors, but tended to hang around the lobby in the morning and evening and clog up the elevators at times. They also hog the 2 computers with Internet access. Speaking of Internet, you cannot sign into the wifi in the lobby after 9pm for some weird reason. We were not able to use the wifi in the rooms, i think you need to be a regal rewards customer for that. Because of the tour groups there often isn't a place to sit in the lobby to surf the internet during the evening or morning either. One odd thing I noticed was the fire doors are made of wood in this hotel and I was walking between different areas on our floor and someone was eating or had Durian fruit in their room on the same floor we were staying on, the doors kept the smell contained, but the smell carried in this containment area and was not exactly pleasant when passing through this area. The hotel has a pool which is not heated but it was quite pleasant to take a dip in the cold water in the pool when it was extremely hot outside. My son spent hours in the pool. One of our visits to the swimming pool was a little entertaining, we watch both life guards have to jump into the pool to rescue 2 different Chinese tourist who tried to swim in this pool, but couldn't. The pool is only a maximum of 1.85M's deep. I suspect they were just doing it to make the life guards work for their money. I found it more funny then anything else. But the pool was fun. There is a shuttle service between the hotel and the Sha Tin MTR station, it usually runs every 20 minutes, its a first come first serve, i have seen it leave with people left behind a few times. Taking a cab from the MTR to the hotel is only $20 and less than 5 minutes.We have used this when we were tool lazy to wait for the next shuttle. Its about 20 minutes walk between the hotel and the 2 close MTR stations. The hotel is located about 1/2 way between two MTR stations.", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cWell-appointed Room\u201d", "Author": "travelbuddyfun", "ReviewID": "UR130780484", "Content": "Stay in this hotel for the first time for 7 nights.

I booked this hotel because they offer family rooms and the rate is OK with all the amenities I need and space is bigger than most of the other hotels. I know that in-room wifi is not included in my rate so didn\u2019t bother to ask for that, and that\u2019s not one of the priorities at that time also if ever you would need one there\u2019s free access at the lobby area \u2013 which I used on my last day just to communicate to the person who will pick us up from the airport. I would say that the reviewers from this site and other hotel booking site has taught me a lot \u2013 prepared me on what to expect from this hotel. Example as are as follows: 1. Mouthwash \u2013 It was perfectly labeled that it cost HK$20 not misleading at all even if it is placed together with the toiletries provided by the hotel. If you think this is expensive there are 7-Eleven and other stores just around the corner. 2. Room Scent \u2013 I requested for a non-smoking room beforehand and made sure this is available as I am very particular to it. The room assigned to us was very nice including the view. I think this is one of the newly renovated rooms on the 10th floor. I have booked different hotels in HK before and even in their non-smoking floor it smells like cigarette smoke. This one has a very clean scent. 3. Location \u2013 I think the location was great, we we\u2019re in the middle of all the places we planned to visit(Airport/Disneyland/Ngong Ping/ Citygate Outlets ) will take about 30-45mins. (Ocean Park/Victoria Peak) will take about 45mins-1hr depending on the traffic. Lots of options on public transportation which is also very efficient and easy to follow. We took the hotel shuttle to Disneyland & Airport and took Bus 170 directly to Ocean Park. Took MTR to Central on our way to Peak Tram. Very accessible \u2013 make sure you research you options beforehand just like what I did. 4. Concierge \u2013 Book your Airport Shuttle with them in advance as this is a first come first served service. Shuttle to MTR is also available \u2013 but if you can\u2019t wait for the 20mins interval you can just take the taxi for only HK$20. 5. Booking \u2013 book directly if you can \u2013 they have more freebies if you do so. Unfortunately I wasn\u2019t able to because of the initial booking I made with Agoda on the other hotel \u2013 and used the credits to book this hotel Overall I had a really wonderful stay in this hotel \u2013 will definitely come back and stay here again, as I have said this is going to be my address in HK every time I visit. And will also recommend to friends, colleagues and family (one of my brother is now planning to go to HK and stay at this hotel). Thanks to all hotel staff who made it a very pleasant vacation for me and my family. We appreciate the welcome fruits and the complementary birthday cake for my son. Thanks to to Tony Chan, Queenie for assisting us during check-in , Canattie & Edith during check-out , Doris for the tours/shuttle, Allen and Philip of concierge. To the housekeeping team for a quick response on our request for extra towels. And of course to Josef Halbherr \u2013 Thank you very much!

I read most of the reviews before staying at this hotel so I knew what to expect about certain things such as to watch out for the noise, etc. But surprisingly it wasn't so bad! The repairs were done at reasonable hours, I wasn't woken up by noise at all. And anyway we leave the hotel and go out around Hongkong and by the time we come back there aren't any disturbances. Hotel Transpo / Wifi - There's a hotel shuttle that picks you up from Airport to Hotel and vice versa; and a shuttle to take you to the nearest MTR, or all the way to Disneyland! So it's pretty convenient. Wifi is not free in the rooms, but there's free wifi in the lobby; just ask the concierge for a password. Location - Okay, it's not the closest to the city. But I'm more of a suburbs person so while I do like to go around the bustling city, I like to go home to quite a relaxing place, and Sha Tin is the sort of place that feels really comfortable, with a lot of open spaces and parks; it's where you can breathe. Anyway we just take the MTR; it's really convenient. We never took the taxi or city bus at all. We even went on a day trip to Macau coming from Sha Tin. Room - We got a room at the 12th floor, facing the river! The room is spacious, clean, with elegant interiors, and the bathroom is clean as well. The bed is comfortable enough. We have an amazing view, facing the river, very nice and relaxing. It's a big change from the view of narrow buildings from the city. There's a park there by the river where you can go jogging if you want. Nearest Shops - I know that there's a nearby shopping mall there but my boyfriend and I sometimes go to Home Square / Ikea to have lunch, it's just a short shuttle ride away from the hotel. There's free wifi at the ground floor of Home Square! There's cool stuff there if you're into furniture or novelty items. If we really want to go shopping for other things we just go take the MTR to go to Causeway Bay and other stations.

There was no safe box in the room (pretty essential when travelling with family with passports, money, Ipods etc) and no minibar (I like to have a fridge to keep our own supplies cool). But to give the hotel its due, they agreed without argument to move us up to a room in the renovated non-smoking floors of the hotel, this time with two double beds, safe box and fridge. The room was clean and well laid out, with reasonable-length beds, by HK standards. So we had a great stay after that. The location of the hotel is pretty good for anyone who knows Hong Kong already, and doesn't want to spend all their time in Central district of HK Island. The A41 airport bus stops right outside the hotel, as does the 182 bus to Central (and this is a lot less hassle than going to the MTR). So does the 299 to Sai Kung, a prime area of Hong Kong countryside ideal for walking and seaside views away from the city. Just round the corner from the hotel is a stop for the 170 which will take you to Ocean Park.

Stayed July 2011 for 5 nights on a quad room. We arrived around noon, and found the room not available (official check in is around 2pm), so we went to the shopping center to have lunch. Directions were given by the helpful guys manning the concierge desk. When we finally got back to the hotel, we were efficiently given our rooms. Unforutnately i requested for double beds during reservations and even told the lady handling our checkin, but was given 4 singles on the lower floors instead. No reason given, not sure if she was not conversant in English, but she did not seem to feel like talking to me. What really surprised me was when i asked for an extra card key, she just dismissed my the request. just like my request for double beds. No reason given why i could not be given an extra room key with 4 people staying in the room. This was not a good start of our stay. when we reached the floor of our bedroom, i noticed that a wing was under renovation so it was very dusty and noisy going out from the elevator. good thing my friends and I are heavy sleepers so no worries about noise, but the dust was creeping out of the plasic curtains that they setup. so when you are waiting for the elevator you would get a sniff of the dusts. not sure if they advertise free wireless, but it did not seem to work, i had to plug the cable to get internet. the shampoo/conditioner is the dispenser type, they offer a couple of toothbush for a room meant for 4. and the small mouthwash cost 10$. toilet and bathroom are dated but reasonably clean and functional. one of the four single beds was pretty worn out - it was extra soft with no support. our rooms were not facing the river, what we see out the window was the scaffholding and the nearby school. not really a concern for us. but having booked for 5 nights, i would have thought that a better room could have been given. One of the promotion they offered was free minibar (softdrinks/water), unfortunately i think housekeeping was not aware. i called them the first night, the lady on the line just said yes but nothing happened. the second night, also the same thing. the third night, i had it and went down to reception. i got scolded by the receptionist that there was a queue of people waiting to checkin. i told her that was not there to checkin but to complain for the lack of service. it was then that she changed her tone and offered me the complaint / feedback form. i told her, i didn't need it, that i want the problem to get resolved. i suspect there's just a language problem as the housekeeping ladies seems to be pretty efficient in their jobs. Most probably, they never understood what i needed. but these things should never happen in a 4 star hotel. pool was closed during our stay, the fitness center was pretty decent. a huge choice of restaurant is available, if you're on a budget a good selection of hawker food is there at the back of the hotel. no need to speak the local dialect, just point to the food you find interesting. pizza hut just a short walk away. they seem to cater to mainland chinese tour groups, so it could be busy at times. and maybe that's where the attitude comes in. i would say this is a value for money hotel. but they really need to fix the attitude or language problem of the staff otherwise vacationing guest will just remeber the bad stuff.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExpensive and and uncomfortable\u201d", "Author": "YanFav F", "ReviewID": "UR126306997", "Content": "Spend 2 night in this hotel, price changing everyday if not booked before. 2100 hkdollar first 1350 second day.

My idea was that the reception was understaffed. When I asked for the internet, I was given wrong instructions which I only solved after spending almost one hour in the elevator coming up and down from my room. This was solved after talking with some other member of the staff that told me a very simple set of instructions that had nothing in common with the instructions that others at the reception had given me. Of course, during this hour I was in tremendous amount of stress to check the e-mail because I needed to confirm several issues regarding scheduled business meetings. The sort of unclear and contradictory information and procedures would occur frequently.

The bed was quite comfortable as well, and I slept very well in the various nights that I spent there. The hotel has some good restaurants where one can relax on its own or have business meetings, which are not affected by the usually noisy and hectic lobby. The hotel is situated at a walking distance from the Sha-Tin MTR station (the subway station in Hong Kong), but it will take you almost one hour to get to central Hong Kong, so if you want to be close to downtown this should not be an option.

LOCATION: Hong Kong is divided into 3 areas; Hong Kong Island, Kowloon & the New Territories. Most tourists only visit Hong Kong Island &/or a small part of Kowloon. However, the New Territories is larger, quieter and greener. Shatin is the largest town in the New Territories & the hotel faces the Shing Mun river & is located in a suburban area. GETTING AROUND: The hotel has a shuttle bus to its other hotels around Hong Kong & the airport. A taxi costs about HK$15 (bus HK$4) to get to the town centre although you can walk it in 15 minutes. At Shatin town you have a wide range of parks, shopping & restaurants & the trains that will take you to the northern New Territories/ the border with mainland China (c20mins, HK$25) or south to Kowloon & Hong Kong Island (c10 - 30 mins, HK$5-25).

The bathroom suite was very old and we found hairs in the plug hole and noted that the wash basis had not been cleaned. It was absolutely appalling. We complained to reception and they offered for a cleaner to come up and clean the room. That night we also went to the skybar and drinks were a rip off price - we got 4 drinks and paid over $200 hong kong dollars for them! I ordered a manhatten cocktail and it was more like drinking off whiskey and ice. My sister ordered a glass of white wine and you could tell the white wine had been corked/ open bottle which noone has drunk for ages.

We also used the internet connect which they charge at a daily rate and for each IP connection. The connection was very slow and very expensive. Do not go on the internet is my advise. Also went to the swimming pool, which they do have a lifeguard however, he was very unfriendly and did not understand the concept of a locker room, until I spoke catonese.

In the end we were told to leave our credit card details where they could charge us if it was found we didnt pay.

As I booked online, I was entitled to the free airport transfer from the airport to the hotel directly. Our flight got delayed and I missed the bus which I initially booked, which is at 10.50am. I went over to the hotel counter and was informed that I can take the next shuttle bus which is at 12.20pm. We didn't know where the shuttle bus is actually waiting at, almost missed the bus because we couldn't find it till we asked a staff at the Regal Airport Hotel and he told us that it is at the hotel lobby. Our trip to the hotel from the airport took about 30-40mins. First impression of the hotel was good as the lobby is quite spacious looking. At the front desk counter upon my check in, I was informed by Sylvia that the room which I booked is not available. (When i paid for my rooms online through the hotel reservations, I requested for a king size bed and a non-smoking room with early check in) Sylvia told me that all the rooms are fully booked and there are only twin size bed rooms available or if we want a king size bed, we are supposed to downgrade to a room that is very much smaller than the room I initially booked. After I insist that I do not want to downgrade to a smaller room, she then mentioned that there is another room with a king size bed and another single bed in the room as well, but the room is smaller than what I booked as well. I then told Sylvia that I requested and paid for this particular bedroom very much in advance and I shouldn't be facing this problem at all during my check-in and it is ridiculous for me to be downgraded. She then went to ask for help from another staff, Debbie. She then look through their system and told us that if we want our room, we have to wait for 40mins as the guests have just checked-out. I told her that this is not acceptable as well as I first of all requested for early check-in, If i got on to the 10.50am shuttle bus and arrived much earlier at the hotel, am I supposed to wait for hours for my room? I then requested to speak to their manager and the manager didn't apologize to their mistake and just told us to wait for 30-40mins for our room and he offered to let us wait at their i-club lounge. We went up to the lounge and he told us to help ourselves with drinks but we sat there for 30mins and none of the staffs came and asked what do we want to drink. Oh and not to forget, the guest that was queuing behind us during check-in, I overheard that his room was not available as well. Finally, we got our key card and went to our room. We got upgraded to the Regal I-Club room, the room is spacious and beautiful. The bed is big and comfortable. Our luggage took 1 hour to be delivered to our room. I had to call the front desk to ask where is my luggage and the concierge was rude as well. All these encounters leave me with a bad impression about this hotel. I believe that first impression really counts and I will not come back to this hotel ever again. That aside, the shuttle bus to the nearest MTR station (Shatin) comes every 20mins and there are public buses around the hotel to go to various parts of the city. There are also cha chan teng around and supermarket too. The hotel 24 hour restaurant, moon river, is affordable and serve decent food. Room service is efficient but there are no smiles from the staff. During my last night, I went to the front desk to ask about buses to go to the ferry terminal, I stood there for 10mins, shouted out a few excuse me to the staffs at the front desk and concierge, all of them just continue doing their own things and never bothered about us. One of the names we noticed is Kenneth. It was only until Debbie walked past us and asked how can she help us. I really don't understand where is the service of this hotel? There are so many hotels in Hong Kong and there are so many other hotels which may be better at the price which we are paying.

It really did not disappoint! As we only went for the cheapest room (Superior), and have seen some pictures of some really tiny rooms at the hotel, we were a little apprehensive. But when we checked in, we got a very spacious room, with a comfy queen bed overlooking the hotel pool! It was a pleasant surprise :) There was a free shuttle van from the hotel, available every 20mins, taking you to either Tsim Sha Tsui or Shatin New Town Plaza (which was great for connections to the rest of Kowloon). The hotel also offered transfers to the airport for a fee, but you're best bet is probably getting on the A41 bus; $26 HKD or so (one way), approx 45mins max journey and the bus stops only about a few seconds walk from the hotel. Staff were very polite and helpful; i.e. I was unwell halfway through our holiday and had to call an ambulance from the hotel. Staff were very helpful and even rang our room later that evening to check that we were OK. Location of hotel was very good; only a short walk away (approx 20mins) to Shatin City One, which is basically a small district with shops and restaurants, also a laundrette that charged by weight (if like us, you didn't want to pay per sock you wanted to wash at the hotel). If you didn't get the free hotel shuttle, you can easily get the 86k buses or various other choices to Shatin New Town Plaza - buses came very regularly and was literally just outside the hotel. Costs approx 50p for a journey to the Plaza. We have read that you can walk from the hotel to the Plaza, which we think is very doable, but under the blistering mid-30c heat we didn't get a chance to this time round! Down points though: costs of using wifi, pool wasn't overly clean as there were always little branches or leaves in it when we went although the poolside staff did seem to try and clean it out daily, and expensive hotel restaurants (although the food quality was really good).

When we asked the reception and then the manager if we could change the voucher for our final day to our first day so we can take advantage for dinner they said they could not due to the accounting dept. This just aggravated me and so we had dinner elsewhere. It's such a simple and small thing to do to welcome a guest and if it really is this case that the accounting team has more pull than a manager for something that the reception level should really be able to do then there are bigger problems. No free wifi or broadband. My husband and I are currently traveling extensively and this is the 15th hotel we've stayed at in a row - this is also the most expensive hotel (even more than London and Paris). For the amount of money we paid per night for our stay, it is an embarrassment to the hotel that there isn't complimentary internet services included in the rate. It's not even affordable and when we spoke to the manager he said that the hotel has been actively negotiating with the internet provider to offer better rates. We stayed over a weekend and checked out on a Monday - the construction on our final day was so LOUD. It felt like it was inside my head. There was no way to drown it out - you couldn't hold a conversation even while yelling. If we had stayed there during a weekday we would have had to listen to this every single day. That is COMPLETELY unacceptable. The pool was supposed to have been completed, however it was not and this was a big disappointment. The other thing to note is when you walk up the hotel you'll see \"SOHO Shatin\" if I remember correctly. We passed it twice not realizing that these hotels technically share the lobby and it says Regal Riverside on the other side.

Our round trip airport transport were free for my family and wifi was complementary. I requested an extra bed for my child free of charge and when we arrived they upgraded us to a 2 queen size bed corner upper room with a fantastic view of the river. Too bad the airconditioning was not working properly so when they could not fix it they moved us up one floor with the same type of room but not the river view room. It was ok with us because the room was big and we loved the 42 inch lcd tv. and the mountain view. We loved the service and the pool was fantastic with two lifeguards on duty.

From there it is easy enough to get public transportation but the journey to go to the city would easily take 1 hour. Bear this in mind if you decide to stay here. It is a long trek everyday and very inconvenient. Food is not up to standard so better to take your meals elsewhere. Breakfast had sufficient choice but quality of food is not good.

The ride from the airport took about 40 minutes. The staff at the hotel smiled and greeted us upon entry and led us to the queue for the front desk. They were polite but firm when approaching customers who break in the line. English spoken by the front desk staff was sufficient to make a good transaction. The room given to us was located at the 17th floor and had 2 twin sized beds, 1 chair, 1 desk, 3-tiered drawers, side table, 1 flat screen tv, minibar with small refrigerator and a closet integrated in the wall. It was very small but the design of the room had mirrors and a big bay window that the room \"seemed\" spacious and bright. The tv was placed at the top corner of the room where you'd feel comfortable watching while laying on the bed or viewing it from one of the numerous mirrors. The bathroom was small but felt adequate (Asian-size). There's a shower enclosure (no bath tub) glass counters and a sink. The walls of the bathroom are made of glass to be able to see the great view from the window whether in or out of the bathroom. There are thick curtains, however, that can give you some privacy, although the only locks for the bathroom are the sliding glass door and the curtain's velcro-fastener. Best to consider the persons you'll be sharing the room with when staying in this type of room. The greatest thing about the room is the view window. We had a spectacular view of the river, the street below, part of the mountain side, the community swimming pool across the river and the floating restaurant. In the morning you wake up to the view of river where you may spot a sampan going by, row boat racers practicing, and tall buildings against a green mountain background. By nightfall, you'll see colorful lights along the riverbanks, streets and the establishments in the vicinity. Depending on your preference, you can use the screen or the heavy curtain to diffuse or totally block out the view. The hotel has a free shuttle service that can bring you to the MTR station in Sha Tin, the hospital and back at regular intervals. Just coordinate with the concierge for the schedule and bookings. Also, the hotel is located close to a bus stop. Across the street is a walking/jogging path and a separate bicycle path along the riverside that you can access by using the pedestrian underpass coming from the side entrance (near the bar). On the other side (near the cake shop) you can see small parks with lots of plants, flowers, small trees with benches or provisions to sit and rest. As you wall to the right, you'll see several restaurants selling live seafood, groceries, laundry shops, hardware stores and other establishments. Elevators were fast and quiet. Employees were very courteous and helpful. Wi-fi is available in the hotel but signal may vary depending on your location in the hotel. LAN connections are available in the rooms for a fee. On the whole I'd like to stay in this hotel again. My only concern is that it can be far from the some of the destinations tourists usually visit and may take some time and more money to reach places like Central, Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui, Admiralty, Stanley, Mong Kok, Disneyland, Tung Chung, etc.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cAverage room, Good value for money....\u201d", "Author": "BelgiumSurrey", "ReviewID": "UR116549115", "Content": "Having stayed here for the third times, I know the area very well.

However, just to make sure, I emailed and telephoned the Reservations Officer to know the inclusions (free shuttle service to nearby MTR station, from/to airport) and Ms. Katie Lui was very helpful. She also informed us to proceed to Counter B02 for the free shuttle service which we did. It was a breeze getting to Regal Airport Hotel where we waited for our ride. My 4-year-old daughter was able to enjoy the Kiddie Play Area during the wait. When we got to Regal Riverside, we went straight to Check-In where our reservation document was verified. We requested for an early check-in but since the room was still being prepared (it was around 11:30am), we were told to come back after an hour. We were already given the room card key jacket plus HK$400 worth of food vouchers which we can use in any of the 10 restaurants/bars of the hotel. This was an unexpected blessing. And so off we went to Avanti and ordered Four-Cheese Pizza which we found delightful. An hour later, we got our room at the 9th floor, with 2 single beds and 1 double bed and, of course, as we requested, a stunning view of the river. It was bigger than the hotels in Kowloon where we used to stay during our previous trips to Hong Kong. The bathroom was clean and well-supplied with fresh towels and toiletries. We had complimentary bottled drinking water and coffee/tea which were replenished daily plus a working safe, too, where we tucked away our passports and jewelry. We were also very happy with the Tours Desk personnel, Doris, who gave us options and valuable information on tour packages. We didn't have to go out to get our tickets for Ocean Park and Disneyland...they were available at the Tours Desk in the hotel lobby. This was really fantastic. We even got complimentary Disneyland umbrellas which we used during a rainy morning at Disneyland. The complimentary shuttle service was very much appreciated. We tried going to Sha Tin MTR station (which was about 3 minutes from the hotel) and walked just a bit to Grand Central Plaza to visit IKEA. Our first day was very enjoyable. Going to Kowloon was never a problem because there was a complimentary shuttle service that was bound to Regal Kowloon Hotel (about 40 minutes ride). The Moon River Restaurant became our family's favorite for late-night cold drinks (my daughter fell in love with ice-cold Ribena while the boys were overjoyed with the milk tea and soya milk) and breakfast. I particularly adored the turnip cakes and wonton noodle soup, shrimp flavor. We also tried a very interesting dessert, peaches with sago and grass jelly, which was worth the wait. The only problem we had was during our third day when we were so tired and we couldn't enter the room because the card keys didn't seem to work. My husband went down 3 times to the Concierge at the ground floor to report that we couldn't open the room. First, they sent someone from Housekeeping who also failed to open the room. Then we waited for the Manager to look into the door locking system himself. My kids and I were already seating on the carpet floor with our shopping bags and all as we waited. Then they called Engineering who took out the electronic lockset and repaired it on the spot. The whole process took more than an hour. It was a bit frustrating when all we wanted to do was to have an early night in preparation for our Disneyland tour the following day. Naturally, our room was not fixed while we were out, but Housekeeping replaced our towels and gave us our daily bottled water ration. Checking out (around 6am) was uneventful. We waited for the complimentary shuttle service going to the airport which arrived on the dot.

We, i.e. my wife Sushila & my sons Jigar & Sagar, had stayed this hotel in Feb. 2011. We were in a group. When we reached at hotel, it was crowded because of the Chinese New Year festival. However, within 10-15 minutes we had received our room keys. We had been allotted room on 16th floor. We found the room was neat and clean. Everything like tooth brush, shampoo, toothpaste, towels, match box, shaving kits, tea & coffee maker, safe, cupboard with hangers, mineral waters bottles, Hair dryer, intercom, bathrobes, Napkins, Handkerchief, shoe cleaner, slipper, music system, T.V. etc. On ceiling there was mirror which gives a soothing & comfortable feeling. When we settled in the room after taking tea, I remembered to recharge my mobile. I found that my charger had round bar whereas the hotel room plug was square. I called the housekeeper and within few minutes an adopter was provided to us. I also made some ISD calls using the room phone. The room consist of large bath room, spacious bed comfortable for two with enough space to move around. The rate is also reasonable around 350 Hong Kong dollars. I marvelled at location of Hotel and our room in particular. It was on the road side in front of which a river was flowing. There was a five large swimming pools, 6 lanes roads. So, we have Views of River, roads, swimming pools, jogging tracks, cycle tracks, gardens (from our Balcony), and greenery every where. We used to seat in the window side at least 1 hour every day when we woke up taking stocks of all these beautiful scenes. Next day we locked the room and went for morning breakfast. While passing through the lobby we noticed a lady was replacing towels & other toiletries in other rooms. She smiled sweetly and wished good morning to us. We also reciprocated. The restaurant was on 3rd floor. We have been provided passes for breakfast. The restaurant was beautifully decorated. The food varieties were enormous. There were vegetarian and non-vegetarian items. They were nicely placed, neat, clean, appealing, and fresh. The waiter promptly and speedily picks up the used dishes so that no dirty plates remain at sight. I asked about vegetarian food dishes. She did not understand. However, she called other guy who understood my English and cared to explain and direct me to the various vegetarian dishes quite cheerfully and politely. There was a swimming pool adjacent to restaurant so we took our plates and enjoyed food seating in front of swimming pool. After breakfast, we returned to our room and noticed that the lady was attending our room. She came out and apologized saying also that the room would be ready within few minutes. When we entered the room all mess we did in hurry for breakfast was gone and the room was again nice and all the necessities were replaced and placed in proper way. Next day was Valentine day. Wow!!!, the decorations, lightening, the valentine tree etc. were fabulous. I also would like to mention largeness of Hotel. I think the hotel had more than 500 rooms, which includes budget room, suits, honeymoon suits, etc. It had also specious parking place. It is in proximity to Metro, Bus service, Market etc. We found no threat, insecurity of any kind during our stay. So, in nut cell our experience about Hotel Regal Riverside is happy because of: 1) Convenient Riverside location, peaceful and serene environment 2) Spacious room at reasonable rate. 3) Cleanness, neatness and prompt service with smile. 4) Quality of food and services are excellent. 5) Decoration done by Hotel 6) Availability of all miscellaneous services related sight seeing, money exchange, laundry, travels, ISD etc. 7) Helpful and friendly staff", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "perth, western australia", "Title": "\u201cSolo Adventure\u201d", "Author": "owls9383", "ReviewID": "UR114290083", "Content": "I'd like to be honest and state that this review is actually way overdue.

Tried one of their buffet style dinner and just a little disappointed . Although not in TST area, transport was easy. Little feeder buses stops regularly just round the corner from the hotel and it'll bring you to the the MTR station. This station is also in the basement of a huge shopping centre with some brand label outlets and restaurants/fast food joints (must visit the top floor for a little 'sweets outlet' which served fantastic durian mousse of some sort). The Royal Park Hotel also in the same complex. Another 20min on the MTR and you're down in TST. Alternatively, take the MTR and venture out to the little suburbs. For those not in a hurry (like me), I walked from hotel, crossed bridge, walked alongside river and enjoy the lovely outdoor setting of the park (seniors doing taichi, others exercising).

I stayed in one of the iclub rooms on the 13th floor, and was able to make use of complimentary wi-fi, which was great as I was staying on business and needed to be available by e.mail, as well as free use of the fitness centre, complimentary drinks every evening, and discounts in all of the hotel restaurants (more on them later). A complimentary shuttle trip from the airport got the visit off to a very good start, although I was less impressed by the welcome from the staff in the main reception on the ground floor. I didn't feel that they were interested in customer service at all, and while I appreciate that they were very busy when I arrived, the attitude seemed to be the same throughout my stay, whether they were busy or not. Fortunately I was directed to the 15th floor for the iclub check-in, and the staff there were lovely - very friendly and helpful. The room was very big, recently decorated in light colours, and the bed was extemely comfortable. I have only two complaints about the room: firstly the fridge didn't work, so if I had been tempted to use the mini bar, the drinks were all warm, and secondly I couldn't find a way to switch off the light in the wardrobe at night without switching the master switch by the bedroom door off, meaning that the bedside lights were inactivated, and so as a consequence I had to sleep for two weeks with the light on. Fortunately it didn't give out enough light to disturb my sleep, but it was still a bit annoying. The bathroom was adequate, could have done with some redecoration to take it up to the standard of the rest of the room. Air-conditioning worked well, I was happy with the temperature of the room. The iclub breakfast was good, although there was not much variety, which was noticeable after two weeks. As for the other restaurants, they were reasonably priced, particularly the Moon River restaurant, where you could eat dishes such as Singapore laksa with seafood for just 35HKD! I particularly enjoyed the food at Vi (a Thai/vietnamese restaurant), but the service was not that great, whereas the service was excellent in L'eau and the Avanti restaurants, but the food wasn't so good. I didn't go into the main bar, as I was travelling alone, but it was quite quiet, from what I could see, apart from on the last coupleof days when it livened up a bit. The shuttle bus to the metro wasn't a good option for me - it didn't start running until 11am on Sundays, and finished at around 7.30 every day, which is nowhere near late enough - but the walk to the metro station is only 15 minutes or so, and the route felt quite safe, even after 11pm, travelling alone. The journey to Hong Kong Island or Tsim Sha Tsui was about 40 minutes in total - living in London I can't complain about a 40 minute journey really, and it was ideal for work at the nearby hospital. The nearby shopping centre (New Town Plaza) is huge, and it is also very easy to get to the lovely fishing village of Sai Kung by bus, and out to the national parks for some lovely walks. The fitness centre was very good - could do with turning the air-con up, but other than that, the reception staff were friendly, there were 5 treadmills and most of the weights and other equipment that you could want. The jacuzzi was far too hot (I couldn't get in) but the sauna was lovely (and empty most of the time!). It was a shame that the pool is shut until April, but I can understand that it may have been a bit cold to make it worth keeping an outdoor pool open during the winter. There were a couple of occasions when the other guests were very loud (I was woken up at 4am by someone very clearly drunk and making a racket), but during the week it was always quiet. Overall I think that the hotel is definitely worth 4 stars, and was good value for money. I would probably not stay in this hotel if I was in Hong Kong purely for sight-seeing, but if they could move it closer to Kowloon I would definitely return (although the location is probably what keeps the value so good).", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel in Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "ssgill", "ReviewID": "UR103045121", "Content": "Even if this hotel is in Shatin it is actually closer to the airport and Disneyland.

I was not happy with the hotel at all and doubt I will stay here again. I booked a superior twin room but it was certainly not superior to me. I was fine with the location of the hotel, as the MTR is very convenient and cheap in Hong Kong (just get an Octopus card). Likes - Large spacious room and comfy bed - Complimentary toiletries and slippers - Large bathroom with bathtub - Free gym which was pretty well equipped - Free shuttle bus to the Shatin MTR station (New Town Shopping Plaza is attached to the station). If you do not want to wait around for the shuttle bus then you can take the bus (very frequent) or walk (around 10-15 minutes). - Nearby seafood restaurant was fantastic and cheap - Nearby small supermarket was great too Dislikes - Booked a twin room but they gave us a double bed instead. This is unacceptable as we booked months in advance. - Shuttle bus to Disneyland was not free but costs HK$ 140 (return) if I remember correctly - Our room and bathroom seemed quite dated (both rooms definitely needed refurbishing) although they were both clean. Towels were not great either, they were acceptable though. - The curtains were stained and would let in a lot of light in the morning. - The flat screen TV was slightly blurry. - Terrible service. Was kept waiting for ages for the simple requests that we made. I really did not expect this since most of the reviews here about the service are wonderful. Firstly, we waited ages for people to pick up the phone (I think they were screening our calls because we had called so many times about the heating problem before), waited almost an hour for the hotel engineer to come over to check our heater (after a 3 minute inspection he told us what we knew already, it was broken) and finally we waited around 40 minutes for the heater to be delivered. I accept that they are busy during the festive period and that our requests might take a little longer than normal to be looked into but they took ages! - The new temporary heater that they provided us with seemed really old. It would turn itself on and off, so in the end we had to switch it off as the noise was too much even though the room was really cold. - The shower was really weak. - Internet was not free. It was very expensive - Check in/ check out took a while as reception was always busy although this was acceptable as they did not keep us waiting too long. Also, my sister and brother stayed at this hotel at the same time as us (on the same floor too) but they were much luckier. They did not have any issues with the beds, heating or TV. Their room was also slightly bigger which does make a small difference in my opinion. They did not have to deal with housekeeping much (if ever) so they had no problems with their service.

The new rooms are nice but have a love hoel feel with mirrors on the walls and even on the ceiling. That was ok but everything else was white, it gave the room a, IMO, a cold sterile uncomfortable feel. The normal rooms are massive, enough space for 2 beds and still space for a couch, coffee table and a chair. In terms of comfort, maybe 'cos its still new, the bed, pillows and comforter in the iCLUB rooms are great, very very comfy nights sleep. The downside. It is in Sha Tin which is in the middle of nowhere. Its HKD100 to get to Tsim Sha Tsui. The last hotel shuttle to the hotel leaves the city at 10;15pm. So you ahve to plan everything to fit the schedule. To tke the trains = 3 trains and a taxi ride from the city. Another downside is that the hotel caters to mainland chinese groups, unfortunately this makes the hotel very noisy. My pet peeve was the constant shouting in the hallways and the constant knocking on my door, they seem to always find the wrong rooms.

The hotel itself was pretty good and exceptional value compared to hotels in Kowloon. The room was immaculate and unexpectedly large. It's easy to get to from the airport (the A41 bus stops right outside) despite being out of the main tourist areas. However, if you are thinking about staying here there are two things that you need to consider. First, if you have a basic room only package then paying for other things at the hotel can work out quite expensive. The restaurants appeared comparatively pricy (especially for breakfast) and, as has been writen previously, they will charge you 70HKD for an hour's internet use in the hotel business centre. Secondly, the location. It's a 15 minute walk to the KCR station and the interconnected shopping plazas at Sha Tin. Although it's not an unpleasant walk, it does add significantly to the time taken to travel around. If you don't want to eat in the hotel there are many restaurants in the Sha Tin shopping malls and in the local area close by. However, unlike previous posters, I didn't see many English menus in the smaller, and better value, restaurants (these places are, quite rightly, geared to local customers so there is no reason why they should have them) and would have missed out on a lot of delicious food if not for the fact that my wife is Hong Kong Chinese. If time is tight in Hong Kong and you need to be closer to the main attractions then the Riverside mightn't be the best bet for you. However, if you enjoy being in an area that is probably more representative of typical Hong Kong life than Kowloon, then you could do much worse.", "Date": "February 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchurch, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cExcellent breakfast\u201d", "Author": "mightymonkey", "ReviewID": "UR8449024", "Content": "We just spent two weeks at the Regal Riverside Hotel in Sha Tin, and were really impressed with it. First of all, I would recommend that you shop around for the best price. I found the best price on asiarooms, and that was about 45GBPounds per night for a twin, including buffet breakfast for two. The shuttle bus from the airport costs 110 HKDollars one way per person, and the bus leaves about once every 75 mins. If you miss a bus and have to wait around, that doesn't matter, because there are plenty of shops and restaurants at the airport, and then you walk over to the Regal Airport Hotel (2 mins) to wait for the bus in air-conditioned comfort there! Once on the bus, it takes about 40 mins to get to the hotel. I wondered about getting public transport to the hotel, but having taken the shuttle bus, I would recommend that others do the same. It's hassle-free and the airport express train plus a bus/taxi/KCR, would cost more or less the same, if not a bit more. So, for convenience and time, the bus would be the best bet. I emailed the hotel two days beforehand, and my name was put on a list at the Regal Hotels airport travel desk - very easy to find as soon as you come through the arrivals gate. Coming back to the airport was the same - we booked it a day before, and it was a stress-free journey from hotel to airport. Incidentally, the shuttle bus also stops at Disneyland between the airport and the hotel, so this would also be convenient, if you chose to go there. The hotel itself is fine. The room was cleaned everyday; notices were often put under the door to notify you of fire alarms, telephone checks, extreme weather warnings (in our case, a Level 8 Typhoon!) etc; we had a variety of TV channels, including about 4 English ones and all the usual that you would expect from a hotel. We didn't have a room overlooking the river, but that didn't bother us, because the view was pretty nice anyway, especially at night when all the lights appeared. During the day, there was a lot of cloud, but we could see a high school and green hills. There was a swimming pool, but we didn't use it although we had our swimming gear with us! It's surrounded by rooms, and a restaurant, so those less self-conscious might be happy to use it - I wasn't! We did have a massage, which was excellent, and just what we needed. An hour cost about 300HKD. The breakfast was excellent. It catered to all tastes. There was (prepare yourself) -fried rice, baked beans, ham, sausages, hash browns, spring rolls, samosas, miso soup, fresh made-to-order omelettes, toast, patisserie goods - mini croissants etc, juice, cereal, tea, coffee, broth/congee and extras, dim sum, fruit, salads.. and maybe more that I can't remember! I was highly impressed, as I wasn't sure what to expect beforehand. It's worth paying the extra for the breakfast, unless you are willing to wait until you get to New Town Plaza everyday and look for a cafe or bakery to get something. The New Town Plaza plays a major role in any stay at this hotel. It's just across the river, so a 10-15 min walk, or a 2 min bus ride. Jump on any bus which says 'Sha Tin Town Centre' or 'Sha Tin KCR Station'. Depending on which bus you hop on, it can cost 2.50-4 HKD. The smaller buses are cheaper, I paid 4 once on a fully air-conditioned double decker bus. If you take 299 or 284, it costs 3.10 - either pay by swiping an Octopus (travel) Card or with the exact change, which you throw into the metal money box. You can buy an Octopus card at the KCR station - the staff speak good English. We walked a few times - at night it was warm and breezy, so it was OK, but to be honest, we were so wiped out by the heat and humidity, we mostly took the bus. Mostly a bus would come along every minute or so. We barely had to wait at all. To get back to the hotel from the bus station on the ground level of NTP, take 284 or 299 and it's the second stop. I think 284 goes more often. The Plaza stays open until very late; getting in at 9pm or so, all the shops are still open and the restaurants are full - the place is still buzzing with people. The KCR station is very easy to find in the Plaza. In terms of food, if you can speak a bit of Chinese (I never heard them speak English, and the menus were all in Chinese with no pictures), there is an excellent and cheap restaurant about 20m away behind the hotel. A bowl of noodles costs 18 HKD after 2.30pm! Otherwise, go over to the NTP - plenty of restaurants with English menus. I wouldn't go for the hotel restaurants myself. Apart from the breakfast, I thought they were overpriced. For those on a real budget, there is a 7-11 just behind the hotel as well! We also went to Ocean Park, which was a huge tourist trap. There were soooooo many people there, and there were huge queues for everything - even just to get drinks, it totally put us off going to Disneyland. In Sha Tin we went to the Heritage Museum, which was a bit disappointing. It's a lovely building, but we spent less than an hour there. Maybe we weren't in the mood. The museum shop was really random: it felt and looked just like a UK gift shop, with nothing in it that was related to the museum itself. However, the tea rooms have a set menu everyday for 40 HKD, and we both agreed that it was probably the cleanest place we had eaten all fortnight! Despite my happiness with the hotel and its location, I wouldn't recommend it to people who are mainly going to be visiting Hong Kong Island, Kowloon etc. For us to get to Central it took about an hour (maybe a bit less) and so if you are planning on going to Lantau Island, with the KCR, ferry etc, there and back takes quite a chunk out of the day. Personally, I know that if I return to HKG I will stay at this hotel again, because it is well placed for going both north and south, it was clean,the breakfast was good and it was a decent price.", "Date": "August 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201clovely place to stay recommend it definatley!!\u201d", "Author": "recommend-2NE1", "ReviewID": "UR6055049", "Content": "what a lovely place to stay we have a large room over looking the river which is beautiful at night as you can see the gorgeous lights, good room size as we had a double bed and to singles a lovely walk over the brigde to the kCR at night or you can save your legs and it would only cost a pound to the station for 4 ppl which come in handy if you was tied at the end of the day or you wanted to say your legs at the start of the day. the hotel has brillant facilities to use the gym lovely size a sauna a steam room a jacuzzi and a lovely swimming pool.. there is a light show at the harbour lookin over at hongkong island where they do lights from the island evrey night 8 oclock hongkong time. you can go to hongkong island for the day by ferrie or by under train and at hongkong island u must go up the peak lovely view and can either go by tram or bus... bus is really long so i would advise you not to take that and its really rocky aswel lol there is many more to do and i think a week and a half should do it..if you decide to book into this hotel make sure you book a room over looking the river!!!! recommend it to any 1 x x", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cShatin hotel\u201d", "Author": "sndaily", "ReviewID": "UR4774279", "Content": "Just returned from a 4 night stay in Hong Kong with our kids.

Going in and out of the city became a little tiresome but for the price I couldn't find a similar quality hotel closer in (we paid HK$ 850 per room per night.", "Date": "March 30, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Regal Riverside Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d302178-Reviews-Regal_Riverside_Hotel-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$91 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">34-36 Tai Chung Kiu Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Sha Tin, New Territories</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "302178", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/92/76/9b/filename-regal-riverside.jpg"}}
