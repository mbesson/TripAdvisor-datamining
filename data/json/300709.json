My time in Berlin was short so I bought a Berlin Welcome Card (the city-wide transport ticket for visitors), expecting it to be waiting for me at the hotel. After all, that's what a hotel concierge is for. It wasn't. I had to buy a travel ticket in order to travel 6km to collect the ticket. The ticket office could have sold me the same ticket across the counter for a lower price. So what was the point of this concierge service? I complained to the hotel that they were being misleading and dishonest by offering this service. But their answer was, and I quote, \"please be assured that this service has nothing to do with our hotel.\" Uh? You sent the email inviting me: \"To help you plan your trip, why not take advantage of the services and recommendations provided by your e-concierge!\" I wrote again and was met with total rejection of my concerns. So there you have it.

There are few shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s near the hotel, but is enough. I recommend Italian restaurant Ischia ( go down the Brandenburgische str. and before you get to crossroad turn right). Hotel is clean, and offers all you need. Staff is OK, but we did not have any problems to solve with them. This hotel is much cheaper then ibis hotels located in the center, that is why we chose this one.

The price was very reasonable (39E paid in advance on IBIS web site) and I was a bit worried because of that. Sounded too cheap to be true. But the hotel turned out to be very nice. The room was a decent size for one, it would do fine for a couple, and the bathroom was in a kind of enclosed pod in the corner. The pictures on the web site are accurate. Nothing more or less. I began to think of this as the IKEA of hotels, because it's cheap, functional, designed well and is clean. In terms of U.S. hotels, it is similar to the Courtyard Marriott or Holiday Inn Express hotels. The bed was firm and comfortable and the hotel very quiet (might have been the winter months, for it didn't seem crowded). They charge for room access to wifi but the cost was not great for several days (I think 39E for 7 days) which was worth it for me as I needed web access. Speed was fine for web and audio. There are small neighborhood restaurants nearby, some with English menus (try the bar Hell odor Dunkel, G\u00fcntzelstra\u00dfe 24-- decent food and beer and English menu). The hotel was very accessible to other parts of town via U-Bann, and the service was very nice. I did the hotel breakfast since I had to leave very early in the morning and found the spread to be fresh and ample. I would go back to this hotel, but if going on vacation would actually try their other location in the Mitte.

Wifey was the co-traveller. This hotel was the nearest to Berlin Messe and that had a reasonable rate. The hotel is nice and clean in the reception and the staff very forthcoming. To the right in the reception area is a free-for-use internet-connected computer. Don't miss the mini-card-stand with rebates at various attractions and restuarant, next to the computer. A bit further in to the right is a bar area. Yet further in is the breakfast room. Skip the breakfast though at the hotel and instead go to the bakery across the street at the corner (go right when exiting the hotel), past the antiques shop. They serve a pretty decent breakfast for \u20ac3,95 (2010-11) with Scandinavian measures measured, and also gives you a chance to mingle with the locals instead of hotel guests... The neighbourhood is located in a semi-commercial condo-something area, so chances to met locals are good. The room we had was on the third floor, accessible via a lift (room-card operated) and halfway down the corridor. The double-room itself was relatively small, but good enough as a sleeping place. When travelling I'm, quite satisfied with a bed and a bathroom. The bed was wide and firm; top-notch! The bathroom featured a showercabin and free soap/schampoo. There is no tub. There is also no safe-box in the room, ask the staff in the reception for free use of their big safe in the luggage room. The room is otherwise pretty basic as mentioned and quite okay if your primary concern is what musems and other sights you should see first. This place is first and foremost a place to crash after a long day. Ibis City Berlin West offers a 24h \"snack service\" which might come in handy, didn't try it though. The hotel offers free taxi-call service, which came in handy. There is a U-bahn close by, Fehrbelliner Platz, approx 200m away. Some bus stops are closer by, but nowhere near as convenient as the U- and S-bahns. If you continue the street to the left when exiting the hotel, approx 300m, you'll get to a small centre-area with shops, supermarkets and some pretty good restaurants. The locals frequent these places, which is a good sign. We tried out croatian food at restaurant Galeb, italian at restaurant Milano and an authentic berliner D\u00f6ner with bread at the \"train place\" just across the street from Milano. There's also a smallish take-away called \"Isst was, trink was\" that wifey said had some really good baclavas. There's also a japanese and a thai restaurant close by, we didn't try those. Close to the Fehrbelliner Ptz U-bahn, is Park Caf\u00e9, serving both caf\u00e9-stuff as well as more diner-like dishes. Things of notice/to beware of in Berlin: * The best apfelstrudel in Berlin I got, was at the Berlin Tegel Airport at Leyssers' or some such restaurant; a big chunk of strudel, creamy not too sweet, lots of apple and no frickin raisins(!). It cost me four Euros but was worth every cent! * Get a U-/S-bahn line map the first thing you do. * The world's most accepted card, Visa, is *NOT* very widely accepted in Berlin except at the bigger places like the Pergamon museum and the tv-tower. Instead the EC-card and Maestro far more accepted. * ATM's are located here and there, but note the withdrawal fees; they can differ quite a lot! * The U-/S-bahn ticket vending machines did not accept neither mine nor wifey's Visa-cards. * Taxi's usually accept Visa.

The area which the hotel is located in, is QUIET but safe. No problems from traffic or shady characters. Breakfast is extra (9.5 euro's I think) but is wholesome. It consists of a self help selection of cheeses, meats, cereals, toast, coffee, juices.... etc etc... Free internet and printer use is available, although this restricted to one computer only. So you have to be a little patient and be flexible with its use. But this comes in very handy for self check-ins. Staff at the hotel are friendly and speak excellent English. A hotel safe can be used to store passports. Also the usage of a locker room next to the reception to store baggage too.

The only drawback was no tea making facilities in the bedrooms, but drinks could be purchased in the bar area. The four of us tended to meet in there to make plans for the day., and have a drink later in the evening after a full day out. The buffet breakfast cost 9 euros and are good, value with fresh fruit salad, yoghurt, hot rolls and croissants, cold meats, cheeses, fruit juice, tea and coffee. The staff were polite, friendly and helpful and their English was excellent. Public transport is excellent, Up to five people can travel in all the zones in Berlin for 15 euros per day, on the buses, overground and underground trains. It is clean, punctual,and fast. Individual tickets can also be purchased. The transfer from Tegel airport to the hotel on the bus and underground costs 2.10 euros each and allows up to 2 hours travel. You need to be fairly fit to carry your cases up and down the underground steps as not all the stations have lifts. The city bus tour gives an interesting insight to a new traveller, and you can get on and off to take a further look at somewhere you find particulary interesting. The Etheopian restaurant, Lalibela, around the corner from the hotel is excellent value, and the food is good.
