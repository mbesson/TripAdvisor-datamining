Great stay! Very reasonable price. The room was big and comfy. Amazing shower! So much character. The breakfast (included) was amazing with a variety of juices, homemade yogurt, breads, meats, etc. A great atmosphere overall. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They kept our bags after check-out to let us explore Berlin. The location was great!! Hotel is within walking distance to Zoo Garten train station and major shopping. I highly recommend this hotel. We booked a room with our own private toilet and shower. They have other cheaper options. When in Berlin, I will always stay at this hotel.

Hotel Pension Columbus is a true family pension, run with great care and dedication. The 19 rooms are all different - some with bathrooms, some without. All have very high ceilings and hark back to an earlier Berlin. Breakfast is a treat and, with a selection of magazines and the daily paper auf Deutsch, one could linger in the breakfast room for an hour. Chris and her husband run a wonderful place. They are truly helpful and cheerfully dole out suggestions for dinner, shopping and transportation. They react flexibly to client needs.

This time around, I was travelling with my fianc\u00e9e. My first interaction with the hotel was the morning before our arrival, when I called to advise that we may be cancelling at the last minute, due to my fianc\u00e9e possibly not being able to fly. The woman on the other end (one of the owners, I believe) was very sympathetic and told me not to worry -- if I had to cancel at the last minute due to illness, we would not be charged for our room. Win! On our arrival, we were quite disappointed by the fact that our room, which on the booking website was listed as a \"double room\", had two single beds at opposite ends of the room. When we asked about alternatives, we were told that no rooms with double beds were available. The beds in this room were also a bit on the uncomfortable side, and the heating in the room was ineffective. The latter problem was solved by extra blankets, which were immediately provided upon request. Having arrived in Berlin from a week with relatives who live without an internet connection, we were keen to get online. As on my previous visit to this hotel, I found the WiFi coverage to be spotty at best. There was no coverage at all in our room, nor was there in the few places in the corridor where seating was available. To check our email, we had to stand in the corridor, about six rooms down from ours. And, even then, the connection went in and out. As on my previous stay, breakfast was excellent and plentiful. The female owner (again, I'm assuming she's an owner -- my understanding is that the hotel is run by a couple) not only put on a delicious spread, but was also very friendly and helpful in providing suggestions and directions for sightseeing. On the whole, I was still quite happy with the hotel, especially for the money. My fianc\u00e9e does not want to return, on account of her uncomfortable bed.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cA loving home away from home\u201d", "Author": "NielsBSDk", "ReviewID": "UR85036397", "Content": "The place to be in Berlin.

Room sizes differ greatly, we had a large double with plenty of space. Our friend, who had stayed there before, had a reasonably sized single.

The hotel is close to a subway station, only one stop away from the Zoological Gardens, in West Berlin. I was a little confused when I arrived, as I had to ring a doorbell at what looked somewhat like an apartment building. This is more of a reflection on my inexperience than the hotel, but I thought it might be worth mentioning, for others like me, who end up going to the Hotel Pension Columbus and start to worry when they don't encounter a lobby :-) Once my initial confusion passed, and I got upstairs to the third floor, I received a very warm welcome. I was first shown the room I had booked -- one without a shower (shared bathroom facilities on the floor) -- but was then offered, at no additional charge, a room with a shower (WC still shared, across the corridor). I accepted the better room, of course. The gentleman (sorry, I can't remember his name) was very friendly, and answered the many questions I had. He also suggested a very nice Thai restaurant (called Lychee) nearby, which was perfect for a vegetarian student who was travelling on a tight budget. The room itself was quite simple, but everything was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. When I got up in the morning, I was greeted, and asked what I would like to eat and drink, before I made it to the breakfast room. Breakfast was both delicious and plentiful. Having remembered that I had asked for a recommendation for a vegetarian dinner the night before, the owners went to the trouble of preparing a cheese plate for me, in lieu of meat options. I thought this was a very nice touch. All in all, I thought this hotel was great. The only problem I had was that I was unable to connect to the free wifi, both with my laptop and my phone. Not a big deal, but slightly annoying.

The hotel is on the 3rd floor of a beautiful 1906 building, one of the few remaining after WW2, when 80% of Berlin was flattened; what's more, apart from the addition of an elevator, the building remains unaltered and retains all original features and rooms; no partitioning through cornices and windows here! And it's right in the heart of the city, with easy transport access, with 3 good restaurants/bars practically adjacent to the hotel - yet all bedrooms are totally quiet, as they overlook inner squares. My wife was initially unimpressed to find that, although a shower had been added in one corner of the room, the lavatory was across the corridor, as not all rooms have en-suite facilities. Nor was she impressed with the mishmash of 50's & 60's furniture, although the exceptional cleanliness of everything pleased and mollified her. At breakfast next day, in a lovely room overlooking the street (also oddly, but cleanly furnished) we were delighted by the food and the hospitality, which never waned for a moment throughout our 4 day stay. Nothing was too much trouble and the lovely couple who own and run the hotel could not have been kinder. At breakfast on the 3rd day our hostess presented us with a tray on which were 2 champagne flutes, a small bottle of bubbly, and a candle - with profuse apologies that she had not noticed from the registration card that it had been my birthday the day before!!

We had arrived at 6am on the boat train from Sweden, crammed in a 6-berth sleeper cabin and arrived at the Zoogarten station totally whacked. We chose the Columbus from a display of accommodation in the area as it looked like it once was a grand residence and it was only 500m from the station. The room rate, including breakfast was then only DM125 ($AUD100) including as much as you can eat continental breakfast for 2. A very quiet hotel, we slept for the first 12 hours! Stayed 1 week and loved it. The second time we stayed here was in September 2005, again for a week, using it as a base for further exploring Berlin. The room rate was then 90 Euro ($AUD147) a day, a modest increase in tariff considering many other places just replaced the DM sign with a Euro sign!. The hotel is run by a wife and husband team who still remembered us from 5 years earlier! Breakfast is still as good and the establishment is spotless! A few words about the facilities; There is a lift to the hotel which is on the third floor and you are given two keys: one to get into the lobby and one for your room. Security plus! The rooms all have a handbasin; showering and toilet facilities are one per passageway (never bothered us, at home we don't have a bathroom in our bedroom either!) There may be \"superior\" rooms that have built-in facilities. The rooms are large by hotel standards and are equipped with TV, (maybe a phone also; we used our mobile phone, so didn't notice), good solid furniture and comfortable bed(s). See the posted photo for our room (our second stay; the room we had in 1999 was quite a bit larger again). Anything you need (such as champagne kept cold in the hotel's kitchen fridge) - just ask. Our hosts also provided information on things to see and do, with a local touch! Within 300m are some famous landmarks (the Kaiser Wilhelm gedachtnis kirche), Hard Rock Cafe, bus tours, eateries and yes, an erotic museum. In short, to us it was like a home away from home! Most other guests were of similar age (40-60) and very polite. Speaking to them at breakfast indicated many were \"return\" clients.
