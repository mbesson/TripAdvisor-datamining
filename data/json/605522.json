Here's the real scoop: -Small rooms - true. But not far off from a typical NYC hotel room. -Rooms also have thin walls, no doubt. But, unless you get stuck with crazy neighbors, you are probably OK. We had a neighbor who occasionally let off a scream (assume she had bad dreams?) but no points docked for the hotel for this. =) -Beds are standard. Nothing to write home about, but sufficient after a long day of walking the city. -Staff - all friendly, varying levels of English speaking. Most very hospitable. Actually it is the owner of the hotel who was the least welcoming during the stay (dare I say grumpy old man). -Breakfast is on the top level, enclosed. Includes cheeses, meats, some pastries and a variety of spreads. Apple Tea and coffee included. Nice view from here. -Location is excellent for sight seeing such as the \"blue mosque\" and others nearby. Grand Bazaar, subway/tram station, restaurants, all within a hop skip and jump of the hotel. -Tip: A subway/tram ride from IST airport is about $2US, 90 minute ride, including one transfer of trains. Not a bad deal! Your return trip, can purchase a shared bus ride for $7US from the local travel agency across the hotel. Overall the hotel is average. There are many - MANY hotels in this and surrounding areas. Do your homework. Consider this among others. It provides a decent stay for a relatively good price, in a location excellent for sightseeing. One more note: The Musim prayers are 5X a day in IST. The proximity of the Mosque's to the hotel mean at 6am loud...LOUD prayers are broadcast for the entire neighborhood to hear. Even the soundest sleeper should be prepared for a 6am \"wake up call\". This may not be different from other hotels nearby other mosque's/loud speakers. -", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cto be avoided\u201d", "Author": "salim o", "ReviewID": "UR118556054", "Content": "very small room, Small beds, Constarction going on, Service is zero, No one speaks english, breakfast is a desaster", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Holiday at Abella Hotel !\u201d", "Author": "tribonzaii", "ReviewID": "UR113011751", "Content": "\u00c4\u00b0stanbul and Sultanahmet is one of great place in the world and during my holiday I stayed Abella hotel , room is little small but very clean and very good staff , breakfast yummy :) they alwasy smile and helpfull ..definitely I ll come back to Sultanahmet again ...", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cdisappointed\u201d", "Author": "anda70", "ReviewID": "UR102643259", "Content": "On arrival (8 pm) told the twin room we had booked was not ready and wouldn't be for a couple of hours as it had water problems...but they had 1 room left which was a triple.

This time wasn't an exception - we were invited to a cafe that absolutely didn't seem to me prominent in any way. But then I realised it was just a ground floor of a small hotel. The manager led us to a terrace on the roof and - it's not a joke - you can really gasp in amazement because of its picturesque panoramic view. The seaside is always somewhere close to you if you are in Sultanahmet, but the buildings are erected so densely that you can hardly enjoy its view. But from that roof you can observe everything in the city from Galata Tower and Bosphorus to hills on the asian side and ships on the road of Sea of Marmara. Usually in a place with such an advantage they don't carry about something else - but that could not be said about Abella. The waiter is really friendly and a kind of polyglot, the dishes are delicious, too (I can't stand anything with fish so I can warrant at least meat). Even the prices are pretty reasonable, especially for expensive Sultanahmet. The most serious thing I can size upon is several white stains on the roof left by seagulls circling above Istanbul:-) Thank you for my last admirable glance at Istanbul, Abella!

The staff are very friendly and are happy to arrange tours and things at reasonable prices, though I recomend you try and do things on your own. I can't help but feel that on the same road I could have had a hotel with a better view of the Sultan Ahmet Mosque. the rooms are slightly cramped, but I don't think you can expect any different in this area where space is a pricey commodity. I would personally live slightly away from the area and walk or commute to the Blue Mosque (Istanbul has phenomenal transport).
