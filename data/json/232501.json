I can genuinly say that everything nice you read, as i read, is actually spot on, (the only downside, which i had read prior to us going) was to ask for a room at the front, as they are more spacious, but we had a choice of a front view with twin beds or another room with no view with a double bed, and as we wanted to be a lil romantic, we chose the latter and a double bed without the view is what we got. So all in all very pleased, although the room was only 4mtrs by 3 mtrs, it was on the small side and a lil cramped, but hey! that was our choice, As others have said, you wont need a taxi ( from airport to hotel is 45 euro each way) the breakfast was superb, the location and staff were wonderful,very peaceful, no drunken idiots shouting outside,just the sound of peace and birds( the feathered variety!!) Just 10 mins walk to shops or a gentle 20min walk to red light district. Would we stay again -YES, but next time we would ask for a more spacious room at the front, as others have said, So go go go, and enjoy your stay as much as we did.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA good place to stay\u201d", "Author": "SLK_Student", "ReviewID": "UR127404993", "Content": "This place was our saviour.

Free breakfast is awesome with your choice of bread, meats, hard boiled eggs, cereal, and juices. It's in an excellent location with beautiful canal views but is not so close to the center that you get stuck with noise. We stayed in a street side room so you could hear the people outside but everyone in Amsterdam is basically in bed early so it isn't a problem. The only thing we didn't like was the fact that the shower doesn't have a door; it's one of those open to the bathroom showers with just a small piece of glass wall near the shower head so the bathroom gets kind of wet but they give you plenty of towels so if you just put one on the floor it's fine.

Singel hotel is literally up the road and round the corner from the main station so was perfect.

We had room 25 which is a double (although it was actually twin beds pushed together) and looks right out onto the canal. Yes the room was small but this seems to be a feature of Amsterdam architecture rather than the hotel being mean with space. Look at the buildings in Amsterdam - they are TINY.

The desk is open 24hours which is a boon when you have no idea when you will return.....The TV selection is not bad - for english speakers there was BBC 1,2,3, CBBC and some generic US channels.

As always, it's subjective as I was in a room that might be totally different to others, but what I had (Room 22 I think) was TINY. I appreciate that it used to be a Merchants House and it's lots of little rooms, etc, but it doesn't make for a very comfortable stay, especially if you need to spend a little more time in your room than just sleeping. We did have a glimpse of the canal, however, so that was nice, but for two adults, with bags, it was a squeeze. It's also is a slightly seedy part of town - didn't bother us too much, but something for others to consider. It also seemed a bit on the pricey side, and I think with some more research we could have found a bigger, better room for less, although we did hit a weekend with a special event (the marathon) so things were more expensive. Being an old house, it's also a bit noisy internally, so you can hear people chatting, doors slamming, tv's etc. On the plus side, the room was clean, the service was efficient, the breakfast was good, the location handy. One thing that annoyed the hell out of me - as it does in any establishment - is loud piped music in the breakfast room. I am a fan of NO music as it's a time to wake, reflect, chat, work out the day, but if there is anything it should be LOW in volume, and relaxing. NOt so here.

The Singel tries and I give them credit for that but it doesn't always succeed. Our first floor canal view bedroom was clean, large (for Amsterdam)and decently equipped if decorated in a somewhat non-descript style. The large windows let in a lot of May sunlight and watching the foot, bike and boat traffic going by outside was addictive. However, the bathroom was a totally different story. While clean, it had a distinctly tired and played out green institutional look and feel with blackened tile grout and a stained, speckled linoleum-like floor. The institutional theme at the Singel was also picked up in the page of \"guest rules\" that one had to sign upon checking in (one rule included a very specific charge of Eur47.25 that would be assessed if you had a guest in your room that stayed longer than two hours). You also had to pay in full upon check in and agree to surrender you room key to the front desk every time you left the hotel. I understand that these rules are in place to control a certain type of \"element\" from staying at the Singel but overall it makes it seem a bit like checking into a halfway house. But a better hotel probably does cost about another 100 Euros per night and the Singel is in a good location (within easy walking distance of Central Station but still by a relatively quiet canal) and does include a decent breakfast (though service can be chaotic especially when busy). So, the Singel is kind of a compromise.

I had been staying in some higher-priced hotels but by the time I got around to the Singel I was watching my pocketbook a bit so was glad to find a place in the center city that seemed nice for about half as much as I had been paying elsewhere. I also was intrigued by their advertising the \"Smallest Single Room in Amsterdam\" as I am a fan of creative use of small spaces and really wanted to see how they would make this attic room work, especially given that it had its own bathroom as well! I am a solo traveller and not terribly large or tall, with good flexibility, so I was able to fit myself and my two small bags into the room just fine. It was like a little attic maid's room under the roof slope - very romantic and Sara Crewe-like. There was a bed, a tiny desk and a fairly large (given the space) closet, and that took up just about all the space in the room. It's fine if you're going to be spending most of your time in the room in bed, as I was because I was out sightseeing all day and basically came home to sleep. I would have liked it if the electrical outlets were spaced better - one of them by the door would not hold my US voltage transformer as the door was in the way, and the other was right over the bed which is a fire hazard. Other than that, the bed was comfy, the closet held all of my luggage just fine, and the TV was viewable from my bed. Over the bed was an attic-type window that pushed open allowing lots of fresh air (and unfortunately, the occasional bad smell from a vent on the adjoining roof, fortunately this was only an occasional problem). The bathroom had everything about helf the size it normally would be - a little sink, a little toilet, and a shower in a teeny space. Your knees go under the sink when you sit on the toilet and when you shower, you may find yourself bending over the other conveniences in order to rinse (and everything in the room gets damp/ steamed) but it's way preferable to having to share a bathroom and I was impressed that they were able to fit it all in there. Overall it was a comfortable arrangement for a solo traveller with not much luggage and a sense of adventure. If you don't have good mobility or if you are very tall or fat, or if you need to work in your room, it might not work for you. I did think that the bathroom floor as well as the carpet in the bedroom could have been a little cleaner, especially under the bed (lots of litter under there when I looked) and I was disappointed that the in-room safe was stuck in the \"locked\" position and would not work at all. The deadbolt lock to my door was also old and sticky and at one point I had a hard time getting it undone. Everything else in the room worked fine. On the other hand, I was absolutely THRILLED that the place had FREE TV including movie channels and some English-language channels, and that it also had FREE WI-FI that worked very well. After paying an extra 24 euros at the last \"four star\" hotel to have Internet in my room for one day, I was so happy to find a place that wasn't charging for it at all! This is very important to me and I really wasn't expecting the service to be available at a cheaper hotel so I was very happy. Breakfast is mostly cold - meat, cheese (very good), hard boiled eggs, cereal and a variety of bread which you can toast. I was fine with this because I don't like to get up and eat a huge plate of hot breakfast normally. There is a 24-hour snack bar at the reception and the prices for things like a Coke were more reasonable than at other places I stayed. The staff were very nice and helpful throughout my stay and helped me with booking transportation to the airport and printing out a travel voucher.

I booked the Hotel via their own website and, as both my partner and I are smokers, I reserved a Smoking Room as usual. Upon our arrival at the Hotel, the receptionist waited until I'd paid the full amount upfront, (standard practise) before informing us that they couldn't provide us with a Smoking room as we'd requested. I mentioned to the Receptionist that we both smoke and that if we'd known that they couldn't allocate us a Smoking Room we would've stayed elsewhere, (which I'm sure they'd known). The Receptionist responded by saying that Smoking Rooms are allocated on a first come, first served basis so she obviously knew as soon as we'd booked that they wouldn't be able to satisfy our request. The only room they had available which was a smoking room was a triple room for an extra 150 Euros for the use of an ashtray! Of course I had to take the room and pay the additional money much to my dismay but it seemed pointless staying somewhere where we were unable to smoke, especially in March! I raised the issue with another member of Staff the next day and produced my Confirmation Letter, he pointed out that my booking was merely a \"Request\" and not a confirmation and therefore they didn't have to guarantee a smoking room for us. I told him that we requested a Smoking Room obviously because we both smoke and that it's not convenient for us to have to stand outside in the cold just to smoke. He said that they don't notify guests of whether or not their room requests have been fulfilled prior to arrival but in the 13 times I've stayed in Amsterdam I've never encountered this before. In addition to paying 150 more than what I was expecting, the triple room had 3 single beds in it with 3 single duvets, so my partner and I had to sleep seperately for the whole break. The room had no Fridge or Tea/Coffee making facilities, and the cleaning which was done daily didn't seem to include Hoovering or linen replacement.

Firstly, the location is great. It is very close to the Centraal Station. In fact, having not known the close proximinity of the hotel, we grabbed a cab and paid a 15-euro flat \"zone\" rate to ride a distance that later took us about 10 mins to walk. Total rip-off. Plus, the cab driver charged us an additional 2 euro fee per each suitcase. Very surprising. So unless you are traveling with really huge luggage, there's no reason not to stroll down Singel Canal to the hotel. Other than the location, which puts you within easy reach of all public means of transportation and many of the city's key attractions (be sure to take one of the water canal tours - very informative and convinient), the hotel's biggest \"pro\" was the incredibly pleasant and helpful staff. I travel throughout Europe a lot and this level of service (which we've come to take for granted in U.S.) isn't so common on this continent (complete opposite to Paris' and Brussles' four-star hotels we had visited days earlier). All of the front desk attendees spoke very decent to fluent English and were very accommodating if we had any special requests. There's an elevator (not common). The rooms are very clean and decent size by European standards. The \"double\" rooms actually have a large size bed rather than two twins pulled together (as you often find in Europe) which creates an uncomfortable devision in the middle of the bed. The furniture was in very good condition and in clean and simple style typical of these northern countries. A large window spanning almost half a wall. Variety of television options in English. My laptop picked up a wireless internet signal, but it wasn't very strong. The breakfast room offers 24-hour access to a computer with high speed internet and my laptop had a nice strong (and free :) wireless signal there as well. After checking into some other options we had considered when booking hotels, I realized that Singel's prices are VERY competitive and the accommodations are quite comfortable with staff that's very pleasant.

The bed was jammed against the wall, so if the person on the inside of the bed (by the wall) wanted to get out, they would have to get the other person to get up first, then roll over to their side to stand up (and watch their head!)

However, all my fears were allayed once we arrived. It was very easy to locate and get to once we had arrived at the central train station from the airport. Less than 10 minutes walk (even with luggage) in a quiet street alongside the Singel canal. I had requested two non-smoking rooms with canal views (I suspect most people ask for canal views!). On arrival we had been allocated a single room with canal view and a double room (with a view of the house next door!). The canal room view did smell of smoke, but after a short time with the window open (all the better to see the nice view) this soon cleared. The double room was marked on the hotel plan as a smoking room, but there was no smell of it in there at all. The rooms were not so much small as narrow - and I've stayed in much smaller rooms in the USA most notably in New York However, for the price, which is a bargain for the central location in Amsterdam this was fine - anyway, its a hotel room, so long as the bed is comfy, how much time are you actually going to spend in there anyway? The hotel is (fairly in my opinion) listed as a three star establishment - we found it clean and comfortable. Some of the fixtures and fittings were a little worn, but again, this wasn't a problem. T The TV has many channels to watch, including many English language ones (many Dutch channels seem to show English programmes with Dutch subtitles), plus three free film channels. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. Always available for advice on somewhere to go to eat (try Humphreys 5 minutes walk away - the service is `relaxed` to say the least, but the three course meal for 20.50 euros is absolutely excellent) or for directions. One reviewer thought that the red light district seemed to have reached this area - not quite true (That's still more than half a mile away on the other side of town). However, there are quite a few `Red Light Window Brothels` on the same street and nearby - however, again, this shouldn't be a problem to most visitors. If you're worried about the very open attitudes to sex and drugs, then Amsterdam is not the place for you. Another reviewer complained about the `complex` instructions for the in-room safe. I can only say that I've seen and used identical safes in hotel rooms all over the world and have never had a problem - certainly didn't with this one either. The buffet style breakfast was typical of most mid-range budget european hotels - just right to get you set up for the day.

Again, the whole romantic valentines night was probab;y slightly affected by the fact that we both kept falling 'down the gap' in the middle!

Having said that, it is fair to warn others who may be staying longer that there are some things worth considering. Looking back on others reviews, I would say that the vast majority of comments are very accurate and I would say look closely at them and see if anything commented on is a 'deal breaker' for you. We were in room 40, which is situated at attic level involving going outdoors over a small section of flat roof to reach the room. It was slippery due to damp weather and if you are at all infirm or intend to go out drinking while you are there, request in advance that you are not given this room. The previous reviewers have comprehensively covered the main issues with this hotel. There is no soundproofing between rooms and we couldn't get to sleep due to a noisy group who talked, laughed, argued, and in the childrens case, whined, long after bedtime. It was loud enough that if we had wished we could have chatted with them without raising our voices much. Be warned...take earplugs just in case you are an 'early to bed, early to rise' type. The room itself was warm and clean and the bed was very comfortable, but the bathroom in number 40 is horrible, very damp with mouldy tile grout. The bathroom itself, other than needing some serious work on the grout, was adequate and was otherwise clean with a good hot shower. My children stayed in room 42, which was at the front of the hotel, again at attic level, and had a nicer bathroom. They all commented on the comfortable beds. As commented elsewhere, the staff are amongst the nicest I have ever come across in a hotel, and were extremely accommodating. Breakfast was more than adequate and everything appeared to be fresh. I would stay in this hotel again as it is very central and in a quiet street without a lot of hubub. The aforementioned prostitutes in the window at the other end of the street do exist but, hey, it is Amsterdam and it is not a sign that you are in a bad and dangerous area. One word of caution for car drivers. There is metered parking on the street, but if you overstay your time, they do clamp in Amsterdam, as parking spots are at an absolute premium.", "Date": "February 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Mateo, California", "Title": "\u201cClean, convenient, comfortable\u201d", "Author": "snickelfritz76", "ReviewID": "UR6635798", "Content": "This is a small hotel that is located about a 5 minute walk from the central train station.

Check in 4pm and check out is 12, there is a room to store left luggage. My room did not have a canal view unlike my friends (contact the hotel and request a canal view), but we were only in our room for sleeping, etc. The hotel staff were polite and very helpful. Breakfast was also good (cereals, yoghurts, bread, ham, cheese, boiled eggs,etc.), but they could do with more than one toaster. The bedrooms were not overly spacious, but they were clean. The beds were very comfortable with extra pillows if required. There was a free safe and a TV with same English channels. The bathroom was small but OK - it was basically a wet room (as I have one at home it was not a problem). There was a shower, sink and toilet. There was good water pressure and plenty of hot water (a hairdryer was also provided). It must be remember that the Singel is made up of 3 canal houses - so bathrooms were never going to be big. The rooms were cleaned daily and fresh towels provided. The walls or doors let in some noise, e.g. returning guests at night - but it was not a major problem as I slept well while staying at the Singel. All floors could be accessed using a small lift.

Well heated rooms. No street noise at all in back rooms (and I bet the canal side is fairly quiet too as there is hardly any traffic). There is a small elevator. Cons: room (a double) is indeed quite small, and no view in off street rooms (although it is quiet accordingly). our bathroom was so-so in terms of cleanliness (the shower is one end of the bathroom and is not separated by a tub or partition, so water can get all over the floor; there was a musty odor to the shower and curtain). decor is charmless. Smoke (both kinds) and chatter from other rooms often drifted into our room, which happened late at night given a high number of young late night revelers the week we were there (or maybe every week in Amsterdam).

Someone wrote a review saying that they wouldn't go again as there is a couple of brothels nearby. Yes there is a few brothels further down Singel Canal (about 3-4 min walk away from the hotel) but they are nothing compared to the actual red light district and brothels etc are regulated by the police in amsterdam so you wont have any trouble, also if you are like me and my girlfriend and dont like the idea of the brothels etc.. just walk a bit faster when you are near them!

But our room was rather cold, the double bed consisted of two twin beds pushed together, and since we were given a room on the first floor, it was rather loud and not at all private (we could hear the people talking and opening doors in the reception all the time). We asked for another room but were told that there were none left - however, someone checked out while we were standing there, yet for some reason they wouldn't let us have their room. Reception was very friendly but not terribly helpful. Rooms were rather sparse (don't expect any amenities in the bathroom), but breakfast was tasty. All in all, though, I can't complain. The hotel was reasonably priced for Amsterdam, but I wouldn't pay that much for a hotel of this quality in any other city. For a one-night stay, it was perfectly adequate. I would probably look elsewhere for my next trip to Amsterdam, but wouldn't mind staying here again if I couldn't find anything else.", "Date": "November 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, England", "Title": "\u201cGood No-frills Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Galliworm", "ReviewID": "UR4123464", "Content": "Stayed at the Singel in November '05 and overall it was a pleasant stay. The location can't be faulted - It was a 15 minute train ride from the airport and a 5 minute walk to the hotel from Central Station. All the city has to offer is within easy walking distance or a quick tram ride. The rooms are clean but small and basic with a good shower. They sorely lacked tea/ coffee making facilities though. The very friendly and helpful staff are always smiling.

The bathroom, although kept well, was very small as well. The double bed however, was wonderful and so very comfortable - top points for that! As a young couple staying the weekend though, we were woken up each morning by (1) the people coming & going in the lift next door to us; (2) the hotel residents having breakfast & the kitchen cleaning up afterwards, as it's all on the same floor, and (3) the children running and shouting in the foyer, as it's also on the same floor as Rm 7. If you're a young couple staying there, who enjoy a sleep-in the morning after going out the previous night, ask for another room! On a very good note however, the hotel was ideally place - so close to the station, shopping streets, coffee shops, dam square, cafe's and of course, about 10 minutes' walk from the red light district! The staff at the hotel were also really kind and accommodating. If you can get over the noise and the tiny room, then it's the place for you!

The apartment was exceptionally clean with good facilities that would be expected in an everyday apartment.
