The public is invited to attend prayer services, and one can request a tour of the private rooms of Saint Brigitta.

Because the hotel is run by nuns, at times their attitudes become an issue. It also meant that their schedule dictated when you could do things like settle the bill and have breakfast (8 am - 9 am, unless special arrangements are made). I have travelled primarily as a single since 2006, and the single room (NUMBER 23) they put me in initially measured less than 11 feet by 11 feet, inlcuding the microscopic bathroom. The twin bed was the worst I'd slept in since 1974, It had a slope and a trough, which made sleeping difficult. The shower curtain was a joke, and toilet paper and a lot of other stuff got wet from the morning shower. They put me into number 19 the next day, and the room and bathroom were much larger and better organized. Be aware that the rooms don't have TV, and the TV in the lounge doesn't get any English-speaking channels. The hotel also does not provide room safes, and you must ask to use a hair dryer or get more soap or shampoo. Breakfast is adequate - coffee, rolls, jam, cold cuts, yogurt. The hotel is well situated right off the Piazza Farnese and a couple blocks from the Campo de' Fiori. The Campo is a lot of fun, with a ton of pricey restaurants nearby. (If you want reasonably priced food, go to 33 Gubbonari to Voglia Pizzaria Spaghetteria.) The hotel's site and cleanliness enable it to get very high room rates. Save you initial emails from the hotel, as they raised the rates 10 euros/night per room between when we reserved and when we checked out.

My husband and I spent a good amount of time deciding where to stay during our visit to Rome in June 2008 and we have discovered a little piece of heaven.

It is simple is its traditional yet elegant decor which gives it a wonderfully peaceful ambiance after the intensity of sightseeinging in Rome. There is no curfew.

If you haven't read it, the description in Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging is far more accurate. They describe the place as simple wth sub-par staff. On a positive note, the location is outstanding and a very convenient area from which to base your Rome stay. It's a close walk to all the major sights. In addition, the location on Piazza Farnese gives it a certain charm. The Room: We stayed in room #29, which is one of their \"family\" rooms (we wanted a double). The room was reasonably clean but very simple. The floors were cold and hard, not wood like in other rooms. The bathroom looked reasonably clean, but the toilet smelled slightly of urine. Be prepared for thin, air dried towels (stiff and rough). Our room was right on the Piazza, which was interesting because with the windows closed the room was very hot and stuffy. So, we decided to leave the windows open, which made it feel like you were sleeping in the middle of the road - noisy all night long. The Service: While I might be able to overlook the quality of the room, the service was really the icing on the cake. It all started out badly and didn't get any better. We went to the address on the reservation e-mail. However, what they didn't say was that the address on the e-mail is for the church/convent side. So, we were immediately scolded for going to the wrong door. Not exactly welcoming. We decided to try to sleep in on our first day since we were both jet lagged. We were still in our room when they came by to clean it, so we asked that they come back in about 1 hour to 30 minutes. We were told that would not be possible since that would go into their lunch time. So, forget it , we didn't get our room cleaned on the first day. Not a major deal, but a little annoying given the prices they charge. The real topper was when we were asking for advice on where to go and what to see. Our stay in Rome gave us two full days on 5/16/07 and 5/17/07, staying with the nuns the nights of 5/15-5/17. This was not the first stop on our trip, so we were kind of out of it. Anyway, it turns out that 5/17/07 was a religous holiday, the Feast of the Ascension, and the Vatican Museum would be closed. While we probably should have known this, it would have been nice for the sisters to point out that if we were planning to got the Vatican to go on 5/16 and not 5/17. Advice I would certainly expect from a tourist hotel's staff. So, we managed to miss the Vatican Museum (Sistine Chapel) this trip. Finally, we were departing Rome early morning 5/18. Since we were catching a train, we were told we didn't need to book a cab the night before, but that they would call us one in the morning. They would certainly be there at 7:00 am. Well, we went to leave at 7:00 and there wasn't a nun in sight. We ended up walking out to the street and hailing a cab there. Final thoughts: Okay, I'll admit that this probably sounds a bit nitpicky and that I should have a different standard for this place since it is a convent. Well, I would agree with that if this they charged discount prices. At 190 euros + an additional 5% fee for credit card payment, one should be able to expect a little more than a room with a bed.

It was a wise decision and although their accommodations are priced higher than other convents, one cannot get the same value-for-money deal elsewhere in central Rome. Our room was spotlessly clean, the beds were firm, and we enjoyed the delicious home-cooked food of the sisters. Although our room looked out to Piazza Farnese, we were not the least disturbed by any noise. They have no curfew, so we felt quite comfortable about doing a day trip to Siena. The nuns are able to provide special passes for the papal audience at no cost. I guess what we appreciated most is the serenity of the place which provided the best ambience for our Christian pilgrimage. There are daily Masses every morning except Wednesdays (when Mass is at sunset). Upon check-out, we immediately booked rooms for a family vacation 10 months ahead, but guess what, they are almost booked out already.", "Date": "February 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cHow often do you get to stay in a convent?\u201d", "Author": "KiNdReDSpRiT", "ReviewID": "UR4044337", "Content": "Our stay at Casa Di Santa Brigida was a pleasant surprise. We were't sure what to expect based on some of the earlier reviews, but we found the sisters to be warm, friendly and charming. We had no problems during our stay. The location is great because the convent is right next to the popular Campo De Fiori and Piazza Navona, however, the convent itself is in Piazza Farnese, which is nice and quiet. We were able to walk to most of the major sites, but did take the occasional taxi because Rome is so big. Breakfasts were good and the rooms were small but immaculate. We're a married couple and we pushed our twin beds together, so the sleeping arrangement wasn't bad. The rooftop terrace is lovely. One word of caution, making the reservation was much harder than it needed to be. The nuns don't take credit card reservations; instead, they require you to send a personal check for deposit. They weren't clear about this until about the fourth email. Their lack of timeliness in responding to our emails left us worrying about whether our reservation was confirmed.", "Date": "October 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice nuns, some quibbles\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2672759", "Content": "The location, in Piazza Farnese, is great -- near Camp de Fiore, near Trastevere, close enough to the Vatican and all the big tourist sites. The breakfasts are pretty austere, but Americans pig out too much at breakfast anyway, and since Italy is a country for elaborate lunches and dinners, an austere breakfast is a good check. The rooms come with multi-layered windows and shutters that completely block out the sound of the street below, and the nuns are great -- very idiosyncratic, witty, and they speak very little English -- a plus, if you're trying to practice your Italian. On the downside, the air-conditioning is very weak, so if it's summer, the room will be only marginably comfortable. Also, the nuns know how cute they are, so look out for them. I paid my deposit on an agreed rate only to have them jack up the price when it was time to check out. Not wanting to get into a money dispute with a nun, I let that sneaky sister beat me out of almost 50 bucks.

We are going back to Italy for our 2nd anniversary and of course, back to Rome. We would not consider staying anywhere else than with the sisters. We actually almost cancelled Rome as a stop because the sisters e-mailed us that they were booked on the dates that we wanted to stay in Rome. Several days later they e-mailed us back letting us know that they would be able to accomodate us. In 2002 they were nice enough to give us a tour of Santa Brigida's private living quarters and they have always been kind and helpful. The breakfast is simple but very typical of Italy - the best way to assure a great vacation is to keep an open mind and go with the flow. The rooms are simple but very clean.

On the plus side, the location was absolutely tops, on the quiet Piazza Farnesse, just steps from the wonderful Campo di Fiore and a few blocks from the even more wonderful Piazza Navona. We also were able to walk to St. Peter's without any trouble and also to the Forum and Colosseum, although those latter two are quite a walk, but doable. Also, the public rooms in the convent are lovely and there's a very nice rooftop terrace with chairs and a table. Now to the negatives. I guess the over $200 a night they charge is for the location, because the room, breakfast and helpfulness of the sisters left a lot to be desired. The beds in our room (#12) were so squeaky they woke us up at night when we shifted in our sleep. And the pillows were rock hard. Other than that, no complaints about the room other than it wasn't worth the price. Breakfast was disappointing. There was good American-style coffee and orange juice, but other than than, only a hard roll and a slice of meat and/or cheese. One day instead of the meat and cheese, we were served hard boiled eggs. Compared to our breakfasts in other Italian cities we visited, which were buffets including yogurt and fresh fruit and various types of breads, this one was certainly lacking. We had read in the book \"Bed and Blessings\" that the sisters at St. Bridget's were not particularly warm and we found that to be the case. I felt that I was bothering them if I asked for something. One day we wanted a little ice, and after being told we had to wait a few minutes while the sister at the desk finished something she was doing, we were told there was no ice after all, that the sisters had finished it all. We felt like we were tolerated visitors there instead of welcome guests like you would normally feel in a hotel. What irked me the most was the day we went to St. Peter's and one of the sisters at the convent told me I could wear a sleeveless shirt into the church. Well, we got there and of course I couldn't, so we had to leave the walking tour we were a part of and go back outside and scrounge around to find something to cover my shoulders. I ended up having to buy a scarf to cover myself up. We couldn't believe a nun could be that ill informed. So all in all, while the location is simply marvelous, next time we'll opt for a hotel nearby, of which there are several. The pricey Casa di Santa Brigida just isn't worth the money.", "Date": "August 2, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Casa di Santa Brigida", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d253435-Reviews-Casa_di_Santa_Brigida-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$125*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Monserato 54</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00186</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "253435", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/5f/1a/casa-di-santa-brigida.jpg"}}
