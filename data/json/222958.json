He was very helpful and told us to make sure we are up before 10:00 am to get the free breakfast!! The hotel room was clean and very comfortable. We had reservations for a more expensive hotel the following two days, but id have to say that I had a much more comfortable sleep at the comfort inn...go figure! breakfast was delicious and the hotel is located only a short drive to the Sam Adams brewery!!

This was the last hotel we stayed in during a medical stay. This hotel was close to our daughter's home in Neponset, so we stayed here. We got a medical rate again and that included cheery maid service, shuttles to the airport and local hospitals and to the local restaurants. We felt very comfy here, especially the spacious rooms with a desk for our computer and the lovely tv ,watching the playoff games. Breakfasts had some variety, a hot egg and sausage, farina, yogurts, lots of muffins, bagels, and waffle maker. A large screen computer is available to access the internet in the lobby...also a printer. Cafe for breakfast is handy for guests. We had a good time here! It has a shuttle to the T at UMass as well, which was on time. I was happy on my birthday, to hear Mike Miano sing while we feasted on steak tips at the Freeport Inn, too. if you need a souvenir, the Philips Candy House had lots to choose from. there is also a pedestrian bridge near the property so you can walk to Stop'n'Shop or to the CVS store down the road a little. There is a laundry one street up from Stop n shop and a great Wholesale Liquidator store where we found inexpensive luggage and other items. Ti the south, there is a Chicken restaurant and a great gas station for your car, called John's Shell, I believe. To the south, you have access to I-93 and to the north, drive into South Boston via Morrissey when the traffic is bad. Freeport Road will take you to the South Bay shopping Center if the highway is slow.

A nice candy store is next door if you want to take some Boston treats home. An unusual thing happened when the fire alarm went off during the night. The hotel staff handled the event with professionalism and the fire department was there to check on the situation (was a false alarm).

I live about two miles away from this property, but honestly never even acknowledged it existed despite driving by near daily! It's tucked a bit back off the road, on a curve, so it's easy to miss. FIRST off: Location. It is in the city of Boston proper, in the Dorchester section of the city. Dorchester is a working class area with a very diverse population; parts of Dorchester are undergoing serious gentrification and you can find some stunning renovated Victorians not too far from this Comfort Inn. The property is just South of downtown via I-93. It is on a major roadway, Morrissey Blvd, in a business district with some run down houses near by. This does NOT equal unsafe. It is not a fabulous place to stay if you want scenery or quaintness. Frankly, the curb appeal is awful. BUT, it is convenient to both the Interstate and public transportation -- not to mention Lambert's grocery, Dunkin Donuts, and numerous convenience stores. Lock your vehicle, yes. It's a major city, but among the safest of all major cities -- why WOULDN'T you lock your vehicle if there were valuables in it anyhow? I am at odds as to why someone would lower their rating of a property because of this. The hotel is typical Comfort Inn -- appears to be renovated within the last 5 years. My top-floor room was immaculately clean, and had a sofa and wing chair in addition to the adequately comfy queen bed. The bed was no Westin Heavenly Bed, but it was better than the one in my home. Flat-screen LCD TV had all the usual channels, and there was a micro-fridge in the room. The breakfast was in the top half of complimentary hotel breakfasts I've had. Be sure to request a room on the FRONT side of the building. Otherwise, you may hear the rumble of the Red Line subway near the rear of the hotel. The Red Line stops running at about 12:45AM and resumes service around 5AM, FYI, so you won't have any noise issues in the rear of the hotel during the middle of the night. Overall value for this Comfort Inn is an A+. Decent room, good location, convenient and good service for just over $100 a night in Boston? That is almost unheard of. I would recommend this place for budget-conscious travelers who are realistic in their expectations. It would be good for families visiting Boston universities, utilizing Boston-area hospitals, any people not afraid to use public transportation, and road-trippers looking for an overnight stopover. If you want a resort experience, look into the Seaport Hotel in the Seaport district and be prepared to pay $300 per night, $20pp for breakfast and $30 a night for parking.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cthis is a good base, with amenities\u201d", "Author": "itsabouttime7", "ReviewID": "UR120045913", "Content": "we spent a night in boston recently and after researching alot of hotels in boston i realized that prices were steep right downtown and i didn't want to chance priceline. i decided on this hotel which is 7 miles south of boston right off the interstate. it was clean, had restaurant, chocolate factory, supermarket all next door. the best part was that it ran a shuttle every half hour till 11pm to get you to the closest T station.

This hotel was a pleasant surprise! Although the location was not in an \"ideal\" location, my daughter and I were pleasantly surprised by what this hotel had to offer. With traffic backed up on I-93 Northbound, I did not know how to return to Boston. The hotel receptionist on duty at the time recommended that we take the \"T\". This hotel provides a free shuttle every hour and half hour to the JFK/UMass station [Red Line] from 6am until 11pm, and parking our car was free. From the station, we picked up a \"Charlie Card,\" activated it with a credit card, and had an easy time of traveling to and from Boston. We did have to wait for the shuttle to return to the hote,l but it was worth the time and parking fee that we would have had to pay had we driven the car. There was also a Dunkin Donuts within easy walking distance of the hotel as well as a very nice restaurant, Freeport Tavern. There is a candy shop that was even closer. We were also able to make a reservation for the airport shuttle even though we had checked out in the morning. So this was an unexpected surprise. The room itself was clean and everything worked properly. The pillows were great, 4 to each double bed, and the bed itself was pretty comfortable. The location of the hotel is not in a very nice area, but we did feel safe walking to the restaurant in the early evening and to Dunkin Donuts in the morning. Breakfast was OK except for the crowd of people from the bus tour that had stayed in the hotel. We managed to put a plate together and eat in our room. There was a decent selection of breakfast items including cold/hot cereal, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, waffles and pastries, but the scrambled eggs were not very appetizing.

The reason the desk clerk gives is they went to charge my credit card for the room at 4:00 pm and the card was decline. My response is why are you charging me when i have not even checked in as yet. Your guarantee policy on line is that I have until 7 am the next morning to check in before you charge me. Of course no real explanation is given and now they are sold out they have no rooms available. So now i have to get back on the shuttle bus and trek over to there sister hotel the Ramada who has one room left lucky me. Finally by 2 am in the morning i was able to get into a room.

Well it was quite a long walk and when I clocked it with my car the next day I found out it was actually 2.1 miles away and the walk involved walking through parking lots (again I have small children). Needless to say we ended up driving into Boston every day since the shuttle service was a nightmare, not convenient at all. The hotel is also not located in a great place. When you check in they give you a hand out that says they have had recent car break-ins and to remove all electronics from your vehicle. They even go as far to say to clean the area were your GPS suctions onto your window so the potential thief doesn't realize you have a GPS. It surely didn't leave us with the warm and fuzzys. The train also runs directly behind the hotel so avoid getting a room on the backside of the hotel. We stayed in one on the front side facing the parking lot so I'm not sure how much the train is heard from within one of the backside rooms. It's a very small hotel with not a lot of amenities. I surely didn't pay a lot but I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saratoga Springs, New York", "Title": "\u201cCrazy night!\u201d", "Author": "93ruby", "ReviewID": "UR28612805", "Content": "My husband and I and our daughter stayed for one night with parking on April 9th.

I spent 1 week and would like to tell you about it. I arrived in Boston, got my Hertz Rental car and drove with map instructions to the hotel. I had a difficult time finding the place because the area has had major highway construction and rerouting of lanes. The work is finished but it really takes a skilled driver to find the place the first few times. The street in front of the hotel is divided and you can cross either by foot over the bridge, or on the street (dangerous to do so) if you want to go to the supermarket across the street. Use the bridge, save yourself. Check in was fine and my room was above expectations. I used the shuttle the following day to go to the airport to retrieve people arriving from Japan and coming back was fine except that on using the shuttles, I noticed that each driver had a different way to get to and from the hotel. Unless you really need a car, don't bother renting one. Follow the instructions in the lobby and use the shuttle to the T (subway stop) pay $2 and go in town. Its easy, fast and you don't have to deal with the car. Dining: The hotel has a free continental breakfast. There is a microwave in the dining room and you can use it for the oatmeal or hot cereal, hot chocolate, etc. or microwave your own food (at any hour you wish). The dining room provides make your own waffles, scrambled eggs, the usual cakes, toast, rolls, juices. Its not a big dining room but the European tourists that overloaded the hotel thought they were at a sidewalk cafe and the lines waiting to eat were annoying due to many people sitting and reading a paper while having breakfast. Generally it is sufficient, clean, and filling. There is no other dining option at the hotel. You can walk about 1 block to the bowling alley where there is an Italian sandwich shop and pizza, adequate but nothing great. Just okay from my point of view. Next to it is that Phillips Candy shop. At $23 a pound they don't give out samples and the employees act as if they are the owners of the place and keep count of every item. Next to it is the restaurant/bar. Its worth going to. They have a good menu, its like an English pub, many beers and cocktails, good service, the waitresses are patient and helpful especially in dealing with the tourists who did not speak English. I would go back there again even if not staying at the hotel. 4**** for the restaurant. The pool at the Marriot is available for use but I never saw anybody using it. You would have to carry your suit and towel there, walking 1 block or driving over there if you want to go for a swim. The noise factor from the T is not that bad. Maybe it is if you are in the rear of the hotel but the front was quite nice and there is plenty of free parking. The rooms have an iron and an ironing board and there is a laundry on the first floor. You can wash and dry clothes and the washer has an automatic soap dispenser which adds soap and fabric softner so you don't have to worry about obtaining it at all. Some of the staff on the front desk were not too bright and gave me directions which caused me to get lost while looking for a Target store. Others on the front desk are quite competent and accomodating. You can sit in the lobby or in the front of the hotel and have a cigarette and read a newspaper. Most of the guests were in and out all day long. This hotel is not really close in at all but the alternative is staying in central Boston at a much higher rate and generally in a dumpy downtown area. Boston is congested and not that clean in my opinion. The cleaning staff at the Comfort Inn did a very good job, were thorough and efficient. I am always amazed at the slobs who criticize here. Just take a walk through the hallways and look into the rooms that the maids are cleaning. Clothes on the food, bottles all over and debris in the room. These are the slobs that call everything filthy and post it here. Take a good look at the full length mirror and see who the slobs really are. I notice that many Europeans are critical when writing reviews. The very same people who camp in downtown areas in European parks and wear lederhosen or sweat outfits to fancy restaurants seem to think they are in Monte Carlo (playing the lowest denomination slot machine). I would recommend the hotel and would stay there, had no complaints for the 7 days we were there.

The restaruant and pool are not on site but at the adjoing Ramada, owned by the same people. But consider that Boston is usually pretty expensive for hotels, espcially any closer to teh city center. I paid $134 a night, which was far cheaper than other properties closer in, and i was still easily able to get to where i wanted to go. Plus the free parking saves you the $20+ you'd pay downtown. If the weather is nice, and you dont mind walking, it is just over a mile to the nearest T station (not the one the shuttle takes you to), so i avoided the crowded shuttle. Coming back to the hotel was not crowded at all. Breakfast was wonderful, a little more than usually expected. waffles each day, plus other hot foods (including eggs) the other day. not sure why eggs were not both days, but i was very late to eat that first day. If you have kids, there is a very nice city beach/playground just behind the hotel. If you are a runner/biker/walker it is on the developing harborwalk trail system, which i ran on each day i was there, felt safe and was very nice.

The night in question was due to a large group of about 25 - 30 teenagers who checked in late and were loud, continuously knocking at each others' rooms, stomping and yelling the length of the hallways. Called the front desk to request that the group's chaperones be notified to settle their people down. Said they would but basically nothing changed till well past. midnight . That aside, unless you want to pay $350+ for a downtown hotel, this is a very good option. They provide a free shuttle to and from the airport. We waited an acceptable 20 minutes, after our call, for our pickup. The pickup location was across the immediate departure area of the airport and easy to find. We were joining a cruise and they also provided a free scheduled drop off to the cruise terminal. The hotel is located about three subway stops from the center of Boston and they also provide a shuttle to and from the Metro or \"T\" station. This shuttle runs about every 30 minutes but of particular note, the van can carry only about 20 people and serves not only the Comfort Inn but the Ramada Inn and as a consequence can fill quite quickly. There were a few occasions where people could not get on and had to wait 30 minutes for the next pickup with no assurance that they would be able to get on the next one. Think some kind of sign up system is needed. The rooms were clean and functional and unlike some other reviewers we didn't find traffic noise or any other external noises to be any problem at all, and we had a room facing the road. The free breakfast was very good and the selection was more than adequate. The immediate area does not have too many options for resturants. There is a resturant attached to a hotel (think it was a Ramada Inn) - the food was so so, but like some other reviewer mentioned, the service was abysmally slow. Eat in town before you return to the hotel unless you have time to burn. A sandwich shop, a Dunking Doughnut resturant and Bowling Alley Pizza place are closeby.

There isn't a restaurant on the hotel grounds, but there is on the property. Confused? The Philips Family owns 4-5 properties within a 5 minute walk, so there are 2 restaurants a block from the Comfort Inn attached to the Ramada and also a pizzeria/cafe in the bowling alley that they own on the property. There is also a grocery store, Dunkin Donuts and a sub shop across the street from the Comfort Inn. How inconvenient! (sarcasm) It is about 20-25 minutes from downtown Boston, but don't let that discourage you from using this hotel. For $15.00 you can purchase a 7 day Charlie Card and use the Mass Transit unlimited (Bus, Subway..etc). It also takes the headache out of getting around the city. The most interchanges you would have to make from the hotel to any part of Boston was 1 using the T line. Overall, I would stay there again. The distance to Boston wasn't bad and for the price, you can't beat it. It is good for travelers that don't want to spend over $200 a night just to lay your head on a pillow.

The front desk staff was courteous, and since we arrived late in the evening they gave us a free room upgrade as the last available room was between the elevator and ice machine, and the hotel staff did not want to put us there (nice of them, I thought.) The room was perfectly nice, nothing fancy but clean and tastefully decorated. The subway line runs behind the building, and can be noisy at night if you are a light sleeper so maybe request a room at the front of the hotel. The shuttle to the \"T\" station ran every half hour, and we never had an excessive wait. There really isn't anything nearby as far as restaurants or attractions (save for the \"on-property\" restaurants and bowling alley) so one pretty much has to get on the \"T\" to get to almost anything. The \"on-property\" restaurants were nice enough, although it depends on what your definintion of \"on-property\" is. It is about a 2 block walk to the Ramada Inn, which is where the restaurants, bowling alley, AND THE COMFORT INN's POOL are. The area seems safe enough during the day, but I was very nervous walking from the restaurant back to the hotel at night as the area is a bit industrial and not well lit. The walk is especially bothersome if you plan on using the pool, unless you want to take clothes with you and change at the Ramada. In fact, I never used the pool becuase of this inconvenience. The continental breakfast was very good. Belgian waffles, cereal, and bagels/muffins/ toast, and fruit if you get up early enough to get it. This hotel seems to cater to a very international and family-oriented crowd. But, if you have kids who want to use the \"entertainment complex\" you might want to consider the Ramada instead to eliminate the walk. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a nice hotel at a good price. It is not the Ritz, but for a 3-star hotel it was more than adequate.", "Date": "July 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cOK but...what you should know...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5379865", "Content": "Just returned from our stay at Comfort Inn Boston on Morrisey. At first was concerned about the rail line was just outside our room but when we set the A/C to Fan it did mostly drowned out the noise. Wasn't the problem it appeared it would be at first. Restaurants and pool several blocks way was very misleading when you look at their website it sounds like they are on property. It was a very good restaurant overall but the walk was more than we expected. It rained while we were there so could have been a problem. Staff was friendly but some of the information that gave about Trolley, times of scheduled shuttles, tourist info was not totally accurate. Didn't create big problem but could have been better. The housekeepers did not have a good grasp of stocking and cleaning in room coffee makers. Every night of our stay we had to go get cups, sugar, cream and even coffee for the next morning. Not very pleasing when you are tired and ready for bed. Coffee in the room was important to us and after telling them it wasn't serviced correctly the first night was shocked every night for 4 nights it was no better. Overall the room was clean, staff pleasant, and stay was nice. We had a good deal so the price was good and found it to be an OK place to stay. With just a few minor adjustments and a more accurate description on their website might improve others view of stay.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOut of the way hotel\u201d", "Author": "rob_hanson1979", "ReviewID": "UR5379400", "Content": "When arriving in Boston South Station, we took a taxi to this hotel because of our luggage. The website leads you to believe it is conveniently located on the outskirts of downtown, but it is not. It is much further. Our taxi fare was over $25, and that was with NO traffic to delay us. Once we arrived at the hotel, our room was not ready, so the man at the front desk stored our luggage for us. We mentioned we would be spending the day downtown, and he didn't mention the free shuttle to the subway station. We were going to walk all the way to the subway station(and it is far) but fortunately, the woman at Dunkin Donuts told us about the free shuttle offered by OUR hotel. We went back to the hotel, and took the shuttle. After spending the day in downtown Boston, we returned to the hotel, checked in, and asked for our luggage. The new front desk clerk couldn't find it anywhere. It turns out the morning clerk stored it in a different location than they usually store luggage, but didn't tell anyone. Our room was clean and large. It was comfortable and the bathroom was large. Keep in mind that half the rooms in this hotel are right next to the subway tracks, so you will have trains going by all night. Light sleepers may be bothered by this. While there are some restaurants and shops within walking distance, the roads are very unfriendly for pedestrians, with no crosswalks and curves everywhere. I would be wary of wandering around in what seemed like an unsafe industrial area. So to sum up, the free shuttle to the subway make it a decent hotel to stay at if you want to save some money by avoiding downtown hotels, but the location is not a good feature of this hotel. Plus the customer service by the staff is slightly less than satisfactory. I would stay here again for the rates as you can easily take the Subway downtown. However, if you book, please know what you are getting.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOK for price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3984595", "Content": "We stayed at Comfort Inn Boston as the cost was reasonable in comparison to most Boston hotels. The hotel sent a complementary shuttle bus to pick us up from the airport, which was really helpful. The hotel room was clean and comfortable. I had no difficulty with internet wireless access on my laptop in the hotel and this was complementary. Breakfast was included in cost also, which consisted of fresh waffles, muffins, bread, coffee, yogurt, fruit juice etc. I thought that this was good value as other 'better hotels' had charged us for all of the above, additional to our room rate, and the service was no better than the Comfort Inn Boston. On the downside, it is hard to believe that this hotel is advertised as part of a complex containing restaurants. It is a shorter walk to Dunkin' Donuts and the supermarket opposite the hotel than to the 'restaurants' on-site. There is a railway behind the hotel and though I occasionally heard some noise, it wasn't bad enough to cause any great problems.", "Date": "October 2, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Comfort Inn - Boston", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60745-d222958-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Boston-Boston_Massachusetts.html", "Price": "$132 - $258*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">900 Morrissey Boulevard</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Boston</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">02122</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "222958", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d3/19/d3198f7c0767018401339a390f95df3e6large.jpg"}}
