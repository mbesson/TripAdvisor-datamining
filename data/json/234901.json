From the moment we walked in, things didn't feel \"right\". We were asked to pay cash upfront because the card machine was broken, the promised WiFi internet connection is \"still being installed\" and the so-called free off street parking turned into an 8 Euro per day park out the back of the hotel. The room was simple and very small. The bathroom was acceptable and clean (although to our horror, it had a RED heat light when you switch the light on!). The location of this hotel, whilst being only about a 15 min walk to the city centre, is across the road from a seedy looking car dealer and is in the gay bar district so we certainly didn't feel comfortable heading out after dark. The breakfast was the only good part of our stay here - they do offer a wide variety buffet breakfast.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heathrowcountry", "Title": "\u201cBB Hotel, Berlin = my bad experience\u201d", "Author": "Heathrowcountry", "ReviewID": "UR62494961", "Content": "on my third visit to Berlin but my first stay at this hotel, a bad experience.

Well, the worst place, a nightmare. I have only stayed there for 2 nights, if I had to stay more in this hotel I would have searched for another hotel. After all this explanation I still have to say that its not cheap at all (81 euros per day!!!!) I would have paid twice or 3 times for another hotel.

First you get a homemade soop, than diner and after that desert. It was realy tastefull. Our room was not so big, but it was clean and the bed's slept very well.

The hotel however does offer some privacy and discression - providing you keep quiet, as walls are thin.

The hotel was basically okay, however, it obviously had some hospitality problems. Although we booked in advance, at first they placed us in a chillingly cold room on the second floor that had no double glazing and only one weak light bulb. Besides, the windows faced a rather busy Martin-Luther-Strasse. After some complaining, we obtained a transfer to an obviously renovated room on the first floor with PVC windows that faced the courtyard. This one was thoroughly enjoyable: spacious, with high ceilings, light and quiet. The breakfast was excellent: a good choice of salami, cheese and cornflakes. Finally, it has to be noted that the hotel is about 7-10 minutes away from the nearest metro station, but it is conveniently located in the midst of a gay neighbourhood and in proximity to a few nice Italian restaurants.", "Date": "February 17, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BB Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234901-Reviews-BB_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$68 - $148*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Fuggerstrasse 13</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Sch&ouml;neberg</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10777</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "234901", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/43/bb/43bbde847d57db1bd37ef9f57703a9a81large.jpg"}}
