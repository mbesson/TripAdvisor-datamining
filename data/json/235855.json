We also visited Florence and Rome after our stay in Venice. Our flight to Venice landed at 8:30 a.m. on Sunday morning. We took the Alilaguna (slow) boat from the dock near the airport to the San Zaccaria stop. I believe it was about 13 euros per person, and I think it was well worth it. The walk to the hotel maybe took 10 minutes from the San Zaccaria stop. We arrived a little early to check in and were allowed to leave our luggage at the hotel until we could check into our rooms. We left for an initial walk around Venice and had lunch at a very nice place that was behind the hotel (can't remember the name, but the food was very good). We were given rooms on the floor where breakfast was served. There was a little corridor off of the breakfast area; our room and the other couple's room was directly off of the corridor and the location of our rooms was very convenient. I've read other reviews where the writers think it would be weird to have a room off of the breakfast area, but we enjoyed it very much. My husband would go get us a cappuccino early while we were getting ready -- loved that. Then we would go for breakfast which was good and plentiful. Also, we never heard any noises from the breakfast area in our rooms. The breakfast was the best we had in Italy, with the waiter bringing fresh, hot croissants to the table. The coffee and cappuccino were very good. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. The front desk staff were exceptional, and provided help and information at our every request. We enjoyed several glasses of wine on the terrace off of the breakfast area and also the downstairs terrace several times. I don't think we had an \"updated\" room, but it was very nice, regardless. The room was small as was the bathroom, but exceptionally clean. There was a very good \"close-up\" makeup mirror in our bathroom, but if you are accustomed to styling your hair with a typical American blow dryer, you need to take your own with the appropriate electrical connection converter. The bed was extremely comfortable. We paid 10 euros for Wifi for our entire stay (three nights). The hotel is very convenient to San Marco -- maybe a 5-7 minute walk. There are many small sandwich shops close by that are very good for lunch. Almost every restaurant we visited was very good. We enjoyed going to the Coop supermarket - there is a good and inexpensive selection of wine there. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. In my opinion, it had the charm and character we were expecting of a hotel in Venice, and we loved it!", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Siena, Italy", "Title": "\u201cshort break for easter\u201d", "Author": "josephine s", "ReviewID": "UR127470963", "Content": "A short break in Venice for Easter and again at Hotel Casa Verardo.

I always take hotel websites sceptically, but this one really surprised me. Our room looked nothing like any of the rooms shown in the website. We had booked a 'deluxe' room rather than the basic 'classic', but even so the room was small with spartan furnishings - we only had a single hard chair to sit on in the room, in their website the 'deluxe' room is shown with a sofa, a desk chair and a footstool, not to mention an elegant chest of drawers and a wardrobe, all we got was a stolid utilitarian wardrobe that looked like it came from a stalinist design manual. I had the impression from the website that all rooms were individually furnished and decorated with as they put it 'enriched textiles'. Actually all the rooms I saw into on our floor were identical to ours. Also, I spotted that a room shown as a 'deluxe' room on the website was included in the photos on TripAdvisor as a 'junior suite' - had someone made a mistake? The wifi is a pain to use, it is free but parcelled out in such mean packages that it gets irritating to keep having to go back to the reception desk to ask for another session. The rooms on the first floor all appear to open into the breakfast room, which seems a bit strange.

We had to stack our suitcases as there wasn't enough room for both anywhere. On top of that, the room was stiflingly hot so we were up all night and there was some sort of scent that neither of us could bear. We left after one night of staying there as we honestly couldn't take it anymore. We complained to the staff and there was no offer of a refund.

The breakfast was decent & the location was great, thank goodness for these redeeming factors as we had a couple of issues. There was some confusion regarding the room layout, I had booked for 4 guests, advising that 1 of us would be arriving on a different day to the rest of us. We had 4 beds on the first night, then returned to our room the afternoon of day 2 to only 3 beds in the room, when our 4th guest was about to arrive. I was told this happened because I didn't tell staff I needed the 4th bed that night... be sure to clarify specific room requirements with staff each morning to ensure this doesn't happen to you, an inconvenience to you & the staff. The other issue we encountered was in regards to wifi. Wifi is given to guests in 3 hour brackets, which is fine, but when we asked for more when these had expired, we were told that it is not included and we would have to pay for it (as this is how things are done in Venice). In the end we were given 'free' 30 minute passes, which don't last long when shared between 4 people. The staff made us feel like we were continually inconveniencing them, by continually having to ask for another 30 minutes of access. It would have made everyones life easier if they would have given us one 3 hour card instead of six 30 minute cards!

They had provided more chairs but they were plastic chairs which were very dirty and looked as if they had come from a rubbish dump. We complained again and said that the replacement chairs were unacceptable. Reception again rang the lady owner whilst my husband was there.

Sure enough, when I arrived I was told I needed to change rooms. Pier, the manager, who is an extremely nice person, told me that I needn't worry, all my belongings would be carefully moved... I was disapointed to find when I came back to the hotel that night, that my belongings were not moved with care or put in their proper places. My toiletries were in one bag and the contact solution leaked on my make-up, the clothes were not hung-up, etc. The new room was a lovely little room upstairs, but I was surprised that not much care was given in moving my possessions given that the manager knew that I was not happy about being moved. I would have thought that they would have really made an effort to make the move nice for me as Pier indicated he would. I wrote Pier an e-mail when I came home detailing what happened and he did not respond. I thought I was very straight forward and I told him what my concerns were. In hindsight, I wish I had also gone into more detail telling him about my positive perceptions about the hotel. Overall, I think it's a lovely hotel and the people are very nice. I had some great conversations with some of the staff, the building is lovely and overall it is a good value. I recommend the hotel to others, my only caution is that if you do not want a room change, I would get a guarantee, perhaps in writing. I also was not given a lower rate for the new room and I think it would have been appropriate given the circumstances.

Needless to say, we like it! The hotel is a very short walk from San Zaccaria vaporetto stop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with only one small bridge to cross in front of the hotel with your luggage. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk - and 2 bridges (one of which has good view of The Bridge of Sighs) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c away from Piazza San Marco. The location is so peaceful yet there are at least a dozen bars & restaurants within 100 metres of the hotel. Every part of the hotel is kept beautifully clean and tidy. We occupied room 206 at the back of the hotel. Rooms at the front have a view of the small canal that runs along the front of the hotel. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is traditional Venetian throughout, with modern bathrooms fitted. Our room had a full size bath with shower above (and a leaky shower screen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly annoying having to put a towel down to soak up the water - our only niggle), the usual WC, bidet & washbasin as well as a lovely toasty warm radiator-cum-towel warmer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which seemed to be the only source of heat but more than adequately kept the room and bathroom cosy. There is a tube-type hairdryer and a few toiletries provided \u00e2\u20ac\u201c soaps, bottles of shampoo and a shower cap. We find the beds extremely comfortable. They have the latex type mattresses - as opposed to sprung \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which in our experience are very popular in Italian hotels (and in our house too!) The four pillows in our room varied in softness/firmness, which suited us perfectly (so I'm sure they can cater for most guests' requirements - people often complain of too-hard pillows - hence my pillow review!)There is a small TV set on the desk and one chair in the room. In the built-in wardrobe, there is a safe, approx. 5 decent sized shelves and a roomy hanging area. I counted the hangers and there were 10 assorted style hangers. There is also a small mini bar containing 2 bottles of beer, 1 small bottle of wine, 2 cans of Coca Cola and 2 bottles of water. I only noticed the price of the Coke \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.00. We know from past visits during warmer weather that the air-conditioning works perfectly well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thought it worth a mention. We have also enjoyed breakfast on the terrace and relaxing in the pretty courtyard in warmer weather. Buffet breakfast is provided in the lovely breakfast room on the first floor (several of the rooms open out into this space) and in detail, consists of small white crusty bread rolls, butter, sliced salami, ham and cheese, fruit salad (canned), fresh grapefruits & oranges, choice of 3 cereals, milk, orange juice, assorted yogurts, little tubs of jams, marmalade, honey, nutella spread and packs of biscuits and crackers. Angelica and Fernando will bring fresh warm croissants to your table (some days plain, some days with apricot jam inside) and they'll get you tea, coffee, cappucino etc. (lovely coffee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thanks, guys!) Breakfast is served from 8.00 (I think) to 10.30 (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure!), which should suit most people. Internet access is available \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much faster connection this year! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at a cost of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.00 for 1 hour or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.00 for 3 hours. The PC is located on the second floor salon (just outside our door which was very handy for hubby to check his email) All the staff are efficient, friendly and helpful - from the front desk to chambermaids. Wherever we travel, we have a special request for an extra mattress on the bed to help with my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he needs a high bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the bed was already made up to meet our needs when we arrived.

The staff is very helpfull and always smiling: what a pleasure was to talk with them in the morning! To sit in the linen sofas outside in the charming private campiello (small typican venetian garden) of the hotel, drinking a glass of white wine, is the best after a busy day around this wonderfull city! Of course i will stay again at Casa Verardo for my next trip to Venice!", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roanoke,VA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Venice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "BillyBoy013", "ReviewID": "UR8226450", "Content": "We have just returned from a very nice 3 night stay at Hotel Casa Verardo in Venice. It is a restored 16th century palace, and is typically European in style in that the rooms are modest, but very nicely appointed and air conditioned. It is conveniently located within a 5 minute walk to St. Mark's Square, but far enough away that it is very quiet inside and around the hotel - it sits on one of the canals and has an outside terrace for relaxing after those long days of walking around in Venice. They serve a nice continental breakfast with absolutely delicious homemade croissants and nice Italian coffee or cappucino. The English speaking staff, especially Babett if you are lucky enough to meet her, were most helpful with directions, restaurant recommendations, etc. and basically just appreciative that you are a guest in their hotel. We paid around 195 euro's per night, but I believe July to be their off season. It is also within about 50 yards of a nice square that has plenty of nice shops and choices for eating. Overall, a very nice Italian hotel in a very quiet, convenient location at a very fair price, with great service and an attentive staff. I would highly recommend it and would stay there again if opportunity presents itself. Also, if you are flying out of Venice, they use one of the local water taxi services that is close to the hotel and get to the airport in about 20 minutes, versus the crammed and hot vaporetto's which take over an hour to get there.

It was incredibly convenient to San Marco and 2 close water bus stops. The first two nights we had a triple room with absolutely NO VIEW. Looking out our window was a prison-like area with concrete floor and dead plants. We were not very pleased. We asked the man at the front desk if we could possibly change. He said that he would check, but he could not promise us anything. We returned at the end of the day and he said they didn't have anything available until our third night where he could upgrade us to a room with a better view or he could upgrade us to a canal view room for a 50 euro supplement. We went with the canal view room, which was stunning and well worth the 50 euros. The breakfast is delicious with hot croissants with a fruity filling, cereal, fruit....etc. YUM!

No problems - our room was upgraded for 2 of our 4 nights and it was excellent with a small balcony overlooking a canal.

We were not disappointed. The hotel is family-run and therefore has the personal touch and guests are made very welcome by all the staff who are unfailingly helpful and friendly. The building itself is a former smallish palazzo and the owners have carefully restored and adapted the rooms and public areas with great sensitivity and style, retaining original features and using period furniture to recreate an appropriate atmosphere and ambience. Great attention is paid to detail and the rooms are very comfortable with excellent facilities. Breakfast is continental but ample with plenty of choice. There are several practical advantages in staying at Casa Verardo. Firstly, if you arrive at Marco Polo airport, you can get the waterbus to the waterfront at St. Mark's Square (this provides an interesting trip across the lagoon and a spectacular approach to the city - a unique experience) and it is only a short walk from there to the hotel which is in a quiet location beside a small canal and bridge (very pretty). From the hotel it is only three minutes stroll to St Mark's Square and is in easy walking distance to most places of interest. Nearby there are plenty of good eating places too.

Other rooms are also quite nice, but we relished the space, privacy, and canal view of our room. The bathroom was newly renovated and was wonderful and spacious.

Don't expect a lovely view if you are only paying for a standard room - we got a view into the building next door - but a room is to sleep in. The breakfast room was my favourite part. It was a lovely open room and in summer they actually have an open courtyard. It always smelt of vanilla and pastires. The staff were always helpful and polite. They always had a restaurant to recommend or would be happy to help us figure out which vaparetto to get. The hotel itself it situated over a lovely bridge and is easy to get to when you first arrive in Venice. Don't be daunted by the alleys at night - we found them safe enough.
