It was a little farther away than I had anticipated (a 32TL Cab ride, 14km). The room was nice and the front desk was helpful, but although the nice I heard the rumble of a train. The next morning I asked if that was a commuter line. Turns out hotel is right on a commuter line. A 10TL cab ride will get you to Pendik station, or if you are traveling light and don't mind off roading it, there is a station a 200m walk from hotel. From Pendik, 2TL will get you to a ferry, 2 more will get you to Enimou and 2 more for the tram will get you to Sultanahmet (6TL total and about 1.5 hr). Avoid using Taxis to get to next hotel, as they will rip you off.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monchengladbach, Germany", "Title": "\u201cCool place to stay\u201d", "Author": "thomas198129", "ReviewID": "UR104863754", "Content": "The Mamara Pendik Hotel is a nice little Hotel,people are very friendly and they always try to help you.
