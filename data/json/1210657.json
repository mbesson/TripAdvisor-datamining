{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Gem of a hotel, 5-minute walk from Roppongi Hills Followed my girlfriend to Tokyo on a conference, where all the conference guests stayed at this hotel. This non-profit hotel (subsidized by various entities including the Rockefeller Foundation) serves to promote cultural cooperation between Japan and other countries. Most of the guests seemed to be either academics or people somehow involved in the arts and entertainment.The rooms are a bit on the small side, but every room has a view of the beautiful gardens, a functional desk and a nice reading chair. On the ground floor there's a good library that also has some free computer stations with internet (in case you don't wish to plug in directly from your room).The buffet breakfast is very much on the modest side of the spectrum, but also completely adequate for getting a bite before going out to explore the city (or run off to a conference).The great things about this hotel are its location and its very quiet and relaxing environment. Our room rate was under US$200/night. Hotel room prices in Tokyo are falling quickly, so in terms of price it's probably possible to find better deals. But if you wish to be 5-10 minutes by foot from Roppongi Hills (and its famous Hyatt hotel), it's hard to imagine you'll find a better deal than this.Also, staff at the front desk are extremely polite and helpful.", "Date": "Nov 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR544395060", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "m8condo"}, {"Content": "\u93c8\u20ac\u6942\u6a38\u4f04\u6434\ue15e\u6e4c   showReview(23244055, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR497997007", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tikurin"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d1210657-r21995230-International_House_of_Japan-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1210657", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
