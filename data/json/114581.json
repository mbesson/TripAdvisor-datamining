More bland and generic than the \"European elegance\" claimed on their website. The lack of hot water, was definitely not fine though. There were a couple pluses to our stay at Swissotel.

It's location is prime and beautiful (other than the major construction taking place next door - but I could see past that). You drive up and ask for valet, to which you are pointed in the direction of the TIGHTEST drive WAY underground to the garage. There are no signs directing you and nobody there to tell you where to park or drop your keys. We had to walk up to a window where a woman was busy paying more attention to her computer than any guests arriving in this confined sub-basement garage. She tells us to park right where we were and we left our luggage with the bellman who came out. We arrived at 11 and check-in is at 3. We knew that but were told our rooms (2 of them) would probably be ready when we arrived. Not the case, but that was ok. Once you get up to the lobby you quickly enter a construction zone within the Swissotel. A strange registration area where there is no real line, just people standing all over the place trying to figure out if they are in line or not was difficult to navigate. We were assured that our luggage would be safe and that when we returned at 3 it would meet us in our rooms. (Valet - $55 per night) We returned at 3 and were given our rooms. Lakeview rooms were actually complete views of the wall of construction next door. They are going to need to re-name those rooms because there will not be a lake view until you are well above the 20th floor. Our luggage was lost and they called our rooms asking us to describe our bags because they never tagged them, only \"threw them in a room with hundreds of others\". After 2 deliveries and about 45 minutes, we finally had our bags. The TV's were flatscreen and about half the channels wouldn't come in and the other 40% were snowy. The only channels that came through clear were the ABC, NBC, CBS and about 2 others. Beds were great (although our friends room did not have sheets on their bed). Very comfortable rooms. We set our room temp at 70 (about 80 outside during the day) and the room was still humid and hot through the night. The hotel was very loud. We could hear people using showers, toilets and talking in the hallways. You could also hear people outside and we were on the 19th and 20th floors. Wi-fi is available for $10 for 24 hours. Although when our friends tried to get it, they sent up an IT person who after about 30 minutes of trying to figure it out, told them that our whole side of the hotel would be unable to get wi-fi. It's hard to believe that a hotel that big and these days still charges for wi-fi... considering how much you have to pay to stay there! Woke up the next morning to a shower that was between cooler than luke-warm and cold. An hour later it was still the same way and never warmed up. Was the same for our friends on a different floor. The breakfast was the shining star of this terrible hotel. An amazing breakfast buffet ($26) was the best part of the stay. Very European and freash! I would walk to this hotel, from a different one, just to have the breakfast again. We were told that to get our car from valet would be about a 30 minute wait. We were then sent to the garage to pick up the car again and squeeze our way through the twisty turny skinny tunnel to get out. We have a normal size SUV and it was TIGHT! I would not stay here again. It's too bad because it is in a great location.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "O'Fallon, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNice Views of Chicago\u201d", "Author": "Sjack80724", "ReviewID": "UR126326197", "Content": "Stayed here for a two day conference.

I was left with $22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago, 2000 miles from where I live.

The staff was excellent and the location was fine but the hotel itself is under construction, making this the worst business stay I've ever had. The lobby was non existent and lacked basic amenites you don't think about until you don't have them, like chairs in which to sit and gather your thoughts and paperwork before you head out for your day, no free Internet in the lobby or a place to even stand; no other guests in sight, no house phones in site, no views, no parking lot or driveway, and hidden restaurants that have been relocated during construction to the basement concourse level. My first attempt, I went down to the basement as instructed and found myself in a construction zone, came up above ground and was told I took the wrong elevator -- the elevator which was in the lobby. Turns out I was supposed to have taken a second bank of elevators that were down a narrow temporary hallway. I went down again, found the restaurant, saw that it was empty as well as overpriced, and left the hotel in search of breakfast. The hotel felt deserted; the experience made me feel isolated and on my own. Here's another example. When I asked for directions to the Business Center to pick up a Fed Ex box, the receptionist told me that she wasn't permitted to tell me what floor it was on but that all I needed to do was get into the elevator and press \"business center.\" Huh? I picked this hotel because it was terrific three years ago, before construction started. I also selected this hotel because of flattering reviews on TripAdvisor, but now I notice I was reading outdated reviews. Final note, I've been home for a week and have yet to receive one of those electronic \"tell us how your stay was\" emails. Two very bright notes: excellent, polite, professional staff, and the bed and temperature in the room was very comfortable.

The bedroom was spacious, clean, very well lit with natural light and easily darkened with the energy saver curtains and most important...very well heated.

The hotel is very comfortable and at a nice location. I would give it an \"Excellent\" rating if it weren't for the bait-and-switch techniques and the elevators. We arrived the day before the conference started, when all the people started coming in, and we checked in around 4:10pm, which was a little over an hour after check-in time started. The hotel gave us a room with a different bedding arrangement than we had reserved. They claimed that our preferred bedding arrangement was not available, which I didn't believe because it was just after check-in had started and I know that lots of people at this conference preferred a bedding arrangement different from ours. After some prodding, we were told that they did have a room like we had requested, but we would have to pay $35 per night more for it because it had a lake view. We didn't go for the bait and switch and took original room. Later, we found out that they had tried the same technique on other people, namely give them a room that was different from what they had requested and then try to extract more money from them to get the room they had requested. This was irrespective of the bedding arrangement requested. Another thing is the elevators. If you want to take an elevator, you have to punch in the number of the floor that you want to go to and the system tells you which of the 6 elevators you need to take. The elevators take a VERY long time to arrive under the best of circumstances. There are no buttons inside the elevator, so you are really very dependent on the system working properly. But then the system broke down and I would go into the assigned elevator and instead of taking me up to where I wanted to go, it took me down. Then, I needed to get out on in the basement and punch in the floor I wanted to go to again and wait for a long time and just hope that this time I would be taken to my floor. The whole thing was very disconcerting because there is nothing you can do once you are inside this elevator.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cFlawless execution\u201d", "Author": "investroll", "ReviewID": "UR122787319", "Content": "I stayed here for a business convention and it ran at 100% capacity.

Overall, we had a nice time though we paid a little more than we had in the past and we didn't find a deal for free parking but overall the price was fine. We parked elsewhere and saved about $40. The lobby was under construction so you had to walk around and the check-in area was a makeshift operation while the construction occurred. Nonetheless, check-in was efficient. The room for some reason was smaller than I had remembered and more typical of the standard 3 stars we have stayed at in the past. We were on the 20th floor w/ a view of another building and the river so I'm not sure if room sizes vary significantly but it was fine for one adult and 2 children. We were upset that the price of the pool was not included in the price of the room but luckily we were informed when we went to pay the $15 per person per day for pool/fitness room that we could join SwissCircle for free and have free access to both (yay!). The other negative was that WIFI service was $9.95 per 24 hours of use. My girls who had just received their IPADs for Christmas were disappointed that I wasn't going to pay for that. There was also some sort of noise which we thought may have emanated from an ice machine perhaps on the floor below us which my daughter described as \"2 hollow rusty metals rubbing against each other\" The location is great and the bed, as has been described to much detail in other posts, was wonderful as always.

Though the hotel was completely booked, due to two conventions on Friday and Saturday nights, when we decided to stay an extra night on Saturday, we were wait listed for that night. Even though there was a mix-up with our original Sunday night booking and it and our wait-list had been lost, upon calling back, the person I spoke with was able to confirm a wonderful lake view room on the 31st floor for both nights. Once again we had a most delightful stay and thoroughly enjoyed the terrific view of Lake Michigan. Our room was beautiful, extremely comfortable, and incredibly clean. Perhaps my only complaint is the $50 per day parking fee, but that seems to be the norm for large cities. Our two meals in their Palm Restaurant was another story.

But...we were there for a romantic interlude, so the small-ish lobby full of conventioneers, the on-site Palm restaurant full of conventioneers, and the bar full of conventioneers was sort of a drag. The location is on a cul-de-sac, so is actually quiet despite the heavy construction to the North of the hotel - we never heard any noise whatsoever. Downtown is literally a couple of blocks, and Millennium Park and the Art Institute and many restaurants are steps away. Lakeshore Drive is also a couple of blocks away if you want to rent a bike for a few hours along the lakeside. I guess the service is the story here - to then man/woman, everyone went out of their way to say hello, to ask how our stay was, did we need anything, can I help you out...it stood out as exemplary. The breakfast restaurant below the lobby level provided a very nice spread, and, once again, the service was wonderful.

The hotel is located pretty far out east on Wacker Drive, just south of the river. (It's located past the Hyatt Hotel, also on East Wacker.) The location turned out to be a detriment when the under-staffed cab line didn't move at all on a busy Friday night as we were trying to make a show that evening. It was so inconvenient trying to hail a cab at the hotel that we decided to change our plans the following evening and have dinner at the Palm Restaurant in the lobby level of the hotel. Room service was efficient and edible -- not the best, not the worst. There is a fully equipped minibar as well as a Keurig coffee machine (the kind that uses individual pods to brew coffee!) in the hotel room. We had a fantastic view of Lake Michigan facing south, which was great from the 32nd floor. Unfortunately, when we called ahead to the hotel before the trip, I was informed that the gym requires an additional fee of $15/day. Because we were staying at the Swissotel with a group booking for my fiance's work, both wifi and the fitness center ended up being complimentary. Wifi has a charge of $10/day, otherwise. Next year -- for this and other annual meetings that require us to travel to Chicago -- we will be staying closer to Mag Mile on Michigan Avenue (likely the Conrad or the Park Hyatt). Location-wise, the Swissotel is a bit out of the way for visitors who enjoy walking around and are attracted to the main tourist attractions downtown.

You could even watch the fabulous fireworks over the Navy Pier from the hotel. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The check-in was prompt without issue. The elevators are modern and you select the floor and the panel indicates which elevator will take you there. For some reason, I had not seen this before, but it seems efficient. The rooms are a generous size with very nice views and nice sized bathrooms. The bed and pillows were super comfy and the turn-down service left chocolates.

Granted, I did not order the steak and lobster...maybe I should have. I got the cesar salad which was good followed by the crab cakes which were suprisingly not good. The flourless chocolate cake was tasty. The waitstaff was fine. Perhaps this was not a place to eat solo. I just did not care for it overall and the value simply wasn't there for me. As for restaurants within walking distance, I would suggest Volare for Italian, The Purple Pig for shared plates/drinks, and The Gage for a tavern feel with creative takes on American cuisine and great beer options.

Now what I didn't like: -The hotel charges 15 dollars a person, per day!!! to use the pool and the fitness centre. Why have a pool if not many people will be using it?? We spoke to two young gentlemen in the elevator one day who had just returned from the pool and I asked if they paid the 15 dollars? The told us that they booked the room using a \"Groupon\" so the pool was included. However, they did pay 20 dollars a night more for the hotel than we did, so there is the pool \"charge\". -Before we left, I read a reivew warning to not open the mini bar because it is censored and you will be charged for using it. Upon arrival to our room my son opened the fridge and I told him to quickly close it because of what I had previously read.

But not all was as expected, leading one to conclude that management has unnecessarily and surprisingly become miserly on some aspects of hotel appointments and appearance. An unready room, which had been changed from king to double and previously confirmed with Swissotel central reservations and the hotel itself, had been overlooked, resulting in an unready room at a 345pm check-in. To the hotel's credit, but only at my request, Alex, an assistant manager, corrected the oversight, furnishing a full breakfast voucher as an apology. (Breakfast is excellent with made-to-order eggs, but otherwise rather expensive.) Because of the building's architectural footprint, the mostly low-ceilinged lobby wanders hither and yon without adequate sineage, and is surprisingly dark and colorless. Yet, the 6 new elevators are among the fastest in town, and computer controlled from the elevator lobby and not in the elevator itself. The Front Desk, while official and courteous, yet seemed stressed (confirmed by later visits), and lacked the welcoming attitudes characteristic of deluxe hotels. The same could be said for the concierge desk - stressed - and also furnished incorrect information about a church mass. Yes, the hotel was fully booked, but aren't staff trained for such situations? Guest rooms are certainy bright and well-appointed, quiet, excellent quality mattress, 42 inch flat screen television that actually was HD (and not a big screen analogue TV as common in many hotels.) But no CD player as shown on web-site. The bath appointments, such as the silver dollar sized soap and downscale motel - sized no-name shampoo and bath accessories, were a major surprise for a quality hotel chain. The aroma, or was it an odor, in the bath, could have been from the cleaning solution or from the soap, or perhaps both or none. Whatever it was, change the bath accessopries to match the hotel quality. Other indications of a lack of guest consideration included only a few free newspapers at the front desk and restaurant - and they had to be snatched early - and a fee-based internet. Contrast all of this with the James Hotel, where I stayed 5 nights in July. At the James, local, national, Wall Street Journal, are available in sufficient quantity seven days a week. Internet is free in business center. Deluxe bath accessories are far superior to Swissotel, CD players with excellent mini-speakers are part of room appointments, and the smiling staff is much more accommodating and knowledgeable than at Swissotel. The Palm Restaurant at Swissotel can be highly recommended, especially the happy hour menu with generously-sized mini portions at reasonable prices. Swissotel Chicago management was made aware of these issues in reply to computer - generated query, but to date has not replied. These complaints seem petty and overall the hotel merits patronage, but little things still mean a lot. A deluxe hotel is expected to be deluxe in every category from front desk welcome to concierge awareness, to bath accessories.

I noticed previous reviews where guests had some fee issues, and I did indeed have an erroneous mini-bar charge on my check-out statement, however it was (seemingly) resolved quickly and easily at the registration desk.

I then saw a worker on the floor, and the worker opened the door after I showed him my key room number. The room was occupied with somebody else's belongings, so the worker locked the door and I then had to lug my suitcases back to the lobby, stand in line again, and talk to the manager.

Second and subsequent nights, my safe did not work. Somebody came to work on it twice. Said he would have to have an engineer look at it. Never left me a message that the engineer could not fix it. I called front desk. They told me the safe door was on back order and they could not get me a safe from another room (even though I was staying 7 nights). Major inconvenience. I was told I could keep my money, jewelry and netbook at the front desk. That was unacceptable as I was not going to run from the 28th floor to the front desk every time I needed one of those items, nor was I going to run to the 6th floor to my colleagues room.

As mentioned in previous reviews, do NOT touch anything in the minibar or you will be charged. I would suggest eating outside of the hotel since the cost of food here is very high. Even the free breakfast was not that great. If we had to pay for it, it would have cost us $30 per person for an omelette, toast, fruit, and some cereal. Walk over to Eggsmart just a block away outside or through the underground pathway. You can get a breakfast buffet there for $12.99 and it is a lot better. Parking is also ridiculous. They charge $52 per night for valet parking. All they do is park it in an underground garage. There is one just around the corner on Columbus Dr. Park it yourself there and it costs just $24 a night.

The views from our room were truly spectactular. The location is also convenient. Other than that, it is an average property and experience to me.

There were two other adults in my party and my 6 month old daughter. I called the hotel ahead of time and requested a room with two double beds to comfortably accomodate my party. When we arrived at the hotel, late Saturday night, there was one person at reception. We had to wait about 15 mins before we were served. Upon being served, we were told that there were no rooms with double beds available only kings. I told the receptionist that I had called in advance with my special requests. After some back and forth, she tells me there is a double room available after all but that it will need to be cleaned and that it will be about 45 mins to an hour before it would be ready. We agree to wait as we really have no choice. Some 15 mins later, someone claiming to be the manager comes over to us and tells us there are no double rooms and the only thing he can do is give us a king room with a rollaway and switch us to a double the next day. No explanation as to what happened to the double room they were supposed to be making ready for us. Tired and exasperated and needing to get our 6 month old to bed, we complete the transaction and head up. Once in the room, it takes 2 phone calls and more back and forth before the rollaway bed is brought up. We are told that it will cost us an extra $50.00 a night to have the rollaway (smh at this point!). Nothing of the sort was mentioned at reception. We were told that there would be an increase in the room rate because of the third person in the room but nothing about a charge for the use of rollaway. Random charge being added perhaps?? Throughout the whole ordeal at check in, no apologies from the lady at reception for getting our reservation wrong, no courtesies, no smiles, she was downright cold and indifferent notwithstanding that we were standing unfront of her with a very sleepy baby. And that cold and indifferent face was the first we encountered on entering the hotel...well it set the tone for the rest of our stay. With the exception of the room service attendants and the very kind lady who made up our room everyday, the staff of the hotel, especially the front desk and the concierge was unfriendly and most unhelpful! For the last couple of days of our stay we moved over to the Fairmont and it was like a breathe of fresh air. Like night and day in terms of quality of service, attitude and standard of hotel. In terms of amenities, our room was nothing special. The view was great and the room including the bathroom was spacious but the shower stall and bathtub were tiny and outdated. We had room service a few times and also had breakfast at Geneva. Nothing special and expensive. I could have dealt with the issues with our room if were afforded a professional and courteous manner. But the attitude of the front office lady and the \"manager\" left alot to be desired and there are just too many hotel rooms in Chicago to subject oneself to poor service and incompetence.

There were always plenty of taxis, several major bus routes and metra stops within a 10-15 minute walk of the hotel. Michigan Ave, Millenium Park, Grant Park, Lakeshore, Navy Pier...all within a pleasant, easy walk from the hotel. Will definitely keep this hotel in mind next time we are in town!

Overall, I was satisfied with my stay. The room itself was nice. It's tricky getting in there, so first time travelers, pay close attention on Wacker Dr. It's a quick right turn otherwise, you have to U-turn which can be hectic if you're unfamiliar with the area. When I arrived, everyone including the parking attendant, front desk, and bell-man were very nice and welcoming. The bell-man gave the usual tour of the room and facility. I had a double queen with a nice view of Navy Pier. Nice fluffy pillows and comforter. Internet was not free which to me is a dissatisfier. Parking was a bit expensive, $56.00 for the night but I think that's the going rate for a Downtown Hotel. I slept well, was not able to hear anything but I did stay out at the Gala til about 2AM at the Hyatt. When I awoke the next morning, I decided to have room service. Green Tea and Pancakes ran about $30.00 (including gratuity) but I have to say the food arrived rather quickly. I was satisfied with the breakfast, it was tasty and the service was great from the gentlemen who delivered it. My only gripe was nearing check-out. I casually looked over my bill that was slid under my door and noticed the expensive parking and an additional $78.00 for a bar-tab. Bar tab? I don't even drink alcohol what could that be? Belvidere Vodka....apparently is very expensive. I have to say when I called the front desk, they were very nice and removed charge immediately. So I really can't complain about that; however, pay close attention to your bill. Can you imagine how many times patrons are charged for that when they don't read the bill; probably numerous. Nice clean room and I would definitely stay again. I really felt everyone was caring and genuine; not snooty.

When I requested four rooms together with the online reservation system I never received any e-mail confirmations\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6after I called in I finally received four e-mail confirmations on different floors with different views either including or not including breakfast. After about six telephone calls and numerous e-mail confirmations I decided to cancel all of the reservations and move to Hyatt Regency next door but by chance Jackie, In House Reservation Manager, answered my call and corrected these continuing problems. However, when we arrived at the hotel we all had the same rate with breakfast but again on different floor with different views\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the rooms had not been blocked before our arrival so another thirty minute correction at the front desk with a twenty dollar tip to the Desk Manager\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6on the same floor but we still did not have four adjacent rooms in a half-full hotel and the mini refrigerator was deliver to the wrong room. Basically, the problem is that there is a central reservation and an in house reservation and neither have automatic e-mail confirmation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and if you have a reservation with breakfast this has to be manually updated in the system by either calling after making the online reservation or at the front desk at check-in. Also the rumor about charging for the included breakfast is true\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6My parents and my aunt went down to breakfast early and told the server that they had breakfast included with the room and were handed an menu to order and a complimentary bill at the end of breakfast which was instead charged to my room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so after we ate breakfast I was a little surprise later that day with $80 breakfast bill was added to my room charge for my parents and aunt\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6this continuing problem could easily be corrected by providing guests with a buffet breakfast voucher like other hotels but this is an obvious \"bait and switch\" to get guests to twice pay for breakfast. Regardless, I was another thirty minutes at the front desk correcting this problem and the only reason I think this charge was removed was because it was added to my room and not my parents and aunt rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6also this breakfast charge was submitted to my credit card within hours and had to be removed before check-out. In summary, if you believe that a group reservation for four rooms at a $200/night hotel should include 30-minutes online making a reservation, 2-3 hours on the telephone correcting the reservations, another 30-minutes at the front desk correcting the reservations again, then another 30-minutes correcting additional charges before check-out, and like this much chaos...then I highly recommend the Swissotel for your next family weekend getaway.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCan't be better than this\u201d", "Author": "Hexa67", "ReviewID": "UR105619841", "Content": "This hotel is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.

The nearest L stop is about 10 minutes away. Overall a good location, and definitely a good location for the views. I didn't try the restaurants but I did order room service. Both the woman on the phone and the man who delivered it was very friendly. The food was better than what I've had in other hotels for room service. Also - I experienced no elevator problems. I never had to wait more than 20 seconds for an elevator in either direction.

I had a \"corner king\" room on the 21st floor (room 2119) with outstanding views looking to the lake and Navy Pier and around to the south toward Grant Park. After taxes, around $200 per night. Check-in went smooth and the staff was very friendly. I called guest services for a tube of toothpaste and it was delivered, along with 2 toothbrushes, in under 10 minutes. One complaint I have with guest services: There is a breakfast menu in the room. Fill it out and hang it on the door for the next morning. I tried this the first 3 mornings I was there, and each morning it was still hanging on the door and no breakfast. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had this happen at other hotels, so I was prepared to go out for breakfast. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to take a 5 minute walk, head over to Delmonico Deli in the pedway for the buffet of fresh fruit and made to order breakfast for much less (than the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast of oatmeal, toast, banana, coffee and orange juice for $30!). The room was spacious, clean and nice, with a few exceptions. The room is near the elevators and there is VERY noticeable elevator noise in the room when one of them runs (I think it's the one that hasn't been updated yet). At first, I thought I was hearing the \"L\" go by somewhere below, but realized that was not the case after the first night (the L isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even close to the hotel). It's quite frequent in the morning when people are leaving the hotel. I sleep best in hotels with the room fan running, so that helped. But, if you're a light sleeper who has to have quiet, this is not the room for you. I'm sure requesting a room away from the elevators would solve this problem. No complaints on the elevators themselves, other than looking quite worn, for recently being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153updated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I have also seen complaints about the TV not working right and had the same experience here. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a tech guy and found that the cable connection was loose where it goes into a splitter. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any way to tighten it (there are security boots around the connectors), but did find if I positioned it just right, the signal was good and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drop out. Looks like an easy fix, given the correct tools. At check-in, I was asked if I wanted gym access for the week, at $15 a day. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too much for me, but opted for 2 days of access. When I checked out, they had billed me for 3. They corrected that mistake with no questions (luckily, the girl at the front desk had noted at check-in that I only wanted 2 days). Check your bill before you leave!! Like others have said, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to \u00e2\u20ac\u01535-star\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotels, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be disappointed with Swissotel. I normally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have access, or budget, for really nice hotels, but have stayed in a few. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice, but not spectacular. And if your version of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153affordable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd food is a salad and dessert (no drinks) for $30, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be right at home here. Any restaurant in the vicinity of the hotel will be higher priced (a New York strip steak, 2 drinks, plus tip was $64 at one place). I do have one place you MUST visit if you like Italian food. Club Lago at 331 W Superior (corner of Superior and Orleans). It's a $10 cab ride, or about a 20 minute walk from the hotel. We took a cab there and walked back. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 3rd generation family owned place and the food is fantastic! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a high end place, but has a great atmosphere and great prices (dinner was $16!!). Your soda pop arrives in the can, and the food is served on dishes that were probably around when they opened the place\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like eating at home! I loved it!!

I paid $214.20 for the room. Later on, I found another $200 charge by the Swissotel in my credit card statement. As it turned out, the unexpected charge was for a missing multipurpose alarm clock, which I did not recall seeing at any point during my stay (to clarify, I saw no clock in the room at all). The situation has been handled very poorly. There are three separate issues here. Firstly, they did not make any attempt to reach out to me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a customer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c regarding the missing item. I deposited my luggage at the hotel concierge after the check out for seven hours and could have simply allowed them to search my luggage if they were eager to do so. Secondly, they did not make any attempt to inform me regarding the $200 charge. From my perspective, this is ironically an act of theft; I was robbed $200 behind my back. Thirdly, I practically have to bear the burden of proof. I had to call several people at the hotel simply to obtain the details of the $200 charge. A few of them indicated that they would return my phone calls to no avail. In addition, I am under the impression that I must be responsible for the imaginary $200 alarm clock regardless. Frighteningly, someone who had an access to the room could have emptied the mini bar, stealing any items (bathrobes, TV, and so on), etc. And I could end up being responsible for thousand dollars for these missing items without any means to prove otherwise. That is, I would be deemed a theft while actually being robbed regardless. On a positive note, the hotel stay itself was as pleasant as the last time that I stayed in 2007 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was the main reason that I chose Swissotel over many other hotels in Chicago, especially the Renaissance which is my focal choice elsewhere. And I should recognize one of the receptionists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I believe her nickname is Nazir (she has a long last name) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for her exceptional services. All these make it rather sad that I will never stay in any Swissotel hotels again for my entire life. Oh! If you are a thief, try not to leave your credit card account there since they will charge you later on. And for those who are not a thief, you may want to ask for a check-in checklist so that you can walk through and make sure that there is nothing missing during your stay.

My Swiss company does not give me a choice. It is not the 'best' place I ever stayed, however if one has only stayed at Motel 6's and never stayed anywhere else in Chicago, it could be the best place I guess. Although you can get 4/5 star hotels at a better price, this hotel is very nice and yes..the staff and the views are great. However the same can be said for most any 4/5 star hotel in any city center anywhere. A review will sometimes get cute 'concerned' reply quips from someone saying they are management and 'oh give us another chance', or 'oops sorry'. If you have a problem at Swissotel in Chicago, their feigned concerns are only that. I had issues there recently, I did not rant and face to face the person said \"ahh, sorry\", did nothing, put my money in the drawer and walked....as if he/she was trained to admit nothing and try to get away with errors to save money. Like all the staff, however, he was very nice about 'ripping me off '. Is it the Swissotel training or the local employees doing their own thing? Someone, somewhere, does not care. DO NOT count on any upgrade, even if you are a member of their 'club' (during the years I have never gotten upgrades at Swissotel) and DO NOT, if you choose this hotel, eat the stuff they call breakfast at the GENEVA. It is embarrassing for any hotel over 1 star and says volumes about Swiss management... 'When a fish smells, it smells from the head to the tail'. This breakfast never changed and always cost my company over USD 30 each time. Months ago I mentioned the poor breakfast and with a cute quip was told it would be corrected, but I still had to pay for the slop even thought it was agreed there was a problem with it. If a great, fairly priced and tasty breakfast makes a difference to you, within 1/2 K you will see an breakfast buffet eatery with a larger selection of perfectly prepared, quality food for close to 1/3 the cost of Swissotel.

They had everything at the Swissotel, so I stayed there to save time and money. I checked it out online, and was excited - it looked like a nice, high class place in a nice part of town. It even had good reviews - so I was looking forward to staying there. After my stay, though, I must say that the Swissotel's perception of 5-star is totally different than my perception. Let's start with the room itself. Nothing special. Our \"discounted\" rate was $175/night, and after taxes it was $200/night. For that, I expect more than an \"okay\" room and hotel facility. The conference rooms were nice, the service at the conference rooms was very good, but the room itself just did not say to me \"$200/night\". I can't put my finger on it, but it just didn't impress me. And there were signs of wear, which can be expected in an older (about 30 yrs) facility, but should not be so obvious in a place claiming to be 5-star. Also, some of my hand towels were stained, causing me to double check every towel I used. Next, the hotel has major elevator issues. This is the FIRST hotel I've ever been in that has DIRECTIONS posted on how to use the elevators on every floor. They had to because apparently the new elevator system they installed was designed by someone who never used an elevator. There were six elevators, and yet the wait was never less than five minutes. On the last day of our conference, many of our cohorts were late for the first meeting because it took 15 or 20 minutes to get an elevator. This was NOT acceptable. Also, another interesting quirk: Ice was only available on every other floor; and there were NO vending machines on the room levels. How is that? And anyone who has ever been in Chicago knows you need ice and soda! After that, there is the value question. I've paid more than this for rooms in Vegas, but those rooms make you feel like you spent the money. I'm still wondering where the money went in this place. The location was nice, as it was within walking distance of food and shopping, but that's about it. And if you have a car, it's $52/night to park for guests. So, overall, this place was okay, it just doesn't deserve the super high rating everyone gives it once you've been to other great hotels. And it is way overpriced.

Club level for breakfast and/or evening snacks? Another $50/day. And a note about the club - the food was good but it's NOT open in the afternoon and ALL alcohol is an ADDITIONAL charge. Not sure I drank $200 worth of Starbucks coffee or nibbled on that many carrots to make the cost worth it. You can go in there and use the computer in the morning and in the evening, but that's it. I arranged for the club as a backup in case our view didn't allow us to see the fireworks. Turns out the view from the club isn't all that great. Our room was much better. The best place seems to have been the gym though. Did I mention that costs extra too? The front desk did throw it in for free when we got the club floor, but I think it's usually another $25/day. Are you seeing a theme here? Our room was nice. Previous commentaries were on target - it's minimalistic, the sun does stream in and immediately warm up the room. The small frig is filled with water, soda, etc. that is pressure sensitive (if it moves, you get charged). There's no space to put any food you may have and it didn't even really seem cold at all. The bed seemed to be a super-king. I titled this \"A Mixed Bag\" because I thought it was going to be a bit more upscale given the prices listed. Lets just say that the clientele was eclectic.

Two of our friends we were traveling with were airline staff and got an excellent interline rate, though the regular rates also seemed very reasonable for what they offered. Two of us had been to Chicago before and were pretty familiar with the city, two of us were first-timers. Mainly, we were interested in shopping which made this location pretty convenient. First of all, we should mention transportation from the airport. We flew into Midway, which is a bit closer to downtown. It is connected on the Orange Line and provides above-ground rail transportation frequently right into the downtown \"loop\" very frequently. The service was only a few dollars and we opted for the 3-day metro pass and more than got our money's worth. The hotel is a short 5min walk from the loop. This service is also available for those arriving into O'Hare on the blue line. The trip time is approx 30 and 40 minutes respectively. Arrival at the hotel was certainly not the warmest welcome we've received. The doormen were always friendly, and greeted you with a smily. However, I found the front desk service to be hot and cold. We arrived about 2 hours behind our 2 friends and so they had already checked in. They didn't have cell phone service since we were roaming so we had no way to know what room they were in. They told the front desk our names and when we'd be arriving so we could be issued keys and go right up. However, front desk insisted that we use the house phone to connect to the operator, who would connect us to the room, so they could tell us what room to find them in, then head up. Terrible hospitality, in my opinion. Upon arriving in our room we were VERY pleased with our accommodations! The rooms were much larger than we expected, especially for Chicago. We had everything we needed in the room: mini-bar, couch, huge desk, iPod alarm (lovely feature), plenty of closet space, a nice view, comfortable beds and a very large and well equipped bathroom. The bathroom featured a tub as well as a proper shower and the ample counter space and lighting made getting ready in the morning a breeze! We went to use the concierge one morning to book tickets for Second City. First of all, I highly recommend the show! I'd never been but we had a great time and the price was very reasonable. We found the concierge hard to track down and we were sent to the 40th floor Swiss Executive Lounge. We didn't even know this lounge existed! Apparently you pay a daily fee and have full access which includes breakfast, evening h'ordeurves and desserts. As well there is plenty of seating, a large TV and a beautiful view out to the water. We were quick to add on this lounge access! Unfortunately I don't remember the exact price, it was either $50 or $25 daily. In our opinion, well worth the price! I suggest at least going up and having a tour and adding it for any full days, we obviously didn't want to pay full price on departure day for just a quick breakfast. Another case of poor communication with the hotel though was that they failed to tell us that the lounge would be closed half way through our stay for scheduled renovations. Would have been great to know when we paid for it, also so we weren't fumbling to try and get in looking like crazy people. In lieu of a refund they said we could use the main restaurant (in the basement) for breakfast, which we found acceptable since we needed to eat quickly. However, they didn't live up to this and still billed us and additional $64 for two people's mediocre buffet breakfast! Unacceptable and utterly disappointed about that. On the note of charges, though the pool may be beautiful, you better be ready to pay! They charge you per PERSON, per DAY to use the pool. In all my travels and work in the industry (I'm a former travel agent) I've never had a charge like this! Because of that, we didn't use the pool once, though I would have loved to. Also, internet was somewhere around $10 per day. Not ideal, but a lot of hotels still charge. Worth noting was that whenever we called downstairs for information such as directions or restaurant suggestions, they were always spot on! Made planning things on-the-go so much easier! We were also very proud to see the hotel participating in Earth Hour. They left voicemails asking guests to participate, and if interested join them in the lobby. They dimmed the lights and lit candles throughout the lobby and were having a social at the lobby bar. We were very impressed by this! Overall, very happy with the Swissotel brand and would quickly return. Found them comparable to the French styled Sofitel brand, that we very much enjoy. So just be aware of some of the fees, be patient with the front desk, and enjoy the accommodations and the lovely city! PS if you're looking for a unique way to tour the city, we highly recommend a Segway tour. We thought it sounded odd too, but had the time of our lives.

They offered to move us to another nearby hotel for the night, and Swissotel would take care of the cost for that night. As much as I would have rather just stayed there and paid for all 3 nights, I realized that there was nothing that could be done and this seemed like adequate compensation. I was under the impression that i would be refunded the cost of one nights stay. This was not the case. When I inquired about the refund upon checkout, the clerk informed me that the hotel had merely covered the cost of the other hotel.

We arrived early and were hoping to store our luggage but were told our room was ready and not a problem to check in early. 2. The check in person was courteous and wanted to know if there was anything we needed and what time would we like the Champaign to be delivered to the room that evening. She provided her name and asked that we contact her personally if we needed anything. 3. We requested extra towels and, upon return for dinner, there was a thank you note for the tip we left in the room for house service! 4. The champaign was on ice and waiting 5. The following morning we went to breakfast in the Geneva Room. What a wonderful experience. The staff was helpful and attentive, the breakfast was great. There was not only a brunch buffet, we were advised if there were anything else we would like, we only needed to ask. The server asked if we would like coffee to take back to our room. The food was hot and delicious. 6. Our bill was in our room that morning....no coupons or credits; the bill was accurate and had everything the hotel offered under the romance package. 7. They retrieved our car in less than ten minutes and there were two bottled waters in the car for our trip home.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo Ohio", "Title": "\u201cActually a disappointment\u201d", "Author": "Consultant2468", "ReviewID": "UR59465707", "Content": "Perhaps I was expecting something better but after staying at the Fairmont the past few years for my annual convention, I can say that the Swiss does not compare. The staff are courteous but they lack that \"extra\" that a seasoned traveler who knows many Fairmonts, 4 Seasons, Ritzs, and the like would expect. The level of service, the ambiance, the amenities reminded me more of a standard Hyatt or Westin. The specifics: 1. Glasses not replaced in the bathroom (this was a five day stay) 2. Even though the green card was placed on the bed to have the linens changed, they were not changed. 3. Eating choices - if you do not want to go out for dinner, your only choice is the Palm (another surprising disappointment), or very expensive room service. 4. The corner suites are interestingly shaped but cause a cramped location in the bedroom area. 5. The business work area is not as good as many of the newer Marriott's -- the desk area required going under the desk to get power; the ethernet cord on the desk was not connected and required an engineer to come to the room with another longer cord and after much manipulation, having to hook it up into the wall. (There is a Bose CD player - why don't they put more emphasis on the computer space? -- And shockingly, there is no desk lamp (type in the dark) 6. Parking valets are slow to respond; at least for us, they were not helpful in getting the luggage in. They brought it in and left it at the desk; then the desk person did not offer to get a person to take the luggage upstairs. 7. The bar is fair, not great wine choices; the food very slow to come (even for a bar) 8. I did not feel the concierge were that helpful - not much better than \"here is a map, try this; no favorite locations\" etc. 9. Yes, parking is $52 per night - but it is roughly the same at the next door Hyatt and Fairmont. Parking downtown Chicago is NOT cheap Once again, if I stay at a Hyatt or a Westin, I know what to expect -- but I do not expect to find this at a Swissotel.

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the town and will go out of your way to be helpful. While my boyfriend andI were trying to get to the Pedway, one of the hotel managers stopped what he was doing and lead us to where we were going. after a long and exhausting drive from Tennessee, the beds at the Swiss were incredibly welcoming too. My boyfriend is currently trying to find out how they make their beds so comfortable and where he can get one of their comforters because it felt so amazing. Getting little toblerone (one of my favorites) chocolates on your pillow everynight is a nice touch that adds some elegance to your evening no matter why your staying there. The rooms look like they were just remodled and upgraded, there was an HD TV and a nice iHome docking station to put my iPod so I could set the alarm to wake up with my music instead of the radio. The whole decor was really to my taste, and of course it helped that it was impeccibly clean the whole time. While I was out exploring chicago, the blanket that I'd brought from home and left in a chair was even folded neatly at the foot of the bed when I came back. I'm a little bathroom phobic and these were really nice, super clean, with beautiful (very new looking) tile. I'm really into showers and so i liked the big showerheads that give you the rainfall style shower. I didn't try out the tub though. Also, i know there's a 24 hour exercise/fitness facility upstairs. I walked through it to go use the pool and jacuzzi (talk about a pool with a view, try the 42nd floor! that was a fun place to swim). It looked like it had a lot of weights and machines to choose from but I never got to use any of them. We were staying to go to SOFA (the Sculptural Objects & Functional Art exposition) at Navy Pier. Having a great hotel in close proximity to Navy Pier, in a central location downtown, with a gerat view of Lake Michigan was important. (well the great view wasn't important, but it was a very nice bonus). The bar in the hotel lobby has a very comfrotable feel, even though stylistically its very classy. We saw several groups of people sitting around chatting with tables pulled together or by the fireplace, and both bartenders were very friendly and helpful answering questions about chicago. Our whole stay it felt like the staff went out of their way to make sure we had the best visit possible. Breakfast in the Geneva downstairs was great as well. I love fresh fruit but generally you only get apples and a banana, so seeing fresh raspberries, blueberries and strawberries (among other breakfast fruit staples) was surprising. They had a great selection of pastries, cereals, yogurt and breakfast meats. there were so many different things for breakfast (plus you could order off the menu) it would take too long to go into them, but I was happy to get such a variety of options. I wish I could mention every good thing about our stay...there were just so many little things that made it add up to a great trip. The only downside was that we had to leave. We're already planning a return trip to the Swiss where we can stay for at least a week to see parts of Chicago we missed and because we had such a great experience it really made us want to come back.", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooms, staff and location, but extras overpriced\u201d", "Author": "jruez", "ReviewID": "UR48348866", "Content": "My wife and I got a deal off hotwire for a 4 star near michigan and it ended up being this hotel.

We were not sure what to expect since we used Hotwire and got a great rate, so we were very pleased. The location is perfect. A couple blocks from Michigan, so a walk or a short $5 taxi ride takes you to any shop you would like. We went to the Shedd Aquarium for around $6-7. We also found that if you take the escalator down under the hotel, there is a dunkin donuts and many other shops/restaurants to eat. They are open during the week, but most were closed on saturday. Room service was expensive in the hotel. I just remember $29 for eggs benedict. Don't quote me on that exact prices, but it is pretty close. Even with the amount we saved on the room, we could not justify spending the amount they listed for room service. We found a great place for breakfast a few block away called South Water Kitchen - great meals and we spent about $35 between us. We paid for parking at the hotel. It is as expensive as everyone says - $52 per day - but we felt with what we saved, it wasn't too bad. I would rather not have taken a car at all, but needed it for a day of work. I will save my money next time on the car and parking and use Go Airport Express to/from the airport or a cab, then use cabs or walk to get around the city.

Generally applicable comments: the standard rooms are small, the lobby bar is very small (not amenable to a lot of people having a post-meeting drink). Compare the large and lively lobby bars at the Marriott or Westin North River. The bathroom mirrors are not well placed for applying make-up, a minimum number of towels are supplied, the shampoo was not refilled without my express request, and no conditioner was supplied -- bring your own conditioner!

The hotel is not smack-bang on the Magnificent Mile, so if a super-central location - i.e. one right in the middle of the hustle and bustle - is important to you, then you may wish to try the Marriott or the Intercontinental. However, the Swissotel is so close to all that, but is also nicely removed from it; located closer to Navy Pier, it is quieter and a lot calmer, but still offers easy access to the shopping and attractions of the city. A pleasant stroll along the river brings you out at the end of the Magnificent Mile, where it is also possible to catch a boat trip or join one of the 'hop on, hop off' bus/trolley tours. I've olny ever stayed in the 'standard' rooms in this property, all of which are spacious and airy, and function well for both business or leisure travellers. There is always a generously-sized workdesk, which would easily accommodate two working on their laptops, (though there is only one chair provided). I have generally had two telephones in the room, (one on the workdesk and another on the coffee table beside the lounge chair), but on this occasion, I only have the one. Not a major issue at all, but worth noting. Similarly, the size of the bathroom on this visit is smaller than usual - but it still has the separate walk-in shower as well as a bath, which is very much appreciated! Rooms all appear to either look out onto the river and the bustle of Chicago or, on the other side, will face Navy Pier, (an especially great view during the summer months when there are regular firework displays). The technology in the room is good and up-to-date; a large plasma TV, (I think...I'm not especially up on these things!), is complemented by a handy clock/radio on the nightstand which also allows you to charge your ipod and indeed play music from the ipod through the speakers, which makes a nice touch. On the negative side, the minibar is one of those nasty move-anything-and-you'll-pay-through-the-nose ones, which I have come to hate with a vengeance! I have in the past called Guest Services for the loan of a mini-fridge which was previously installed in the room with no problem; this time round, I was told there was a flat US$50 fee for this, irrespective of the duration of the stay. Well I'd appreciate this being mentioned in the in-room literature, and don't exactly understand such a hefty charge, (it's not like I'm going to run off with the thing!), especially when I'd be paying the same for less than 24 hours useage as a traveller spending a week here...(needless to say, I didn't pay!) Also worth mentioning is that this can be quite a 'conference' destination which can make things very busy if you are staying during one of these events; service can be slow and erratic, and the wait for elevators can be long and frustrating! The breakfast buffet in the Geneva restaurant is a highlight and a good start to the day. There is a definite continental twist to the spread on offer, with a lovely birchermusli and lots of cold cuts to accompany the usual American-style fayre. The serving times are generously extended over the weekend so breakfast can quite easily become a leisurely brunch, and it's worth taking your time over the whole thing if you're not in a rush! An excellent choice when staying in Chicago, but I would recommend trying to get a room on a higher floor if possible to maximise your enjoyment of the views!", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "mangomojito", "Title": "\u201cNothing not to like\u201d", "Author": "mangomojito", "ReviewID": "UR36256189", "Content": "I think my title says it all. While there was nothing that I absolutely fell in love with at this hotel, there was also nothing not to like either. We managed to secure an unbelievable deal very last minute for the Swissotel. It wasn't my first choice to be honest, but it more than lived up to my expectations and superceded what I needed to get out of it. The location is almost unbeatable for the price. And it does earn cred for being the only triangular shape hotel building in Chicago. It sits right above the river and depending where your room is you'll get unparallelled views of the architecture, two bodies of water and the beautifully lit Navy Pier at night. We faced the Wrigley building on the 29th floor. It was a bit unnerving to also be facing a busy office building across the street from us especially when it came to changing or just relaxing. But we really did spend very little time in our rooms.When it comes to the rooms, its your standard run of the mill hotel room. Clean, a bit on the small side. We had two doubles and I have to say the room felt a bit cramped. One of the beds were almost up against the wall. Yes, while the best thing going for this hotel is the location they do have some negatives too. It's not the hippest or most trendy place. If you're single you're probably not going to have a kickin time here. I saw that it was mostly families, older couples or suited people coming in for conventions. The staff is friendly enough and check in, check out went smoothly without incident. The rooms were cleaned spic and span every day. The beds were comfortable but it was too soft/plush for me, but that's a matter of personal preference. The mini bar is super annoying as they charge you for just moving things out of place, but it is also a no brainer to rectify the situation at check out. They are probably so used to these types of complaints, they didn't give us a hard time at all. All in all, I was within a 5-10 min walk to most of the major destinations in downtown. The loop, the red and blue line, the El, millennium park, grant park, lake shore, the boat tours, steps from Michigan Ave and Magnificient Mile, Navy Pier. The convenience factor is unbeatable. There are tons of restaurants within a few block radius. We never ate anything onsite so I can't vouch for the food options immediately avialable. Another thing that was annoying was the fact that they charge for internet, the gym and the pool. But I guess they have to make money somehow since they practically give their rooms away. It's really a great value for the money and I wouldnt mind to stay here again if I was visiting the city again.

The front desk was very nice about letting us check-in at 12 noon and then storing our bags with the bellman. The desk clerk told us that most days we would have been able to have a room at noon, but that the hotel had been sold out the night before and there were many people still checking out at noon.

I was visiting on business so I am not sure I would stay at your hotel again. Your prices are prohibitive for a personal visit, and I was actually a little surprised at all the extra charges. My husband and I travel extensively and this was our first Swissotel. We were so disappointed to find every amenity was an extra charge. $11.00 for a bottle of water, a gym use charge, and the wireless was charged per laptop! That was truly a first for us. Many families now have multiple laptops and this will be one of my main warnings in my reviews. We stay in Klimpton Hotels, Omni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Sofitel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as well as Hilton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and I believe all of them offer complimentary wireless (though some require a free signup for their member services). Even if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer it in the room, the lobby has complimentary wireless. You can see this is critical for us, and I suspect, for many who travel on a regular basis. The room was nice and large and I assume I was given a handicap room (though we do not have disabilities) because of the conference rate. A heads up by the front desk about this would have been nice, though I suspect this explains the reason the room was so spacious. The tub though did look a little hospital like with the bars and the drippy faucet staining the porcelain. We should have reported the drip, but we were kidding that we might get charged for it :) Some of the concierge staff were abit chilly at times, but the housekeeping service staff were extremely friendly and cheerful. Too bad on several days, they were not able to service the room until late afternoon. Another surprise when we wanted to take at nap at 4:30pm and the room was still not cleaned. We did appreciate the promptness of any requests we made (e.g. wakeup calls, non-allergen pillows, shampoo) That said, we were again surprised that we had to request shampoo! On the second day we finally realized, nope, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a mistake, they just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide it. However, as we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring any extra in our packing, we called and, as noted, it was promptly delivered.

All of the trains, buses, shopping areas, bars, etc. are within walking distance from the hotel or a very short taxi ride away. Also, Giordano's Pizza is five minutes away from the hotel. HIGHLY recommend this fantastic pizza!! Some of the drawbacks were the thin walls and not being able to rest comfortably when others were using the shower in your room or in another room, a very slippery shower after it was cleaned and no vending machines. Also, there were limited television channels and the charges for internet were ridiculous(I stood at a dingy hotel in NY and they had wireless internet service), but one should not go on vacation to surf the net or watch television anyway.

Check-in was smooth. I had called ahead to request a high floor and a view of Grant Park. I had hoped that we could see some of the fireworks on July 3rd from our room (30th floor). I asked the check-in clerk if this would be possible and he said that even from the high floors, there would be obstructed views. The room itself was nice but not spotless. There was garbage under the desk, the capsule in the coffee maker from the previous user was still in the coffee maker, and our bed sheet had a hole in it (about 1\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd long).

LOCATION Perfect. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right by the Chicago River and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proximity to Lake Shore Drive, makes for a quicker cab ride to the Airport or north to Wrigley Field. There are few buildings between the Swissotel and Lake Michigan, making for gorgeous views, yet you are in the heart of it all. The Michigan Avenue bridge is only two blocks away. Grant Park and Navy Pier are also a short walk. ROOMS If you can swing it, get a corner suite. Because the building is a triangular shape, you get a sweeping view that is absolutely stunning. A lot of windows, but nice light-tight drapes for a good nite sleep. Tasteful modern decor and roomy. The bathroom and bedroom are separated by a good distance. The beds are heavenly. VIEWS From a corner suite, you can see the Navy Pier, Millenium Fountain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hourly water arch across the Chicago River, Lake Michigan & the Harbor, Buckingham Fountain and part of Millenium Park. We were lucky enough to see the 9:30pm fireworks show from our window that are set from Navy Pier on the weekend. STAFF Has that midwestern charm. The bell hops and front desk personnel are very helpful and friendly. I did not hear a peep out of housekeeping who were respectful. MISC. Every third floor has an ice machine. The 9th and 12th Floors for example have ice. The location of the machine is in an isolated room, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m assuming to drown out the noise. It was a little creepy at night. Guys won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care, women may feel a little ill at ease, but could certainly call room service. The staff is quite accommodating. In the lobby the hotel offers complimentary water, which may not sound like much, but the ice cold jugs have freshly cut fruit in them such as melon or strawberries. The restaurant in the hotel is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Palm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which has several locations nationwide and serves up a good steak. If you take a river architecture cruise, the guides will point out the Swissotel as one of architect Harry Weese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triangle obsessed marvels.

Through Travelzoo.com, I became aware of a discounted room rate and jumped at the offer of about $150 night including taxes. This year, for the second consecutive year, I attended the Air and Water Show. Newspaper accounts say that over three million people visited that weekend. The Blue Angels were terrific. The wait to check in was long. There were two people working behind the reservation desk late morning. After about 15-to-20 minutes in line, I was told my reservation was not on file. I then gave the confirmation number and hotel print out to the person at the front desk and after a few more minutes, I was finally checked in. A minor inconvenience but I sensed another person was having a similar experience based on conversation to which I overheard. The room was exceptional. It was bright and appealing. The room was also promptly cleaned. Great view including part of Lake Michigan. There are new high-rises and the like being built all around Chicago and one near the Swissotel. I awoke one morning to an inspiring sunrise, a red/orange ball that was sparkling. The bed was one of the best I have encountered in any hotel. The comforter was incredibly soft while the bed and the mattress pad were ideal. The room had plenty of space, certainly bigger than other hotels I have visited in recent years. My room had an LG 37-inch LCD TV that was fantastic. I'm not much of a TV viewer but I did catch some of the 2008 Olympic events at odd hours and the clarity of images displayed were exceptional. I stayed on the 35th floor and still the elevators were quick if not immediate. I visited the pool area briefly, but didn't stay since the weather was close to perfect during my stay and opted to see the city as often as possible. My opinion on the location is neutral. If you have a vehicle, this hotel is exceptional because it is somewhat removed from Michigan Ave and the usual congestion associated with hotels on (or just off) major streets. This hotel is located on Wacker off Michigan and the isolation has its benefits but as an avid walker, I prefer a stay around the John Hancock Building. The Hyatt was within steps of the Swissotel and what looked like an office building in between the two major hotel properties. Steps away, is a Houlihans bar/restaurant with outdoor seating. Additionally, there seemed to be an increase of homeless people near the area, though not in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. In fact, on consecutive nights I had the same woman follow me for about a dozen or so steps. This was after midnight on each occasion. A friend, who stayed at the nearby Hard Rock Hotel, had somewhat similar experiences. About a 3-to-5 minute walk away is a Giordano's Restaurant -- famous for deep dish pizza. It was perfect for late night dining. The lobby of the hotel was cozy and as a pleasant touch there were two glass dispensers offering a mix of ice water and diced fresh fruit added for flavor. A Palm Restaurant is located in the lobby, too. Late at night, there was a bowl of fruit near the reservation desk. A daily Wall Street Journal was dropped at the door of each guest's room, another nice touch. There was also a handful of copies of the Chicago Tribune adjacent to the reservation desk.

It's a very short walk to the Magnificent Mile, plenty of restaurants, the Navy Pier, the train, and there is a cab stand right in front and a Dunkin Donuts next door. A cab from Midway Airport was $35. A cab from Wrigley was $13. My only complaint about the hotel is that the mini bar has a weight sensor. So if you move around bottles in the fridge so that you can store your own food/personal items, the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged. Or that's at least what the front desk told me. Considering how much this hotel costs, it would be nice if they provided you with a fridge large enough to store your own items in it.

Booked a package through Priceline, and would stay there again in a heartbeat. ROOM The king-sized bed was very comfortable, and all of the linens were fresh and clean. The room was spacious, not cramped at all. The bathroom was spotless--no mildew, no stains, and nicely appointed with little soaps and the usual toiletries. They were replenished daily. We didn't get a full lake view (didn't pay or ask for one, either), but the view was still nice, and we saw a lot of fireworks from our window. I should mention that, despite the obvious construction in the area, we were not disturbed by any drilling or other noises. Left the room at 10:30 or 11 a.m. every day, but did not hear noise. LOCATION The hotel was central to everything we wanted to see. Navy Pier is extremely close, Michigan Avenue is just a short walk away, and it's just a few blocks to the \"EL\" Red Line Station. Cabs also line the street in front of the hotel, so there's no delay in catching a ride. I felt very safe walking the area at night, as there were a lot of other people and tourists. I did see a few homeless people, but that's to be expected in any city. Police presence was high, especially at the Taste of Chicago and Navy Pier. SERVICE Everyone was efficient, no big lines for check-in or check-out. People smiled and said hello. At one point, our room key became deactivated, but that was quickly fixed. Housekeeping did a great job keeping the room and bathroom spotless. VALUE The room exceeded our expectations, especially because we received a discounted rate. I imagine if I'd paid full price, I wouldn't be too happy about the $9.99 fee for 24 hours of dial-up internet, but that's becoming the norm at most hotels. Also, they charge exorbitant prices for mini-bar items and room service meals, so be prepared for that. ($6 bottled water) We purchased our water from the Walgreens down the street.

I got exactly that. A beautifully decorated, well-equipped and stylish room. It does suffer, however, from a trend that I have been noticing that as rooms at business class hotels are upgraded - particularly with a patch panel for the big LCD-TV - drawer space becomes less and less. As someone who actually likes to unpack if I am staying more than one night, it has become a problem. I end up using the nightstand drawers. The V.I.K. (Very Important Kids) check-in desk next to the front desk leads me to believe that the hotel is family-friendly. The location is great - near Michigan Avenue and with a view of the lake, but just far enough from Michigan to feel like you're away from the hub of activity. My one issue was with the staff. The front desk staff were friendly and relatively efficient but utterly lacked any warmth (both check-in and check-out). Without meaning to stereotype, they were both European and I don't know if that had anything to do with it. The doorman was another story. He seemed friendly enough and appeared to be a local. I arrived late and just wanted a light meal. He suggested The Palm in the hotel lobby but I told him I wanted something lighter and more casual. He then suggested Houlihans. Now I don't mean to sound like a snob, but when you're in one of the great cities in the world, staying at what is supposed to be a high-end hotel, to have the doorman recommend Houlihans is like asking what is a good car to buy and being told to consider a Yugo.

Hotel was beautiful. Staff was very accomodating. If you are going to stay here, be sure and get their points membership before you go. When you arrive, ask for an upgrade. They will ask for your card. I had my number put on my reservation so I didn't take my card. We were upgraded to a corner room that overlooked the river, Navy Pier and the Lake.

I always tip housekeeping and the staff never disappointed. The only complaint I had about the room was the shower was very very small. I could hardly turnaround in it. I will say, if you are not a walker and want to be on Michigan Ave then I wouldn't stay here. This hotel is 3 Chicago blocks (which are longer that regular blocks) from Michigan Ave. Then you have to walk Michigan for a long time to see it all. I would use the CTA if you want to stay here and do Michigan Ave.Go to Michigan and pay even more for your hotel. Right now the Swissotel is running a summer special. Our room was only $129/night. It was worth it to me to save money and walk. Besides I had already done the Michigan Ave thing! If you are into public transportation. From Midway airport, take the orange line to State and Lake. You are appoximately 4 or 5 blocks from the hotel. As far as CTA, the #6 bus stops accross the street from the hotel and goes South on Michigan. Also, if you plan on using public transportation, get the visitors pass. You can get a 3 day pass for only $12 and it gives you unlimited train and buss access. You will need to transfer to get over to State street where the \"real\" shopping goes on (i.e.: Macy's, Filenes Basement, etc). I would recommend the \"West Egg\" fro breakfast (3 blocks off Michigan on Ontario) and for lunch or dinner The Grand Lux Cafe (corner of Michigan and Ontario). Also don't forget to go the \"The River North\" for great food. Check out the Blue Water Grill for dinner. Pricey, but very good.

The front desk staff was never very helpful when we had any requests for simple things. When does the shuttle leave for O'hare? How much is the shuttle? Why is the cleaning staff telling us they are out of coffee for the rooms? Can we borrow a screwdriver to fix our daughter's Gameboy? All of these were answered by blank stares and major confusion. On July 4th, we were checking out. I needed to print out our boarding passes. The business center was closed due to the holiday. I went to the front desk to ask to have 5 minutes of access to the \"Executive Level\" business center to print our passes. At this point the only place open with internet access. I was told \"no, it is an access only room\". Huh? I explained what was going on and they could charge us whatever, we needed to print these passes. So the hunt for the key to the business office began. Now most normal people would have saved the hassle and sent us up to the Executive Floor. After 20 mins of not finding anyone with a key, guess where I ended up...the Executive Floor to print our boarding passes, totally silly. Just not a great overall feel from the front desk or the concierge. The rooms were nice, clean and updated. The beds super comfortable. BE ADVISED!!! There is major construction going on right behind the hotel at the new development AQUA. Non-stop from sun up to sun down. Drilling, pounding, ect. Did not bother us as we were pretty far away. We could really only hear in our bathroom and in lobby of hotel. However, we were never advised of this. Several other hotels also have major construction going on around them, so not a huge deal, no dust, which would have been a bummer. Overall, our room was super cheap on Expedia. Would we stay again, if we could get the same rate. Would I pay over $199 a night, most likely not. You can get better customer service elsewhere for much less.

I was pretty underwhelmed overall. The room itself was mostly fine, but in general the stay was just OK. THE RESERVATION: I found a decent rate on TravelZoo and booked it directly on the Swiss website about a month before my stay. I called the day before to confirm, and no one could find any record of my reservation. I even e-mailed my confirmation to the gentleman in reservations, and all he could do (after several calls and him agreeing that their system had simply lost my info) was forward my e-mail to the reservation manager. And when I called the next morning to ensure it had been addressed--guess what--the reservation manager had no idea and I needed to start over with the explainations and fixing. All this, and I was assigned a room with a view of mostly the office building next door. I'd like to think they would have marked my reservation for a better room, given all the hassles. THE ROOM: My room was comfortable (very good bed linens and towels) and clean. There's an Ipod docking station but I never was able to make it work with my Ipod. The drapes don't block the light, however, so even with a west-facing room it was bright very early in the morning. THE DINING: I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and room service. The restaurant was steep, even for a business hotel. Oatmeal/toast/bacon took me close to $40. Room service, however, was prompt and good. I had for a surprisingly large and yummy pizza--there was easily enough for two. I chose chicken/spinach/artichoke and was tickled that I got to relax in my room with a meal ($16 for the pizza) that fit well within my expense report limits. THE ANNOYANCE: Upon checkout, I asked the concierge about how long the shuttle ride to O'Hare would take. I was shocked at the 90 minute time she quoted--after all, it was early on a Saturday--but she was insisted that was the travel time so I scheduled myself accordingly. As it turned out, it was just under 45 minutes, and I had lots of time to kill at the airport. THE LOCATION: Overall, the location is just OK--it's walkable to Mag Mile, State Street (just under a mile), theatre district, Navy Pier (again, just under a mile), a nearby movie theater, and restaurants. But unlike other comparable hotels, there aren't delightful restaurants and great shops just outside the door--you'd better wear comfortable shoes at all times. IN SUM: It was missing the amenities I've come to enoy and expect--turndown, free internet, high quality toiletries--from hotels in this price range. It may be fine for corporate gatherings, but for the independent business traveler or the family on a leisure trip, you can do better. If you just need a place to crash, the Swiss is fine.

We have mostly very positive things to say, and would probably stay there again if we ever go to Chicago. At least if we can find as good a deal as we did this time. I would like to point out some things you should be aware of: 1) There's a lot of construction work around the Swissotel. The hotel seems to be 100 % soundproof, so that's no problems. But within a year or so the magnificent lake view will probably be only a memory of the past. The same goes for the view of the park area to the south. 2) Make sure that you don't get a room right next to the elevators, since these make a lot of sound, speedy as they are. We first got room 3301, but had to change. No problems at all at the front desk - they seemed to be used to it. The original room had a lakefront view which was stunning. The second room overlooked the city and river, with a good look of the Wrigley Building. Not as exciting, but still very good. Beware of office workers who probably can see right into your room from a 100 feet distance. 3) We had an Executive Room which granted us access to the 42nd floor Executive Lounge with day-round complimentary beverage service (non-alcoholic), an evening serving of hors d'ouvres (sorry for the spelling) and pastries, and free Internet Access. Also a great view. The Executive status did not grant us free access to the gym, which came for a cost of $15. The pool and sauna was free for all guests. 4) The restaurant and bar service on the ground floor was OK, but during our stay, the lobby was always really full of other guests. Maybe since the hotel had a really good spring offer, which attracted more private guests compared to the usual business people. 5) The Executive room was smaller than expected, probably a standard room, although on high floors. I would probably choose a corner room next time, which looks larger on their website. The King bed was excellent, LCD-TV really nice, and the room came with a stereo with iPod docking station as well as a really good coffee brewer. Nice! The bathroom featured both a tub and a shower and was in perfect condition. The last remark in fact goes for the whole room, the cleaning service was perfect and the room recently renovated. 6) Make sure to sign up for the Club Swiss Gold bonus program before your stay for better front desk service and it will strengthen your chances of a free upgrade.

The bathroom was large and modern, but the corner shower was a bit cramped and water invariably leaked onto the floor each time. A hassle...not a deal-breaker.

After waiting in the line for more than 30 minutes, we finally got to our room and were disappointed to see that it didn't look anything like the photos online. It looked like it hadn't been updated since the late 1980's. Later that night while trying to go to sleep we realized that you could hear the elevators traveling up and down all night from our room. The shower head couldn't be adjusted and because of the awkward bathroom layout you could not turn the shower on or adjust the temperature without the stream of water hitting you in the face. I slipped in the bathroom as I learned the hard way that the shower also leaked. After this incident we asked management to change us to a new room and found the second room to have identical issues as the first.

(don't even think about buying your own to place in the fridge. Just moving the items will trigger a charge to your bill! So I did not even open the fridge) There was a charge to use the gym. Being on the far end of Wacker Drive, if you are not into walking, you have to use a cab. Other than that, Michigan Ave is only a couple blocks away. Be warned however that if you stay on the south facing side of the building, a new building is going up next door and there is construction going on. The noise was not an issue unless you like to sleep in late. I am not sure how tall this structure will be but by judging the existing high rises that are around, the view from the room will more than likely be blocked soon.

I booked on travelzoo.com and got a fantastic rate of $109 a night. My total was $250.51 for a quiet room with a king bed. Upon checking in I informed Nury at the front desk of the promotional price and asked her to explain my charges to me so that I would know which card that I wanted to put it on. She said that she would, but she handed my wife a piece of paper and asked her to sign. My wife handed me the paper and I signed where it said that the rate was $109. Nury didn\\'t explain anything to us, and I asked her to explaine again and she simply smiled and said have a great stay. My wife was exhausted from a 5 hour train ride so we proceeded to our room. The room was not what I\\'d asked for it was a double and not a king. We changed out of our dirty clothes and made some calls to our kids and since we had reservations we left. As soon as we got back we informed the front desk attendant that we asked for a King and got a double. She gladly upgraded our room with a LakeSide view. I asked her to make sure that we had a quiet room. She smiled. When we got to the room it took the bellman 30 minutes to get our things. Not a problem but he was not very nice. My wife offered him a tip but he refused. The King room was amazing, but one issue, we have 5 kids at home and very hetic jobs and we requested twice a quiet room. She put us right next to the elevator and next to very noisey guests. I slept fine, but my wife is a light sleep and she only got 3 hours sleep Friday night. She said that there were teenagers making a lot of noise in the hallway. The next morning she went to Nury and spoke with her about it. Nury simply smiled and said that the next time my wife should call down to the front desk to complain. My wife was not pleased with the response, but nevertheless we proceeded to breakfast. I decided to check our debit card to see what our balance was. I was very upset when I learned that the Swissotel charged our card $461! After breakfast we went to the front desk and spoke with Nury and she smiled again and told us that they charged our card $75 a day for incidentals. INCIDENTALS? I asked her to explain that to me and she just kept smiling and said that it was for incidentals. My wife was very upset with Nury and her snobbish attitude so she said that we asked her to explain the charges to us the day that we checked in which was Friday, April 18th and she didn\\'t explain them. We asked her twice. My wife asked her if there was a language barrier and if she didn\\'t understand her when she requested an explaination. My wife was very upset so I asked her to please explain the charges and Nury simply said I already did. So to keep my wife calm I took her back to our room and called the manager. When I spoke to the manager she was just as uncaring as Nury. I explained to her that had Nury explained that they were going to hold over $200 extra dollars on my debit card I would\\'ve used another credit card. I informed her that we asked Nury to explain the charges twice and she then said that we signed a paper, I told her that we read the paper and signed it, but when we asked Nury to explain the charges she should\\'ve explained that they were going to charge an extra $200. Which she didn\\'t. The manager didn\\'t care. I am not one to complain, but you have a lovely hotel and I would reccommend your establishment however we were treated like we didn\\'t matter. I checked my credit card and my money is still gone. Is it their policy to take money from your patrons? In my eyes that is a step up from stealing because we did not utilize the mini bar, room service or the business center. The staff really need to take a class in interpersonal communication. The bell man was very rude to us and the way that Nury and the manager treated us was simply uncalled for.

Not an auspicious start, considering other hotels at least pretend to care by discussing my smoking and bed preferences and giving me a brief rundown on the hotel amenities and restaurants (he didn't). I ended up with a double on the 7th floor - I would've preferred a King since I was alone, but it was one of the renovated rooms so I decided to keep it. The room was fine - neutral modern decor in varying shades of beige, flatscreen TV, and a nice view of the city. The bathroom was spacious, with a separate shower and tub. The bed was comfortable, but would have liked a firmer pillow. There were a number of details that made my stay not-so-great: 1. No soap for the sink or shower! They brought some up right away, but it really set the tone for the rest of the stay. 2. Wireless internet was not working. Had to call tech-support on my cell since toll-free calls are charged by the hotel. Tech-support (IBAHN) called the front desk to have an ethernet cable sent to my room. An hour later, I had to call again because I still had not received the cable. Wired internet was good, and you can roam with Boingo or T-Mobile accounts. 3. My room was never made-up. I left the hotel for 4 hours in the afternoon with the do-not-disturb sign removed, but it was not serviced when I returned. Of course, by then there was no point in calling housekeeping because I didn't want to wait in the lobby while they tidied up. 4.

It cost $5 from the hotel to the Water Tower. Before I left, I asked the concierge for shopping info: the polite gentleman gave me a map, pointed out well known stores, and gave me a 10% discount coupon to Macy's and Bloomingdales. Our room was on the 32nd floor with a closeup view of a construction site and a frozen Lake Michigan in the distance. We weren't interested in a view.

The bathroom was roomy, with both a tub and separate shower (the plumbing was a little noisy). We were very comfortable. After shopping in the blizzard, I tried to order a late lunch at the lobby cafe -- but even though the desk clerk said it was open there was no one around. It was cozy sitting by the fireplace, but after 15 minutes I got tired and left. I ended up ordering room service. It was delivered within 15 minutes: a fabulous herb-filled tuna salad wrap and gorgeous fruit (huge portions that I could've easily shared). Hubby's conference met that evening on the top floor with a panoramic view of the skyline -- very lovely in a blizzard! The hotel buffet had fabulous food. The waite staff was annoying: talking loudly among themselves, taking away plates while you were still nibbling, bringing the wrong drinks, etc. The next night we had a late supper in The Palm Restaurant on the main floor. The atmosphere was low key - like a private club. The staff was unbelievably friendly and efficient.

We get there and they tell us they overbooked the hotel and they were moving us to a suite but that it was just like as a regular room. I get to the \"ROOM\" and it was horrible. It was an office space with a murphy bed, they said it was a king size bed. No my queen size bed at home was bigger than that. The shower was nasty and the door wouldnt close. The tub had a semidirt ring ughhhhhhhhh. I went downstairs to complain and some man said in a very condecending tone, \"Well when you book off of Hotwire you get what we give you\" Excuse me, I pay my money like everyone else. He then told me that they have no more rooms available and i was just going to have to deal with it since i was only staying a night. O really?? I called from my cell phone and asked if they had any rooms available and they said yes its blah blah blah. I went downstairs and complained some more. Is this how they treat everyone or is it because I look a lot younger than I am? I asked to speak with a manager before I lost my cool with him. They got me someone else and all they could give me was breakfast. We came down for a party and werent going to be up by breakfast time. I walked away and went to get ready for my party. It was an all white affair(everyone wears white clothing) and the iron spit black gunk on my white pants, glad I had a backup. The next morning at checkout, the woman i spoke with was very nice she apologized for the man last night comp'd me lunch and took care of my parking.

Here's a rundown of our \"pros\" and \"cons\" overall. Pros: very nice pool and spa on the 42nd floor, rooms and lobby were clean, easy walk to Michigan Ave through via the lower level walkway to the Illinois State center, beds were comfortable. Cons: no free internet access ($9.95/day) is a major no no these days. Slight mold found in shower. Fan for room heating/air was noisy at times - it literally sounded like a woodpecker at 2am one night. No room fridge except the well-stocked but highly monitored fridge loaded with snacks and booze. Ice machines are not on every floor, so to keep your own beverage cold you may need to go quite a way to get ice. When you do find the ice, it is in a service area often cluttered with maid carts. There is no vending in this building either, but you can get snacks at the gift shop. You're better off going down to the Dunkin Donuts near the walkway to the Illinois Center, it's a quick walk. Also, there is a condo tower being built on the North side of the building. Construction could be noisy at lower levels, but personally I was fascinated to have such a good view of the construction activity, cranes, etc. Guys will like it but I could see it being a problem if you're trying to work quietly or have a sleeping baby.

My hotel stay came about through a priceline bid. We paid $147 (without taxes) per night; Saturday arrival, Sunday departure. Our goal was to Christmas shop; first weekend of December stay. First and foremost, the location is terrible. \"Close to\" means quite a hike. Just to get to Michigan Avenue was several blocks. Then, you are at the END of Michigan Avenue. To get to the good stores you have another hike. To get to State Street to see the original Macy's and more shopping, it was an even further hike. I'm 37 years old and when I crawled into bed that evening I ached all over, but mostly my feet were killing me. My friend felt the same way; the next day our hips ached from all the walking. (By the end of the day we did start paying for taxi rides; we were miserable.) Secondly, the hotel is rated a four star and I didn't get why. It was simply a very average room. And, by the way, if you move anything in the refrigerator, you will be charged for it. The products have sensors on them. We put a piece of cheesecake in the refrigerator and had to move the items around to make it fit. The next morning we had over $60 in minibar charges that we had to dispute. Not much of a dispute; they took them off the bill without questioning us...but it was still ridiculous. Food is beyond expensive. Two decaf coffees, one bagel with cream cheese, and a small blueberry muffin at the \"bar\" in the lobby cost $18. Staff was very, very professional; however, where is the smile? Where is the kindness? Even asking the concierge was like talking to a drill sargeant. I just want nice! I did ask for a room upgrade...a \"lake view.\" I was told it was $30 more. I declined. My friend's room was also handicap. Her toilet was very high...and she's short. It was very awkward for her. Then, the toilet seat cover didn't fit the toilet bowl shape. Also awkward. Just would have been nice if she had been told so she had the option of declining such a room. Our biggest problem with this hotel truly came down to the location.

Additional pluses are an indoor pool and gym on the 42nd floor, with some spectacular views, and internet connection at a reasonable price ($10/d).

My first room had a loose window, producing an amazing howl, so I moved nearby. The bathroom was fine, though strangely, had only one small bar of soap. Most annoying was the minibar.

Plus like I said Sundays are free. 2.Noise is an issue. a.There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a condo building being built next door so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be greeted at 7am by the noise of heavy equipment construction. This will surely get worse as right now (August 07) they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only on the foundation: as the building rises the noise will get worse as they get closer to guest rooms. b.CTA and tour buses idle in front of the hotel on the part of Upper Wacker that dead-ends by the hotel. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a light sleeper I would highly consider getting a higher floor city view room. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a deep sleeper and even had some troubles. 3.While the sheets/blankets were nice, the bedding and pillow were sub-par. The mattress in our room needs to be replaced ASAP. 4.High speed internet is $10/day. The WiFi signals weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best, but at least there was a wired Ethernet connection as a backup. 5.Furniture looks like newer patterns, but the wood is beat up badly. 6.Shower stall is very small: almost reminds you of a old style phone booth. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 6\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 3\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and 200lbs so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a tall but normal build guy. The shower head was fine height but I kept bumping my knees, elbows, shoulders and head when trying to take a shower. Someone of a heavy build, pregnant or older age would have a real problem and be stuck taking a bath. 7.The gym on one of the top floors has a lot of great equipment and even better views. Full slate of cardio, cable machines and free weights that would rival a normal gym. However at $12/day per person we skipped it and took a long walk along the lake. 8.The lobby isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best design and can easily get very clogged when the traffic level gets high. One time I had to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excuse me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to six different people to get from the front door to the elevators. 9.Not enough storage. Beyond the closet there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any other place in our room to put our luggage/clothes. No drawers or similar place to keep stuff out of the open. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all bad. 1.The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. 2.The rooms were very clean. 3.Heating/AC control worked very well. 4.Large selection of TV channels. Also one last note: the door handles only work upwards. Was tough for me since my office is the opposite. While at the price we paid I could overlook a lot of these issues. But if I paid the $300+/night most websites were charging, I would check other hotels out.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cDecent choice\u201d", "Author": "HondaCivicMan", "ReviewID": "UR8590044", "Content": "Reading the mixed reviews before going to the Swissotel in Chicago made me hesitate. While I can't speak against those other poor reviews I can only base my review on my direct (and therefore limited) experience. We stayed there on Aug 20-23, 38th floor, Room 3817. We had it on a discount deal. The place was clean and quiet, as we requested a high floor and a quiet room. Our room was a south facing room, directly in front of a shorter office building with construction going on right beneath us, and a new construction to our left that did not obstruct us so was ok. Between buildings on the right, we could see parts of Millennium Park and between buildings on the left, we could see the Marina. Personally, we liked this view, particularly at night, as we are from Washington, DC and don't have tall buildings and the goings-on around them. Construction noise was minimal from this height, and I've been in som noisy hotels; it wasn't much more noise than any hotel located in a big city. The bed was clean, well made, and comfy (to us), which was a bit harder than ours at home. The carpet was very clean and looked new or refurbished. The bathroom was decent with an open design and bright lights; it seemed bigger than average and looks like a retro-1930's fashion/art deco without being garish or gaudy at all. There were some small water stains on the tile in the shower, but by gosh, you'd need to look pretty hard at it to know. The tv, btw, had some volume control issues but that was minor. The a/c was a big refresher from the hot humid days we stayed during the big rain storms that week. I think the Swissotel is a reliable choice. I kept thinking whether this is a 4-star. It's not a 3-star. I'd say 3.5 star. For the price, it is a deal either way you look at it. However, with the much more expensive competitors right next door, I think its a decent place for the more budget minded business or tourist traveller, though it doesn't seem directly aimed at the family travellers. They are right next door to KPMG and do a lot of convention business but it wasn't as fancy nor terrible as some seem to have written.

So I called again, this time got the front desk, they did say if a room was available before 3:00 you could check in. Got to hotel, rooms weren't ready yet. Feasible since there were 3 large groups meeting there. Finally got a corner room. Looked ok. 1. Bathroom looked like it came out of the early 1990's with round circular lightbulbs going around the mirror. Shower was very tight and small. Mold growing in between tile. Fellow coworker had leaky shower head and door. I had a leaky showerhead.Toliet made funny noises after being flushed. Took forever to find hairdryer. In case you are looking for it's in a white bag in the coat closet hanging off the bathrobe. Overall bathroom needs a complete remodel. 2. Bed-= absolutely awful. Nowadays most hotels have nice comfortable beds. Unless you like really firm beds, this bed is not for those who are used to luxury pillowtops. The mattress was old and hard. Could not fall asleep on. Actually got a backache from it for 2 days. 3. TV and Internet connection: slow, they do have wireless. Wireless is free but to activate it and link your computer to it there is an fee of $10. TV has something to be desired. Even if you are waking up in the morning or winding down in the evening, the TV connection was bad due to use of sattelite. Co-worker had a snowy picture on all channels. Not much to choose from in the channel selection. 4. Exercise room: There is an extra charge per day per person to use the gym. Pool is free. 5. Parking: Unless you can expense for business, leave the car or rental car at home or airport. Overnight parking costs $45. That is absolutely crazy. Stick to walking or taking the cab, \"El\" or metra if you need to get around. 6. Elevators: Slow This hotel is definitely not a top hotel. For $219 a night it is lacking in comfort and amenities.

However, the staff was very friendly and helpful. At first I was a little upset about the $45/day parking, but to me it ended up being well worth it. I pulled up to the front door and the Valet parkers were so pleasant and helpful. I didn't have to worry about finding the garage and then finding my way back to the hotel.

It was so awesome to call down and have the car ready within about 10-15 min. To me, definitely wortht the price!

The furnishings had chips and peeling paint. The artwork was similar to what I had when I was a college student. Nicer prints and frames can be found at Linens and Things.

I attended during a part of the work week and avoided long lines. I've read some concerns about the distance to subway stations. This really wasn't a problem for me, I timed the walk generally 13-15 minutes to State Station. It wasn't too far to get anywhere really. The Navy pier was about 25-30 minutes away and the subways and buses take you so many places if you're tired of walking. Consider buying a 3 day visitors CTA pass for $12. You get unlimited subway and bus rides. The visitor center is close by on Randolph street. You can also walk down the stairs to the canal and take an architectural tour down the Chicago River which is informative and I would recommend. You can watch the Navy Pier fireworks from the hotel Wednesday and Saturday evenings weather permitting. Consider flying into Midway Airport instead of O'Hare...only a 30 minute subway ride to Randolph/Lake orange line station and vice versa and no transfers. I've heard the blue line to O'Hare can take up to 90 minutes. You can also avoid taxi fare. I didn't bring a car, so no comment on parking expenses. Overall I had a pleasant stay at the Swissotel.

I've stayed in a number of Chicago hotels, and this one was very nice. Our room and bathroom were both spotless. Our room was the largest room we've ever had in Chicago. We had a king bed with a desk, dresser, etc., and a very nice marble bathroom. We thought the bed was very comfortable and the linens were crisp and clean. The shower was spotless, as was the rest of the bathroom. We liked the separate shower and bathtub. Check-in and check-out were a breeze (on a Saturday and Sunday), and the staff was just fine. Not snooty at all, just adequately friendly. There is a taxi stand right outside the hotel which is a bonus. It is just at the bridge at the Chicago River, so you are not at all far from Michigan Ave. Getting to Navy Pier, however, is tricky because you have to go down a bunch of staircases and make your way through various streets to get there (it's easier from Mich. Ave). There is a public parking lot just down the street and on the left (parking at the hotel is $45 per night, which is a downer). And for breakfast there is a Corner Bakery right down the street as well. If you book here, ask for a view of Navy Pier if you can. It's a nice view. We had a view of the river, which was nice as well, but not as nice as the lake and Navy Pier.

We added a couple days to the stay after the conference so we could enjoy time with family flying in to join us. I have a little different perspective on the stay because I stayed across the street at the Fairmont on July 6 & 7 so I have a comparison. I absolutely love the look of the Swissotel. Our rooms were nice and didn't look worn or old. In fact, I have no complaints except for the building noise outside the hotel which isn't their fault. Our grandchildren enjoyed the nice indoor pool and we appreciated no extra charge for using it. My biggest complaint is I got used to the Fairmont's treatment, the staff is very well trained to meet your every need and are over accomodating. The Swissotel has very ordinary concierges that aren't overly friendly like the Fairmonts and their front desk didn't say \"Welcome to Swissotel, how can I assist you, it was basically - next?\" The Fairmont welcomes you, asks if they can assist you further, etc, etc. My conference rate was higher at the Swissotel than the Fairmont. The rooms were comparable but I have to admit I loved the Fairmont service, especially the bellhops and front desk. Swissotel needs some training on customer service. Often times there appears to be a manager waiting as you come through the door but never once did he say a thing so I assume the help gets their training from people like him, sad because I think the hotel architecture is fabulous. I do recommend while in Chicago go eat deep dish pizza at Giordanos and get Oprah's favorite carmelcorn at Garrett's Popcorn. All of us enjoyed the Field Museum and if you have children, take them to the Navy Pier (fireworks Wed and Sun visible from hotel) and go to the Children's Museum. It is free Thursdays from 5pm-8pm. There is a deli/store very close to the hotel called Bockwinkles. The sandwiches are great, $3.99 freshly made. We stocked up on soda, water and snacks there.

The Cadillac Palace is less than a mile away as well (This where the Color Purple is). We were also only a $5 cab ride from Rush St. The bad side is that the rooms are dated and in need of some upgrades, but for $109 a night through Travelocity it was great. The front desk was helpful with switching my room to a King Bed. Another ding against the hotel is that they charge for everything! A simply local call for 1 minute cost a $1.28. If you pick up anything in the mini bar you were charged. To use the gym area you have to pay. There is a nice restaurant (The Palms) in the hotel, but be prepared to spend about $100 for 2. Everything is a la carte. I would definitely recommend this hotel for someone just wanting location and would not be in the room alot, but if you are going to relax in your room, this is not the place for you.

We decided after this last 2 night stay (and 15 years of visits) that this would be our last until renovation. We could live with the worn furniture (desk was particularly battered) and bathroom door (and shower door!) that sealed only with great effort but the lumpy, saggy mattress and miserable pillows were more than we could bear for a $200+ daily rate (especially with all the new properties that Chicago has to offer.)

Rooms: We liked our room. The bathroom was big enough with adequate vanity space, with separate tub and shower. Beds were comfortable enough, although it seemed they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d put a pillow top mattress pad on top of a too old mattress. Furnishings were fine. Rooms were quiet enough. Be sure to ask for a room high up when you book your reservation; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably get a good view wherever you stay, but the higher up you are, the more you can see. Location: This is a pretty good, central location, about a 5-10 minute walk off Michigan Avenue and Wacker, close to the water, just south of the Magnificent Mile. You can see downtown and/or the Navy Pier from most of the rooms. I liked it because it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too close to the noise and crowdedness of Michigan Avenue. Swissotel is next door to the huge Hyatt hotel. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the 3rd building in from the lake. Transportation: Well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read about taking the train in and then walking to the hotel. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think any of the train stations are close together. Cabs are definitely the way to go. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rent a car unless you absolutely have to. The parking at Swissotel is about $45 and parking is hard to come by in other places if you want to get out and about. The trains are old, jerky and bumpy\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot like the ones in New York City or Washington, D.C. From Midway Airport, we took the Orange line in and got off at the State and Lake stop. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at least a 20-minute walk from there to the Swissotel (again, did I mention all the luggage?) The train stop is upstairs and there are no elevators, so we had to lug all our bags down 2 flights of stairs. Looking back, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d save the expense and trouble and just get a cab. It was $35 one-way back to the Midway Airport from the hotel. We each bought a 3-day unlimited CTA pass for $12 each and only used the train once getting from Midway to the hotel. Staff: We found the staff to be helpful and friendly. We never saw long lines for anything. We asked for extra towels each day and they were promptly delivered within 15 minutes. The maids did a good job. Ice machine: we had to go up a floor and into a service area to find ice. They turn the machines off to save electricity, I think. You have to flip the power switch, and once I figured it out, I had all the ice I needed. Pool: We went to the hot tub a couple of times. It was nice. They have a nice workout area but you have to pay $10 a day to use it. The workout area overlooks the city and was nice and clean. Dining: We did not eat at the hotel. They have a Palm Steak house here and it was open for lunch. They seemed to have reasonable steak house lunch prices. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen a Palm restaurant open for lunch\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwish we could have tried this. We went to Houlihan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down the street as several other reviews suggested\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all that impressed. They have a $10 breakfast buffet but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that\u00e2\u20ac\u201da $10 breakfast buffet, similar to what you find in a nice Hampton Inn and Suites these days. They had some hot items that looked like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d sat a little too long, cereal and some fruit stations. They had an omelet station but they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the chef so I waited 5 minutes (omelet was good). We ate at the original Billy Goat Tavern; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Michigan, just north of Wacker, across the bridge, maybe a 10-minute walk from the hotel. You have to take a staircase down to the lower level of the highway (kind of like an underground parking garage). They serve breakfast, lunch & dinner. Wish I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d known about the breakfast on the first day. Good hamburgers too (and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually like hamburgers). There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to the Billy Goat Tavern, right behind the Wrigley Building. We ate at Mike Ditka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steak House restaurant and it was good. We went to the Signature Room Restaurant and it was good, with the great view you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect. We had a little bit hard of a time trying to identify the Hancock Tower\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit seemed kind of set back off Michigan Avenue. We ate at Giordano\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Italian and it was good. The have a lunch personal pizza and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still too big for one person. We ate at Emerald Loop Caf\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down Wacker, go left on Wabash, restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the right. A nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food. Kind of like an upscale Bennigans, but a lot better and prices aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that much higher. Attractions: We took the Architecture Foundation river cruise. The departure is right down the street from the Swissotel, at the corner of Wacker & Michigan, downstairs, under the blue awning. The tour was well done, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget a hat and some major sunscreen\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe best seats are up top and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open to the elements. I went to the Art Institute of Chicago and wish I could have spent more time there. Hubby and kids went to the Museum of Science and Industry. We walked along the Navy Pier. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just as touristy and kid-friendly as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect but seemed clean and relatively safe. Went to Millennium Park (free! And not too far from Swissotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmaybe 15 minutes walk) and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great place to visit. Ambiance of the city: We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the people of Chicago to be as friendly as those in Texas. We encountered quite a few aggressive homeless people throughout all of Chicago. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel completely safe walking around the streets by myself.

After reading some of the reviews for the Swissotel, I felt compelled to share my experience. We recently stayed for a long weekend - and finding hotels to be over $180/night, I booked on Hotwire. Got Swissotel for a very good price, but was a little anxious since some of the reviews on this site complained of slow elevator service, unhelpful staff, etc. We encountered not a single problem during our three-night stay. Check-in was quick and simple, our room overlooked the river (I will post a photo so you can see), and most importantly, the room was quiet! I've stayed next door at the Hyatt Regency and was kept awake all night by loud neighbors and every single toilet flush (the walls are that thin); I would gladly choose Swissotel over the Hyatt any day of the week. The room was spacious. The bathroom was marble with a separate shower and tub. The decor was nothing exciting, to be honest, but the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The location is excellent - close to Michigan Ave., Millenium Park, Navy Pier, etc. The clientele seemed upscale, the staff was friendly and I slept so soundly every night - I have absolutely nothing to complain about. (My boyfriend, though, was irritated that there was not a working ice machine on our floor - 23rd- he had to walk up a few floors, found a nonworking machine, then walked down more floors to finally find ice. To me, it's not the biggest deal in the world.) Oh, one word of warning - parking is expensive (45/night, I think), so we took the advice of other reviewers and parked elsewhere. We happened to find a parking lot on E. Randolph (for a condo building) that charged only $17/night! Our total charge was only $51, a bargain in Chicago. The walk back to the hotel was a bit tiring, but that's only because it was over 90 degrees. :) It was well worth it, especially when you consider how much money we saved. At the end of the day, we felt like we got a decent deal. If we would've paid 45/night for parking, we might've had a different opinion.

Note: given the number of skyscrappers under construction many hotel views are now blocked or soon will be. Here the lake view will remain unobstructed since this property is on the river.

After arriving we wanted to extend for saturday night but the front desk said they were sold out.

The hotel was in an excellent location (although hotels on Mag. Mile are better located of course) about 3 blocks from Mag. Mile right along the Chicago River. From the hotel we easily walked south to Millenium Park and the Art Institute and north to the John Hancock Building. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wear yourself out walking\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe Navy Pier is not as close as it looks\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtake the free trolley! We also took the train in from Midway and it was about a 15 minute walk to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno problem at all and only cost $2 (the whole trip probably took about 50 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit is a bit of a walk from the airport terminal to the train, but it is very accessible). We arrived at the hotel around 2 pm and had no trouble checking in and our room was ready for us even though we were early. Our room was on the 23rd floor and faced the Chicago River with a great view of the skyscrapers and Navy Pier. The room was very clean and had enough space for 4 of us, although I wished the beds were queens instead of doubles. My only complaint about the room was the small shower. A marble bath is nice and all, but when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4 of us and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a hurry, all we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to do is use the shower and it was tiny! Plus the nozzle faced the door so you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn it on to warm it up before you got in without making a huge mess on the floor. As a side note the linens on the bed are quite comfortable, but the towels are your typical hotel towels\u00e2\u20ac\u201dscratchy and small. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use any of the hotel amenities or eat in their restaurant so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on that. Cabs are readily available at the hotel and I always felt safe walking to and from the hotel as late as midnight (we were a group of 4 girls). One more complaint\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe elevator is quite packed Sunday morning when everyone is trying to check out. We had about 4 full elevators pass us by before we realized we were going to have to go up to go down. It probably took us about 15 minutes to get to the lobby because of this so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re located on middle floors remember this! Since we had a late flight we were able to leave our bags with the hotel while we walked around some more. And, the concierge will print up your boarding passes the night before (a plus since we were flying Southwest). Overall, we had a great experience at the Swissotel, but it is definitely not a 5 star, maybe not even a 4 star, but I travel to see the city, not to stay in the hotel room so it was no problem for me. We stayed at the Swissotel from Friday to Monday in March. For 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds. About a month before hand a deal showed up on Travelzoo for $99 a night for 2 people, but because of our dates our room ended up being $20 more, but it was still a good deal. I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1-3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds. About a week before I called the hotel directly and was able to confirm a room with 2 double beds for 4 people at a rate of $179 for the 2 nights there were 4 of us (other night remained at $119) so I cancelled one reservation with no problems. The taxes for each night were about $20. I probably could have just confirmed that I had a room with 2 double beds and not told them there were 4 of us with no problems and saved $60 a night, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to say that now!", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marshall, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cA Great Chicago Stay\u201d", "Author": "biggfoot18", "ReviewID": "UR7260794", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Swissotel on Fri-Sun, 3/23-25. This was our second stay at this hotel, and the experience this year was even better than our first time. I will say, I do not believe this is a good hotel to bring kids to. I suppose it is adequate for this, but it is better with just adults or older children. We brought 2 kids the first time 4 years ago and had a much better hotel experience this time without them. Let's start from the front. Good valet, albeit expensive ($45/day), good bell service (they have a service elevator). Check in was speedy, but it also wasn't too busy. We had been booked for 2 beds and wanted a King, they accomodated us by finding a King room at the same price. We could have upgraded to a waterview but it was an extra $50/night and quite frankly, our room on the 22nd floor was in the fog/clouds most of the first part of the weekend. The room was spacious with a large bathroom with tub and a separate shower. The room was comfotable temperature wise, however, one of our party in another room could not get the room cooled off all weekend and were miserable. The room was clean, well appointed, had easy plug-in high speed Internet access for my laptop computer ($10/day). The elevators are fast unless it is busy. If busy you could be stuck waiting quite a while. This happened to us on check out on Sunday. Lots of folks were checking out and the elevator service was slow. We had 6 elevators stop at our floor full of people before we got on one to take down. Some people had been complaining about a 20 minute wait. To be fair, the hotel extended check out for the day to 2pm from 11 am because they anticipated this problem. They left us a letter in our bill apologizing for the heavy delays they were expecting in check out. I can deal with it if I know its going to happen. The pool seemed nice (didn't get back to the hotel in time to use it either night!). The downstairs lobby/lounge/coffee bar was great. Nice comfortable furniture, a fireplace and very attentive wait staff. All in all we were very pleased and will be staying here again. Can't beat the location or amenities.

Nothing is worse than realising, too late, that the hotel will charge an arm and a leg for breakfast \u00c3\u00a0 la carte, or offer nothing at all, sending you out to fend for yourself in the morning. In fact, this item on the agenda is what clinched it. And what a buffet breakfast it was: assorted cereals, assorted fruit juices, fresh fruit, including raspeberries, strawberries, blackberries, bluberries, pineapple, melon, orange, watermelon, bananas, apples; I have never seen such a spread of fruit! Plus the usual cooked items, pancakes, sausages, bacon, etc, (I don't eat cooked breakfast, so I can't vouch for the range, but it, too, looked very big). Then, to round it off, a big variety of cakes and breads. I was so stuffed after breakfast that lunch and dinner became nominal! It was superb. The views from the 29th corner-room floor were great. The room was spacious and well-appointed. We did have an argumentative lavatory which blocked each day we were there, and which was unblocked each time we got back (having mentioned it to the conci\u00c3\u00a8ge each morning on the way out). Ah, for perfection... The total bill for three days, after the state and city taxes were added (which total is not mentioned at the time of booking) came to just over $1000 for the two of us. Oh: something else which took us too long to find out. The hotel is connected underground to Michigan Avenue through various corridors and lobbies, except on weekends, when it is all closed. We arrived in -6\u00c2\u00b0 wind chill conditions, and this piece of information would have been most welcome. There are a few entrances which look like big office entrances on the east side of Michigan south of Wacker: just go in and ask for directions to Swiss\u00c3\u00b4tel.

The pool and whirlpool were a great way to relax after spending the day shopping. Didn't use the workout area, but looked like they had plenty of equipment for guest to use.

The toiletries were similar to those in other major downtown hotels. There was a separate tub and shower stall. The toilet didn't always flush completely, so we sometimes needed to hold the handle down for the entire flushing sequence or we had to flush more than once. A minor inconvenience... The volume control on the TV remote didn't work, and the picture on the TV was too dark (but viewable). We didn't ask anyone to replace or fix the TV remote, nor did we ask anyone to come in and adjust the TV picture. We couldn't find any controls on the remote that would allow us to adjust the TV picture, although it's possible that such a control was there.

It is within walking distance, if you are fit to walk, to most of the attractions in the city including the mediocre and overrated \"mall type\" Navy Pier. The river is directly in front of the hotel and the view of the Navy Pier is wonderful, if you are lucky enough to get a room there. Now on the side of the service and staff, there is a real \"snobbish\" attitude that is probably related to the fact that the Swedish-German progeny of Europe work at the hotel, except as luggage handlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers. With this said, they were very rude and utilitarian, not even asking me if I needed help with my luggage, I had 8 bags in total and I had to come back twice to get them up to the room while being stared at by the \"robotic like\" security thugs. The hotel has no charm, the lackluster and practical design might move fans of Gropius but it is severely lacking in warmth or charm. It is CLEAN though, I must give them that. Upon entering the hallway to the rooms, the decor changes from the mild pragmatic blandness of the lobby, to a cozy, down home 'flowers and stripes pattern' that really works well after a day of hard sight seeing. The room is very clean, not too large and the plus is the bathroom, which boasts one of the best and roomiest showers I have ever had the pleasure of using. The neat rock tiles and cleanliness add to the dark color, there is even a large bath to use, although I did not take the opportunity because I was paranoid of getting a fungal infection at the time. The downturn is in the parking fee, which is something like $35-$65 a night and is absurd, considering my car was lost for a few hours in the dingy cement style basement. So, in all, I would definitely stay here again, even though the service stinks, the restaurant is for rich patrons with money to blow and the people are snobs, the rooms make up for it.

I had also stayed at the Swissotel Boston several years ago and this was a much different experience from a service point of view. This is the only Swissotel in the US now as the Boston one I believe is now a Hyatt. The hotel seemed understaffed at the front desk as there was only one agent when I checked in. At anytime in my stay I only saw at most, 2 agents and many times there was a line. I thought that the concierge staff was OK, certainly not too pleasant, but adequate. I got an early check-in by calling the hotel the morning of my arrival. I was happy to be able to check my stuff in at 9AM vs. 3PM. Granted, they put me in a room by the elevator on the 33rd floor but I wasn't about to complain. Quite honestly there wasn't a lot of noise outside my door and I was not in the room a lot of the time. Regarding the room itself though, there was a problem with my minibar, the refrigerator didn't work. The internet access/guest services/movie selection didn't work either. Of course I called downstairs and was put on endless hold due to them not being staffed sufficiently. I hung up and just dealt with it, I didn't want the hassle when I am on my way outside to enjoy the beautiful weather I had while I was there. So the issue never got resolved and I am sure the next guest had to deal with it. I had a note slipped under my door early Friday morning telling me that they were working on the guest services/movie thing and that they hoped to have it back working that night. Also, that the water in the hotel would be turned off from 9:30AM-11:30AM. I took an early shower that morning. The view from my room was really nice for the most part, but I wasn't going to be sitting in my room staring out the window either. The location on Wacker Drive is fine in that you can walk a couple blocks up to Michigan Avenue. It's a block away from the Hyatt which I have also stayed at and isn't as nice as the Swissotel but at least its better staffed. It's two blocks from Millenium Park which is very nice. There are a couple of fountains in Millenium Park designed for kids to play in that is nice if you are staying here during the warmer months. Perhaps my room was the only one that didn't have a working refrigrator/minibar. I would say if the company is paying for it, the hotel is fine.

My room was paid for, but I noticed the rate was $259.00 and I don't think it's worth THAT kind of money. The view of the river and Navy Pier was certainly great, and it was quiet there, but the room itself was just so-so. Once you shut the door, and without the view, you wouldn't necessarily think you were in a luxury hotel in a major city. Furnishings were nothing special and kind of 'worn'. The shower was a stall with a curtain, and the shower head was at about shoulder level for a man of just average height; no place to put anything either. By the time the shower was over, even with the curtain closed, there was a lot of water on the floor, etc. Toilet seat would NOT stay up on its own, not much counter-space by the sink, and when you open the door to the room, it swings open and stays there on its own until it's ready to automatically close. And I never could tell exactly what they meant by the term \"Swiss hospitality\" I kept hearing about. When the TV check-out system wouldn't work, I called to check out, and the voice on the other end cut me off and said \"it's all taken care of\" in about half a nano-second, like I was a huge interruption to something really important. I agree with other reviewers who found the staff to be efficient, but not terribly personable. None of these things is a big deal, alone, obviously, but I have to say I've been more impressed with hotels like the Intercontinental, the Sofitel, the Sheraton along the river, the Marriott on Michigan Ave., the W downtown, or the Drake, at this price.

We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a \"normal\" room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately. We took the corner room facing Navy Pier and Chicago River and we were high fiving for 20 minutes like kids in a candy shop. Two walls are solid glass the entire wall. The view was unparralled. The bed was PERFECT. Two plump down pillows for each of us, big fluffy white comforter, soft sheets, CLEAN. There were thick terry robes in the closet, an umbrella you could borrow, iron, coffee pot, lotions and q-tips all complimentary. The front desk staff was professional and very helpful. My only complaint was that there is a charge for using the gym that is not stated very clearly and openly and I was shocked that it was to be added to my bill without my knowledge. I resorted to only using the sauna after talking to management about the fee and suddenly the next day \"the sauna was being worked on for several hours\" and I could not use it. Swissotel has a famous restaurant inside it and the staff in there are charming and attentive. Loved them! I wasn't completely bowled over by the Swiss as they could have done a little more to really make our stay special (paper delivered only once to door, no extra ammenities or special touches that would really impress for very little extra cost). Make SURE to walk just behind the hotel to Millenium Park. It's RIGHT THERE! There's a nice cafe and sculptures and music. In front of the Millenium Park is a Starbuck's and a Walgreens since you can't use your in room frige without paying out the woo hoo. Very cool hotel. Loved it.

Chicago Arch. Center boat tours leave just across the street from hotel at riverside. I'm from Los Angeles and don't do a lot of walking but I found all of the above within my comfort zone. Cabs were parked outside in case I got lazy. Cons: I believe the hotel is categorized in the luxury category but seemed pretty plain wrap to me. Room and bathroom were clean, though shower stall was extremely tiny (and I'm not that big.) There was no room to put shampoo and if you put it on the floor and bent over you chanced hitting your head on the door. You had to turn the water on while standing in the stall or it would spray directly into the room before you had a chance to shut the door. There was no evening turndown service or complimentary bottled water. One day there was a newspaper, but not the other three days we were there. Staff seemed efficient though not overly friendly, no good morning, etc. when you passed. Room service is limited after 10 p.m. Though not completely isolated, I didn't find any interesting restaurants nearby. The Swissotel loyalty program is by invitation only which was disappointing. I recently joined the Fairmont's free President's Club and enjoyed benefits such as free wireless access, free health club and spa discount, my very first visit. As far as activities in Chicago, did the usual tourist stuff. Found the John Hancock Observatory to be expensive for the short time one's there. Instead of spending money for it, have a drink in the Signature Lounge or enjoy the reasonably priced lunch buffet offered in the Signature Room instead. Took in the Best of Second City at the Black Orchid Lounge--got the tickets at discount at the HotTix at the Old Water Tower building. Very much enjoyed the Chicago Food Tour, a walking tour that incorporates food tastings at various places like a bakery, traditional deli, pizza, chocolate lounge, etc. with informative details about Chicago's history. Our guide, Shane, pointed out significant buildings that we would have walked right past and introduced us to some wonderful neighborhoods that offered shops and restaurants unique to Chicago.

I went straight back to reception and got a new room so up I went again. It turned out to be one of the odd-shaped but ok corner rooms, the design being a result of the triangular shapre of the building. Again, elevators could be heard. From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down! The worst experience during my five night stay was breakfast. The lower-level restaurant called Geneva is run-down, both the carpet and the chairs need cleaning, not to mention the color design dating back approx. 20 years. The worst were the clorox-like smell on that floor and the level of service provided by the staff. One morning, the order of scrambled egg and bacon turned out to be fried eggs and sausage, one other morning, the french toast showed up as two slices of french toast on a bare dish, all the extras were just missing. What a sight! The staff is not helpful and sometimes hardly able to understand even a simple English sentence. Back in the room, the cleaning staff never made it there before 4pm in the afternoon, not very exciting when you have to spend a rainy weekend in the windy city! And due to the lack of a sign, you cannot indicate to the cleaning staff early in the day that the room is ready. Upon checkout, I was told that the printer was offline and no receipt could be printed, but was promised to get a pdf file per email asap. As one could expect, nothing happened and only after writing to the GM could I finally get the invoice I needed for the expense reporting. Alltogether, this seems to be a somewhat run-down place, far from its old glory and catering to a two- to three-star crowd of tourists, conference attendees and, at least over the weekend, the wedding croud. No reason to return to this place, there are better places more or less just around the corner.

On Sunday, we used the express check-out option which was very easy. When we returned home, we had a receipt waiting in our email inbox. Overall, the hotel was great. However, if you want the picky details, here you go.... The toilet paper was horribly thin. It's a small detail, but could easily be improved. Also, on Saturday morning, we woke up and there wasn't any hot water. We had to wait about an hour before we could shower and leave. It didn't really bother us, but if we had been on a tight schedule, it really would have been a problem. Also, the scale in the bathroom didn't work-- but who wants to weight themselves on a weekend away from home?!?

I felt like a second class citizen. I e-mailed the hotel about 5 weeks before I was due to arrive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c requesting that they confirm the reservation and asking them to note my request for a room on as high a floor as possible. (the hotel has over 40 floors). They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to reply to my e-mail. When I checked in on arrival a rather frosty-faced receptionist whose English seemed limited (although this may just have been due to her extremely formal manner) told me that the highest floor she could offer was the 10th. There was no mention that they had received my e-mail requesting a high floor \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but regretted that non were available\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nor was there an explanation of their policy (as I later found out) that the higher floors were reserved for their frequent guests or for those who had paid a higher room rate. The room I had been allocated had been adequately made up but was far from clean - I could write my name in the dust on the shelf above the bed. I phoned down and explained this to the reception and told them the room was unacceptable as it was. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem particularly interested in my complaint but merely sent a key up for another room which was on an even lower floor. Two evenings later I had to get dressed to go down to the bar as they had not bothered to restock my minibar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again when I mentioned it to reception they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem interested. The final straw was that the day before leaving I returned to my room one afternoon to find that someone had been in and left a part used packet of cigarettes there. I mentioned this to the reception by phone and again as I was going out later that evening but again they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem interested.

I didn't want a hold placed on one of my personal cards. At first, they were not going to allow me to check in. They didn't give me any option either. I persisted, and ended up having to give the front desk one of my personal checks in order to receive the room key. I then realized they were going to place a hold on my account anyway, which was fine as I had the funds and was simply wanting to get checked in. Even though I had about $1500 in my account, there was an error with the hotel's communication with my bank. I was told that my check wasn't any good. As far as the hotel clerk was concerned, I could just walk away, have a seat (with all my luggage), and wait. I asked if I could use her phone to call my bank. When my bank informed me that I had the funds, I asked my bank representative to give this information to the clerk. She did so. When they ended their conversation, however, this clerk asked her manager (right in front of me !) how they could trust that it was indeed my bank that I'd called !! She said I could have just called some friend. I was flabbergasted. Thankfully, the manager permitted me to check in, and they held my check. An hour later, when my boss arrived for dinner, I produced the credit card and asked for my check back. I was told that the clerk who had assisted me was on dinner break and that I'd have to come back later. My boss took over the conversation and asked why that should matter.

I also hated that there were no fitted sheets - woke up each morning sleeping right on the mattress as the sheets had come loose. As for service issues, the concierge gave us erroneous info about the Navy Pier trolley; the maid failed to replace toiletries and towels, despite a $3 tip that had been left (I normally tip $1-2 per day and wait until the day we leave to tip the maid, but I decided to try something different this time since we were at a 4* hotel.) We had a voucher for a breakfast buffet that included tax & gratuity, but still left a $5 tip for the waiter; when we returned the next day, he put us in the back of the restaurant and pretty much forgot about us; we removed our own dirty dishes and I finally got a refill on my coffee after asking another waiter (while our waiter doted on a party of 8 without vouchers that was seated after us - they were immediately greeted with a thermal carafe of coffee while my cup sat empty....) Needless to say, we didn't tip him the second day. I should note that we had booked a \"bed & breakfast\" special that had been promoted on Travelzoo - while the value was very good for a downtown hotel especially given the added breakfast, I didn't feel like I truly experienced a 4* hotel (despite my best efforts to be an appreciative guest.) Yes, the room view was teriffic, but I paid extra for a lake view room. I would probably stay here again if I found a similar deal. All in all, I feel like this hotel has 4* potential, but is probably in need of a renovation and some intense customer service training for its staff.

Unfortunately, for my family and I that just was not the case. My family and I recently stayed in the Chicago hotel, (9/4 - 9/7) and I was so completely disappointed in both the room and the service that not only will I never stay in one of their facilities again, but I will certainly encourage all of my friends and family to do the same. I was lucky to have come across a wonderful promotion through QuikBook that offered both a discounted rate as well as a Breakfast Buffet for any attendees between August and the end of September. So, I booked our trip and my family and I were very excited about our trip. When we arrived the person who checked us in said that he had no record of our complimentary Breakfast Buffet, and after showing him my confirmation from QuikBook he said that he would have someone bring the certificates to our room later. I also inquired about the possibility of a corner room and a view of the water which I had requested with my reservation. The gentleman explained to me that since I had requested two double beds, no corner room offered that accommodation they only offered a single king size bed. I told him no problem and since he didn't mention the water view I assumed he had assigned that to me. When my family and I got to our room we were extremely disappointed to find that our view was over a very large dirt lot, (I believe the building next door had been torn down) and no water in sight. I called the front desk before we even set our suitcases down and asked if we could switch rooms. Basically, I was told that because I had booked through QuikBook I was getting the best room I could expect for the rate that I paid. I asked to speak to the manager on duty, (John Murdock) who told me that he could do nothing to help me, he reiterated again because I had booked through QuikBook that they would not accommodate me and if I didn't like it I could leave and he would not charge me a cancellation fee. I was shocked and scared!! At this point it was close to 2 pm and my first fear was that my family and I would be stranded in Chicago with no available rooms at a reputable hotel. I called QuikBook and was relieved to have been able to speak with a live person who immediately called the hotel to work everything out. Thank goodness someone was available at QuikBook, (but again had the manager been the least bit sympathetic or helpful, he could have accomplished the same thing!) Anyway, they ended up moving us to another room that did have a water view, but after we got settled in the room we realized that they had just pawned us off on a room with a view, yes, but with a multitude of other problems. Due to the location of our room we heard the elevator go up and down all hours of the day. There was no lid over the water reservoir on our coffee maker. The telephone on the desk did not work. The clock did not work. They locked us out of our room on the second day and did not clean our room until we got back at 6 pm. We requested additional towels and pillows and it was only after the third request that we got them. Honestly, I felt that because I had complained the manager was going out of his way to irritate us. You may be thinking that I am a difficult person because you don't know me or anything about me. But, I can tell you that this is the first time I have ever written a complaint letter and I have stayed in a variety of different hotels and have experienced all kinds of situations. We travel extensively and I can tell you that the scenario in Chicago could have been avoided had the manager taken any amount of time to use some form of customer service. The fact that another person out of the building could affect our situation shows that arrangements could have been made had the manager been so inclined.
