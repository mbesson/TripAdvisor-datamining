I loved the gardener/odd job man who was always about on the complex, he`ll tell you all about the flowers and the turtles in the pen, and just about anything else you want to know. Mike`s the tall dishy one in the office who will organise lifts and has great info to hand.

Small, cosy set-up, built around a good size, clean pool. Great staff, great parking and good clean rooms.

What a shock, the place was much better than whe **** I heard about from some of the people that wrote on here. They ran a cheap shuttle service (never get a yellow cab unless you specify price first......cos they cahnge their fares willy nilly-there is a cheap late nite taxi company called county transportation on 407-396-0003-they are the cheapest about 17 dollars to Disney for 2 people yellow cabs are about 36 dollars!!!) Anyway, the people who work at the pines are not horrible, they are the nicest guys who go out of their way to help you!!!!! They tell you what parks to go to cos they are busier if they have special shows etc, and they do deals for you all the time to make your stay more enjoyable. The rooms are basic but clean and very nice....good programs on the portable while you get ready to go out....but annoying American advert every 5 mins!!!! Sonia (Manager sexy Brazilian!!), Mike (Good hunky bloke whose a laugh) and the lovable James (Sweet driver from Arkansas) What a crew of people!!!!!! Lovely guys and Matt the surfer looking dude what a rep very helpful, even if you wake him up during the night (He's the emergency contact!!!) GO HERE IT IS CHEAP AND GREAT!!!!! WINGHOUSE IS A GREAT PLACE TO EAT TOO ESP. FOR BLOKES!!!!!! The shop and pizzaria opposite have friendly people working in, and if you do feel intimidated by locals, just say hello to them, they are real nice people, not at all intimidating.....I think they are in awe of you!!!!!

Stayed on a room only basis and found the local shops and residential area very intimidating, this is not sour grapes just an honest view from someone who looked forward to comfortable accommodation to base the holiday from. In the room only accommodation there is no control over heat or cold, no chairs to sit on and nothing in the way of comfort. Extremely dissappointed and even paid extra to move hotels in order to enjoy what remained of our holiday, the staff were angry that we complained to the rep and were rude and very unhelpful. The safety deposit box is not free you pay a daily rate for this, and you are provided with polystyrene cups no spoon, and our room was not cleaned once in 5 days.", "Date": "March 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThis was the worst place I have ever stayed, definitely not a 2 star plus!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1723424", "Content": "Don't think about staying here it is horrendous. I find it very strange that there are so many people who are giving Kissimmee Pines the 'thumbs up'. My partner and I stayed at Kissimmee Pines between end Feb and beginning March 2004. This is the worst place I have ever stayed. The accomodation was filthy, the towels never changed, we had to balance a kettle to boil on a waste bin, there was a smell of fumes in the room that gave us headaches and sickness. The doors on either side of the room wouldn't open properly and when they did then we couldn't lock them. During our stay the temperature in Orlando was quite low and we couldn't locate a control to turn on the air conditioning/heating. We contacted our tour rep as it wasn't made apparent how to contact the manager/reception. When we were shown the air condition/temp control it was covered over with a metal box that had to be opened by the owner with a key. Mike (manager/owner?) adjusted the temp with our rep present and then when we went out for the day turned it off completely! The result of our stay at the Kissimmee Pines was that the staff accused us of 'trashing' a door (which I had already reported as not opening or closing properly, at the commencement of our stay and him wanting us to pay for a new door. This all ended up with my partner and I having had enough abuse from the staff and manager/owner, that we paid to move to other accomodation in Kissimmee. NB. We were not the only people who moved - on the same day at least two other parties of people moved to other accomodation due to the same problems. My partner and I were both verbally abused and shouted at by the staff and treated disgustingly. When we reported problems they weren't dealt with and the manager verbally abused us when we asked to move to another room and also when we went to check out to move to another hotel. This accomodation is smack bang in the middle of a 'residential' district (very unsavoury area)and during our stay - which lasted 5 hellish days - at 4am on one morning the police arrived with sirens blaring, at a house on the estate at the side of our apts, no more than 100 feet away. The police broke down the door to the house and dragged out a man and put him in the back of the police vehicle. There is a 'local' shop across the road from kissimmee pines, that sells the various essential items you need ie. soap, milk, coffee, tea, cigarettes etc. There is also a 'cafe' on the same block as the shop. The locals tend to hang about inside and outside both and when inside the shop follow you around and watch you paying at the till (very intimidating) and then follow you outside. We both did not feel at all safe around this area. My partner and I will never, ever stay at this accomodation again and I would strongly recommend that any other people thinking to stay at Kissimmee Pines should rethink and stay somewhere else. Otherwise you risk your holiday being completely ruined as our holiday was. Please take our experience of this accomodation seriously. We would not want anyone else to have to go through the things we endured at the Kissimmee Pines.", "Date": "March 13, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBEST HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1553425", "Content": "BEST HOTEL IN DISNEY!!!!Fantastic stay.
