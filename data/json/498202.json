We are a couple with 2 kids in primary. We found the room in perfect shape, basically it looked new. The beds, sheets and pillows were new and fresh. The room and bathroom were spotless. We were on the 6th (top) floor and heard no noise from within the Hotel, although the last night we did hear some noise from the street. A nice feature was the use of the common fridges and microwave where we stored and reheated food, which really helped keep our eating costs down. The front desk was helpful and checkin and checkout went without a hitch. There is a Coles just 5 minutes up the hill. I don't recommend using the small convenience stores down the hill as they are incredibly expensive and don't even both to display the price of items! They are basically a rip off. My kids loved the bunk beds, even fighting over who got the top bunk. There was a tiny TV which worked fine, and the Air Con. ran well and quietly. I really cannot complain about anything, especially given the fact that we had a mid-week special of $69 a night or so. For that money I cannot complain.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandra, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cHotel Formule 1 Kings Cross Sydney\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR127335318", "Content": "Hotel was dirty.

In the bathroom you almost have to shower over the toilet and the water did not drain from the bathroom floor. The blankets were full of long black hairs. There was carpet glued to the bottom of the walls instead of skirting boards which was falling off. No \"do not disturb\" signs provided, so every morning we were woken up by housekeeping. Only one powerpoint in the entire room, which was underneath the TV and a tiny mirror stuck to the wall above it.

Check in was easy and the staff pleasant, but there the good stuff ends. We stepped into the lift and the stink of cigarettes, and general dirtiness began. The hallway was marginally better, but nothing compared to the room itself. I would say if you buried your face in someone else's sweaty jogger you might have a good idea what it was like. Even with the noisy aircon on it wasn't any better. The room had a queen and a set of bunks, and wasn't really all that tiny. The beds were hard, but the sheets clean. The bathroom was tiny, and the once-was-white shower curtain was black with mould and filth. It really was pretty poor. It is such a pity as it could be a great little hotel- I just can't understand how they can let the place become so gross.

The hotel was full of rowdy, drunk, young men. And that is when I realised I made a mistake of choosing this for my two night stay in Sydney. On first glance, the room and bathroom looked reasonably clean. However, when I asked the staff member at the reception desk for extra bedding he came to my room with extra blankets then left suddenly; I found out why shortly after. The blankets were covered in long human hairs of different colours and cigarette burns. When I pulled back the bedspread the blanket on the bed was also covered in human hair. When I pulled back the sheets I noticed lots of little unidentifiable black dots and a large faint pale yellow stain in the middle of the bed. When I complained to the staff member at the front desk he apologised and said he would bring me some clean bedding, but of course that never eventuated. By this time it was too late to find another hotel so I slept on one side of the bed with my tracksuit on over my pjs and my jacket covering me as I was cold. I switched the dual heating/air-conditioning unit on and it was full of dust, which made breathing difficult. I put up with situation for two nights at a total cost of $338.00 (I had to pay upfront and I was not entitled to a refund as I booked online). To say I was appalled is an understatement. The only good thing I can say about this hotel is the location as it is close to restaurants, shops, and transport. So my advice is simple: For no other reason (and I haven't even mentioned the smell of stale fast food that lingers in the hotel or the strong stench of vomit in the lift which lasted a whole night before it went away), stay at a hotel that offers clean bedding because it is the least you should expect from hotel accommodation and it is the least any hotel should be able to provide to its customers.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queanbeyan", "Title": "\u201cvery uncomfortable bed\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR121850243", "Content": "Our trip was neither business or leisure.

I was scared when i was walking out of the room to find a powerpoint that looked as though it had recently been on fire and the elevator buttons...well...non existent... i could have played with the live wires but i decided against it..... a hotel cleaner joined me in the lift and i literally held my breath the whole way down (i dont think they know what deodorant is) I have been in a $46 a night backpackers and THAT was nicer than this place! I found another hotel (O'Malleys hotel) and had to have a shower as i felt ....well...slightly violated.... all in all i would rather sleep in the streets of Darlinghurst street than stay here again.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good service, slightly dated.\u201d", "Author": "Shortyman77", "ReviewID": "UR105561114", "Content": "Just got back from a stay of 3 nights.

You are better off using the lower staircase. One major annoyance is that the cleaners come round at 8am, and even if you leave a note on the door saying you are sleeping they will knock on your door to see if you really are still asleep.

Due to some unforseen circumstances, my touring party (four people, two couples) found ourselves without accommodation [staying with people fell through], at an extremely late hour (after 3am Wednesday, with a drive to Newcastle at 10am). We were able to book a room through reception at this hour, which was great. It's a very basic facility, but when kind of desperate for accommodation at 3am on a Wednesday night - luxury does not matter. What does matter is cleanliness, security, and efficiency. I found that this hotel passed these criteria for me. Unlike some Formule 1 Hotels, the room (4x bunk bed configuration) had a basic ensuite in the room, and free to air television channels.

Once in the room, we found it to be dirty, small and old. Basically, i came to the conclusion that its main purpose would be for a cheap room for the working ladies on the cross. The airconditioner was HUGE and LOUD, the bathroom was bigger than the actual room, and you could hear evryting going on in the corridors - word for word. The next morning at 7am, despite booking the room for 2 nights to avoid having to check out early, the cleaner knocked on the door and told us to check out, when i told him we were staying for two nights, he told me i needed to go downstairs and book it, despite the fact i had. After ignoring the cleaner, we came back after lunch to find that we had been locked out of the room. This was sorted quite easily, but no apologies or refunds were given.

Not much furniture in the room, just a cheap $5 chair, and a small counter. Not even a night table, but just fine. Good air conditioning and heat, but there was NO PHONE in the room. Remember, the price is 1/6 of the Hilton. I also liked that you could walk to the gay area on Oxford Street, about 20 minute walk. Lots of restaurants on the way there, and in that area. If you must be in central Sydney, be prepared to pay the price. Honestly, it's only a 5 minute walk and a 5 minute train from the Kings Cross station to central Sydney. I think the tran was about $2 Australian one way. I also walked to the Hard Rock Cafe, which was about a 15 minute walk away.
