The hotel prices were expensive. I stumbled across The Copley House on Booking.com. It was around \u00a390 ($110) for a \"medium studio\". We really just wanted a place with a shower and bed for the night. The reviews were mixed and we decided after hours of searching the hotel websites, that this was the best option. My friend and I walked to the location from the bus station. It was about 45-55 minute walk with luggage (backpack and suitcase). I would say if you have alot of luggage, don't walk it. Google said it was 36 minutes. We went to the Reception and were told our studio was located in a different building. There was a person ready to drop us by van. It was literally just round the corner from the building with the Reception. The studio was in the basement and was warm and cozy. There was a lovely big bed and a sofa bed, kitchenette area and small bathroom with shower. The shower was boiling hot on the first day for me but ok for my friend. It seemed fine the next day. The bed was very comfy. It was a nice location and close to the concert venue. Something to watch out for - make a note of the door number when you leave the building. Our studio was located inside a house with lots of studios on a street with lots of identical front doors! It is easy to forgot which set of steps leads up to the building with your studio in it! I would stay in this studio again.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santiago, Chile", "Title": "\u201cHorrible\u201d", "Author": "pyanez", "ReviewID": "UR126160790", "Content": "Horrible experience, don't go there, no heater, no service, no information, no blankets, the cold win pass through the windows, impossible to talk with some one, waste of money the experience.

Our room was the one directly behind the office, but this means nothing when there is no one there after business hours, and the front door is left completely unlocked.

It felt more like staying in a family home. The downside was that you can hear movement in the room above (chairs scraping, water running in the bathroom) but as I was up at around the same time as our upstairs neighbors anyway, it was not an issue. If you are sensitive to background noise or intend to sleep in, this may not be the place for you. The bathroom was bigger than a typical hotel bathroom, Wi-Fi signal was excellent. I couldn't get a cell phone signal, maybe because our room was downstairs from the main floor (not basement level; we had 2 large living room windows).

We were there for 4th July weekend and so booked months in advance. At the time we made the booking, I saw that there were a lot of negative reviews on TripAdvisor about this place so I was wary about making a reservation here. However, we needed an apartment/place with its own cooking facilities and I could only find two such places in Boston that matched our modest budget. (The other place we considered only offered 7 night stays or more, so no good for us). However, I needn't have worried, and I see now that the more recent reviews on Trip Advisor (2009) are much more positive than earlier reviews. I don't know if this is because Copley House has got its act together recently, or the earlier reviewers were the type of people who want the moon on a stick, or both. But we really liked our apartment. Its not the Hilton - everything was a little on the old side and the decor is pretty basic and homely as opposed to modern. But our 'small studio' was actually quite spacious, it was very clean and all the kitchen applicances etc worked fine. The bed was very comfortable too. The location was great - we were in a building on West Newton St - I understand that Copley House also has apartments in buildings on nearby streets. The street we stayed in was quiet and very nice, the sort of leafy and brownstone-lined street in Boston I'd love to live on. It was about 2-3 minute walk to the T (subway) stop, which gets you into the downtown/Park St/Government Center area in about 15 minutes. The T is right at the Prudential Center which has a great shopping and views (if you pay to go the observation deck at the top, which I recommend). West Newton Street is also just a few minutes walk away from Copley Square, Newbery Street and its a 20 minute walk to Fenway Park too.

We had a problem with the TV asked the front desk if they could have a look at it and they finally got round to fixing it on the last night we were there as we happened to catch the maintenance man on the stairs. Other niggle was we had to leave for a flight in the morning, we left arount 7.30 and there was nobody downstairs to to give the key too or a box to drop it in, in the end we left it on the hallway shelf with a note and hoped for the best. All in all the apartment was very close to an underground stop (5 mins walk) Duck boat tours was just round the corner and a shopping centre.

We booked 8 units for family members coming from across the US, Australia, Europe and the Middle East. At the time of booking (directly with The Copley House), we requested emailed photos of the rooms reserved for us, as a record. The BEST part of our stay was having so many family members in close accommodation for such a happy occasion as a wedding, being able to meet all together in one room for a drink, or to share a meal. Looking back, this meant far more than the standard of the accommodation - a waste to spend more for fancy rooms when our holiday was about visiting with family members separated by long distances (and airfares), and seeing Boston. Downside and Upside points listed below. Downside: 1. The rooms we were assigned on arrival did not always correspond with the photo shown, as had been agreed on booking. 2. The carpets were in need of a good clean and did not get vacuumed at all that we noticed. 3. Not a full complement of cutlery in some kitchens, nor was it very clean. Housekeeping needs to learn to wash dishes hygienically. 4. Rooms were overheated and temperature not adjustable, so we had to have the windows open. 5. Shower stall drained very slowly only in at least 1 studio. 6. Pull out bed mattresses uncomfortable in some studios. 7. We were told there was a 'short' flight of stairs down to the room reserved for a 94 yo - in fact, 2 very steep flights. Would not meet requisite standards for people with disabilities or the very elderly in my country. Upside: 1. Excellent location. 2. The staff was EXTREMELY helpful and friendly. 3. Complaints were dealt with promptly such as: room change to one similar to photo; lumpy springless mattress thrown out and replaced with a new one... 4. Bathrooms were cleaned daily, fresh towels daily. 5. We had free parking for 2 weeks. 6. We kept our rooms at a much reduced rate when we were away for a night. 7.

(considering all the nearby hotels charge over $200 a night) I am glad that I stayed in Copley House, will definitely stay there again next time I return to Boston.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value, Great Location!\u201d", "Author": "seattlehousewife", "ReviewID": "UR5553295", "Content": "Just visited Boston with my husband and 6 year old son. Initially, I was a little concerned about staying at the Copley House instead of one of the large hotel chains. Glad I decided to go ahead and book my stay at this hotel! It was clean, quiet, comfortable, and a great deal- about half of what the other hotels in the area were charging! We stayed in a one bedroom, which was pretty good sized and included a kitchenette. The Copley is close to everything, and if I come back to Boston I would absolutely not hesitate to stay here again!", "Date": "August 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Far Hills, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and value!\u201d", "Author": "katen", "ReviewID": "UR5467613", "Content": "Recently stayed here for 2 nights as a friend and I were in the city for a concert. I spoke to 3 different staff members between the time of booking and arrival and found them all to be extremely pleasant and helpful. The location was perfect and only about a 4 minute walk to the Prudential T. The tree-lined street was comprised of brownstones, making you feel not as a visitor but more of a resident. 7-11 was conveniently 2 blocks away, and lively Boylston St. is only about a 7 minute walk. If you need parking, request it at the time of booking as they have a limited number of spots. At only $10/night, it was a bargain compared to the usual $30+ for the garages. The studio itself was about $105/night (for Friday/Saturday!!) We arrived at our room to find our air conditioning not working. One of the staff members went out of his way to insure we were taken care of. Maintenance did not come until the following morning to replace it, however we were given another \"cool\" room to sleep in that night. This is not the Ritz, so don't expect fancy, high quality accomodations. The rooms are well worn and could be a bit cleaner, but if you're just looking for a place to sleep at night, it can't be beat. What you WILL get is friendly and accomodating staff, a great location, and superb value. Having stayed at a different hotel each of my many Boston stays, I will gladly repeat Copley House in the future.", "Date": "July 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cCopley House,great value.\u201d", "Author": "Frankn", "ReviewID": "UR5188206", "Content": "Just back from Boston having stayed at Copley House.
