Only a continental breakfast and no bar but we prefer to be out and about normally when on a City Break so no problem with that. The Staff were very friendly (in fact the only friendly people we met in Rome) as soon as we arrived the porter gave us excellent information and advice on the city and the people, with a free map he wrote all of the best places to explore, although great advice some of it was a real downer. He warned us that everyone would be out to fleece us, said be very careful of pick pockets and never sit outside a restaurant without know the prices first. This unfortunately left us with a bad taste and did not help our frame of mind as we felt on edge and suspicious of everyone all weekend. He also told us that the taxi trip from the main station should have been 15 euro and not the 40 euro we had to pay! I have to say that apart from a visit to the Sistine Chapel and the Hotel we stayed at The Relais Dei Papi our trip was the worst city break ever. It was very clear that the Italians hate the British, very rude people especially when they knew you were British - we were ripped off at every opportunity with EXTORTIONATE charges for: - Taxi 4 km trip 40 euro!!! 2/3 pint of beer 7 euro! 1 x tea+ 1x coffee+ 2 x pastries + 33 euro!!! A work colleague of mine yesterday told me that he had similar experiences visiting Rome, Venice and Milan on a three City excursion, he was fleeced by everyone at one point with his pregnant wife he had a 2km taxi ride with luggage that the driver wanted 50 euro for!! - the taxi driver would not let them have their luggage until they paid!!

Each room does have a mini bar, with drinks inside, but I found these to be expensive (but no more expensive than in a restaurant), and the hotel has 2 local shops less than 100m from the front door where you can buy things at a third of the price and stock your own fridge.

I agree with an earlier review that it's a bit of experience in itself... the rooms were a little over-the-top in the decoration department, but they were incredibly clean. The staff was EXCELLENT, particularly Diana. She always had an answer to our questions, and we always willing to make confirmation calls, look things up for us, etc. As has been previously stated, breakfast left a little to be desired, but at least we got something! The location was awesome. Because the Vatican stands between the hotel and the rest of Rome, you can't help but walk by it every time you leave and come back to the hotel. I can't imagine going to Rome and only seeing St. Peter's once! It was in a nice neighborhood, and there was a supermarket very close ,so we went and got snacks/water to keep in the room as well. That's a big recommendation I have - if at all possible, get water at a supermarket, because you can get a 6pack for less than 2 euros, whereas if you buy it from a vendor it's going to be more like 6 euros for 1 bottle... The closest thing I have to a complaint is that the front desk isn't staffed overnight, and nobody gets there until about 7:30am, and since the hotel is on the 3rd floor of an office building, nobody can get in the front doors unless buzzed in. This is a good thing, obviously, except that our transfer to the airport for our flight home was to pick us up at 7:20am. They ended up getting there more than 20 minutes early (again, a good thing) but we had no way of knowing because no one was at the front desk to answer their buzz at the front door. Luckily they waited for us! All in all, if I go back to Rome (I threw my coin in Trevi Fountain, so hopefully someday!), I will definitely be staying at Relais dei Papi.

Most hotels were in the $500 to $600 a night range, and this was simply beyond our budget. I was unfamiliar with the neighborhoods, and therefore, somewhat concerned that less expensive places were somehow in less desireable neighborhoods. The reviews for this little place set my mind at ease. Now that I have been, I can safely assure other travelers that this B & B (as it's not at all a \"hotel\" in the conventional terms)... is located in a wonderful little neighborhood. The local cafes are less expensive than in the heart of the city (and some of the best food we had), the Vatican is less than a 10 minute walk, it's safe, and it's as clean as any other part of town. You have to cross the river to get into the city (a 10 minute walk), but from there, everything is within walking distance. If you are of the mind to take taxis, resist... they are pricy, and the buses and trains are right there (no need if you ask me either, as walking is the best way to see it all). The B & B is the 3rd floor of a nice building, but it is small, a bit on the \"overdecorated side\", and small (did I mention small). None of this will matter, as your room is merely a place to rest your head, and your weary legs. What you will find, is that it is clean, and quiet, and that will be enough to make it a comfortable place to rest. Be aware that there is a lift, but it, like our dear B & B, is small (seems to be a theme here), and a bit tricky with large suitcases. My husband found it charming, so it depends on the way you look at it. A minor fact, given you'll only need to negotiate it twice with your bags. The staff was friendly, if also, a bit confused about bookings (didn't realize we were booked for 2 nights at first). They aren't there in the early morning (odd), so no one was there to check us out. There is a tiny little breakfast nook, with pastries, crackers and machine coffee (not bad). Overall, I would recommend this place to travelers who don't want to spend a mint on accomodations, and for those who like to explore. A few tips on Rome; try not to schedule your trip to the Vatican and the Colisseum in the same day (we did), and you won't have enough time to explore the museum if you're worried about getting all the way across town in the same day. Get up early and get to the Vatican Museum. Spend as much time here as you can, but don't expect to see it all. Avoid the early morning line for the Basilica, as you will see it at the end of your day in the museums without having spent the morning in the sun, on a never ending line. Eat on the outskirts of the city. Less expensive, less touristic, and much better food. Try not to go to the restaurants in the English guide books, unless you want to eat with a bunch of other, loud, complaintive, Americans. Do the audio tour at the Colisseum, as you can move ahead of the lines, and you'll have a bit more insight into what you are viewing. Watch out for pick pockets around all the major sites (we saw one in action at the Pantheon). Drink lots of wine, eat lots of pasta, and HAVE a wonderful time!! Book at this establishment for less, and you'll have more to spend on the other stuff.
