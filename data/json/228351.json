{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lovely place I stayed in Sofitel Frankfurt Savigny for 3 nights during a business trip in May.I like the hotel: it is clean, quiet, the staff is friendly and helpful. The room had air conditioner, the bed was comfortable. One can use internet for free in reception area. I liked breakfasts, although I've been dissapointed to know they are not included in room's cost and quite expensive (19 EUR for contenental one).The hotel's location is great: the Savignystrasse is beautiful and quiet, and it is within walking distance from both messe centers and city sights.I liked the place and I certainly would stay there again, but only for company's expense - to my mind the only disadvantage is the price of accomodation.", "Date": "May 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR323832919", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Achutok"}, {"Content": "Great Location for Frankfurt Messe Stayed in this hotel for a recent business trip to Frankfurt. As it was midweek, the rate of 330 Euro/night was to be expected, but for that amount of money I expected the room to be a bit larger. The room had 2 comfortable twin beds pushed next to each other, with about 1.5 feet on each side between the wall and the beds. In addition, there was a small writing desk and a wing chair near the foot of the bed. The room was quiet at night. The bathroom looked like it had been recently remodeled, though I still do not understand why so many European hotels insist on not installing a full shower/bath door. To avoid getting water all over the bathroom, one has to stand directly under the showerhead, jammed up against the wall and not move around too much. Being 6'2, this is difficult at best. The hotel restaurant was very good for both breakfast and dinner. This was lucky as there did not seem to be much choice other than take away restaurants in the surrounding area. The hotel is conveniently located to both the Frankfurt train station and the Frankfurt Messe fairgrounds. Both are within 10-15 minutes walk. Check-in and Check-out were quick and easy", "Date": "Jan 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR812925951", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "hhkexplorer"}, {"Content": "A good hotel for business Hi This is a good business hotel, would not stay there for pleasure, but who goes to Frankfurt for pleasure!You can walk to most of the city from the hotel and it is max 10 minutes to the train station.

We stayed here for three days in Feb. We found this to be a good location very close to the main rail station less than a 10min walk. The hotel fronts to a quiet street with an old church and homes, yet to the side is a large office tower. This location is great cause it is quiet and not far from shopping and food.Frankfurt is an easy city to walk cause it is very compact. This not a very large hotel compared to other chain properties in Frankfurt, its about five floors in two separate but connected buildings. We were in what appeared to be the older back part. The lobby was nice and bright warm colors and nice decor if a bit small. The restaurant was also a bit small but nicely furnished and confortable. The morning buffet was limited and pricey. As was dinner . There are many better and less expensive reastaurants in the area including a nice Brittish restaurant/pub called the Fox and Hound behind the Sofitel. Now on to the rooms, very small and a bit dingy both in need of remodeling. I say both because we had to switch rooms because the beds in the first room were old and worn out . We had two twin beds and at least my bed had a saggy side and very springy. The second room was much improved. In both the pillows were lumpy and old, two extra pillows were ordered and helped a bit. The bathroom however was very nice and a good size compared to the room. Everything was clean but just in need of an update. The staff was hit-n-miss, some very nice . All in all its an ok hotel in a good spot in need of some remodeling. I would stay here again if the price was right. I got a good deal on this stay.", "Date": "Apr 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR430033182", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KMHChicago"}, {"Content": "Clean Hotel but Don't Like It Stayed here over Christmas of 2006 with a friend.

I stay here regularly on business, and in fairness, cannot fault the hotel in terms of quality of service, decor, cleanliness etc. The food is also very good indeed. I agree with another poster who says it has no soul - I have no reason to dislike it, but I do!It is extremely convenient for my office and for the main station (I can't comment on anything else, as don't go there) and is in a nice neighbourhood. I actually find it a rather depressing hotel, and think that this is because of the soullnessness of it, there really is nothing else to fault. Room service is fairly limited if you want to eat a meal, although is extremely nice - I had a fish I had never heard of and the standard was perfect and the presentation faultless. Big breakfast as well if you have it brought up, really good selection. I believe it's rather expensive if you're not on an inclusive rate.There is 1 English-language channel which is extremely poor - and what's more, it's one of those news channels which constantly gives you the same news every 30 minutes! I do feel that especially when you are away on business on your own, a bit of telly is often just what you need. Even though it's a German hotel and you can't expect a huge selection in other languages, they have 3 or 4 French and 2 or 3 Italian, so it does seem we are getting a bit of a raw deal!", "Date": "May 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR517161638", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bushytailedfox"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Hotel Located on a quiet one way street in a residential area, this hotel is really nice and the service is excellent.
