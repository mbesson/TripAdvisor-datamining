However, all was not as it seemed. First of all, they double booked us, expecting us to accept 1 room in the Secret Garden and one in the Ciak Hostel (which is affiliated with the hotel). The room in the hostel was okay, a bit grubby, but most importantly it was a hostel room and as a result basic (on a busy main road). As if this wasn't problem enough, the room in the Secret Garden was a basement room, facing the street. The room was musty, damp and very smelly. No sign of the promised terrace or balcony or any of the features mentioned in the ad. The facilities were also basic, dirty and the toilet wouldn't take toilet paper. The room felt like a cell, with very little light and plenty of street noise. I personally couldn't have stayed in this room.The roof terrace was also basic, bordering on grubby, and far from inviting. The staff at the Ciak (where the joint reception is held) were very friendly and did their best but overall the whole experience was dreadful. I complained at check out, but no managers were available, so the poor girl on reception had to bear the brunt of our frustrations. The only concession we were given was a discount on the price (i.e. paid for a hostel room for the room in the hostel), hardly a concession, more a given! It also transpires that this practice of double booking is quite common (they use the hostel as an overflow for the hotel), so my advice would be to double check you have a guaranteed room in the Secret Garden, but not a basement room. If not don't stay, use the booking service at the station. The whole experience ruined our time in Rome, particularly as reading other reviews, it looks lke the upstairs rooms would have been the deal we were expecting on arrival, so I'd be wary of planning to stay here.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cCleaner needs sacking\u201d", "Author": "Lee_and_Jaine", "ReviewID": "UR112716372", "Content": "I'll get the good points out of the way first. Our room (2) was a nice size and the bed was big and comfortable, something you'll appreciate after a long day walking around Rome. The shower was nice and powerful and the ceiling fan provided a nice breeze to combat the stifling heat. There is also free wi-fi in the room which proved useful as I could research the local restaurants on my mobile phone whilst waiting for my wife to get ready. Now, the bad points. The booking information states you have to check in at an alternative address from where the hotel is but when we tried to find that address we took a while as the numbers on the buildings weren't too clearly identified. Should anyone still book this hotel after reading the rest of this review then note, when you exit the underground station Manzoni, if you head up via Manzoni then the ciak hostel is approx 75-100m on your right, next to a snack bar that is on the corner of the crossroads. The Secret Garden is then only a 5 minute walk from there. On to the room. Although the room appears tidy, it is actually quite dirty, lots of stains and ground in dirt, especially in the bathroom. There were terrible smells coming from the bathroom at all times and it made the stay in the room quite uncomfortable. When we arrived we had 2 bath towels and 2 hand towels and after a long journey we decided to shower before we went out sightseeing. Once we had dried ourselves off, we left the towels on the floor to be changed the next day. The next morning after we showered, we dried ourselves with the hand towels which wasnt a problem but we then also left them on the floor to be changed. After a long day walking in the sun we returned to our room to have a nice shower only to find that the cleaner had folded our dirty, wet towels and hung them on the racks to be re-used. The room had a 14\" tv on a wall bracket but this didnt work either. Although I didnt intend staying in to watch TV, I do like to catch up on the news at the end of the day as I'm in bed. The breakfast on the roof terrace was basic to say the least. There was cornflakes and sweet bread with a couple of almost empty jars of jam. There was a carafe of milk and a carafe of fruit juice. The strangest part of the breakfast was that you had to wash your own plates, cups and cuttlery. This wouldnt of been as bad if there was some washing up liquid and a cloth to use but there was neither. Overall, the bed proved to be the only thing that we really appreciated about this room. It is also conveniently located 5 minutes away from a couple of metro stations. The lack of TV, the limited breakfast and smell didnt really affect us but the lack of basic hygiene by not changing the towels was a real put off and if I were to revisit Rome, I'd definitely look for somewhere else to stay.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cGood location, decent place - a little noisy.\u201d", "Author": "brucegrimshaw", "ReviewID": "UR103255230", "Content": "I had actually booked Ciak Hostel, which is just around the corner, but for whatever reason was moved to Secret Garden.

I think it is important to mention that this is definitely not a hotel, it is a private house, so there is no 24 hour reception available, however the guy said that if I needed anything to call and he would be there in 5 minutes. The room had a big bed and it was spacious (considering others I experienced as a solo traveler in Europe) and I had a private bathroom. I paid my stay in advance and asked what should I do for check out? he asked at what time I was leaving on Sunday, I said noon because my train departure was at 2pm. He said, that would be fine to just leave the bedroom door open, leave the keys in the room and that would be okay. I should also mention that my room was in the bottom floor next to the reception desk, so it was quite loud when other people checked in. And also the cleaning lady was very, very loud, quite inconsiderate for someone on vacation wanting to sleep-in in the morning. Sunday morning at 10am I hear a bang on my door and the cleaning lady's loud voice \"10am you must check out\" I was woken up by this and quite surprised, I opened the door. No one is there, but I can hear the cleaning lady's voice from upstairs \"10am you must check out\" I said I was going to leave at noon (as agreed in my arrival) and she continues to yell \"10am you must check out\" without facing me. I said, \"I need to pack\" So I close my door and try to make sense of what just happened and begin packing my bags. A few minutes later she bangs on my door again and says \"you must check out\", I open the door and again she's gone. I close the door and continue gathering my stuff. A while later she bangs on my door again yelling. This time I am pissed off and say \"stop! I am packing, I will leave as soon as I am ready.\" I was practically chased out of this place and left with the worst impression ever. I am very sorry about this because the guy who helped me check-in was so kind and accommodating.

If you book here, contact GIOVANNA or ALLESSANDRO directly by telephone to verifiy EVERYTHING: [-] This is a mother / son team who are the new management (as of September 2006). They are both fluent in English and genuinely helpful. I booked last-minute to Rome and although I had to move rooms because of the schedule, Gioanna went OUT OF HER WAY to accommodate me. BIGGEST DRAWBACK and READ THIS: the management is NOT on-site to receive you when you arrive... Allessandro arrives by motorcycle to give you keys and do paperwork... so, best to call from Termini, when you arrive to avoid standing in the street with your bags. Also like almost every other smaller place in Rome: They play the cash / credit game... they will tell you their credit card terminal is broken.. it isn't. I finally struck a deal to pay 1/2 credit, 1/2 cash... which they were fine with. You are giiven keys for the duration of your stay; no reporting to a clerk, etc. Come and go as you please. I found this a real plus. The Accommodations: Remember, this is a basic facility... no frills here. But, compared to other places, this is a an EXCELLENT FIND FOR THE MONEY! The linens are crisp and clean. Beds are very comfortable. The bathrooms are immaculate and THERE IS PLENTY OF HOT WATER (something that can be very hard to find, even in the nicest Italian hotels)! And even in a single room, there is at least a double bed. The rooms vary in size and furnishings. #1 seems to be the \"single\" room -- small and in the cellar, but clean and comfortable and was only 55 Euro a night. #3 is a twin room (2 twin beds). #5 is a spacious and airy room, but has its private bathroom one flight above. I paid 70 Euro for this one. #6 seemed to be the gem, large with en suite... but, is upstairs with no lift. Breakfast was on the roof garden (again, no lift) and was tasty and plentiful. They won't leave you hungry here... menu changes daily. Nothing amazing, but they go out of their way to give you a good starting meal. Fresh fruit, Toast, Cereal, sometimes fresh sandwiches... Coffee is weak, but plentiful. Location is very good for return travellers. 10-minute walk from Termini, two blocks east of Plaza Vittorio Emanuelle, two blocks west of Porta Maggiore. For first-timers to Rome, the area will seem a little seedy, dirty and depressing... but, this is the case with most facilities near Termini... the area is safe, despite its look. And it really is a convenient location... I walked to every major attraction... For The Gay Traveller: Walking distance to Max Bar, Sphinx, Sauna Mediterraneo, Hangar. No attitude or hang-ups at all... very friendly. Since you have your own key at all times, no problems with staying out late, etc. Check-out is 10:30am SHARP!
