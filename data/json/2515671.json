The new platinum perks gives one a free continental breakfast, and that was a huge savings for my family. In the Coast restaurant, we appreciated the service of Juan, Nate, and Marites. My family and I were very impressed with how many employees would ask us how were were doing and offer help with making sure that we had an enjoyable stay. One of the room service attendants even declined a tip stating that she just wanted us to have a nice stay (I unfortunately didn't catch her name to give a shout out here). I will definitely be coming back to this property. On other fronts, the meeting facilities also look nice, and the location would be nice for downtown business. I would recommend the Westin San Diego for either business or family travel. If you are doing family travel, you should be looking for site-seeing and not beach or pool activities though.

The location was excellent, about 3 blocks from the Gaslight Quarters where there are hundreds of restaurants and shopping to choose from. The young lady at the front desk, Jackie Burkett was exceptional. We wanted a high floor so that we could get a good view of the bay and Jackie was accommodating to say the least. She asked us our reason for visiting and we told her we were celebrating an important anniversary. The room was lovely, very clean with the most comfortable mattress and bedding. We had an LCD 32\" inch tv in the room. The bathroom was a bit small but the double headed shower head made up for that. Every day near the elevator there was a basket of green apples. The elevators were awesome, with the glass all around and being on the outside of the building when you were going up you could see everything on the Bay, especially nice at night. When we arrived we left our suitcases in the room and went out to scout the area. When we came back there was a beautiful strawberry plater, gift and card to congratulate us on our special anniversary. So thoughtful and unexpected. I would not suggest using the self parking for $24.00 but instead use the Valet for $32.00. Everytime you go in and out of the parking they charge you by 15 min increments, so if you plan to go in and out often better to just go with the valet parking. I asked for an Irish coffee at the hotel bar late in the evening and they didn't have coffee, but went over to the restaurant and got me coffee and made me my drink. Went over and above.

I called down and they sent a handyman up to fix things fairly promptly. This had already put us in a bad mood for what was supposed to be a stress-free weekend getaway. I started to notice other details about the room - there were stains on the carpet, the drapes didn't close all the way letting light in at dawn, fixtures were loose etc. Just a general state of disrepair that we would not expect from a Westin hotel. Admittedly they did comp us a breakfast, but that was the least they could have done under the circumstances. We went to the bar for a Happy Hour drink. Even though there were only 4 or 5 people at the bar and they all had drinks in front of them, the barman cheerily said to us \"be with you right away\" - then disappeared for five minutes. If he had been busy we would have understood but we didn't want to wait, so went elsewhere for a drink. There's plenty of competition in Downtown San Diego so we soon found somewhere that did serve us right away. Next day we asked for a cup of tea to go from the Aroma cafe in the lobby. The lady who served us again disappeared for five minutes, then came back with the tea and marched us over to the bar across the lobby... where she took another five minuted trying to understand the complexities of how the cash register worked! After the maid had made up our room, yet again the second bathrobe had mysteriously disappeared. Add to all this the $32 a day parking fee and the $12.95 internet fee and we did not feel we had a good deal at all. We will not be staying at this hotel again.

A co-worker and I came down for a late lunch during a break and wanted to sample a few things from the menu that Mark had described in colorful detail. The spicy fish tacos, California club & calamari were all amazing! He also let us customize our meals so that we were able to try more than we would have otherwise. We really appreciated the flexibility he offered us.

(the most gracious, kind, compassionate and patient Concierge at the Westin San Diego on 400 W Broadway) for the way she helped many passengers 'abandoned' by British Airways on New Year's Eve when our flight to London, Heathrow was cancelled due to fog. On New Year's Day Thi (pronounced 'tee' - a lovely young woman) helped me personally by allowing me to stay on the line to British Airways for a very long time (and many other passengers too). Eventually Thi 'saved the day' for all of us by speaking to a supervisor/manager and insisting we be given accurate information and be kept informed (everything was conflicting info before this). Thi was instrumental in the passengers being bussed (around 4 pm) and eventually being taken to LA for a flight the following day to Heathrow - arriving into the UK on January 3rd instead of January 1st! Thi took everyone's names and made sure the list was checked and anyone who'd gone for a walk and hadn't returned to the hotel in time for the bus that eventually arrived (only due to Thi - no BA representative ever appeared) was told how to get themselves to LA. I was very, very lucky to have booked the last leg of my trip with air miles and managed to fly out 24 hours later (after being told there was 'no flight'; then there was a flight 'but no seats available' etc -- all very untrue). I hope the Westin San Diego give high recognition to a wonderful young woman who deserves a platinum medal for her patience and compassion!! And the hotel was lovely too!

I called the front desk to inform them of the mess. Five minutes later, this very professional, sweet, and caring gentleman by the name of Nathan Nichols from In Room Dining came with a tray containing Sprite, an assortment of teas, and bread to help me get through this thing. What was even more impressive is he sat with me, went in the bathroom and got me a cool wet towel and placed ut on my forehead. He told me he will stay with me to make sure I am cared for. Never in my 20 plus years staying at a hotel have I had this kind of service, especially nowadays when customer service is pretty much non existent. This gesture truly shows that customer service still exists, one just has to go to the right place. Nathan came back around noonish, and brought me chicken noodle soup complimentary while on HIS break! I offered Nathan a tip for his time, but he declined stating,\"we here at Westin assist our clients for the pleasure it gives us, not to get tipped.\". I am forever a Westin client now.

We have had mishaps at other mid range hotels and were given a discount on the room for a night or a discount coupon for one of their restaurants as well as an apology again when checking out. Nothing was said about it at the Westin. In addition, the cost of parking was outrageous. Since the daily self-parking service was not affiliated with the hotel we ended spending $80 just for parking for only 2 nights. If we knew or had the differences in the parking services more thoroughly explained (the 2 options were just mentioned) we would have chosen the hotels valet parking instead. Daily parking meant that anytime you left and came back you ended paying the daily rate twice and more if you left the hotel more than once.

Great area to get some sun and a lot of chaise and umbrellas if you wanted shade. The view from the deck was also great . The pool and jaccuzi area could use a new coat of paint but again were extremely clean and well set up. The woman who set out the cushions and the towels was meticulous.

The only thing that kept me from rating this hotel with 5 stars was a bad night with a loud party next door--even though that has to do with the guests and not the hotel, it marred my experience of an otherwise perfect stay--more about that later. About the hotel: From the first, all the Westin staff were fantastic! Be aware that there are two Westins only a few blocks apart. Not reading the address carefully, I arrived at the other Westin -- the staff there offered to cab me to the correct Westin, but being a nice day, I wanted to walk. A staff member walked with me, suitcase and all! At the correct Westin, the staff throughout the hotel were fantastic with every interaction every day for all 5 days and nights. My stay was marred only by a large noisy party next door to me on Saturday night. The hotel staff did their best to quiet the group, and eventually, just before the last chance before eviction, the group quieted down. There's no way to know that a group in a hotel will be inconsiderate...but it is nice to feel supported by the hotel staff in attempting to control the situation. The hotel location was great -- just about 4 blocks to the water and in direct line with the ferry to Coronado. Just 2 blocks to the trolley station. For those who enjoy walking, a brisk 25 minute walk brought me to the convention center. At the hotel, the bar has a great happy hour (4-7 pm) every night with good appetizers.

There were some disappointments. I suppose I shouldn't complain, I just have come to expect more from the Westin: - the \"complimentary\" internet access in the lobby is really only for 30 minutes at a time, and then they kick you off. I found this out the hard way while trying to send an important e-mail!! I don't care if they only give you 30 minutes, but they should tell you that!! - the bathroom door wouldn't stay open unless propped with something, and since there was no fan in the bathroom we had to use a shoe to prop open the door after showers. just not something you expect to have to do at a nice hotel - the ironing board was covered in some specs of dirt or something. got my nice white shirt dirty before I noticed - the gym. It was fine, a basic hotel gym with a few new-ish machines and free weights, but when you advertise a \"Reebok fitness center\" or whatever I expect something nicer than what you get at the Marriott or Hilton garden inn. It wasn't. All in all it was a great stay, it was comfortable, and it was much cheaper than some of the other options. I guess I just got my hopes up too high.

This was my first stay in this particular property as I usually stay at the nearby Westin Gaslamp (Horton Plaza). When I couldn't get a room at the Gaslamp property, I reluctantly took the room here. I should not have been worried. Of the two hotels, the staff at this hotel was the better of the two. From the valet to the bell person and everyone in between, the staff was exceptional. We were down in San Diego for my son's first birthday (zoo trip!) so we had a lot of \"gear\" for him. The bell staff was extremely helpful in getting everything out of the car, bringing it up to the room and helping us get things like ice to keep his food cold. The valet staff also was very gracious in retreiving toys from the car that this dumb dad forgot. We didn't take advantage of a lot of other services since it was a short trip, but I will definitely consider going there again. If you go, try to get a water view. We were on a Preferred Guest floor and the views of water were amazing, especially at sunset and daybreak. There are only two slight drawbacks which prevent me from giving it 5 stars. First, the room, while an acceptable Westin room, was not as updated as other properties I have been in. To whit, there was no minifridge. There was a space in furniture for one. Second, it is slightly on the outskirts of downtown. Granted it is not a far walk (or a cheap taxi) to the Gaslamp district, it is farther out than the other Westin at Horton Plaza. If you don't walk to walk far, Karl Strauss brewpub is a short stroll up the street from this hotel. A great option for either a business traveler or a family guy.

Luke, the hotel manager, was very accomodating to all our needs. Not only did he see us when we first walked in (he noticed the white dress hanging on the bellman's baggage cart), he took the time to come up to us, shake our hands and agreed to help us prepare for the big day. We checked in, and the front desk lady was great (I believe her name is Geena?). She was patient enough to ask how we were doing and even granted my nephew his own keycard (he asked me earlier if he can have his own and I told him no because he might lose it). She was sweet enough to do that for him and it made his day. When we went into our room, we noticed it wouldn't be spacious enough to accomodate my hair, makeup, photographers and bridesmaids for preparation. So we went downstairs, asked Geena if we can get a bigger room. She offered to show us 2 rooms and we decided to take the first room she showed us. The bellman's were very prompt and friendly. They talked to us and made sure we were doing well and if there were any thing else we needed. Luke offered us a meeting room to prepare and it was perfect. His staff came in to check if we were doing ok as the time passed. They even brought in an extra mirror for us to use.

One of the most important benefits for me was that they offered a complimentary pick-up at the airport. I was worried about this, though, wondering just how long the wait would be since it was free. From the time I called the hotel to tell them I arrived at the airport to the time they picked me us was ten minutes(or less) - great first impression! The driver's name was Nathan and he was super friendly and pleasant and had a cooler filled with water bottles, which he offered to myself and the two other passengers in the vehicle. The drive to the hotel was very short, but Nathan maintained conversation, sharing some San Diego \"tidbits\" along the way. I arrived at the hotel pretty late in the evening and having traveled from the east coast I was tired and ready to relax, but hungry. The front desk shared there was a 7-11 just around the corner, a short walk, which was perfect to grab a quick snack. I love that Horton Plaza was only about a 10-minute walk from the hotel and the marina was about the same distance in the opposite direction. I have two minor complaints. First, the trash can hadn't been emptied in the room, which I found to be a little uncool and not of the quality I'd expect from the Westin, but the rest of the room was wonderful and the bed was super comfortable. However, I was awakened really early in the morning by what could be described as a loud booming sound, like it was literally in the hotel. It kept happening and I couldn't get back to sleep. At 7a.m. I decided to call the front desk and express my displeasure in the fact I'd been awakened so early by a sound that I wouldn't expect in a hotel. The agent expressed he had no idea what it could be and that no other guest had complained, but that he would let his manager know and see what they could do for me. Nobody called back. At 10 a.m. after a run and a small bite to eat I headed down to walk over to Horton Plaza and decided to mention at the desk that I had called 3 hours prior with a concern, but heard back from nobody. What was a smaller complaint was now much larger because I felt ignored. Immediately Nathan(remember from the night prior?) stepped in wanting to help and see what he could offer to fix this for me. Needless to say, he turned things around for me. He listened, I felt heard, and he made things right for me and I left as a happy guest. Even if a stay isn't perfect, that's okay, it's how the employees handle your concerns that can make all the difference.

Service was top notch, everyone was very friendly, gave out great tips for places in the city. My family all loved the fruit flavored waters in the lobby, it was very refreshing and coming in to the hotel after a long day was instantly relaxing, it's a beautiful building. Very happy with the rate I got on Hotwire (and I dont think we were punished by that rate with our room choice, we had a great view). More than anything though I can't say enough about what a perfect location this is for exploring the city on foot. You go a couple blocks west and you are at the bay and it's boardwalk, can see all kinds of interesting ships and aircraft carriers. About 10 minutes walk north of the hotel is Little Italy which had some wonderful authentic restaurants and gelato and is worth checking out. Two minutes walk from the hotel is Karl Strauss which if you've had a long day and dont feel like walking is very close and a cool very good place to eat (their mac and cheese choices are great). and about 10 minutes west of the hotel is the gaslamp district with great restaurants and good architecture. Took us about 15 minutes drive to get to coronado beach and less than 10 to the zoo. Seaworld was about 20 minutes away, farthest drive we had while there. Never having been to the city this is a perfect place to stay and walk around. The Bad: 1)Valet Parking. $32 a day, they will justify this by telling you this is the standard for the city. Then they will drive your car across the street to the clearly marked $15 a night lot (really, stay and watch them do it, it's very insulting watching you pay an extra $17 a night for someone to walk a hundred feet). It will actually take you less time to park your car in that lot than to have them walk over to get it and drive it over to you. I saw quite a few Valet options walking around the city and they ranged from $10-$15 so I'm not sure when the last time they checked out what the standard was. 2)Prices in general for anything else. The buffet is VERY overpriced for how simple it is (good but something like $25 a person for bacon, eggs, hashbrowns. maybe 8 different things to choose from).. Still charging for wifi that most hotels include these days (even those charging much less to stay). The parking I've already mentioned. I know there is a slight premium to staying at a hotel but it was definitely overboard and there are plenty of choices to avoid it once you know the city even less than 5 minutes walk from hotel. 3)Dream bed. We had our kids so we had two doubles. I don't know if you dont get the dream bed with two doubles I'd be curious to find out if thats the case. But if that really was the dream bed then it's very disappointing. The sheets were nice but the bed was pretty hard to sleep on. The dream shower however I loved. That said the positives very much outweighed the bad, we had a great time here and I would recommend it to anyone as long as they understood to never eat here or pay to park here.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Escondido, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel wrong room\u201d", "Author": "DaSpazz", "ReviewID": "UR116543133", "Content": "This hotel is very nice however on each floor are two tiny rooms tucked behind the service elevators.

We decided that myself and son would come down a few days later to enjoy the weekend in San Diego and take our son to Legoland. I am a Travel Agent. I do my research on hotels very thoroughly. I have been in this business long enough to know that there are some times where bad things happen, and one review is just one review. I am hoping that our experience was just a fluke and won't happen again. But we were HUGHLY disappointed in the Westin San Diego. Enough to know that I will not be staying there again and I will not put any clients there! I did like the location. Very close to a lot of things. If you are looking for a nice family place, I'm not sure this is the place for you. The pool is small. Only goes to 4 feet. Our son could spend all day in the pool if we were to let him, so the 4 ft pool was a little disappointing for him, but is something we can deal with. Not a big deal for me. Rooms were nice. Our room had a pocket door that separated the tub & toilet from the sink and the rest of the room. I noticed that the pocket door was only half painted. Like when someone went to repaint the room, they didn't bother to take the pocket door off the hooks and paint it fully. They didn't even bother to shut the door all the way. So there was a good 2 inch spot on the right side of the door that was a completely different color. A few times, our room wasn't made up until we were on our way to dinner. The thing that topped it off was on our last night, Saturday night. We had gone to Legoland, spent the day there. Came back and had a bad dinner at one of the local restaurants. We were tired, cranky and wanted to just get a good nights sleep. Came back to our room at 10:30pm. We noticed that the room right next to us had the door cracked and there was a party going on. At 10:45pm, my husband called down to security and told them about the noise. Security came up and told them to quiet down. We fell asleep until about 3:30am, when something woke all of us up. It was the banging of doors as people went in and out of the door and into the East Stair Way. They were SMOKING in the stairway! In a NON-Smoking Hotel!!! Again, we called to Security. In the morning, we went down to talk to them about our bill. They charged us $20's more than the rate we thought we were getting because my husband added me onto the room. Ok ... even though I wasn't there the whole time, we decided to pick our battles and just pay the extra $100's that we weren't expecting the room total to be that much. My husband also brought up about the 2 times that we called security to have them come take care of the party next door. Not necessarily to get compensation but just to bring it to their attention that we did not pay $200's a night to stay at a nice hotel to hear a party and smell smoke all night long! That is when the little customer service that we already had been dealing with went out the window. They started to say that there was NO record of any noise complaints all night. We were just dealing with one of the girls at the front desk. She kept going back to ask her manager what to do. The manager approved her to take $40's off our bill (very nice and we would have been happy with just that) and as she did that, she completely IGNORED my husband as he asked her other questions. Wouldn't even look at him \u2026 dead stare at the screen. My husband then asked for the manager on duty. The manager came out and proceeded to argue with us that because there was no reports on the security log that we were lying. My husband even told the manager the conversation the security guard had with the people in the room next door, and that he should be able to track the phone calls that came from our room to security. The manager said there was no way he would be able to do that. But then went to get his business card and was gone quite a long time. When the manager came back out, he did offer to comp our room for the one night and then even offered us breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby. That was nice and is very appreciated but I thought very sad that we had to go thru that whole ordeal. We were not staying at a Motel 6 but we have had better service at one. We paid $200's per night for our room and we expect to get a $200 a night service. I don't believe that we got it at all. Also, the manager did state that the hotel noise policy is that the 1st time security is called for noise, that is the final warning. If it happens again, everyone is supposed to be kicked out. And they are in complete violation for smoking in the stairway. (We do have photos of the cigarette butts in the stair way also.) Obviously that didn't happen. Someone screwed up.

I'm about 7 mths pregnant and so didn't want to travel very far, so we settled on San Diego for our getaway. We had stayed at the Westin Princeville in Kauai last year and had the best time so I was really excited to stay at a Westin again. The smell of the toiletries definitely made me reminisce about Kauai. But of course, this was a totally different experience. For starters, we knew about the $32 valet parking, and so parked in an open lot on C street for $5/day. We had a very warm welcome from Kayti Koelln at the front desk. I asked her for a fridge for the room and I don't think she was able to get me one, but sent up really great cookies and a couple of bottles of apple juice instead along with a hand-written note. Nice! Already more hospitable than Kauai. She also asked for my SPG card and reminded me the waters were free and gave us a Preferred floor room. Nice! The room was average for a 4 star hotel, nothing spectacular. You could tell it was an older building that went through a renovation. And our view was of the skyscraper next door that was under construction. Not that I cared so much since there was no balcony to lounge on anyway. A balcony facing the ocean would've been nice, I guess. Some good things: 1. Being 7mths pregnant and forgetting all my pillows at home, I still had a great night sleep in the Heavenly Bed. The bed was comfy and had this long thin pillow that was great for supporting my belly and between my legs. 2. The fitness area was new and nice 3. The pool was nicely heated to almost body temperature, loved it for easy lap swimming 4. There were towels next to the pool 5. 5 block walk to Gaslamp Quarters 6. 1/2 walk to Seaport village 7. Guest services very responsive when you call them. Some bad things: 1. There was hair that was not mine in more than one place in the bathroom. I know it wasn't mine because I saw it there when I first walked in. There was some on a white towel and some on the tub. I used to camp a lot, so I still used the towels. But man, this is supposed to be a luxury hotel 2. There were flecks of black stuff on the hand towel. What are we cleaning, housekeepers? 3. There are these three things of fruity infused water in the front lobby but every time I tried to get some they were empty! It doesn't help to have the things there to tease us. Put some water in them! 4. Walking back from a movie late at night (around 11:30), there are some weird, crazy people who lurk right outside the hotel and talk to you or the air.

When I made the reservation, I noted that we were in town celebrating a birthday. When checking in, the person at the front desk wished the birthday person a happy birthday. Later that afternoon a knock at the door from room service brought us a pleasant birthday surprise which included a nice card from the hotel staff, assorted cheese plate with crackers and two bottles of sparkling water. A very nice touch to a pleasant stay and friendly hotel staff. This was my first visit at the Westin (I normally frequent Sheraton Marina another Starwood hotel) and I will definitely be back. I booked the Westin weekend escape package which offered, complimentary breakfast (nice hotel breakfast buffet which included an assortment of warm breakfast items like eggs benedict, potatoes, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, fresh omelets to order, French toast, and assortment of breads, and fruit) and an extended check out time of 4:00 p.m. My only gripe was the $32 a night valet parking fee, but aside from that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the hotel to others. Great for families, couples and friends! Stayed in room number 1618 great view of the city and bay with Coronado off in the distance. Thank you Westin!!! Tips for the traveler: Give valet a call 5 minutes before heading down for car. -Search for Westin coupon codes before making a reservation. -Become starwood rewards member for free. Provided for two bottles of drinking water each day ($10 value) and a complimentary appetizer with the purchase of a drink in the hotel bar.

My husband & I checked in at 11pm, after a late flight, only to find that our prepaid Deluxe room had in fact NOT been prepaid due to an \"error with the system\". We booked the room several weeks prior, but were not ever informed of this (even after I called to confirm the reservation 3 days prior to arrival and was told everything was all set). We were unexpectedly charged $450 on the spot with no apologies from the staff on the error, and no explanation as to a breakdown of the charges. The desk clerk simply swiped our card, mumbled something inaudible, and then handed us the room keycards, without even pointing us to the elevators. Not a very impressive welcome for a supposedly upscale hotel chain. This particular trip was to celebrate my husband's birthday, which the reservation rep put into the notes when I called to book our room. But no one at the hotel ever took notice of this. I've never been to an upscale hotel for a birthday event where the staff didn't go out of their way to help us celebrate the special event, or at least SAY happy birthday. Additionally, we booked the Westin Deluxe room, as we were told it would be nicer than the standard Westin room. We did have a nice view, but the room looked very outdated, and it had NO minibar! Only a gigantic empty minibar cabinet. I am not sure how any property can call themselves \"luxury\" when the only in-room amenities offered are shampoo, coffee and water. I'm pretty sure the Econo Lodge offers it's guests more than this. We were very disappointed. The wall insulation in the rooms is appalling. If you are like me, and don't enjoy hearing your neighbors gargle, brush their teeth, and blow-dry their hair at 7am on your vacation, then DO NOT STAY HERE. My husband and I travel quite a bit, and we value more upscale properties and spend quite a bit of time choosing more reputable, luxury brands. We are not looking for a \"cheap stay\", and have no problem paying more to get more.

I loved the price I paid, I loved the Heavenly bed and the dual-headed shower, and the shampoo/conditioner scent. The location is conveinent to most areas of San Diego and I only used my car to take someone to the airport. and to head out to Shelter Island for the SailUSA11 tour. Used the ferry, 4 blocks away to get to Coronado Island and my feet to get to Gaslamp and the trolley system next door to get to Old Town. I was in a weird room at the end of the hallway and there was an extra exterior door that my room and another shared. Well that door closed when I went for ice. No worries as I had my room key. However, it was missing the complete inards to have the key work. I called the front desk for help and they sent up a room attendant. He promptly realized there was nothing he could do. Another call to engineer and to get someone up to open the door. 20 minutes later., I'm in....no follow-up call from front desk apologizing or anything. Moving forward 2 days....I return from the airport only to find that my key is not working in the door. I go down and have it re-keyed, get back to the room only to have the key still not work. This time I call the front desk and they send security up. He tries several times and he tries to use his pass key, and still it doesn't work. He again calls engineering. Apparently the doors electronic locks run on batteries and when they die, they have to get 'shocked\" into working and then the batteries have to be changed. So after 30 minutes this time, still no phone call apologizing, nothing....not a sorry for the PITA this was again.

Didn't like the little room where the toilet and bath/shower was in (sliding door to close). It was pretty small and there wasn't anywhere to put your things. We managed though. The rest of the room was nice and spacious. Enjoyed the fruit flavored ice water in the lobby. One had pineapple in it, another had grapefruit, and the third had cantaloupe.

My friend and I arrived in the morning at the airport, called the Westin shuttle and they sent someone right over to pick us up. We were able to check in quickly, unpack and headed out immediatey to Old Town for margaritas & lunch via the Trolley. The American Plaza trolley station is just a block away from the hotel. Our room was nice/normal - One comment would be for additional towel racks and the bathroom door does not stay open automatically. It's on a spring closure of some sort so we propped the chair in front. Otherwise, it gets very hot in there. The bed and shower were both \"heavenly\". Now, may I just say a very special CUDOS TO MARINA!!!! She was the awesome, funny, personable associate/server. OMG, loved her! WE MISS YOU Marina (from 2 girlz from TX - you KNOW who we are!!) Another CUDOS to Jeanine Benson, she was so helpful to talk to and gave us a tremendous restaurant recommendation (De Medici Italian Restaurant). All of the other staff we encountered were also very nice & helpful. We would definitely return and stay at the Westin! Helpful tips for your visit: 1. Purchase the multi-day trolley pass - $12 for 3 days and you can ride all day/night as much as you want. 2. Request a fridge in advance from hotel. There is a 7-11 just around the corner, less than a block...went and bought bottled water and juice for our room. 3.

The hotel also featured a 24 hour fitness room and pool (not 24 hours) which I checked out and it all looked very well kept, and a massage studio.

My poor experience began at even making the reservation. I made the reservation on their site. Later in the week, I was having second thoughts at the location so I attempted to cancel. The site said that a deposit may still be charged if I cancel now, but did not specify the amount. I continued to cancel, only to learn that the deposit was indeed the entire amount of my stay. Now I had no room, and was still charged the full price. I called customer service. The first representative, transferred me back to the hotel front desk, who then transferred me back to customer service, who told me they didn't know what they could do. I hung up and call back later in the day. The new representative told me they were not able to help me because I had reached customer service....?!!??!!?...they then attempted to sell me three more nights, at a higher rate, after I'd already paid! Confused and tired of waiting on hold, I asked to be transferred back to the hotel where they inform me that my reservations were still there and had never been canceled to begin with. Ok. At least I have a room for the money I've paid now. Around 11 pm, we arrive at the hotel. I see where you can pull up for valet, but there is no spot to pull up into as they have it covered with cars. I pull up on the street and valet informs me that the hotel does not have parking and that you must valet AND that it will be $32 a night. Ridiculous, but again, I'm already tired and frustrated. I go in to the lobby to check in and the hotel is empty. Nobody standing to help in the lobby, it appears closed. I check the back room behind the check in and ah-ha! A human! She checks me in and I make my way up to the room. The rest of the stay includes broken air conditioning, toilets that you have to hold down for 15 seconds to flush, a sink that makes draining noises in the night, and the TV Guide/Menu that doesn't work. The rooms were small, bathrooms/tubs were tiny. My room was never cleaned on the second day. When I finally called on my last night about the air conditioning because I couldn't stand another hot night, they upgraded me to a room on a higher floor. The room was the same size, nothing special, just on a different floor, but I'd take it for some A/C. Wake up in the middle of the night after turning the A/C down to 60 degrees, and it's still 72 degrees in the room. In the morning I wake up to find the check-out letter which includes extra valet charges that I never used. I tell them at the front desk, they take them off without mentioning why they were on there, and I leave. I wonder how many people they got away with charging an extra $100 to their bill that never noticed. If it'd wanted to stay in a two star hotel, I would've paid a two star price.

Having just come from a fabulous week at the Westin in Palm Desert, the first impression here was a real let down. I confirmed that the room that I had booked had two queen beds. Nope he said - all we have are two doubles. I asked if they did not have two queens and he just said \"nope\". How many keys do you want was the next question. I asked for two. When we got to the room there was only one in the folder. So much for paying attention to my answer. I went back out to the vehicle and my wife and kids had unloaded the luggage on to the sidewalk. The bell person was just standing there looking around, so I grabbed a luggage cart and started to push it down the sidewalk. That got his attention and he finally came to help. With the luggage unloaded I headed to the airport to drop our rental vehicle off. Went into the terminal and called the Westin for a pickup in their van. Will be there in 15 minutes was the reply. I waited 25 minutes and finally called again. No one seemed to know about my request and said that once I had my luggage I should call and they would come. I told the operator on the phone that I had already been waiting for 25 minutes from my first call. Sorry she said, we will be there within 20 minutes. I waited 20 minutes (now 45 in total) and gave up and grabbed a cab. When I got back to the hotel, the van was still parked in front and had not even moved. Went up to the room and my wife thought that it was housekeeping. She had called and asked for a couple of blankets and extra towels. Shortly after we left for dinner with friends for a couple of hours. When we got back to the room there still were no towels or blankets. She phoned again and it took over half an hour for them to arrive. I won't comment much on the room, except to say that the angle of the outside wall made things fairly tight with four people and luggage in the room. Room was okay - a standard hotel room - nothing special. Definitely has been renovated at some point in the past, but not a great renovation to say the least. Between business and leisure I spend at least 60 nights per year in hotel rooms and this had to be the worst service that I have had in the last three years.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Staceyzig", "ReviewID": "UR102482632", "Content": "My husband, myself and our one year old daughter stayed 6 nights at this Westin.

My expectations are high when traveling, but I have to say the staff at the Westin is five star in my book and exceeded my expectations.

Asked for one but none available...only for medical emergencies. Never heard that before. If you have young children and need to keep milk or snacks in a fridge, this isn't the place to stay. The desk lamp was broken, shade was hanging off to one side, not sure how housekeeping could miss this! Internet for a fee, still not sure why hotels are charging for this. Did they ever charge for TVs thirty years ago? Service was great, bellman, valet, front desk were all very friendly and helpful. When I called to speak to the manager, he however was not very understanding and just gave me the canned response about the fridge and how most rooms were the same size as ours. Our closet door was next to the bed and about 12\" away, and we did not have any room for our luggage. One bag had to sit on the armchair/ottoman. Ours had the long narrow cooridor at the entrance and most of the other rooms did not. When I booked (at least one month prior) I mentioned we were a family of four. I would have thought they would have put us in a larger room. Valet was a little expensive, about $30 a day, but this is downtown SD and the lot next door is $25 a day but no in-out privileges so not too bad. They don't have the $5 coupon if you opt out of housekeeping. They did not have the typical tourist magazines in the room like other hotels.

Although some incident are smaler than others, I just noted them because they are exemplary. 1. on entering the BF room, 2 staff members were chatting away. One literally with his hands in his pockets like he had nothing else to do. 2. We entered the buffet area at 8.30am on a weekend. Missing was: bread (really), Plain yoghurt (empty and not available anymore), pancakes (empty), butter (really). I noticed this one at a time and asked for these one at a time. Staff hadn't even noticed it before I asked. Once I got to the bread (4th item missing) I exploded and threatened to file a complaint. Suddenly, everything changed, I got my yoghurt which miracolously was found, we were given a extremely good service, which we enjoyed and thanked for and which is how it should've been in the 1st place. The guy with his hands in his pocket, who had earlier said \"There were so many guest, you guys cleaned out all the food in this place\"(really! those awful guests!) was suddenly helping out too. Just to be clear, I don't mind if something is missign or goes wrong (if it is not too much!) but what I do mind is a total lack of commitment to make things work in the first place. 2. The concierge was keeping it deliberately short to help other guests (understandable, but wrong in my humbel opinion because he made me feel less important than the guest waiting behind me), instead of answering my questions, which were not beyond anything normal a tourist would ask 3. When asked for quarters for the parking meter, I got 4 from a new rol or quarters (really). I asked for more, but he said he needed them in case more customers asked. When I said, that maybe they should stock for more quarters in a centrum district with paid parking, the atmosphere chilled to an unprofessional level, especially in a 4 star hotel.

The Ironworkers start work around 6:30am, so if you have the opportunity to sleep in it will be disrupted by construciton noise.

I truly can say this is the best overall experience I've had at a hotel in my travels. From the time I was picked up by their complimentary hotel shuttle to the time I checked out the service was great. I used the Concierage service many times and all of the people who I encountered gave me great service and info, but there was one employee who worked at the Concierage desk that provided me with \"outstanding\" service and also went beyond the normal call of duty. Her name is Sopia. I dealt with her more than anyone else, but that is not why I'm writing this review. It's because of the extra things she did to accomodate me for my dining needs. I asked her about places to eat on several occasions and each time not only did she suggest a nice place, she volunteered to make the reservations. My last night there I told her I wanted to go to Coronado Island for dinner. It's across the bay from San Diego and I was taking the ferry. She suggested a restaurant named \"Peohe's\" that sits on the water and has an fantastic view of the San Diego skyline. She suggested if I got there by 5:30 pm I should be able to get a window view table. She told me she would call and make the reservation. Well she did make the reservation but did much more than that. Unbeknowing to me she asked the restaurant not only to seat me at a window table with a marvelous view of San Diego she also asked them to give me VIP service. When I arrived they seated me at a table with a breathtaking view of San Diego placed a vase of fresh flowers on my table and gave me a personalized menu that had a welcome to the restaurant from Sophia of the Westin welcoming my party with my last name on it. This was truly a nice touch & something that has never happened to me before. But it didn't end there the waiter informed me that Sophia would like to buy me an dessert on her after my meal if I so inclined. I was really surprised to say the least. She went far beyond her normal duty to make my dining experience a truly memorable one. I also must admit the dinner at the restaurant Peohe's was excellent and was the best meal I had during my visit to San Diego. Not only did she have a wonderful spirit she was a great person, with great insight. My visit at this hotel goes to the top of my list and I would recommend anyone to stay there. The location was great and accessible to everything you would like to do. I will definitely stay here the next time I'm in San Diego and suggest you should too. You would not be disappointed.

So much for four star service. Although the breakfast buffet was OK, we absolutely hated it when the wait staff came up to us at the end of our meal and gave us a card with their names on it. Text on the back of the card explained that if we mentioned the server by name on TripAdvisor, they'd get a bonus from their employer, Westin Hotels. They directly asked us to write a positive personal review on this site. Sorry guys, but that's not how it works in our books. First you want a tip for a breakfast buffet...where guests serve themselves...and THEN you overtly ask for free advertising and more perks? Having stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years, I have never seen anything so tacky. I'm not sure where pride in doing a good job, a positive customer service ethic and professionalism comes in - but at the Westin San Diego, the staff''s 'it's all about me' attitude ensured that the guest always came second during our stay.

We went to the restaurant for breakfast on both mornings of our stay and the service and food was terrible. The host, manager and servers were completely unaware that there were guests in the restaurant. We had to actually get up and make a request for a server on several occasions.

Towels and wash clothes that had been placed on the side of the tub were left by the maid. Though she did replace them, I didn't understand why she left them. The room usually wasn't made up until mid-afternoon and to be honest, the first day when I returned to my room, I didn't think the maid had been there yet because the bed appeared to be unmade. I then realized she had been in the room, she just didn't do a very good job at making the bed. My wife had left for a run while the made was in the room and when she returned she found that the maid had turned off the A/C. Since it was a fairly warm day in San Diego, she felt this was inappropriate. On our second day, we found that our keys were inoperative when we returned to our room in the early evening. Upon going to the front desk, we were told that they had to reset all the keys. If this was the case, I would have expected someone to have been by the elevators, informing guests of this before they ventured 23 floors up. The front desk clerk didn't offer an apology for the inconvenience. The workout room was very much like a sauna. I was in the gym at 0530 every morning and by 0545 I could see that I wasn't the only one sweating profusely. As I mentioned, I typically send out positive comments and I really don't like reporting on negative experiences, however; I hope that you will consider my comments and make some of the small changes that I feel are necesary.

There was adequate space, abundant resources of utilities and necessities, and are again very modern. The entire experience was just as comfortable as could be. I was upgraded to a bay-view room, affording me nice sights. I enjoyed watching the boats and the sunsets. The location was also better than I expected.

However, the city blocks are small and this hotel is only about 10 minutes' walk from the same Gas Lamp area. It was a pleasant walk, too, and in a very safe area, well-lit, and easily navigated.

To start with location: the hotel is right in the city centre, close to the Gas Lamp Quarter, or the seaside. Thanks to the very well organized public transportation it was no problem to get anywhere, the train station being just approx. 5 minutes by walk from the hotel. It is quite easy to get to the Sea World, or to go for shopping \u2013 very practical, when your husband is at the conference and you have the whole day for yourself! Although being close to the sea, this is not the place where you could actually swim \u2013 there is no beach nearby, just the port. So if you really wish to go to the beach, take a ferry to the Coronado island (from the port being just 10 mins by walk from the hotel). You can have a nice 20 mins walk accross the island to get to the Coronado hotel \u2013 do you remember the movie \u201eSome like it hot\u201c with Marylin Monroe, Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis? Did you know that \u201ethe hotel in Florida\u201c was actually in San Diego? So, if you love the movie (as much as I do), take a trip to Coronado \u2013 you will love it! As regards swimming \u2013 I am not sure what the weather usually is there, however, despite we were there at the end of August, the wind was quite cold and we did not feel for swimming at all. Perhaps we just had bad luck... The hotel itself: the rooms were nice and spacy, very clean, with all the comfort. The only thing that we were missing was a minibar. Initially I thought that I might use the hotel swimming pool \u2013 however, the weather was not very nice (it was foggy every morning) and the pool was just above a very noisy street and I did not feel this would be the best way for me to relax... So I did not try it at all... Food and service: very nice food for a reasonable price, very professional service. One thing to mention \u2013 down at the reception there were 4 tanks with water (all complimentary) \u2013 one had slices of lemon in it, another had slices of oranges, another one with melon, another one with grapefruit. Great idea \u2013 again something I could recommend for other hotels to introduce! Overall experience: pleasant and convenient for the stay during the conference.

Overall the hotel is a usual Westin and in a nice location. I always prefer paying a little extra for the Starwood experience knowing I'll get something nice and luxurious but this time that wasn't the case. It started at 4am. I was only in town one night but at 4am for some reason an alarm, or what sounded like an alarm, went off for about 30 seconds waking me from my sleep. I couldn't find the source and it wasn\u2019t fire alarm loud, but way more than a simple phone or alarm clock alarm. Every 45 minutes or so this I\u2019d hear this noise and it completely killed my sleep. The worst part is i couldn\u2019t figure out what it was or where it was coming from. I admit I didn't call the front desk at that point because the noise was so intermittent and I really didn't want to change rooms at 5am. Finally after really getting up for the day I called to report the problem. The next problem was in the bathroom. The shower had hair from a pervious guest in it and so did the towels. I am usually understanding about these things, but it felt like insult to injury and was simply gross. I did tell the front desk person about both incidents and was comped breakfast/lunch but the only thing open was the bar. I was fine with that but the service at the bar was horrendous. It was a Sunday afternoon and there were probably 3 other parties there yet our service was terrible. Again, usually I love my westin experience and count on receiving it. That is why I'm willing to pay such a premium to stay there. However, based on this experience I could have received the same treatment for much much less.

The food at the hotel restaurant was good. The breakfast buffet had a good selection and was a good value (eggs were under cooked, but otherwise no issues). When I checked in the front desk could not find my reservation at first. Even though I spelled my name, the woman looking it up obviously didn't listen and was looking under a different spelling. Minor issue. The keys I was given did not work and I had to get replacements. Those worked without problems. Minor issue. The room was generally clean. However, there were a couple minor issues where the cleaning should be more complete. Around the shower there were a couple minor issues where there was \"water damage\" that looked less than inviting. Some of it may be a bit of pealing paint because of the water. Minor issue though one that makes me concerned when thinking about such things as molds. It seemed to be around areas (for example, the ceiling) that the cleaning staff probably doesn't get to. While a minor issue, this would be one that I would consider conditional to being able to recommend the hotel to a friend. No venting for the shower. Takes awhile for the steam from a shower to go away which might be part of the cause for the issue mentioned above with the ceiling. Minor issue. Maid service did a good job of cleaning up every day. I was surprised the hotel charged for wifi. Minor issue, but makes the hotel less attractive. Check out was quick. Problem with the billing. I had asked that the entire bill be charged to my credit card and nothing be charged to the other person's credit card. This was not done and I had to call the hotel after I got home to fix it. This was resolved quickly and without too much trouble. However, I was told that the person working the billing dept was not in at regular times and I had to leave a message to get a call back at some future time. That is not even close to being acceptable. A billing problem should not be something I wait on. I asked for the manager and got Steve Kelly (I believe I have the correct name). He was able to resolve the issue quickly (at this point all charges are on my credit card though it will apparently be 7 - 10 business days before charges are removed from the other person's credit card so I don't know if its completely resolved -- I am assuming it is). Besides being an annoyance to have to fix this, it put me in an uncomfortable position because I had promised someone I was taking care of the bill and that person had to let me know that wasn't the case. For that reason, even though I will answer yes to the would you recommend this hotel to a friend, I have to say that its a conditional yes. Lastly, something that the hotel probably could not control was the construction across the street that started at 7:00am sharp every morning. Minor issue since this is outside the control of the hotel.

The bed is always comfortable with nice linens and a huge (and heavy) down comforter. It is so comfortable. The room: The room was bright and airy and very large. Bathroom: Large shower with great water pressure and the heavenly shower head. This shower head gives a great shower which is always important to me while on the road.

Location: If your going to stay in San Diego to visit the Gaslamp District at night this hotel is a bit of a walk to the main drag of bars and restaurants. If you are going to the Courts this hotel is centrally located. Price. I believe I paid $189/night booked through spg.com. This price was on the lower side as the W and the other Westin in San Diego are often much higher. The price included two free breakfasts in the hotel so I felt that was an added benefit.

The hotel location is terrific, and easy to access. My only two complaints from start to finish are the reservation systems and the parking. It would have also been nice to have free internet, especially as a SPG. I initially had my reservation Monday through Friday, and called the hotel the week prior to the stay in order to modify the reservation to depart on Thursday. I had reserved two rooms under my name, and I also added my SPG number to the reservation. When we got to the hotel, they only showed ONE room under my reservation. Unfortunately I had not brought my confirmation email to show the information indicating there were two rooms reserved. The reservation also showed that I was staying through Friday. I informed them that I had contacted the reservation number the week prior in order to change the departure date. All in all, it was not a big issue, as the manager made the appropriate changes, and added the second room. I did call downstairs once I was in the room, in order to request being moved farther from the elevator. They informed me that since I had requested double beds, they were not able to move me. I had not, in fact, requested double beds, but they apparently had a note in the system that someone had talked to me and noted a request for double beds. I informed them that they had not talked with me about the double beds, and I was told that the note must have been put on the wrong reservation. I ended up staying in the initial room for the duration of my stay. The hotel room was very nice, clean and spacious. I had a very nice view of the harbor and the city. The housekeeping was fantastic during my entire stay. Any questions we had were quickly and nice answered by the staff throughout the hotel. The gaslamp district and plenty of restaurants were within walking distance. Parking was steep at $32 per day. It's amazing to me how so many of the hotels charge such high fees for parking your vehicle. There was a parking lot up the street, where parking was $15 for 24 hours with in and out privileges. When we were ready to check out, the front desk informed us that they had us staying through until Friday. I informed them that that had been changed already.....twice.

The Concierge assured us that everything was in walking distance, but after a trip to Horton Plaza, Star of India, and the Gaslamp Quarter, our feet would think otherwise. The bathroom had a sliding entrance door, which was a bit annoying. The walls are also quite thin. I could hear people laughing and talking around midnight. The Gas Lamp quarter is about 7 blocks away and other than that there isn't too many restaurants in the area. There is a proper Starbucks 1 street West ans 2 streets over was a hidden gem, the Grant Central Cafe. Try the breakfast, the omelets, sourdough toast, and potatoes were great.

Checkin was fast and easy, the rooms were clean and comfortable. Elevator service was always prompt and the gym/pool were available at no additional cost.

So they call me when the room is ready and we don't have a refrigerator or a microwave! We called the operator to ask for a refrigerator and they said they were all taken. If they hadn't made us wait until 6pm to check in, I wouldn't have had a problem with that, but since they were all taken and we had to check in at 6pm, I was very upset, but sitll didn't complain. The parking situation is horrendous! To valet it's $32 a day or you can self park for $24 a day. There are a few parking spots with meters, but good luck. Your best bet is to park your car in the lot behind the hotel (the street parallel to braodway) for $17 a day and take a taxi or walk where you need to go (It's $5 a day on the weekends and holidays). Needless to say we did that and never paid for valet or self park. After finding out the parking siutation, I complained to the manager, Jen, and she apologized and gave us breakfast tickets worth $45 a day for the two mornings we were going to be there. The food was WONDERFUL. I would pay for it if we didn't have the tickets. She also told me they would put us on the list for the next refrigerator and see what she could do about parking. After we got our free tickets, we never heard from her and never got a refrigerator. So this morning, I look at my account online, and they charged me $32 for valet when we never used it! I called and the receptionist said she'd take it off but it would take 10-12 business days! This hotel should not be a 4 star hotel.

Good location in downtown San Diego, It's a 10 minute walk to the Gaslamp District and 5-10 to the waterfront. Very short walk to Santa Fe railway station which we used for travelling on to Los Angeles. Hotel has its own airport pick up service which we didn't know about, but it only cost $10 by taxi anyway (I love how close San Diego airport is to downtown). Check-in was quick and easy, staff pleasant without being overly enthusiastic. Was assigned a room on one of the lower levels with a view of Broadway. Quite an odd shaped room (looking at the fire plan on the back of the door the rooms seemed to vary widely in size and shape). This was the first time we'd stayed in a Westin and their heavenly bed and shower lived up to the hype - the king bed was one of the most comfortable i've ever experienced, as was the shower, they should be banned because i was wasting water, i just didn't want to get out! Nice large flat screen tv with HD channels (local plus ESPN, HBO etc). External noise was an issue - could hear buses and trucks go past on Broadway, though that was tolerable, the worst came in the middle of the night, when goods trains would blast their horn continuously (presumably as they went over the crossing), it wasn't just a short sharp blast, it went on an on and on. This probably happened for 10-20 minutes each night we were there and made for quite a disrupted sleep. At least it wasn't the whole night i guess. DId not eat in the hotel or use the pool so i can't comment on those. The location may not suit everyone. Outside of the Gaslamp Quarter downtown San Diego is rather quiet at night and a lot of homeless people congregate on Broadway (the Greyhound station is not far away from the hotel). Still we did plenty of walking (including walking back from Petco Park after taking in a Padres game) and did not feel unsafe at any time. We stayed in the Sofia Hotel about 7 months prior to this, and the Westin was definitely the better of the 2 - much larger rooms and doesn't have the paper thin wall problem the Sofia does. I can understand why other people have commented it is a little dull and lifeless as it is clearly a business hotel first and a holiday hotel second, but if you want a party hotel then go and stay at the Hard Rock Hotel.

It definitely is clean and the service was what I expected. But here is a list of my issues. 1. Booked a room with two double beds and requested a rollaway which was printed on my confirmation. Upgraded for $25 to bayview. At check in was told that rollaways were not permitted due to fire codes. Impossible for me and two teen boys to fit in the room we were given. Even though it was an upgrade, the room was so small, you could not walk around the beds, there was no door to the bathroom that you could close, only a pocket door that did not close. Windows were covered up in places with yellow tape, as if they were broken. Upon seeing the size of the room and the unavailability of the rollaway, I had to book another room. Funny thing is - in booking the new room - I got the cheapest room available at the time and it was much larger and nicer than the original room I booked (so my issue with the hotel, is what is the point of an upgraded room, what exactly did my upgrade pay for)...! By the way the cheaper room also had a bayview. Another point of contention, my friends stayed in a lower rate room and not only had more space, a bayview and a real bathroom door, but also received bathrobes, which I did not get). My suggestion is do not get the upgrade!! Another point of contention is the location. I think it is convenient in the sense that you can walk to just about anywhere you need to go, but I would not feel comfortable at night in that area, definitely as a woman with kids felt like I had to be hyper aware. I am used to the homeless, living and working in Boston, but the hotel seems to be in a very active homeless area. There is a lot of people asking for money, so just know this if you are going to stay here.

I am not sure if they are or not but it didn't really matter as we were there to sightsee and wouldn't be spending a huge amount of time in the rooms. We had a couple of problems with the safe and a problem in the bathroom, but these were resolved promptly. The beds were comfy but the decor was quite dated. I noticed that the powerpoints in the hallway were falling off ,which isn't ideal if you have small children around. Everyone raves about the shower, but I couldn't really see what all the fuss is about. It was an average bathroom. One strange thing was that housekeeping kept leaving clean towels but never took the dirty ones. By the end of the stay we had quite a collection of towels!! The hotel was centrally located to the train depot, the wharf and within walking distance to Little Italy. Wehad no problems getting around without a car which was why we chose a central location. There seemed to be quite a few homeless people around the hotel. There were more homeless people than I anticipated. I was usually with a group when walking back to the hotel from dinner so didn't feel afraid. However, on one occasion when I had to walk back to the hotel alone someone tried to follow me. I did feel a little threatened as it was quite a few blocks to walk from the main shopping area and not alot of places to get help if needed.

The location was great and we could easily walk to all the venues. The train depot is nearby and the highway entrance/exit is less than a mile away so it makes getting around the San Diego area very simple. The hotel itself was very clean, felt freshly decorated and comfortable. The room was spacious and everything worked properly. The bed is enormous and we slept very well. There were two 'comfy chairs\" of different styles. We got some noise from the train depot and the ships coming into the harbor, but nothing to inhibit rest. The staff anticipated us running out of shampoo, etc, and left more when they saw we were running low. On my birthday, I came back to the room to find they had set my birthday card from my husband( --which I had just opened that morning )on the bed and surrounded it with chocolates! We attended parties for the festival at different venues and met up with groups staying at the nearby W hotel, and both my husband and I agreed we preferred the Westin for comfort and serenity . Our room overlooked the bay and we could watch the sailboats and cruise ships come in. It is well worth a little extra to us to get that sort of water view. All the employees from the front desk to the valets, housekeeping and restaurant staff, were friendly and helpful. Every single one. They gave us directions and answered questions. No attitude or rush. What a refreshing change after a recent stay at a factory-feeling hotel in Vegas! The breakfast buffet at the restaurant is a little expensive ($18--for me who usually stumbles around at home in the morning with tea and toast) but has a great selection of fruits, yogurts, breads and hot dishes. You can also order a la carte off the menu and there is a coffee shop in the lobby so you can just grab a quick bite. My only caveat would be that despite the convenience of the location, some people might not enjoy the area as there are many homeless who may approach--and did ---even just inside the hotel doors one evening. There is a Greyhound bus station a couple of blocks away and the people you meet on your walks can seem a bit dodgey. I'm from LA and used to that, but I know my family from Wisconsin would be uncomfortable. Area parking is also expensive but worth it to keep one's car safely indoors under guard.

Staying here again would certainly not be the worst thing, there are definately some niceties, but the little things started to add up enough that next time we go to San Diego we will very likely try another hotel as this Westin did not \"sell us.\" The good: 1) We asked for a high floor and received a room on the 20th floor. 2) Great view of the water and sunset. 3) Great shower. 4) Convenient location (close to a brewery; Gaslamp Quarter; Petco Park; WAMU ATM; bagel shop; Seaport Village etc.). 5) Staff was very friendly, helpful and accessible (but not always successful). The not-so-good: 1) The air conditioning either didn't work the first night or has such a high setting of temperature to be useless. The next day we asked for both the air conditioning to be looked at and for a good old fashioned fan. We were advised both would be handled within a short time. When we came back to the room several hours later, there was a note that the air conditioning was fixed, but there was no difference from what we could tell. Also, there was no fan. I called downstairs to the front desk and asked again for the fan; was told again a fan would be delivered to our room; but no fan was ever delivered to us as promised. The bed was very comfy, but because the room was stuffy we got little sleep. 2) We left the room around 10 a.m. the 2nd day we stayed, and when we arrived back around, ballpark, 5 or 6, no housekeeping had been done (we're pretty low-maintenance, but were expecting at least clean towels and the bed made so called down for towels and TP and let the rest be as was). 3) Couple small things: Would be nice if there was a phone book and a TV listing guide in the room as there was neither and... 4) There's no place in the bathroom to hang a wet towel. 5) The day we left, I went downstairs to print out our boarding passes. First, I was unable to access the door with my room card as it indicated to do, so I went to the front desk to get assistance. She also had trouble till she realized they decided not to lock the door any longer so you really didn't need a key (although it did not indicate this on the door but rather the opposite). When I tried to print the pass, there was no paper in any of the 8 drawers of printers or copy machine. Back I went to the front desk where they had to call an engineer for paper as that dept. was the only one who was allowed to load paper. Went back to the front desk about 15 minutes later. They called Engineering again. Engineering was there in about 5 minutes after the 2nd call, but he only loaded paper into 2 printer drawers so I did let them know the copier & other printers were out as well (to hopefully avoid frustration for both engineering and customers later that day). Ultimately, the Jet Blue site would not print out the pass after all my repearted attempts (it was asking for some kind of code for that particular computer that was not supplied or I didn't figure out) so the whole process proved a frustration. 6) I filled out a review card at the hotel before I left AND also an online form sent to me a couple weeks later. I have, as of yet, NEVER received any comment from the hotel regarding some of the frustrations we experienced (it is now 7/27/08 - almost 2 months later - I waited to see if they would send me some consolation - even just a few words - but nothing).", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood example of a Westin\u201d", "Author": "AstroJunq", "ReviewID": "UR18243961", "Content": "This hotel has a great downtown location, a beautiful lobby, very nice rooms and pleasant staff.

No matter what city...or even country... you are in, you step into a Westin room and you have to look out the window to remind yourself where you are. This is not necessarily a bad thing. When you are traveling on business (which this visit to the Westin San Diego was), it is nice to have some place familiar to hang your hat. You have your Heavenly Bed with upteen pillows and your Heavenly Bath with a double shower head (too bad the water pressure wasn't double, too). What was different about this Westin was the 32-inch flat screen LCD television with several HD channels that left me craving digital when I returned home. What wasn't different was the sporatic wireless Internet connection. And what wasn't different was the overpriced onsite restaurant with the same menu as room service. Trust me, this gets tedious if you are staying in a hotel more than two nights and you can't get out to find a decent restaurant. There is a Ralph's grocery store a few blocks away if you want to cut the cost and buy your own snacks. Be forewarned there are no refridgerators in the room (although you can improvise with the in room snack center). The Westin San Diego is in a great downtown location. They provide a free airport shuttle (ten minutes away) and you are a few blocks from the waterfront, Gas Town and Little Italy. And it is in San Diego after all, one of the most beautiful American cities. There is a decent (but small) workout room and equally small and odd shaped outdoor pool that is adjacent to the conference rooms (so don't expect privacy if you are sunbathing). All in all the Westin San Diego is a decent place to stay if you are on business and someone else is footing the bill. If you are on vacation, I'd opt for something different.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murrysville, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNot What You Would Expect from Westin\u201d", "Author": "tzinnca", "ReviewID": "UR13215780", "Content": "This hotel is below expectations for a Westin. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during a business trip. The location is good for walking to San Diego's business district, and plenty of restaurants and shopping are nearby. I would recommend this hotel to business travelers, but not for vacationers. Below Average: Valet Service is poor for the heafty $27.00/night. The bathroom was small and the drains were clogged. Elevators were very slow. The decor was odd - very modern furniture in a very outdated room. Hallways are narrow and confustng to navigate. Good Points: Location. Friendly Service.

Check-in was beyond slow as there was just one person working the front desk when we, along with a throng of others, arrived early on a Sunday afternoon. We were given a corner room on the 18th floor which came with a window facing downtown, and a window facing the Coronado Bridge--not bad. The room was a little tight but there was more than enough storage space for everything. The room looked newly updated, nice calming color scheme, flat screen tv, very cozy and comfortable. The bathroom was an odd set-up--the sink area was to the left of the room, out in the open, while the tub and toilet were in a closet sized room of their own with a none too handy pocket door. We really did not like this at all. There was room for very little movement in this room, no place to hang towels except for the shower rod and one small hook. The tub and toilet were so close together that towels hanging from said rod were in the way. I don't know how the cleaning folks work in that tight space but they seemed to manage quite well given the cleanliness of it all. We had dinner in the restaurant one night it poured rain and friends we were with didn't want to go out. Others had the same idea and the restaurant was understaffed, clearly not expecting the crowd they served that night, but given the circumstancs I think they rallied well and the food was good. We've been to San Diego before and while we prefer to stay closer to the water (Sea Port Village, Coronado) we liked the location as we could walk almost everywhere....in fact, we did. However, I would stay here again only if we had to for another meeting. The hotel offers complimentary shuttle service to / from the airport and the staff we encountered at this hotel were professional, helpful and very friendly.", "Date": "January 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNear Perfection\u201d", "Author": "MDFreqTvlr", "ReviewID": "UR12993254", "Content": "I booked before it opened with a little trepidation, but the rate was too good to pass up.
