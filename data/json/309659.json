The hotel is very modern looking but not spectacular in any way although it is very clean. The Reception staff is very efficient and friendly and within 10 minutes of entering the hotel I was in my room. The room was quite spacious with a large bed, a bath and shower, a large screen TV with a few English language channels, and, most importantly - on the 3rd floor!!; more on that later. The room was very clean and had daily servicing and towel exchange. There is WiFi internet available (not free) but the reception in my room was either poor or unworkable depending on time of day. A number of times I even walked out of the room onto the corridor with my laptop to get enough signal to load a page. Eventually I took to going for a coffee downstairs while I checked my emails. The cost of the internet is AED 15 for 30 minutes or AED 25 for 1 hour. There are other options but my patience wouldn't survive longer than an hour with their system. Be warned - if you log off whilst still in credit you lose the lot. There is no carry forward of credit. Within the hotel there are a number of eating options available. Meals are available all day at the Harbour cafe in the foyer and are very nice. There are also Indian and Chinese restaurants on the top floor, each with live music till the early hours. The hotel also provides a salon for the ladies. In addition there is a nightclub called 'Marines' which is accessed on the ground floor but is actually on a mezzanine level. This has an excellent rock band playing every night from 10pm - 3am but be aware it has a lot of working girls in there so you may not want to go with your mother. With the noise from the restaurants on the 7th floor and Marines rock band on the mezzanine all playing till 3am you can see why I made reference to living on the 3rd floor as being a good idea. A room above the Reception desk is even better as all the noise is from the other side of the hotel. It will make the difference to sleeping or not if you are not out till 3am yourself.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, food not\u201d", "Author": "Robert O", "ReviewID": "UR123342090", "Content": "Its a nice and clean hotel.

There is a night club and speciality restaurants and like any hotel in Dubai, if you are a male on your own the chances are someone might try and pick you up, but like looking in a shop window, dont buy if you dont want to!

So I was furious at the service. We got an extra bed in our friends room and had to stay there. Breakfast was ordinary. Not many options.

We were warmly greeted by the lovely reception and were impressed by the friendly welcoming staff. We soon checked into our room and I wasn't highly impressed. The rooms were very basic and instead of the 'sea view' we were promised, the view outside our window was a huge grey old building under construction work and a half grown garden. This was extremely disappointing. The hotel was very clean, the bed covers and toilets were cleaned everyday despite not having put out the 'please clean my room' sign. Room service was generally good, although speaking to the hotel staff via telephone could be difficult on the odd occassion as 1.- No one would answer your call and 2.- You would have to repeat yourself 2 or 3 times to get what you want. I didn't particulary like the location of the hotel however, they ran free shutter buses that dropped and picked you up to and from Jumeriah beach. The only down point about that was the timing! It was from 10.30am- 2.30pm. This was not enough time to spend at the beach! The breakfast was lovely! They had a variety of food and lots of prefences to chose from! On a down point, I was spoken to very rudely by an arab gentleman telling me I was late for breakfast (at 10am) where as infact breakfast closed at 10:30am! I Then only to find out that he was the owner of the hotel!- extremely rude! I agree with all the comments regarding the noise from nightclubs and how expensive the hotel taxi is! It is cheaper to get a normal taxi. I would recommend this hotel for people who intend to stay for a couple of days- mainly for business use (although the noise from the nightclub would contradict this).

(I had read a few reviews before I went, and deliberately asked for a room above the 5th Floor-as to avoid the noise!!), I had a nice room facing the port, on the 6th floor. This I thought would be fine. WRONG......there is a great Indian restaurant on the 7th floor, well worth a visit for the food alone. They also have around 8 dancers, some of which were hysterical to watch dance, as they seemed to be totally bored, and danced out of sync with the band\\(who were excellent). There was an ageing Julio Igleseas asian singer who tried to gee them up. but most were having none of it. Very funny. BUT, the music was so loud, that you could hardly hear yourself think, and because of the proximity of my room, found myself watching TV everynight till 3am when eventually the hotel became quiet(ish)!! - I had hoped to get some good nights sleep, because I have had insomnia for a few weeks before going, and found if I had a Siesta between 6-8, I could actually get a nap without fear of hearing Bangla drums rattling round inside my head :) Great for the party lover, but the hotel is geared towards the buisness man - so I was slightly surprised at the noise levels. On the plus side. I have to say I found the food in all the restaurants very good, and the staff, especially Samir (in the Lounge bar) - who was always very attentive and friendly, as were the 2 young girls, and lads under his watchful eye. When you travel alone it's alwys good to have a friendly face about the place, and virtually at every turn I found the staff here to be excellent. I found the price of alcohol a little on the high side, but gather it's like that all over Dubai so can't complain too much. My room was always clean and tidy. The AC worked a dream which was a plus, and I used both Room Service and the laundry service and had no problems in either area. The 'Shish' reaturant on the roof was very good, with very pleasant surroundings, having the pool right in the centre (if you chose to dine alfresco) and again friendly attentive staff, who made you feel very welcome, even a little on the flirty side, which wasn't offensive :) The pool is a little on the small side, but is great to relax by during the day, and read a book, have a drink (9-4!!)and take in the sun. Again the roof top life guards (they have to mbe there whilst someone is by/in the pool!! were very talkative and friendly. So on the whole a good experience, which I'm already thinking of repeating next year around this time to catch the IPL cricket finals, which our friendly bar staff had great delight in expalining to me.

We arrived at the airport and were greeted by a driver, when we got to the hotel we were told we couldn\u2019t check in until 2pm (which we already knew).

I not sure about lunch or dinner as we never ate there, but it always looked busy. The room was lovely, it was big and clean. Housekeeping was excellent, we always came back to a lovely clean room the bathroom was a good size and was clean. The hotel does have a club which can be heard from in side the hotel but it wasn\u2019t enough to keep us awake and once in our room we couldn\u2019t heard anything. The location of the hotel might be a issue for some people, for us it wasn\u2019t as there are taxis available from right outside the hotel (and the door man is more then happy to stop one for you) but if your planning on spending most of your holiday on the beach then I suggest you book a hotel in Jumeriah.

The other reviews are correct in saying that the intenet photos of the hotel are not in fact the reality, and the hotel does seem somewhat smaller than the pictures suggest - as does the pool. Other reviews are also right when explaining that the hotel is rather noisy. There are three nightclubs throughout the hotel and we were placed on the floor with the arabian bar (open till 3.30am). Now dont get me wrong, you can hear the music slightly (well rather the bass) but this did not at any time keep me awake, it just irritated me at times at the most. If we found we were getting irritated by the noise, well - if you cant beat em join em - and we would just go in for a beer. There is also the hotels location. Its right by the docks and you really have to get taxi's everywhere and its not central to any of the attractions of dubai. Taxi's are cheap however and the door man only too happy to flag you one down. Plus points are that its a very clean hotel, the staff are really really friendly and the food/drink nice. If you are thinking about catching the free shuttle to 'jumeirah beach' though do not bother. They just drop you at the nearest part of the beach to them and tell you they will come back for you a few hours later. What they dont tell you is that this is the middle of nowhere, there are no shops or anywhere you can get a drink from (in that kinda heat rather important id say!) and its right near the building works that are taking place in the ocean. There are also no taxi's nearby so its kinda torturous!. Also, and most importantly, this is a public beach. A lot of the beach in dubai is private owned by hotels which you can use for a small fee at the hotel reception (the jumeriah beach hotel in particular is excellent). Travelling as two females on our own, and then being taken to a private beach and left there was a little odd - we were actually being videod at one point (and we were not scantily clad in the least). If you have a little more money to spend then i would recommend staying at one of the beachfront hotels, and like i said the jumeriah beach hotel in particular is lovely. In fact, we normally ended up getting a taxi down there every day and paying a fee so we could use their facilities. Also the Madinat is a beautiful hotel and well worth a visit - especially their spa 'six senses'.
