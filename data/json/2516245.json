Leading up to my stay I was very excited about staying here because the website gives the impression this is a luxurious resort. The Meritage is actually right next to an industrial park and a highway. The location definitely does not bring to mind respite. The photos on the website disguise this fact. Notwithstanding the location, I still think the grounds look nice. However, this is undermined by the fact the staff put cost over service. I have multiple examples that just made me feel The Meritage is either financially strapped or plain ole cheap. There is a \"resort fee\". At check-in I clarified what this $20.00 per day fee covered and I was told it covered \"wine, water, parking, wi-fi, the pool and fitness center.\" I am staying four nights. So, $80.00 is actually providing me with one bottle of their wine label wine (??), eight bottles of Deer Park water, parking (which you need I guess since you are in the middle of nowhere), wi-fi access (which technically does not cost extra to the resort for guests to use), and the pool. The fitness center, which is clearly advertised on their website, is not open and you actually have to go to a neighboring resort to use their fitness center. The resort fee is unfortunately common, but what really rubbed me was the fact that I was overcharged for things that simply should not cost. Guests are given a bottle of water when they check in. So, when I was waiting in the lobby for a meeting and started choking (non-life threatening), I asked the front desk for some water because the nearby bar was crowded. I was told it would cost $2.00. Infuriating. On another occasion I went to the restaurant for a cup of coffee. $3.50 plus tax! That is insane. A couple of other things that made the stay unpleasant is the lack of accommodation given the fact they are undergoing a lot of construction. The concierge staff also was not aware of where our large group was meeting. The walls are also thin. So, I could hear the people upstairs walk around and shower. I would certainly not stay here if it was my choice.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Avondale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cNew feel, nice grounds.\u201d", "Author": "S E", "ReviewID": "UR129140688", "Content": "This property is six years old so has a new feel to it, there is a large expansion of the resort in progress which will include a fitness center.

What a grand facility. Everything was perfect. We were treated like royalty. I cannot say enough. If you call him, my husband will not stop raving to you about how wonderful everything was. We live in San Ramon CA and have visited Hawaii, Arizona, Oregon, Anaheim, Donatello, Opera House, Fisherman's Wharf, Seattle and lots more of the Shell sites in the last 8 years, but this was the best. Just a 45 minute drive to the Garden of Eden and we are just now finding out about it. We spent the entire day on 03/30/2012 in the Spa. It was my birthday and we had a couples exfoliation, massage and lunch in the Spa with Victoria giving us great service. Francisco tended to my husband's every wish and the therapists were remarkable (Jennifer, Edith, et al). We spent 7 hours in there. All of the women at the spa front desk went overboard and killed us with kindness. Caitlin put together the couples package for us two days before on the phone and we were very happy with what she did. We went to dinner in Yountville at Bistro Jeantry and returned for room service by Ulrecht (from Haiti) who sang Happy Birthday to me in French and presented a chocolate cake with a candle that he lit. We had decafs with it (great coffee in the rooms, by the way, not any cheap stuff!) We went to sleep with a movie on one of five free Starz channels. We woke up to room service breakfast and went to Saturday 8:30 am Mass in the Chapel. What a splendid facility and the visiting priest from Chicago was so warm and caring. My husband did the readings to the sparse congregation. (Perhaps you could advertise it better in the hotel, as we were the only ones there for Palm Sunday Mass on Saturday at 5:30.) After morning Mass we went back to the spa for another day of lazing around doing nothing but sauna, steam, relax, massage, facial Bellisima, lunch, champagne, pampering, apples, tea, sauna, spa, relax. We walked back to the room in our robes and got ready for Palm Sunday Mass and then ate at the Siena. Rafael gave us fantastic service from 8:00 to 10:30 as he catered to our every desire bringing us appetizers and pairing wines to every dish. He was great and so was the food. The manager came by and talked with us and we complained about Yelpers together. We got a free DVD and popcorn from the front desk and had a nightcap in bed after spending time in the spa in the room. We had a hard time waking up on Sunday and finally made it back to Bistro Jeantry for a lunch from 2:30 to 5:00 and back to the Meritage when we realized that we had yet to visit a winery. So we went the the Trinitas on the property and closed the place down and walked back to the room for another night of DVDs, popcorn room service and heaven. The very best part of all: we hadn't been on vacation for a while, so we converted our points to Spa dollars and Dining dollars.

We found the beds uncomfortable as described in other reviews. The windows overlooking the pool were dirty (dirt, water stains, bird droppings) and didn't allow us to enjoy the view of the pool. Our room also provided us with a view of the back side of the property where the hotel GM and other staff members would stand and smoke cigarettes while they watched the construction project go on next door. One morning I watched the hotel GM smoke his cigarette, put it out on the ground, and then kick the cigarette butt into the flower bed. Nice touch. I know it was the GM because I saw him later in the stay and I asked the staff who he was. Back to the room; when set on cool, the A/C fan made a noise so we just slept with the windows open. Siena made for a poor dining experience. The staffing levels were poor (as stated in other reviews) and the service skills of the staff were worse. Unfortunately, we had the same server for breakfast two days in a row. Both days, she poured coffee on the floor as she wrote down our order. The spills stayed on the floor during the meals.

It was awesome the 2 times we went. We also had fantastic meals at Cyrus and the Wine Spectator Restaurant at CIA. My wife did enjoy the spa treatment. In my opinion, they call it a \"resort\" so they can charge a \"resort fee\". It has a bar, a restaurant, and room service. It has a pool and a hot tub. There is a spa.

Except for really good tomato soup, the food at the restaurant was average though the price was reasonable so it wasn't all that bad. We were there on Groupon making it a really good deal. Full price puts it on the expensive side. Two problems. The first was a function of my expectations. I thought that since it was at a vineyard it would be charming. Instead, it was a bigger resort accessed through an industrial park. The second was we were told to go to the concierge for a free gift which was a wine-tasting pass for two along with some good information about the sights. It ended with an offer to sit through a time-share pitch. I am pretty good at resisting so they backed off but I did find it bothersome.

What was frustrating is that we were standing at the desk for a fairly respectable amount of time and she did not acknowledge us.

This was evident due to our crumbs from breakfast were still in the sheets.

However, the hotel/resort did provide a shuttle to take people to downtown Napa between the hours of 4-10:30.

Ok, so the ambiance was lacking, but we decided to make due. We went down to talk to the concierge and got the worst service ever! Greg, the concierge, was so weirdly rude I was almost convinced it was an act. Although he was mildly helpful, he rushed through the information and seemed only interested in selling you things the hotel had partnerships with. Including this freaking time-share. The cave area was ok, tho they only carry the wine the hotel owner produces. Another indication that they are NOT interested in the best service for you, but selling you products that make them more money. Oh and Greg was not the only rude concierge (it seems like a pre-requisite to being hire there is \"do you hate people and life?\" \"hired!\") We came down around 5:30 to get the free shuttle and this lady is sitting in front of her computer, ignores us for a few minutes, this was our interaction: Us - \"Hi, we want to take the shuttle to downtown Napa for dinner\" Lady - \"yeah 6pm\" (doesn't even look up) Us - \"Do you recommend any restaurants? Lady - \"you don't have a reservation!!!\" (rolls her eyes) \"good luck\" (turns back to computer an ignores us. WTF!

It is in a commercial area which is strange driving in, but once you're on-property it's fine. Our initial room was in the Merlot building. Gorgeous, spacious suite with an outdoor patio. Fridge, microwave, washer-dryer, the works. Only one problem. No Wi-Fi. Since the building is pretty new I am sure they will offer Wi-Fi in the future but no Internet access, for a business traveler, simply doesn't work. Long story short, we're moved to a new room in the main building. Nice-sized room, but no microwave nor patio. Great view of the pool, vines, and entrance to the Trinitas wine cave. And, with Wi-Fi, a superb room indeed. Side note here: the staff is phenomenal. Manny at the bell desk was not only absolutely helpful in bringing all of our luggage from one room to the next, he also was kind enough to go retrieve some toiletries I'd left behind in the first room due to not being able to focus because the fire alarm was going off inside the whole Merlot building (story for another time, but it wasn't me. Honestly). The bar in the main building (don't know if it has a name, just off the lobby on the left-hand side), true to form, provided excellent service. Our server was there whenever we wanted to order another round, or dinner, but never hovered. Nor did she appear so busy that we were forgotten, and the place got pretty busy as the World Series was being broadcast on the telly above the bar. Room-service breakfast: we each ordered the Eggs Meritage. Like Benedict, but atop a disc of polenta. Again, great staff interaction - they were friendly to a fault and let us know exactly how long it would be before our food arrived. Great folks you have, Meritage, hopefully you pay them well. Breakfast was good - not phenomenal, but overall 3 stars. The Trinitas wine cave: there was a special business function in the wine cave where three local wineries were offering tasting - the cave is gorgeously lit and very cozy, considering its size. Great venue. There was a special dinner afterward for thirty folks (no invite for me) and the long table, set with snow-white linens, glistening flatware and glassware and gorgeous tapered candles looked striking. What an amazing spot for a special dinner! Perhaps next time... Room-service dinner: I ordered a green salad, Steak Frites and Jack Daniels bread pudding. Green salad: good stuff - mostly greens, few beet chunks, few halved cherry tomatoes. Nice light dressing. Steak Frites: holy hell. Gooooood stuff. I am a meat elitist and turn my nose up at anything that even hints at fat and gristle. This hunk 'o' meat was perfectly prepared, sliced, and honest to goodness, I completely cleaned my plate. The frites: thin, perfectly cooked, some were translucent in all their glory. Wow. The only disappointment was the bread pudding. On the dry side, it could have used about 5x the sauce. I tasted apricots. I tasted good bread pudding egginess. I did NOT, however, taste Jack Daniel's. Anywhere near the plate. No hint of bourbon warmth, nothing whatsoever. If I'd know I was going to get plain old bread pudding, I would've gone with the chocolate. Argh. I know that dessert can be iffy for a kitchen as it is overall omitted from the meal, but for those of us dessert-lovers, it can make or break the meal. It is, literally, the last thing your patrons are going to taste before they leave your restaurant and as such, it needs to be \"holy-crap-I-want-to-wallow-in-this\" good. My bread pudding was lacking. Things to keep in mind: this location is not Napa-proper. It's south of the general \"Napa\" area and not really centrally located to anything other than the industrial park. That said, these folks did a great job with the location they chose. From our third-floor room, the view is nothing but big, azure pool, wine cave, and vines as far as you can see.

The other desk staff were very nice and helpful, particularly with the free DVD rental and nitely popcorn. The room itself was OK. Spacious enough and with a pleasant view of the pool and viewyards. The very unforgiving bed left a lot to be desired, though, and I did not get a good night sleep either of the nights i was there. I would have like a tub to soaked, but I was assigned a room with a shower, even thought the website said the rooms came with tubs. Bathrobes, room safe, refrigerator, dvd player (with no ff or skip capability) and 32\" flat screen were useful. Oh, and the towels were thick and comfy. Coffee maker in the room, tho housekeeping did not replenish the coffee the second day. There is free coffee and tea downstairs in the morning, which left me coffee less in the evening.

Our view from the window was off the pool area and vineyard. The room had everything you need; fridge, which had complimentary water, a coffee pot, cups, coffee, wine glasses, opener, and a complimentary bottle of wine. There were thick terry robes, plenty of towels. There were double sinks and the toilet was in its own room w a door. The shower was large w great water pressure. However, the shower-head must have been 7 ft high & when you are 4'11\", is problematic trying to reach, but if you are tall you will LOVE it. The robe hook was just as high and the sinks felt higher than the norm....which is just an observation. They include a hairdryer and even cotton balls and swabs. We ate breakfast at the Sienna one monring. The prices were moderate and the wait staff were great. One morning we wanted the newspaper and in minutes the paper was at our door. We visited the bar a couple of times and each time the staff were friendly and attentive, however prices a little high. 1-bottle of Lagunitas IPA, and a cup of tea was $13. They have a beautiful pool area, a cave w Spa facilities, & wine tasting room. Because they are a bit of a drive from downtown Napa, they have a FREE shuttle starting @ 5pm and leaves every 1/2 hour until 10. The only thing we did not like was the concierge. We approached them to help with a place for dinner on our second night. All they focused on was they had been \"trying to reach us\" \"they have this promotion\" \"when are we leaving\".....well the shuttle arrived and we had to leave....without any names of places for dinner. After we checked out and were walking out the concierge again jumped to the \"oh just checking in\"? \"we have these promotions\". We said nope we just checked out.

Both mornings I ordered room service for him, and was told there was an hour's wait. When I explained his medical situation, his food arrived within minutes. Amazing! My husband and I arrived at the hotel early on a Friday morning to visit with family, and planned to check in at 4:00. The front office staff found a room that was ready and we were able to check in before noon. And we were in a room just down the hall from my father's! Staff members on every level seem to genuinely enjoy working at the resort. It was refreshing to walk through the beautifully appointed resort and receive gracious smiles from everyone. Free coffee service in the morning was delightful! I didn't have time to take advantage of the spa in the caves, but being local, I plan to secure a massage appointment soon.

Arriving late in the afternoon we got there just in time for the free wine tasting offered in the wine cave at 5 pm. Along with the wine tasting was unlimited amounts of gourmet cheeses, fruits, and crackers. It appeared as much tasting as one would like to do was accommodated. Back at the room we were given a wonderful bottle of red wine that is now one of our favorites and we will look for this wine for purchase in our home state. Two bottles of complimentary water are left in the refrigerator for guests each day and valet parking is free (or should I say included in your $15 a day resort fee). Our room was lovely, every inch decorated beautifully and not one speck of dust or anything out of place. Our bed was comfortable and the pillows just right! The furniture was lovely, the closet and bathroom space were more than ample. I particularly loved finding this hotel is savvy enough to accommodate women by providing a wall mounted magnifying make-up mirror in the bathroom- WOW. We opted for no view thus had the new building under construction outside our window but we weren't in our room much and we didn't hear any particularly unsettling noise from it. I LOVED getting up each morning and walking the paths around the vineyards and my husband found it easy to use the business center with free internet. The food in the restaurant was very good, we had my daughter's rehearsal dinner there and everyone was very happy with our entrees, especially the sea bass. The downside if any is that the gorgeous but very large wooden doors used to enter the double sinked bathroom shower area and then one more to enter the private commode area seem a bit in the way but doable to work around. I was confused why the shower fan was in the private commode instead of the large room accommodating the shower and it came on everytime one used the commode and it was loud enough to be annoying for those brief moments. To keep the bathroom steam free we left the bathroom door open to the bedroom area. I would stay there again in a heartbeat and would recommend it to friends. The shampoos, soaps, and lotions provided were butter based, very nice. It is only a short drive to downtown Napa and on into the wine country. The office park setting made zero difference to staying at this resort other than entering through it to find the resort. Some of our wedding party stayed next door at the Vino Bello when the Meritage became sold out and it was lovely too.

Although the photos make it look spectacular, its in the middle of an industrial park, far enough away from the luxuries that Napa has to offer, however the hotel does run a shuttle service until 10:30pm @ night. When we arrived, we were told to see the concierge for our 'welcome package'. This 'welcome package' was actually a sales pitch for a timeshare option and if we joined a 90 minute meeting, they would give us a trip to Hawaii, etc. We thought it was a totally bizarre way for them to start us off at the hotel. No directions were provided as to where anything was. Room was spacious but we didn't realize it until the next day that they had booked us into a handicap room (which we didn't need). The shower and the makeup mirror were oddly strange heights. When we attempted to call down to discuss, we were kept on hold for almost 10 minutes and finally when someone answered, we were told a manager would speak with us...it is now day 3 and we still haven't heard from the manager and we've been to the front desk 3 times to complain about other issues we've had here. The customer service is lacking - although they are courteous and willing to help, they never actually resolve anything at all. We had booked a car service for the day and when they arrived to our hotel, they were told that we were not listed with the hotel as guests. When we discussed this with the front desk, again we were told management would get back to us and still nothing. They did offer to look into changing our room and suggested we pack up our stuff before we were to head out for the day, but due to the staff suggesting to our wine tour service that we were not registered here, we were unable to gather our items before we left since we were late. Also every time we tried to call the concierge from our room, we were directed to another guest's room who was getting call after call looking for the front desk. Obviously some glitches they need to work through. If you want a hotel that caters to large conference groups, this is the spot to go to. Its a nicely decorated Holiday Inn. With so many places to stay in Napa, keep doing your research unless you're into this kind of hotel. Not worth the value - spa is grossly over-priced and they also charge a resort fee daily which, given there are no immenities that warrant it. They even charge an additional fee of $25 to use the water therapies at the spa - which is a joke. Although the spa is nice, the writeup of what is available makes it sound over the top. This is a hotel posing as a resort. Don't be fooled. The beds are also lumpy and way too soft. When I went to the spa for a massage, my therapist told me that the number one complaint from guests is the mattress and poor sleep due to terrible mattress quality. This place is over-rated and over-priced for what you get and the location.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Millbrae, California", "Title": "\u201cA luxury hotel away from traffic\u201d", "Author": "Margaret M", "ReviewID": "UR117294951", "Content": "We loved the setting.

We booked through Hotwire for a fair price (after the taxes and resort fee are added). Upon arrival, Jonathan at the front desk informed us we were being upgraded to a deluxe room with patio. I asked about the huge construction project going on next door and was informed they don't commence work until 9 AM. When we arrived at the room, we realized were assigned a double queen with a balcony overlooking the full construction project (now wondering what we would have had if we were not upgraded). A couple minutes after our arrival at the room, Jonathan at the front desk called and asked what we thought of the room. I informed him that I thought we would be assigned a king bed as I am 6' 6\" and a queen would not work for my wife and I. After being on hold for a couple minutes, he stated they were out of king rooms and reiterated that construction does not begin until 9. Jonathan informed us the concierge had a gift for us.

We left and drove into Napa to get batter service. Spent over $ 400.00 at the Spa, the attendants in the dressing rooms were great, however no hot water in the showers and only comment form front desk we are working on it and we will take a little off you bill, still have not seen that. Went to the restaurant for breakfast, waited 10 minutes to be seated, again very few people eating at tables most of the tables were empty but still had dirty dishes on them. After being seated took 15 minutes to get have our order taken, then another 30 minutes for the food. This was a simple breakfast not full meals. Service very slow and not customer focused. We decided to go to the wine tasting room. All over the hotel were notes (even on the room key) go to wine tasting 2 for 1 if you are staying at the hotel. The next day I noticed out invoice and they changed us for two wine tastings. I went to the front desk to ask about this and the front desk said\u2026\u201d I can print your invoice and you can walk over there and ask them why they charged your wrong\u201d, once again lack of customer focus.

It is well worth paying $20 more to have a beautiful view than the standard rooms that have limited views by getting a Superior Room with a view of the vineyards or the pool. From the time that we entered the resort with a cozy elegant lobby and smelled the wood burning in the lobby and watching everyone relaxing with a glass of wine we knew that we were going to have a good time. I typically have to bring my plastic wine glasses, wine and cork screw to a hotel but was pleasantly surprised when there was a bottle of complementary Trinitas Wine waiting for us with wine glasses. That was a very nice touch! There were 2 complimentary bottles of water and two cokes in the refrigerator. It was so nice to have a hotel not charge you $5 for water. I love that it had a refrigerator since we had brought some cheese and fresh fruits to enjoy at our wine tours in the picnic areas. Apparently they had a complimentary reception with drinks around 5pm but we had checked in much later so we opened the bottle, enjoyed our wine, then put on our robe to go to the Jacuzzi. Even though it was raining a little we enjoyed our romantic time in the Jacuzzi that was about 100 F much warmer than typical Jacuzzi\u2019s that are around 80F. The d\u00e9cor was very unique instead of the cheesy picture frames there was a vineyard metal on the wall and the headboard had a vintage look. Everything was very clean and modern looking, the bathrooms, carpets... The only comment I have is that the bathroom door opened in an odd way that is because my father is an architect so I noticed. The complementary hotel shuttle took us to the restaurant that we picked in Yountville and after we were done we called the shuttle and they picked us up which was great because we were all able to drink and not have to worry about driving, parking or finding a cab. We walked up the vineyards the next day which was pretty cool as not too many places allow you to just wander around. We took some awesome pictures. It was cool to enter into a cave for some wine tasting knowing that the vineyards were above us. We took advantage of our 2 for 1 special on the hotel keys and tasted some great wines. We even played a game of bocce ball which was cool. We did not manage to enjoy the huge fire pit area as it was raining the night that we came. We thoroughly enjoyed our Sunday Brunch to our surprise it only cost $21 and included 2 eggs any style and our jus, tea, coffee and hot milk. The was plenty of fresh fruits, eggs benedict, French toast, different prosciutto and cold cuts, salmon, deserts and their croissants must have been from a real French Bakery. Everyone at the hotel accommodated all our needs to make sure that we were going to have an unforgettable time from the receptionists, concierge, room service, and restaurant. We asked for champagne glasses and they brought it for us. Self Parking was free which was great. All the wineries are quite some distant apart that is just the way Napa is laid out due to the wineries and the hilly locations to be able to grow the optimal grapes. I would rate the hotel as 5 stars for location, hospitality, cleanliness, value, service, facility, views and fabulous rooms. I can understand if you select a room with limited or no view facing the parking lot if you pay the minimum but that is the case with any hotel anywhere in the world. But as a guest at the hotel you can still enjoy the great view by walking the grounds and using the facility. I was there with my girlfriend and my sister who just got engaged she had a separate room with her fianc\u00e9 with a balcony room facing the pool. Absolutely breathtaking!

Those pictures were taken at cleverly placed angles to make you \"think\" you're looking at a spectacular place to get away. The truth...It is nestled not in a valley, but in a business park! There is a \"small\" vineyard on the back hillside, but above that is a highway, and to the side of the resort is another highway.

Beyond that was a basic room...nothing that made you feel \"special\". The complimentary bottle of wine that came with the room was simply placed on the counter next to the coffee maker and ice bucket with a presentation that was no different than a complimentary bottle of water.

Beyond that was an ugly, fenced construction site, complete with a green fence, bright yellow temporary power poles, a dirt lot, heavy equipment, and a new building under construction. Beyond that was the business park, and several large satellite dishes. If we craned our necks to the left, we could see the end of the vineyard, and the cars passing on the highway above.
