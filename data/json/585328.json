{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Finally, a place that doesn't nickle and dime you! I have stayed in that hotel on numerous occasions and it is now my favorite due to ample free parking on the street (once in a while, it's full, but not often) since it is in an uncrowded part of Frankfurt. Although it is a little far from the touristy parts of the city, I've come to appreciate its quietness as well as the abundance of amenities. Free Wi-Fi comes to mind.Breakfast was 18 Euros, pretty reasonable among 3 star hotels, but this Movenpick is a 4 star hotel. The breakfast was absolutely delicious, with mushrooms, hash browns, sausage, wide variety of pastries, juice, eggs, and more.It is one of the newer hotels and the furnishing's pretty new, although a tad bit IKEA-ish. The television offers quite a few channels, including Arabic and British.If you are not driving, I would not really recommend this hotel, but if you're driving, then by all means, this hotel IS IT!", "Date": "Dec 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR140426059", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "klort"}, {"Content": "unless you are working in the fairgrounds... nice but far from everything only neutral from my side because of the very poor location (even worse than Marriott or Marritim)yes it is in the city centre but in order to reach any kind of facility like restaurant or shopping area you need to walk around the Festhalle complex (hotel is behind the fairgrounds and there absolutely nothing around!!!) The nearest area with shops and restaurants is 2km away. From the U4 station you need to walk ca. 500m (a problem if you have heavy laguage).Hotel itself is new (2005) modern and stylish decor even I'd miss a Sauna or Pool for a real 4* experience. We got it for 40 EUR/night excl. BF at priceline which is adequate (not even a real special deal as you get similar rates for low season in Frankfurt around 45 EUR incl. BF) - 250 EUR (normal rates) are too much for this hotel far from the scene!!Conclusion: not recommended even for 40 EUR/night - take a hotel closer to restaurants and shops", "Date": "Dec 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR111296580", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "joe1968"}, {"Content": "Clean, Modern, Enjoyable       Room", "Date": "Dec 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR478278447", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "cheesage"}, {"Content": "Clean, newer hotel; fine for one-night stay As there was a major tradeshow in Frankfurt during our initial one night layover in Frankfurt, it was very difficult to find any reasonably priced lodging (i.e. clean, somewhat comfortable). We ended up paying a little over $200 USD (includes the extra taxes, fees) for the one night stay (exchange rates very volatile this year-2008, so won't mention rate in Euros). This was prepaid, as Priceline requires.The hotel room was large for European standards, and as mentioned in other reviews, the bathroom and the room's modern, sleek look are nice. The architecture of the building itself is not to die for, but it does not matter; its deep red/burgundy exterior color made it easier to locate if you're walking from the train station (it's a good 10-15 minute walk depending upon which route...). At the time, there was a big empty lot opposite the main entrance of the hotel and a circus show was being held. The staff were friendly enough. We did not try the restaurant or buffet as we were in for the night and out early the next morning.However, the elevators are very small; if people were traveling with a lot of luggage, you might only fit two people in at a time. No complaints other than plan ahead and avoid arriving or departing Frankfurt during peak trade shows so you won't have to pay exorbitant hotel prices. That being said, the priceline price was less than half the rate being quoted by the hotel and other travel websites for the same night; neighboring hotels all had increased prices.", "Date": "Nov 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR760305544", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "yong111en"}, {"Content": "A Great Stay First of all, I booked this hotel through Priceline (name your own price) and ended up paying $40 US for a great room.

The rooms were spotless and had all the amenities I would expect of a 4 star. I've stayed at the Marriot up the street on Priceline bids and it too is great, however I wasn't disappointed after staying at the Movenpick for the first time. I appreciated the comfortable bed, the larger than normal bathroom, the water pressure of the shower, the refridgerator that actually had room for store-bought items. About the only drawback is the distance from the U-Bahn station (Festhalle/Messe) in the case of inclement weather.

Reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly with advice, maps etc.We paid just 59 euros a room which is unbelievable value for this hotel - breakfast (hot and cold buffet - well stocked) was an additional 15.50 euros each.The hotel is obviously very new, clean and modern. WIFI only really worked properly in one room but that was good enough for our needs.We booked two double rooms, one came with just a shower, the other with bath and shower. I'm sure if it bothered my parents, they could have moved to another room but it was not an issue for them as they prefer showers.Walking to town is not a problem - less than 20 minutes, although taxis, tram and metro are all an option very close to the hotel. The location around the hotel is very quiet. We stayed on a Saturday night. The immediate area houses a large exhibition centre and a number of other hotels. We thought we would eat local and not knowing the area well and having a fruitless 10 minute stroll, opted for the hotel restaurant.Turned out to be an excellent choice. On offer was a hot buffet or full choice a la carte. Both excellent value.We opted for the a la carte and everything ordered was very well presented and cooked perfectly. Being a hotel, international cusine was on offer as well as specialist Austrian dishes (due to the hotel chain origins). We had a mixture of both between us with no complaints at all.Parking cost us 27 euros for approx 25 hours - although we did notice after pulling into the hotel car park there are free spaces available in surrounding street - if you are lucky therefore it can be free.The wife used the gym on Sunday morning and had it to herself. It was pretty small but had the usual equipment and, of course, due to the newness of the hotel, everything was working and clean.Overall, we found the staff, cleanliness and location (as it didn't rain and we like a stroll) excellent.
