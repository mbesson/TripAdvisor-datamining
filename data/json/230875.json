Hotel's location was perfect, close enough to the train station by a short taxi ride and a quick walk from the centre of the canals and restaurant hub of Amsterdam. Rooms were large and very well appointed. Beds very comfortable. The welcome sweets were also a nice touch. Staff were all very friendly breakfast could get very busy so was best to go early or order room service, especially if tour groups are in house. Conference rooms were located in an adjacent building but very accessible. Bar staff were amazing - espeically when we were still hungry and the kitchen had closed, the cheese and mustard was amazing, am now addicted.

It was challenging for us to find places for our bags, and we ended up having to place a few items on the only chair/table in the room. It was downright impossible to unload our bags. The room had 6 hangers and a few little 'cubbies' near the floor which appeared to be the size for shoes. The lack of storage made our stay very uncomfortable...having to move bags to get around the room and to rifle through bags to find items that were unable to be unpacked. The other strange thing was that the TV kept turning itself on--which wouldn't be such a big deal, but it did so while we were sleeping on several occasions, until we unplugged it.

When it came out (in a record 15-20 minutes) it was uncooked - so much so that it was difficult to carve in to, even with a steak knife. We called a waitress over and I said I wanted something else instead but she picked up my plate saying she'd get it \"re-cooked\". Five minutes later someone else brings back my plate. They microwaved it. I didn't eat it and decided not to say anything and eat the side order of chips my partner ordered instead. When the waitress came to take away the plates she said nothing (i.e. how was your dinner?) or asked why I hadn't touched the meat but I didn't press any further. She made us feel like we were annoyances. When the bill came, neither of us were surprised to be billed but we were feeling miffed at this point, paid and feeling bitter, went straight to our room. In the room, we were greeted with a placard on the desk of the smiling CEO of the Radisson Hotels with his 100% satisfaction guarantee. This set my partner off. He marched back downstairs to complain to the reception staff. A waitress immediately came over to him and said the restaurant manager had been looking for him. My partner told her that it he mustn't have been looking very hard because, in plain view of the restaurant we went straight to the lifts that took us to our room. When the restaurant manager joined them at reception, my partner explained that the meat wasn't cooked and microwaving it just made it dry. He had the cheek to tell my partner that it is how suckling pig is cooked in Amsterdam. The waitress also tried to say that she asked me if I wanted to order something different which was a blatant lie! The outcome was a refund but it seemed to be a fight to get one. We had the fabulous experience of seeing the restaurant manager the next morning during breakfast and he was, needless to say, delighted to see us also and offered us winning looks and smiles. [Read: Sarcasm] Breakfast was fine though. Buffet. Smile. We won't be back because the way the restaurant experience was managed.

The rest of our stay here was a abject travesty. When we arrived at the hotel, after a long trip from Frankfurt, the staff at the desk refused to give us the two rooms we had paid for in full, and in advance, unless we provided a deposit of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200 per room - apparently in case we stole the mini bar or something ridiculous like that. As we were travelling without credit card (hence the reason we paid in advance) we had no means of providing this deposit, nor did we collectively have \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400 in cash as a deposit for this room. We offered to pay for any extras in cash at the time of checkout, but this was unacceptable for some odd reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c why, I have no idea - and then we were dismissed from the check in desk until we had a solution. I was gob smacked. We ended up having to make an long and expensive roaming call to a family member family at home to provide a credit card over the phone so we could get the rooms we paid for. Apart from this being an utterly ridiculous policy, the staff were insulting and rude, and the whole experience was deeply embarrassing. Another example of the indifference and rudeness of staff at this hotel was made clear at a later point in our stay, we asked one of your staff members at the desk to find a letter that was sent to us by email. He barely made any effort in looking for this delivery, and was incredibly dismissive of us, amazingly even going to the trouble of taking another phone call during our conversation and dealing with another guest! Later when I went back to a different member of staff two hours later, I was told they had the letter all morning - it was in a draw under the check in desk. I can only assume the first member of staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care too much to be bothered to look in the draw under this desk? Probably not, looking in a draw would just upset him, it seems. Even down to the breakfast fiasco in the morning, we had to wait 20 minutes EVERY day, as the breakfast room was full. What hotel can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accommodate its guests for breakfast? To describe the breakfast as chaos would be an understatement. Even the room cleaning wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great, with dirty cups left by the sink. To be blunt, this hotel is more akin to a 2 star with attitude problems and guests are just a hindrance to its daily operations. They have the audacity to put a sign in the room indicating \u00e2\u20ac\u0153100% Guest Satisfaction Guarantee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which I assume is clearly meant to amuse, but in a tragic way.

It's worse than a Motel! Stay Away\u201d", "Author": "sidzy", "ReviewID": "UR115065070", "Content": "This hotel or rather motel is probably the worst I have ever stayed in. From the moment we queued up to check in till the time we checked out, we faced problems one after another. Check in time is marked as 3pm. We had requested for early check in, since we were getting there by 1pm. We had booked 3 rooms and got 2 of them by 3pm. We were told that check in time is 3pm and that there is nothing they can do about it, which was fair. But, we had to wait until 4:30pm to get our third room which we were supposed to get by 3pm despite being promised that all 3 rooms would be available by 3pm. This was really frustrating because they made a big fuss about not giving us rooms before the standard check in time and now we were asked to wait even more despite having travelled by air and train before getting to Amsterdam that day. And anyways, we were waiting from 1pm at the hotel for our rooms. Anyhow, after we got our rooms, my brother realised his room has a slanted wooden pillar jutting out of the wall right across his bed. This was not only inconvenient, but also a safety hazard since waking up from the bed in the morning, he could very easily bang his head against the wooden pillar and hurt himself. He spoke to the reception and had to explain that his room needs to get changed since its not safe. After convincing the reception he finally got transferred to a normal room. My room was fine until I came back in the evening after dinner on the first day, only to find water all over the floor below the Air Conditioner and on my suitcase and in my shoes/slippers placed next to my suitcase. It was shocking to come back to a water logged room just before you get to bed after a long and tiring day. We informed the reception and told them that the Air Conditioner has water leaking from it and that they need to either fix it or change our room. Someone came up after about 5 minutes and couldn't get it to stop. He informed the reception and we too were shifted to another room with some of our stuff totally drenched. Shifting rooms wasn't our preference since we were exhausted by this time and were just about to hit the bed. Apart from our annoying and inconvenient incidents, the hotel was quite shabby in terms of looks. Our rooms were extremely mediocre to say the least. I've stayed in motels in the United States that have better rooms. The linen and curtains were dirty. There were some small rips on the curtains. The entire hotel lobby, corridors and rooms gave a very dingy and cold feeling. After the menace during the checking in process, we were also not able to check out late. We had requested for a late checkout, instead of the standard time of 12 noon we wanted an extra hour for our 3 rooms. We were refused right away. After having spoken at the reception that she should atleast give us 1 room until 1pm since we also got our room later than the standard check in time, they just weren't willing to accommodate. Instead, we were told that there would be a charge if we didn't check out by 12 noon. This really left things in very bad taste. They just weren't willing to listen. Ultimately we had to leave at 12 noon and were extremely disgusted with the hotel and its' staff. While the positives were: the hotel concierge, which was quite helpful; the wifi service, which worked great; and the breakfast, which had a good spread. The hotel is just not good enough for anyone to stay in expecting some decent hotel service. It is just a shabby motel with pathetic staff and dingy rooms that desperately need a makeover. I cannot think of a worse hotel that I have ever stayed in. I highly suggest to look around because this is not the only hotel in the vicinity around Dam Square.

Someone will check on it in a bit.\" So eventually someone went up there and knocked on the door to speak to Sid & Nancy. However this only reduced the noise level to screaming and crying, for the next hour. I called the front desk again to ask if they could so something. I was told, \"oh it's a lovers quarrel and just bad luck for you\". I asked if they could move them \"no, the hotel is full\", could they speak to them again \"well, we already went up there\". Yes and that was not very successful, so could they try again? \"huff, huff.

Radisson Blu happens to be one of my company's corporate hotel, and I managed to get a room for EUR180 including breakfast. We arrived early in the morning around 8am. I had emailed the hotel early to request for early check-in if available. During check in, the hotel offered us immediate check-in into a King size room (apparrently ours is queen size) including breakfast for an additional EUR50. We declined. Frankly, our package at EUR180 already included breakfast and the additional EUR50 would only make sense for those who originally got their room without breakfast. For us it was really not worth it. If I had wanted to pay EUR230, I could have checked myself into the Marriott which I could get at that price on the corporate programmme, and Marriott is a better class hotel. We just left our bags at the hotel and took a walk to Anne Frank House which opened at 9am. That worked out perfectly as the wait at Anne Frank was only 15 mins since we were early. Our room was ready by the time we returned around 12noon. We were given a room on the top floor. The ceiling was slanted because of the roof. The room was really dated and old, and in real need of an upgrade. We did not bother to ask for another room since we are only staying the night. Anyway, we figured that they probably wanted to give us a real crappy room to \"punish\" us for not taking the upgrade offer. Room came with free wifi which is a plus.

It is also a short walk to the DAM square area and to many shopping and dining areas nearby. We found it to be superbly convenient. Since I was on business, I had booked what the hotel calls an \"executive\" room. It was very nice in every respect, except one, it faced Rusland Street. We had expected the street to be fairly quiet, but it turned out to be quite noisy with trucks, cars and motor bikes coming by at all hours of the day and night. If I were to stay at the Radisson Blu again, I would request a room that does not face the street. The hotel serves an excellent breakfast (which was included in the price of our room) and serves dinner in the restaurant in the evening. While we did not have dinner there, the menu looked good and there were many people dining each night we were there. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful.

One thing that you really need to know about this and likely all other hotels in downtown Amsterdam: ask if they have a shuttle from the airport. This one did, but it is not on their website. Also, you will not be able to drag your luggage through town from the train station -- well, you could, but it would not be easy -- so you'll end up paying 20 Euros to get from the train station to the hotel -- and this hotel was relatively close. Adding in the cost of the train ticket for the two of us and the tip to the taxi driver, it cost us 30 euros to get from the hotel to the airport, and took about an hour. Going back to the airport, we took a car (aranged by the hotel) for 40 euros and got there in 20 minutes. This hotel also has a shuttle bus for 15 euros each, which is a great deal.

We stayed in a suite, which consisted of twin beds, dressing table area, tv (plus engish channels), mini bar, Plentiful closet space and a relatively good sized bathroom. The hotel itself is set on a quiet road, so you wont have to hear the party in the centre commencing til the early hours, guaranteed to have a perfect sleep. I must add the beds were soooo comfortable. The staff are more than attentive to you needs. The hotel offers Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner with a superb seafood menu, though we did not eat here as it is very steep in price and you can get cheaper elsewhere. On the weekends they do a deal on Breakfast 20 Euros each, but again, if you walk round the corner you can get a full English or whatever suits your taste buds for less than 10 euros! Amsterdam itself is such a small city, so we made the mistake of buying a travel card for 3 days (25 Euro's each), which we did not use once as we walked everywhere. Trams were everywhere you turned, and again we did not use any during our tour adventures as everything was like 2/3 minutes walk away! The only bad thing I would say is, as we opened our windows to get some air into the room, there was a stench of strong weed smell coming from outside; as the cleaner was cleaning our room, he must of reported it to the staff and two minutes later we had security at our door asking if we were smoking inside (lol), they were more than polite and acknowledged that it was in fact the stench from outside and not from us, we even invited them in to check!!

The hotel is extremely central being only 5 minutes walk from the Dam Square, and it is near the Red light district, but you do not have to go there! There are lots of lovely scenic canal walks which do not go anywhere near it! The choice is yours!

I stayed in the Radisson Blu on two occasions this month and after my last stay there is no way I would go back! The problem with this hotel (and the reason for the mixed reviews) is that it is made up of two buildings with a underground walkway connecting them. On my first visit this month I stayed in the main building where the reception is located. The room was modern and exactly what I would expect from a Radisson, As a GoldPoints member I was upgraded to a business room which was a nice touch but I was very disappointed to note that there was no complementary water in the room and that small bottles of mineral water are charged at over 5 Euros from the minibar! Despite this I was impressed enough with the hotel and the staff to stay there again two weeks later. What a mistake that was! This time I was given a room in the building across the road from the main hotel lobby, despite this being my second visit in two weeks and despite being a Goldpoints member I was given a grotty little room directly behind the main lift shaft. Not only that, the decor was deplorable and the room absolutely stank of stale sweat. I complained at the front desk, to their credit they apologised and upgraded me to a business room. However, this room was also in the building across the road and whilst it was bigger, less noisy and not smelly, the decor was the same. It is over 20 years out of date and I can't imagine that it was ever tasteful, even back then. There are plenty of good business hotels in Amsterdam and I am surprised that this one is ranked so highly as it is now very close to the bottom of my list of business hotels in the city, if you are considering staying here, don't bother, it's a real gamble, take my advice and stay in the Crowne Plaza instead!", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stourbridge", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and thoughtful staff\u201d", "Author": "ami51244", "ReviewID": "UR58664489", "Content": "My partner and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

Other nice touch was free use of the business centre to check in to our flight online and print off our boarding passes - most other hotels would have charged for this service. We were allocated a room on the 6th floor, which had nice views over the city and was also very quiet. There was a good bathroom, although if I was splitting hairs, I would say it is a little on the small side. Definitely only room for one person at a time to brush their teeth! One small note about the room - it was split level. When you came in through the door, there was a bathroom and hall area with ample wardrobe space. There was then a small flight of about 6 steps to get up to the bed area. This wasn't a problem for us, but anyone with limited mobility, or someone who doesn't want to have to go up or down any stairs when going to the bathroom in the night might want to check with reception when they book. I think the split-level design is only found in a couple of rooms. The breakfast buffet had a great selection and was served until a very generous 11:30am on the weekends, which was great!

It is an easy walk to most of the attractions, including the Anne Frank house and floating flower market. Since the lines to the Anne Frank house is always long, it is advisable to either order the timed tickets in advance or go about 45 minutes before closing when the lines are much shorter but guests would only have about 30 minutes to view the house since it closes generally around 7pm. The museum area (Van Gogh and Rijks) may take about 30 minutes. The hotel is also about 10-15 minutes walk from Central Station (the main land and water transportation hub). 2. The room is considered large by European standards with a good-sized bathroom. 3. The room was clean and well maintained. 4. Wireless Internet is free in the room. Cons: 1. There is no coffee machine but a pitcher that heats up water. 2. The hotel should be 3.75 stars by American standards instead of 5 stars, as it doesn't appear to have a spa or a well appointed lobby. The hotel lobby and rooms are due for a remodel. 3. The restaurant serves average food but guests can easily walk to the Damrak (one of the busiest streets) and surrounding streets for food. Just off the Damrak on a street leading back to the hotel (street on the right of NH Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky from Damrak), there is a pizza place to purchase a slice of good pizza for a quick bite.

It's a shame, because if they had reduced their prices we would have had a drink there each evening. A gin & tonic was about 11 euro - which was way too expensive.

We were able to get an upgrade to the business rooms where breakfast is included but if we didn't have that I might have looked for a small cafe. Get a good map and you can walk everywhere. The rooms were nice but Radisson please get some new hair dryers in the rooms. They have the old style hairdryer mounted on the wall. It was awful. The tube kept falling out and it looked like it was from the 70's. Housekeeping was ok, but sometimes the glasses were not changed. The bathtub was very nice and deep though. I went to Lush and got some bath bombs. Taking a bath after walking all day is great. I also liked that the windows opened. You really want a room that looks out on the street not on the interior lobby. If you can go to Boom Chicago and take the Saint Nicholas Boat club tour. it is on a small boat and so much nicer than the large tour boats. very unique. You sign up inside Boom Chicago. On the walk to Leidensplein there are several Italian Restaurants .We had some great Pizza at Antonios. The rijsttafel at Indurpura in the Rembrandtplein was very good. We tried a Brazilian steak house near Indurpura but it was only ok. Definitely get tickets on line to go to the Anne Frank House. You get to go in a separate entrance, and go early by the afternoon the lines are around the block.

It is near the large parties on the Dam and Rembrandt Plaza, but on a quiet street away from the noise. The hotel deserves fulsome praise for its architecture. It is a fully modern atrium lobby hotel built into the facade of some of the traditional Dutch Gothic houses. One of the houses is actually converted into the lounge area. For those who travel for business to Europe, free internet access is a big plus and it is offered here. The rooms are fully modern and comfortable for business travel.

We stayed over Easter this time. I am not sure but I think we may have been upgraded to a nicer room since the price quoted in our room for price per night was far more expensive than the rate we actually paid when we checked out/on our online booking form. We had also requested a room on a high floor with a good view and we got both. Staff gave us a very warm welcome. The room was lovely, really nicely furnished, big TV with plenty of channels, good storage, nice modern, marble bathroom with good hot powerful shower and lots of nice toiletries. The room was not huge but big enough for us. There were free little chocolate eggs in bowls scattered round the reception area which my boyfriend enjoyed helping himself too. The bar in the lobby area looked nice although we didn't have time to stop there and the lobby looked very impressive with a water feature and two computers offering free internet access. One computer was not working during our stay but there was not a big queue. There is also free wifi in all rooms. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant or have breakfast there (24 Euros seemed a little steep) but there are plenty of small cafes within a minute or two's walk from the hotel which do really nice breakfasts for a fraction of the price.

Booked the hotel online via Expedia.de. First of all, the location of the hotel is perfect, right in the middle of the city, at the edge of famous red light district and at a little canal. We knew the hotel from passing by at several other visits in amsterdam, so I knew it has a huge atrium lobby with rooms facing into the lobby. So I mailed to the hotel, that we would like a non-smoking room with two beds with a window to the street. I assume windows opening to the lobby make the room sticky since you dont get fresh air from the outside. Arriving at the hotel we learned, that they could fulfill all of our wishes and we got a very nice room on 4th floor - 406. Compared to the Marriott where we usually stay rooms are smaller, but still very nice. Bathrooms need some renovation, but still OK, nice amenities and good water pressure. Staff all over the hotel is really nice and helpful. We did not eat at the hotel since its very pricy, bar is very cosy but also exxpensive. Very positive: Hotel has free internet wifi access all over if you bring a laptop and offers free access to the internet in the business center including printing. On departure day we asked for late checkout and were allowed to check-out at 3 PM. Again, a very nice hotel, PERFECT location, rooms are OK, staff is very helpful and friendly, we would stay there again. One additional tipp: If you are looking for great, local food. For 9 years now we have dinner at our favourite restaurant in Amsterdam. Very close to the Radisson in a little street, Berenstraat 12- Family owned, very cosy atmosphere, great food. Also a lot of locals eat there, thats always a good sign for us.

Amazing, since check in wasn't supposed to be until 4:00.

The room, in the main hotel building (416) was exactly what we had requested (king size bed, non-smoking, as far from the elevator as possible and away from the street). After 11 days on an African safari, this room was like nirvana to us....great bathroom (heated floor, plenty of linens and apple and orange bath gel), good closet space. Nice desk and side-chair. Very good and thorough maid service. Seemed like the ideal business travelers hotel with all the appropriate amenities. We did not eat at the hotel restaurants, but they always seemed full. The concierge helped us with directions to attractions both days we were there and gladly loaned us umbrellas as we were headed out to explore in the rain. No problems in hailing a cab for us or responding to any inquiry. (Cab from the airport was about $50 Euros, so not cheap, but almost impossible to navigate to the hotel otherwise.

It is also close to many restaurants. We stayed there for 4 nights. The gift shop, although a bit more pricey than the tourist shops, carries the same or better quality items and will save you from having to carrying gifts around during the day. The hotel was nice to send postcards for us as no charge. However the wireless service is extra. Our room was in the building across the street. The under road walkway lobby is quite nice and our room though smallish, was nicely decorated in an Asian theme and had large windows. It was also very quiet. The room had a pants press, which I loved, as well as an iron and ironing board. The bathroom was marble with heated floors. The bathroom floor is about 2\" above the bedroom floor, so watch that you don't stub your toes. On occasion the bathroom had a smelly smell, coming from a floor drain. We reported it, not sure if anything was done, but we bought our own spray and it fixed the problem. Breakfast was a bit high. But the variety was nice and it was a convenient way to start the day. The chef will cook your eggs just as you like. Front desk service was fine. Upon arrival they kept our luggage secure until we could check in (we arrived around 7:30am, and had a room by noon). We were able to pass the time in the comfortable 2nd floor lobby, restaurant and by walking around the city. Although close to the red light district we always felt safe. The exercise facility is quite nice and has a tanning bed (need tokens) and sauna. Good tips - purchase your museum tickets (Van Gogh and Rijks) on line that way you avoid waiting in queue. Also The Rembrant House is a must see. Just a wonderful experience. Also don't miss the Old Church (Oude Kerk) in the Red Light district, it has the most fabulous, decorative pipe organ I've ever seen.

There is a nice relaxing bar on the ground floor which is a good place for a nightcap. All that apart, here are some recommendations in the area:- Kapitein Zeppos in a little alley off Grimburgwal-great international food. Spanish tapas, Belgium mussels, lamb tagine and terrific fish mousse. The place itself has a lovely old fashioned feel. The waiter service was impeccable and the food faultless. Museum Amstelkring, 40 Oudezijds Voorburgwal. There's a hidden church here in the loft conversion. Fascinating place. Dutch Resistance Museum on Plantage Kerklaan (near the zoo). A gem of a museum which deserves more than the 150 or so customers I was told they receive in an average day. The Brouwhuis, 6-8 Klovenierburgwal-excellent white and blonde beers brewed on the premises. The food looked OK as well although we didn't get round to trying it.

It does everything is says on the tin, true it does not have the boutique hotel appeal (something we often prefer) but after a few disappointments on recent trips to boutique style hotels we opted for the Radisson. We got an amazing rate \u00c2\u00a3326.00 twin, deluxe, with breakfast all taxes included. It took a while to find such a good rate but it was well worth the search. Location, location, location in an upmarket street right near the Niewmarket (5 min walk). Canal boat hop on hop off (starts from the Central Station) great value and really good fun. Buy tickets for all the museums in advance on the net (they allow you to queue jump), it is really hard to get tickets that let you jump all the queues when you are there and trust me with so much to see you do not want to waste your time in long queues. Evenings cool at the moment so pack warm. The Bird Thai restaurant was the best we eat in, loads of food, really yummy and fast (everywhere else was very slow) & service with a smile The room was more spacious than we expected with plenty of hanging space. We had an arm chair & coffee table in a bay window, twin beds pushed together (so it felt like a big superking) plenty of lighting options, huge desk & mirror and the standard Radisson grey marble bathroom with shower over bath. We had a great street view directly opposite the lovely Coffee Shop Rusland (one of the best in the area). Air con was effective and very, very quiet. Beds were super comfy and lots of big squashy pillows. Breakfast was amazing, loads of fresh fruit, breads, cereals, juices and loads of cooked items. Coffee was fresh and plentiful. All the staff we so helpful and friendly something I think is hard to find these days. The bar looked nice but we never tried it and the lobby was ok not as grand as some hotels we have stayed in this class but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time in the lobby do you?!

Bedrooms:- we got a Business suite and an adjoining room, for the 3 Kids. Electric roller blinds are more fun than any gameboy advance. No breakfast was included, we paid the hotel direct. Good location with pleanty of excellent restaurants a short walk away. Though it was in the University area the behaviour of the students was exemplary.

He did not know any restaurants that were not around the hotel. After asking him about some good ones (like the Altman) he just said \"Yea, but we have some really good ones around the hotel, you do not need to go so far\". The question was not really location but rather a nice restaurant were we could enjoy dinner. On other occasions when we called from the room he just told us to get down to the lobby so he could explain since it was easier than explaining on the phone.

Location: The hotel is a short walk from Central Station and Dam Square. The area itself is fairly quiet, but very convenient for all the major attractions. There is also a shuttle bus from the airport which costs 12 euros. We walked everywhere, as it was so convenient. There is a bus-boat service which stops at the main museums and sights. Tickets are valid for 24 hours and cost 17 euros. The last trip is at 21.00, which, if its dark by then, is a lovely trip. Check -in. This was the most efficient service I've ever experienced. No waiting in long queues, even though the hotel was very busy. We were upgraded to business class and given a free bottle of red wine, which was a lovely surprise. The staff are really friendly, efficient and attentive. The Room: We were given an upgrade to a Business room. My first impression was that the room was a little basic, but everything is hidden away very cleverly. The decor is modern wood, and each room has a subtle theme; ours was maritime. The rooms have an iron, ironing board, safe, dressing gowns, slippers, icebucket, mini-bar, wi-fi, broadband, and an excellent tea and coffee maker and hairdryer. The air conditioning was quiet and worked well. The rooms were spotlessly clean and well maintained. Dining: Breakfast in the main restaurant was excellent. There is a full selection of cooked breakfasts and chef can prepare an omlette. There is also a good selection of healthy options such as cererals, pastries. yoghurts etc. Freshly squeezed orange juice was always available. I highly recommend the restaurant for an evening meal. The service and food were exceptional and it was a real fine dining experience. They have a salad menu, healthy options and a la carte. Bread rolls are served with a selection of sun-dried tomato, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and lightly salted butter. The wine list was also excellent.

Anyway, as soon as you walk into the hotel you can tell it's something special. A huge (in European standards) 7 or 8 story atrium, a funky check-in area made up of 4 standalone reception 'lecturns' a great looking raised, dark and almost New York style bar and an overall feeling of Phillip Starke design (it isn't one of his though). I got room 51 which was cool too...you open your room door and immediately go down some curved steps down into your sunken room with exposed wooden beams, a big skylight above the bed for star gazing, a funky bathroom, plenty of space and a window overlooking the quiet street below (no canal views here I don't think). Oh and FREE wireless broadband connection in the room for guests too. You can also get rooms looking over the atrium with an inside view. I didn't eat there, but what I saw looked good. And the coffee shop over the road is one of the best I've found in the 'Dam (if that's you thing too) - good selection of special cakes and very friendly too. If you're looking for somewhere different in Amsterdam and can find a good rate (below 140 Euro) then you won't be disappointed with its style and location.

They lack grandeur, cleanliness, facilities and are poor value. But the Radisson is one of the best. I paid 199 euros a night off their website. Largish rooms. Bathrooms though are just acceptable for the price - not huge. The hotel is split in 2 parts so you have to walk across the indoor underpass if you are not in the main block. The bedroom was in neutral colours, had a decent sized TV, and good airconditioning - other hotels in Amsterdam can be unbearably hot. The bar and restaurant are excellent - for Amsterdam. Room service is very good indeed - a great burger and pizza and reasonably priced. No pool, but there is a sauna and small gymn. I lived in Amsterdam about 20 years ago and the city has become a haven for backpackers and 'cheap' tourists only really interested in the 'coffee shops'. And standards and clientele in many hotels and bars and restaurants reflect this now. But the Radisson is a haven from all that with largely business and up market tourists. Therefore, no slamming doors or noise at night. Location is very good, except it can feel a bit dodgy late at night walking back as it is off a side street near the red light district, so you do bump into a few unsavoury sorts. Overall, for Amsterdam, this is a modern, smart, calm and peaceful hotel. And represents good value for this city. Staff were great - friendly but unobtrusive. I will stay again.

The staff in the lobby were extremely nice and helpful and even came up to the room to show us how to access the internet. There is also a bar and restaurant. We did not use the bar because of the heavy smell of smoke. We ate every morning in the restaurant(free because of the rooms we were in) and I would say it was the best breakfast buffet I have ever had the opportunity to eat in--the fresh orange juicer was fabulous! We ate dinner once at the restaurant at night. The food was outstanding and the service impeccable. Our rooms were in the building across from the building housing the lobby. To access them, one takes the elevator to the -1 floor, walk across a carpeted room, and take the elevator up. We were on the 4th floor. We had business rooms decorated in an Asian style. The rooms were smallish and the window sills were so high you couldn't see the street. Perhaps that was only true on the 4th floor. We only had one glitch and that was when a wedding party on our first night became too noisy on the floor above us. We were so exhausted from our trip that I fell asleep waiting for them to stop. The management agreed to move us, but it was quiet after that night. We would definitely stay at the Radisson again. It was within walking distance of the Dam Square and the Canal boats.

We had a \"deluxe\" room on the 3rd floor (no.328) at the back of the hotel. The room was in character with the older parts of the building and had a beamed ceiling with four windows (2 low down and 2 up high into the ceiling). We had a queen size bed, two armchairs, a table, TV, bedside units, a desk and chair, fridge, safe, tea/coffee making facilities, smallish wardrobe and a disappointingly small marbled bathroom (although it was clean and fully functioning). The public rooms and restaurants in the hotel were lovely. The structure of the building and view down into the lobby from our floor was impressive. The central areas around reception were particularly good. These facilities I would rate 4 star however the room, although nice, was not deluxe or 4 star quality.. maybe a 3+ The location of the hotel was good. Central (about 15 mins walk from the Centraal station) yet far enough away from the noise. We walked up to the Nieuwmarket area and all around the City with ease. We were also located quite close to the main shopping areas and within walking distance from the notorious red light district (one to avoid near to midnight if you don't like crowds of over enthusiastic men on stag nights!) The hotel restaurant was simply decorated. It was bright and slightly lacking in intimacy or atmosphere during the evening. Dinner in the hotel was excellent even bearing in mind the lack of atmostphere. My choice of sole with scallops and prawns on a bed of brown rice was delicious. The liquer coffee at the end rounded off a perfect gourmet treat. The same dining area was used for breakfast and at that time of day it didn't matter about the lack of ambience. Breakfast itself was good. Plenty of fresh fruit, pastries and cakes, bread/rolls, meat, cheeses, eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes, pancakes, potatoes etc. There was a fresh juice maker which made surreally zesty, refreshing orange juice right before your eyes. Although it took about 3 oranges to make a small glass it was excellent! The hotel bar was dark and atmospheric but extremely expensive. At check in I had one drink there and was charged over 24 Euro for it! It was even more expensive than the mini-bar in the room. Far too over priced for the hotel bar. Not the right way to encourage their guests to use it. Staff at the hotel were generally friendly and welcoming. There was a slight problem when we checked in but that was resolved instantly by the manager. If you wish to take advantage of the hotel transport to the airport you will need to book it 2 hours in advance. However, I'd recommend you get the train. For only 3.40 Euros each it's a bargain and the easiest way to ensure you don't miss check in.

The room was clean and more like a 3-4 star quality. The services at the hotel were not exceptional but all this would have been fine as my expectations had been set low. However our last night in the hotel, we were informed there would be no water the following morning. The note simply said sorry and if guests wanted, they could go down to the front desk and ask for bottled water. (Am I alone in thinking that a hotel of any class, let alone five star, would automatically bring these to each room and place them in the bathroom?) Obviously I was not impressed with a hotel without running water and upon checkout I said I expected some form of compensation for my inconvenience as I had paid for a room with basic services which includes running water. At no point did I specify what compensation, just simply that I expected something. At this point, all they need have done is something token but, alas, that was not to be. I was told I would need to speak to the manager. I had to queue again to speak to a manager who basic attitude was, tough. He further said I should have told them the night before and they would have arranged alternative accomodation. Notwithstanding the inconvenience, this was not offered by the hotel. I persisted in asking for some type of compensation and reminded the manager of the hotel policy emblazoned on cards in the room of \"100% satisfaction\" He scoffed at this and said it was too bad. Frustrated I said I would take up the issue later with Radisson. I then gave him my credit card to pay. He snarled at me and told me he didn't have a register there (3 feet from a register) and I would have to queue yet again.

The rate (from the Radisson website) for the room was very reasonable - in fact we couldn't believe we were getting such a good rate for a 5 star! The reason became obvious when we saw the room as it was definitely not 5 star quality. (If you want to see real 5 star quality stay in the Grand Marina in Barcelona) Our first room (yes, we had to move) was an average size but it overlooked the central atrium of the hotel. When you opened the window you were looking out over the foyer and all the smoke from the restaurant and bar drifted in. We had to keep the window shut and air conditioning on for the first night and woke up feeling very congested. The bed wasn't particularly comfortable and the bathroom had mould around the sealant on the bath. The toilet looked dirty and limescaley. As for the toiletries, I would agree with others that they were weird. The shower gels, soaps etc were all colourful liquids contained in little glass containers with peel away lids on them so they looked like little jars of jam or something. We asked to move room the next day to a room overlooking the street so that we could have fresh air. In fairness to the staff, they are really helpful and obliging and arranged this immediately. The next room was similar (ie mouldy bath sealant etc) but slightly smaller. There was a single duvet on the double bed. A very helpful maid sorted out that issue. The room was fairly noisy at night as there was a \"coffee shop\" across the road and also a bit of traffic. Having said that, at least we could breathe! The restaurant had beautiful food in the evenings and was very reasonable. Again the service was excellent. Breakfasts were a bit hit and miss - fresh orange juice but powdered scrambled egg? Location-wise the hotel is about 5 minutes walk away from Dam square. Most of Amsterdam is accessible on foot anyway so the location wasn't that important. To sum up this hotel: Aspects that were 5 star- -friendliness and service of all of the staff -location pretty good -restaurant food was excellent -good bar service -good value Aspects that were not 5 star- -Room size and comfort -Bathroom was run down and sealant was mouldy -Weird toiletries -no turn down service of the bed covers or changing of towels in the evening -health club was down in the basement and you could pass between the gents and ladies changing rooms internally as they were both linked to the unisex sauna. This makes it unsafe for a female to be in there on her own as someone could walk from the gents changing room into the ladies without having to walk out into the main exercise room first. Finally, I would just say that you get what you pay for, and I felt that the price was so good that we probably only really paid the level for a 3/4 star hotel, but that was in fact the standard that we got.
