We chose the Idea Hotel Roma Z3 based on other reviews especially the free shuttle link to the Metro. We arrived at the Hotel after a torturous journey from the Airport (we were the last drop off) the Rome baggage handlers took an hour to off load our baggage so it was 3 hours before we arrived at the Hotel. First impressions were very good, the reception staff were very helpful although they pointed out that the free shuttle to the metro had been withdrawn which was one of the main reasons we had booked in the first place. The gentleman on reception was very helpful though, providing us with maps of the bus & metro links. To get into the city: walk through the Auchan supermarket car park in front of the hotel, opposite the bus shelter is a road leading to the right, walk 30m and there is another bus stop on the right hand side. Wait for a number 450 bus (we had purchased a Roma Pass at the airport) when you board scan the bar code on the reader to validate your ticket, after a couple of stops leave the bus at the Metro Line B station S. M. Soccorso, again scan the Roma Pass into the scanner to enter the platform and your on your way, you can choose to leave at Termini (Lots of \"Lowlife\" hustlers) change lines (B to A) or carry on to the Colosseum for example, the Rome transport system worked very well. Back to the hotel, our room was quite small but well furnished,the small bathroom was very clean, the breakfast was a bit hit & miss depending on the time you arrived, when it was busy the bacon & egg trays were left empty for long periods but overall our stay was very pleasant. The position of the Hotel on the east side of Rome meant that the above guide for travelling into the city was a necessity, the downside was that we never stayed in the city late at night so next time we will look to stay in the centre but would recommend this hotel f your on a budget and don't mind the travel. The 7 euro charge for Internet connection was a bit steep, indeed the city of Rome seemed bare of \"Free Wi-Fi\" zones compared to other cities. We only dined one night at the hotel, we took advantage of the 19 Euro set menu which was very nice & good value compared to some of our dining experiences in the city.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Japan", "Title": "\u201cBetter than I thought\u201d", "Author": "BrooksJapan", "ReviewID": "UR124951340", "Content": "Well it is near a hypermarket which is good for shopping.

I had read a few reviews that said how far out it is and how long it took to get to the attractions, but in reality it's not that bad. The hotels minibus has you at the the Rebibbia metro station in a matter of minutes and then it only takes about 15 minutes to get to Termini. The trains do get very packed but, as Rebibbia is the starting point for the line, we always got a seat. On the way back, it wasn't always the case but, there was normally seats by the time we reached Turbitina and it's not that long anyway. As a side note, I observed that Romans are very good at giving up their seats for the elderly, women and anyone else that looks as if they may be struggling. The hotels restaurant was staffed by great staff that served fantastic food. Apart from breakfast we only ate there once for an evening meal (only because we was out all day and ate wherever we was), but it was great. We took advantage of the set meal, which was 3 courses, bread, wine and water for only \u20ac19 each. The hotel itself, was always spotelss throughout and all staff very welcoming and friendly. Our room was absolutely spotless and kept that way everyway by the very friendly housekeeping staff. Although there is nothing much in the immediate area it didn't affect us at all, and to be honest a lot of the rest of Rome is a bit dingy looking - apart from the sights of course. If I have any critism, it's that there is no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms (as I like to have a cup of tea before going down to breakfast and in the evening), but I brought a travel kettle and got supplies from the supermarket across the road.

To reach the central Metro station aka Termini from the Leonardo da Vinci aiport (Fiumicino), one may have three options: Taxis (quite expensive 50 Euros flat-rate), Express train (very slow train which costs 14 Euros/person) and the shuttle bus service (4 Euros/person or 8 Euros when you buy the ticket inside the bus from the driver). From Termini you should walk approx. 10 min. to reach the metro platform Line B proceeding to Rebbibia station. The information in the hotel website mislead us by stating that we should get off at Ponte Mammolo which we did and no shuttle minibus was there to pick us up. It was hard to find out how to reach the hotel and nobody was picking up the phone at the hotel to answer. Somebody there helped us to ride the bus line number 508 (you can also ride the bus line number 451) and get off approx. 500 m. away from the hotel. Finally after 2 hrs. we reached the hotel. Upon checking I found lots of tourists from South East Asia waiting to be checked in. I asked the receptionist why they there was nobody to pick us up and he said that the pick-up plan has changed for some months and it is done from Rebbibia instead of Ponte Mammolo every 30 min. from 8 am until 10.45 pm. The check in was hassle-free and we got the key to the room. The room looks stylish, nice beds, clean bedsheets, very thick curtains, safety deposit box, a fridge and air conditioned. The toilet and the shower is spotless and very clean and it was interesting to find a bidet as well. There is nothing fancy about the room but it's quite small. The breakfast is adequate with lots of choices (especially cakes) and a nice coffee machine. I asked if they have free wi-fi available and the guy at the reception gave me the password to use. The internet speed is acceptable in the morning time but drops dead during night time. There is a branch of Auchan (hypermarket) in front of the hotel which is useful for buying stuff.

We took a bus from Ciampino to termini which cost \u20ac1.20 each and then you have to pay extra per large item of luggage when you get on the bus. Or you can take an express bus which costs \u20ac4 each. Getting to the hotel, there are 2 main ways to get to the hotel from termini, you can either get the metro to Ponte Mammolo and then get the bus 451 or 508 and then walk through the path of the field (takes about 5 minutes) and takes you towards the back of the hotel. Alternatively you can take the metro to Rebibbia and then just outside the station (same place it drops off) the shuttle bus runs from there every 30 minutes from 8.15 in the morning to 11.15pm. We used the shuttle just as much as the bus if not more and it was never full, sometimes we were able to get the last seats so its more about your timing than anything. It can take 30 minutes to an hour depending on how things time out. If you're there for a week I'd suggest buying the 7 day travel tickets which cost \u20ac16 and work on all the trams, busses, metro & suburban rail in Rome. Check in was easy, hotel itself is very clean and has nice decor around the reception areas and in the rooms. I felt they didn't really tell you the little bits of info you may need to know (breakfast times, shuttle service etc) but that's being really picky. They first said we had to pay for the internet but because we pointed out it said it was free on all booking sites they gave us a code that would last for the holiday and worked fine, it's not fast but it works (about 60kb max dl). The room was very nice, big comfy bed, bigger than a kingsize and not 2 single beds pushed together like you would find a lot in other hotels over europe. Room has a flatscreen tv, small fridge, safe, hair dryer. Bathroom's don't have baths, only showers so if that's an issue its not for you, for us it was great! Rooms are cleaned daily & breakfast was very nice. Did feel like some days it was better than others but again, being really picky. Didn't eat dinner in the hotel but they looked quite busy each night and the prices are reasonable. Bar does a happy hour with lots of nice snacks complimentary. There is a huge supermarket (Auchan) literally 30 seconds away which is very handy for snacks/drinks etc (or buying wine by the gallon). We found a nice restaurant that does chinese and italian food not far from the hotel, if you come out the hotel and walk right up to the main road, it's called Hong Kong, we were utterly stuffed for \u20ac20 for the both of us.

As you read, you will understand. I secured two rooms through an opaque booking site in July 2010 and received the Hotel Pisana Palace (Idea Hotel Roma San Pietro) for me, my wife,and 2 travelling companions for the night of October 19, 2010. This was the last night of our 2 week vacation in Tuscany and the Pisana Palace was only about 30 minutes away from Fiumicino for our early morning departure back to the US. We travel with only a cell phone for emergencies and no computer. This was a vacation, not a \"must stay in touch with the world event. Weh we arrived at the Pisana Palace, we were told that they had suffered severe power failures due to equipment difficulties and that our rooms were no longer available. That is understandable, so what is plan B? The young man at the reception desk was very positive and said we would be transferred via their shuttle to a sister facility, Idea Hotel Roma Z3, at no additional expense. We were allowed to store our large luggage and leave the rental vehicle in the underground parking garage at no expense. The hotel could easily have told us, \"tough, find another room elsewhere\", but they did not. This is what I call a most professional resolution. So, after stowing all the luggage and the car, off we go in the hotel shyttle to the sister property (Z3) on the northeast part of Rome. Took about 45 minutes. When we arrived at the Z3, all arrangements had been made, and we were assigned two \"Executive Rooms\" on the 7th floor. This was a most generous gesture by the hotel and greatly appreciated. The rooms were spotless, bright, very modern, the bathrooms sparking, and that great full-size shower. Plenty of clean, white towels, hair dryer, heated towel rack, and suffficient accessories. Also included was a large wide-screen TV, mini-referigator, a huge closet, and the beds were very comfortable. This hotel and its sister property are considered 4-star and I agree. The lobby of both properties were large, well-lit, and very clean. Some previous posters complained about the distance from the city center. Rome is a large historical city and unlike the US, old buildings will not be torn down to make room for a hotel. The #14 trolly (tram) Valente Stop is a mere 1 kilometer away, costs 1 Euro each way and delivers you to the main terminal (Termini) in usually about 30 minutes. The tram runs about 5 minutes. This is as easy as it gets to be in the city center in minutes. The dining room was large and can feed tour groups and others wil ease. Remember, this is Europe and if you are intimidated by crowds and jousting for position, stay home. We encoutered a large tour and waited abour 1-2 minutes to get a plate and food from the buffet. The hotel provided this for free and it was a great European breakfast with plenty of hot food. Absolutely no complaints from me or my wife. The next morning, the shuttle from the original property picked us up at 7:45 as scheduled and were transported back to the Pisana Palace, retrieved our bags, the car, and were off to catch our flight back to the US. Folks, this could easily have been a difficult last night in Italy; however, because of the very professional way in which were treated, transferred, and allowed to sleep in the Executive Floor, it worked out perfectly . The hotel and its staff went over and above what they were required to do for us and for that, my wife and I are very appreciative and thank the management and staff of both hotels for being so gracious. Hotel Pisana Palace and Hotel Rome Z3, thank you very much for helping us and I hope that we will be able to stay at your hotel when we return to Rome again.

However since the small bus can fit only 16 people, you may have to line up for the bus very early, because first come first served. The rooms are quite small and it is difficult to open two suitcases on the floor because of lack of space. The dining room is used for the breakfast buffet, but seems to be too small when the large tour groups have breakfast. Many times one has to wait for the waiters to bring more food because the food has been taken by the large tour groups. Also try the modern chairs at the hotel lobby.

The rooms are big for european rooms, clean and tidy, modern looking, have all the comforts you need (except tea & coffee in the rooms)! Bathrooms are lush, shower is big enough for 2 ;o)!! Rooms were cleaned every day - new bed sheets and towels! There is a safe in the room and a mini bar which was re-stock ever time we used it! Sky TV with lots of free channels. Proper double beds not 2 singles pushed together and amazing curtains that block out all trace of the morning sunshine which was a real bonus cos its get very bright very early! Breakfast is good, lots to choose from and was alway replenished. We didnt eat there in the evening but we did have drinks in the hotel bar, bar man was friendly, polite and spoke decent english. We felt very welcome. Reception gave us maps checking in/out was very easy. Gentleman on reception was exceptionally helpful and spoke very good english. Shuttle bus every morning and evening was brilliant, altho get there early as it fills up quickly!! - note to management we noticed a lot of guests from the near by Holiday Inn coming over to use the service which ment there was no spaces for people actually staying at the Z3! The hotel is a little bit of out the centre but only took 15 mins tops to get to Termini and we didnt find the location a set back at all. It isnt the easiest to find for the first time so..... If you are travelling by public transport. Take the B metro to Ponte Mammolo, as soon as you exit there is a bus station, Take the number 451 bus, get off at the 4th stop (looks like the middle of nowhere on a main road), get off bus and walk right about 200 yards and you should see the hotel, turn left and you are there!! or if you wait at the bus station you will see the shuttle bus with the hotel name on the side (this only runs 7.30-10.30am and 6-9.30pm)", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Forest, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNEXT TO A SAMS CLUB\u201d", "Author": "dianegggg", "ReviewID": "UR80574639", "Content": "this hotel is new - however it is located 30 euro outside of Rome.
