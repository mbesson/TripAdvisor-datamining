On the last day, the concierge returned our bags which had recent paint stains - he ignored us and said it was impossible for the bag to have got stained whilst they had them and the duty manager ignored us too, not giving any solutions and just saying \"we dont use that colour\" although it\u00b4s obvious there was paint as part of their renovation. It all ended when I asked for the complaint form and they said they dont actually have complaint forms, when I said they were legally required to do so, he said they were changing the format and offered to email me a feedback form that would be passed on to the general manager...guess what? I never got that email! His -and the concierge's- last nice touch was allowing me to carry the stained backpack which was about 20kg heavy, although I was obviously pregnant.

We queued to check in however, due to arriving early other guests were checking out so it was to be expected. Breakfast the next day was very very busy. There again was a very long queue so we decided to eat at Macdonalds up the road as we didn't want it to interfere with our day. No hassle and no problem with this. Checking out was easy and for a charge of \u00a31 per bag they kept them until we were ready to collect later in the day. (How reasonable is that?) All staff we dealt with were pleasant and helpful. As we decided not to use the tube at night we opted for a taxi. How pleased were we to find a rank outside. Even taxi drivers were pleasant throughout the whole weekend. They couldn't do enough for us. They even updated us when we got in the taxi to inform us that there had been an accident which meant a slight increase in cost as they had to go the longer way round.

Their website did not say (and still does not say) that the pool is actually undergoing renovation as well, but we read about it in one of these tripadvisor reviews before going to London. We phoned the travel agent with which we booked our room to complain about the lack of pool, and the travel agent convinced the hotel to upgrade us to english breakfast finstead of continental breakfast and to an executive room instead of a basic one...for the same price! Our newly renovated executive room was absolutely stunning, plenty of space for 2 people, everything new and beautiful, tea and coffee, and about 47 films to choose from, free of charge (they normally cost \u00c2\u00a37.5 each), the bathroom was very clean, with 2 free small bathfoam toiletries. The wifi only works in the lobby, but we knew that, and we went downstairs to sit in the comfy sofas in the lobby anytime we had to check our mails. English breakfast was simply delicious, we never had to queue and so did the other guests while we were eating, there's plenty of staff to look after you at breakfast, they accompany you to a table, and they serve you coffee and tea at the table, and they topup coffe and tea anytime you want. The rest of the breakfast is self service, and it is delicious. Our room was on the fifth floor and we were not disturbed by the noise, maybe thay had already finished with it, because we noticed it was much more noisy on some other floors. The location is amazing, only one minute from the tube, and many buses to Piccadilly. Kensington high street is lovely for shopping.

We will be absolutely sure never stay at this hotel or any associated chain, partners or associates again. The good points are that the staff are pleasant, the room was clean and the water hot, but that's where it ends. The staff were pleasant but pacified rather than helped. We were told on check-in that the building was under refurbishment, and work started at 8am each morning - this was the first we'd heard of it. We don't like being woken at 8am while on holiday. They assured us that we had been fully notified of this - a complete and utter falsehood, and I have all the emails to prove it. We asked that we relocate to a room where construction was not going to take place - this was waved away - words to the effect that, \"Construction was taking place all over the hotel, you could never know where or when, and maybe we'd be lucky and they wouldn't start near us tomorrow!\" We asked to speak to the manager, who was - naturally - in a meeting. So were all the senior supervisors, but they would be in contact with us as soon as it finished. Needless to say, they failed to do so. Heavy drilling that shook the room duly commenced at about 08:05 the next morning, and the morning after that. It was accompanied by hammering, grinding, and the sounds associated with very heavy construction. This was taking place across the entire hotel, rather than working on one evacuated wing at a time. The management attitude is screw the customers, we'll just brazen it out and be utter cowards - hiding behind the reception staff who take all the flak. Funnily enough that noise was absent from the early afternoon onwards - surely not because people would demand to check out immediately if they arrived at their rooms to find that unbelievable degree of noise and shaking? Fortunately we were only staying two nights. At check-out, the lady notably failed to ask if we enjoyed our stay, and didn't express any wish that we might return soon - that's a pretty big 'tell'. I imagine plenty of guests had sharp replies to such sentiments, and they had given up making them. The room itself was clean but incredibly small, the best feature was the kettle and teapot. Like another reviewer, my room's AC insisted on having it at a stuffy 25 degrees C, despite my repeatedly turning it down. Clearly it knew best and reset it to 25 every few minutes. The finish of the room betrayed workmanship based on speed rather than quality - a bathroom door which could not be opened or shut without a loud bang, loose fixtures, handles at odd angles, main doors which violently slammed shut, and so on. My own craftsmanship while fitting doors etc. is vastly better despite it being 1000 miles from my own profession, clearly these fitters had no pride or interest in their work. We were told that the spa was free because of this disgracefully intrusive disturbance (it simply said the spa included at the time of booking), unfortunately the main feature - the pool - was closed for maintenance. A good thing indeed we didn't even try eating there. Summary: When a hotel brags about an expensive refurbishment, it lends the impression that this must a good thing - the furnishings must be new. What one does not expect is to be shaken awake first thing in the morning while on holiday, and find themselves right at the heavy end, in the middle of, that refurbishment - with all the noise, vibration and dust associated. This hotel should have been closed for the duration. The management are greedy cowards.

The deal was reasonable, \u00c2\u00a3250 for 2 people (event, room and breakfast). ROOM: Me and my boyfriend were in a newly renovated room, can't complain, very nicely done out, small, but this is London, can't expect much more than that! However, we went with friends, their room was not renovated, all I can say is, renovation was WELL overdue! House keeping were more than happy to bring an ironing board/iron upon request. THE EVENT: Where do I start? What a joke. You can't enter the event through the hotel lobby, you have to go outside (in the rain) and queue with everyone else, even though some were not booked into stay at the hotel, only coming for the \"event\". Went to the (hotel) bar for the first round of drinks, I asked for Disaronno, a common drink, to be told, \"we don't have any\". Good start. Ok, Southern Comfort? \"we don't have any\" yes, you do, it's right there! All this was due to the fact they were only serving 5 spirits, whiskey, crap vodka and Archers, all \u00c2\u00a310 each with mixer. Rip off!! I ended up not drinking for the rest of the night, couldn't see the point in paying \u00c2\u00a310 for a drink I didn't even want! The music. House. House. House. Nothing else. There were 5 different rooms in this place, now, anywhere else I've ever been, they would be playing different music, oh no, not here, just house house house. This was not advertised on the website. In the \"main\" room, all the guy on the mic keep referring to was drugs. I even recorded this on my phone as evidence for complaining. He was asking the crowd for ketamine, saying thanks to people for the cocaine, disgraceful behavior in my opinion. If people choose to take drugs, that's their business, I do to expect to have it rammed down my throat by a bloody mc!!! The \"casino\" was a joke, 3 tables, couldn't get round one of them, when we finally got near, we found out it wasn't even for real money, what a joke, again, website VERY misleading. At this point, we actually decided to leave the hotel and go to a casino elsewhere, which we did, unfortunately we did not have any ID so were forced to go back to the event. We saw in the new year but had had more than enough by 1 and headed up. We had some drinks in our room which was when the fire alarm started going off. The hotel seemingly did nothing. It's like \"we've hired out the hotel for the night, not our problem\". In the morning, my friend said that she'd hardly slept due to the fire alarm continuing to go off for most of the night. She could not contact reception on the phone, no one was answering, which I've seen mentioned elsewhere on here. The alarm went off a few times in my room, but wasn't continuous, so that's something I guess. BREAKFAST: Average. That's all I can say. They constantly ran out of things, and rather than having more ready to replace it with, it was gonna be \"a few minutes\", no fried eggs, no sausages, no beans, no mushrooms. By the time they bought it out, they shut the doors 2 mins later and wouldn't let anyone else in!

There was plastic sheeting all down the corridors and as someone else has stated we were literally stepping over builders. A bit much in my view. Walking from reception you can glance over towards the bar and I thought to myself \"Im not having a drink there\". Just looked shabby. The Room, oh my God, the Room! Small, dingy, dated, smelly for starters. Horrible room. The matress on the bed was like a crisp bag. When you sat on it your backside went straight through to the base of the bed and you could feel the bedsprings through the duvet.

If I'm honest I was a bit put off by the other reviews on here but I believe that a number of people book this hotel via a third party in order to get a cheap deal - the hotel gives these customers the rooms which haven't been refurbished at the cheaper price - so all in all you get what you pay for so I would advise to book through the hotel direct. We didn't eat at the hotel and found the breakfast was quite expensive? Just across the road from the hotel is a very cute little cafe call The Muffin Man which was wonderful and does a brilliant breakfast at a very good rate which I wouldn't recommend!! The hotel is a two minute walk from the tube station and you can park at a local car park but this can be quite costly (it's free to park outside on a Sunday).

The rooms are absolutely disgusting. The double room we were allocated was so small that the bed was pushed right against the window - leaving access to the bed from one side only. The twin room was like a school dormitory. When we asked for another room we were told that the hotel was fully booked and if we wanted to upgrade, we would have to pay \u00c2\u00a330 per room. I argued that I shouldn't have to pay extra just to have a suitable room - it was what I had paid for already. While this was going on, the people either side of me were also complaining about their disgusting rooms. We were eventually upgraded and if this was their definition of an executive room, I despair. I have stayed in better Travelodge rooms - the rooms were small once again, old, tired and filthy - disgusting filthy net curtains, carpeting, water stains from previous floods. The heating was faulty in both rooms - the double didn't work at all (it was 2* outside) and the twin's broke in the night. The bathroom was so small - should any overweight person try and negotiate the pathway to the sink, they would be in real trouble - the gap was perhaps 20 inches at most! The next morning one of the guests in the twin woke up to find a prominent 'insect bite' on her arm that certainly wasn't there the night before. Breakfast was as expected - I can't tell you what the food tasted like because one look at it and I passed! I can say that it looked pretty grim and the diningroom was set out like a huge dormitory with cheap tables and chairs.

They are still small, but bigger than before. They have removed the baths thus making more space. The rooms include the usual bits. Hairdryer,TV, Full length mirror, Safe,Tea/Coffee/Water and plate of fruit which i thought was a nice touch. From what I could see they have upgraded a lot of the rooms, but not all.

It was decorated in an OK way - moderately tasteful - but was very rough around the edges in terms of shabby, grubby walls, curtains etc. The bathroom was in a similar state, but I must note that everywhere was VERY CLEAN.

I had to sleep on the same patch of bed all night because otherwise I would wince in reaction to the icy cold. I noticed a tiny little fan heater in the corner of the room which was probably an attempt on the hotel staff's behalf to stop people complaining and make everything OK. The same problem occurred in the bathroom - the floor was icy cold and it almost seemed as though the window was wide open even though it was closed. The shower was very nice. All in all, not a very enjoyable nights' sleep. I could have perhaps excused the shabby quality of the room, if the room conductions were warm enough to be comfortable, but that wasn't the case. All this cost \u00c2\u00a396 and the hotel is rated 4*... The downstairs decor and random butler man standing outside don't justify the room rate or the hotel rating.

I challenged this and suddenly we were into the \"my english is not so good\" mode - NOT happy, but it was nearly midnight, so went to my room thinking I would get this resolved in the morning. Room was ok, nothing to write home about and a few niggles including a dirty bathroom, a small CRT TV with access to only five channels and an air conditioning unit that kept turning itself on, making lots of noise and waking me up. Matress on bed had seen better days and seemed to taper down to the right side. Needless to say, sleep quality was poor. Breakfast the following morning was shocking - I was waiting for ten minutes to be seated ( only four other guests in front of me waiting to be seated, staff were clueless) and when I was seated, two of the serving staff decided to conduct a conversation leaning over my table in a foreign language. Quality of breakfast was sub standard, coffee was cheap and nasty, only streaky bacon available, generally everything was nasty apart from the hash browns. Go to check out and get told that there has been a bar bill charged to my room ( I did not go near the bar) at which point and explained that I had not been to the bar and raised my concerns about what happened with my card the night before - the only thing that was said repeatedly was that it was a mistake and I would not be charged. Got really annoyed with this and left a parting comment to this effect. Needless to say I will be keeping a very close eye on transactions on my account and the second I see anything fishy I will be in contact with both my bank & the police and will make them fully aware of what happened at this hotel with my card details. I have been in IT security for over ten years - I intend to find out who the PCI QSA was for this hotel and raise my concerns directly with them - My recommendation - DO NOT GIVE YOUR CARD DETAILS TO THIS HOTEL.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cReasonable rate, great location - shabby rooms\u201d", "Author": "Shiregirl", "ReviewID": "UR121028603", "Content": "Room was tiny, with tired bathroom which didn't look very clean.

There was construction all day on Sunday and every other day as well. We even got to enjoy one day without hot water. The staff was not at all helpful.

We new the hotel was undergoing refurbishment, so we expected it to be noisy between 8am & 5pm, but that didn't effect us that much as we were out between those times. We entered the standard twin room and my parents room was strongly smelling of paint fumes and mine was smelling very damp. I opened the windows and turned on the air conditioning which helped a bit! The toilets are so small in the en-suite, if you have a big bottom, you will find it hard to sit down, without being wedged between the walls.

The buffet had plenty choice, but was standard instant coffee and juice was from concentrate. In a 4 star hotel, I would think the standards would be higher. It also cost - \u00c2\u00a347!!! for 3 people Which gave me a shock! My advice it to go to high street turn left and walk a little till you reach \"Balans\" - they have an excellent choice - I had the \"Breakfast Burito, which is delicious! There are no evening meals apart from in the lounge area, but again we rather get our food from outside. In the Copthorne Tara next door they have a very nice Chinese Restaurant which have all the usual favourites and Singapore specialities, which were delicious.

We did have an issue, we brought the issue to the manager at the reception and then the duty manager and it was resolved PROMPTLY and to our satisfaction; b) our room was small - but obviously it fit the standard of the starring they were awarded otherwise they wouldn't have been awarded the star rating, BUT it was clean, bed comfortable and bedlinen immaculate; c)reasonable hight of shower in the bathroom - which you can change!!! so just adjust d)room has complimentary tray with selection of teas - coffees (including decaffinated) e) don't even want to comment on the TV and whether it's modern enough - if one comes to London, pays \u00c2\u00a3120 or so for the room and watches TV - well, it's their choice, however, most of the people wouldn't care - we didn't: there's a TV set, there are enough channels To cut it shorter, one should really 'shop' and look around what they are buying: we wanted good location, reasonable pricing (for London standards) and clean and comfortable room.

In this age of cable, how could any hotel offer only 5 channels? I get more English language channels in hotels in France and Spain! The room safe is as inconveniently located as they can possibly make it: on the floor of the closet. So, when you are placing things in, you need to get down on all fours. When you take things out, in order to see inside, you literally have to get down on your belly. There is no place to put your luggage to load and unload it (I'm told that some rooms have a luggage rack, but not all.)

And there you have it, a room with a nice big king. We had just got off a red eye flight from Canada and had to deal with this. We were too exhausted to deal with the fact that an employee lied to us and at this point too tired to change hotels. And then there was the construction. Frankly it was such a joke they really shouldn't have had the hotel open with so much construction. The jack hammering was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think.

How the city's official services gave the licence to make the works of reconstruction in such size and contemporaneously allow citizens to live in the building site? Why this hotel is open when the fire alarm and the evacuation which follows, is too frequent (almost every day)? Workers were just outside the windows on scaffolds and in the hallway outside the door of our tiny rooms! Wreckers move dangerous debris above our heads! The most disappointing was that the stuff (at all ranks) was uninterested, rude (with a tendesy to thievery). So, we spoke to a lawyer and now we gather evidence to make accusation against this hazardous \"hotel\".", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAwful\u201d", "Author": "Jackie297", "ReviewID": "UR116807647", "Content": "This hotel was very disappointing.

It was our first time in the UK and we were very excited! I had read the reviews of the hotel before leaving for our trip and was a little skeptical. When we first got there (around noon), we were in line at reception to check in with 4 other guests ahead of us. There was only 1 staff at the desk, with other staff going in and out of the back. It didn't occur to any of them, to help shorten the line and service the guests. 1 customer ahead of me was complaining about the construction of the hotel and that he upset that the website didn't indicate that the hotel was under construction. He would have chosen a different hotel for this reason, 1 customer was complaining about the size of the room and 1 customer was complaining about how he had paid for a double bed and was given a single bed. The response from the desk staff was that he was given a single bed because he was the only one staying in the room. I turned to my husband and told him not to expect too much from this hotel. We finally checked in (after 20 minutes of waiting in line) and went up to our room. It was a fairly small room, but that didn't bother us because we knew we weren't going to be spending much time in there. The room reminded me of a college dorm. Very small and simple. We quickly realized that the AC wasn't working and knew that we wanted to switch rooms. The weather was very hot oustide and we wanted to be able to have a good night sleep without waking up in full sweat. We didn't want to open our windows since construction was going on right outside and anyone would have been able to climb into the window. I went downstairs and told the staff member that I wanted to switch rooms and that I expected that they meet our request since we were staying for a week. I was told that they were fully booked, but that we would switch the next day after somone checked out. They told us to have our luggage packed and that they would move them to our room the next day when we were out sightseeing. The next day when we got our new room keys, I asked them if our luggage had been brought to our room and we were told that it had been. Needless to say, we were disappointed to find out that they were not in our room when we got there. I was upset and my husband called down to have them bring us our luggage. When the staff member came to our room with our luggage, he didn't knock at the door. He just opened it with a master key and walked right in. Not professional at all! We were very happy to learn that the AC worked in this room. The room was even smaller than the first one (our room on our cruise was even bigger), but it didn't bother us. What bothered us was that the toilet didn't flush. You would flush it once - nothing would go down. You would then have to wait for 10 minutes before flushing again before it to actually work. We had to do this everytime we went to the washroom. It was ridiculous!! At this point, I just didn't care anymore. We didn't want to ask to switch to a third room because we assumed that there would be something wrong with that room too and we just didn't have the patience anymore. We found a hotel nearby and used the toilets there at the end of each day before coming back to our hotel. After breakast, we would used the washroom on the main floor before heading out for the day. The next day after sightseeing when we got back to the room, my husband and I were upset to learn that the housekeeper left our windows open and our curtains wide open, We were not happy about this! Construction workers were working outside and could easily see into our room. If they liked something they saw, they could easily make there way in. I had to leave a note every morning to housekeeping asking them to not open anything when we were not in there. The spa in the hotel are only for sepcific guests. - depending on how much you paid for your room. Many groups stay at this hotel. I can see why! Great location! Shopping and tube station are just steps away! Breakfast was fine, Typical continental breakfast - both hot and cold foods. Other then the hotel being in a good location, this hotel had nothing to offer. It's worth spending more money to stay at a differen hotelt. It's just not worth saving a few bucks on this hotel.

We came across this hotel, for a very good price (we are a young couple, so this was important) and a convienient location for us (We wanted to shop, visit the London Dungeons, eat out etc). So we booked up for 3 nights- English breakfast included. We read the reviews AFTER booking, and in all honestly, we were very worried! The impression given was that the hotel was filthy, the staff were unhelpful and the main website was mis-leading. We found NONE of these to be true. Yes, the website shows of it's finest rooms available, and ours was not exactly luxury, but it served the purpose we were looking & paid for! THE ROOM- The room was clean, the bathroom was great (nice shower, spacious), and the room was not a bad size for central London accomodation. I'd say one improvement that could be made is the TV size & quality- In fairness, we weren't in much, but the one night we wanted to stay in and watch one of their many available films, we were slightly put off due to the TV size. The bed was also quite small, maybe my partner being 6 ft 4 didn't help matters, but otherwise it was comfortable. Renovations were happening throughout the hotel, which we were advised of prior to booking. They didn't effect us. THE SERVICE- The service was absolutely fine. Everyone that we encountered was very friendly, and happy to answer any queries. THE LOCATION- Right next to Kensington High Street tube! Very handy, although this tube station was shut for 2 days whilst we were staying due to engineering work. We had to walk around a mile to get to the next tube station at Gloucester Road. We managed to visit Picadilly Circus, Oxford Street & Tower Bridge over our stay, and it was easy to reach these destinations on the tube. FOOD- We didn't have a chance to eat at the hotel in the evening, however we ate breakfast every morning. There was a large selection of food, suitable for all. A full english cooked breakfast, which you helped yourself to. Cereal, fruit, yogurt, fruit juices, toast, croissants etc. All of the food we tried was lovely, the cooked breakfast was made to serve a large scale, so maybe not quite as tasty as a homemade breakfast, but more than acceptable. We can't comment on the leisure/spa side to the hotel as we didn't experience either of the things.

I have been in customer service for years and I also work in the hotel industry. They need some training on customer service. There was a fire alarm that sounded and we went down the stairs (we were on the 6th floor) only to find a backup of people at the 2nd floor. Someone from the hotel informed up false alarm and to go back to our rooms. We did and the alarms kept going on and off, we figured it was the construction that trip an alarm by accident. We kept looking in the hallway to see if others were leaving and they were not. Come to find out my friends that were on the 1st floor were outside with all the staff, about 50 employees waiting for an all clear from the fire department. My friends told an employee that they knew for a fact that not everyone was out because the mother and I were still up in the room because of an employee said to go back.

We had dinner in the restaurant which was on the 1st floor. due to the water leak (that is what caused the fire alarm,the pool area and spa were flooded) we ahd to enter the restaurant from the back stairs.

Firstly, the internet advertisement is completely false to what one encounters at this hotel. We were shocked by the appearance of the shoddy entrance and dirty carpeting in the foyer. The internet site claims that renovations are taking place in SOME areas of the hotel, whereas, the ENTIRE hotel is surrounded by scaffolding, in reality. The noise during renovation hours is unbearable and the drilling causes reverberating shudders in the reception area. There are NO GARDENS visible anywhere around the hotel so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the internet pictures of lush gardens lure you. The breakfast area is dull and dark; the reception is dilapidated; carpets and public toilets are dirty and the overall corridor looks nothing like the advert on the internet. Our room did not resemble the internet room AT ALL and we were forced to upgrade to a bearable room, at an additional fee of 300 pounds! Thus, we ended up paying 200 pounds per night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c certainly not worthy of this hotel. The upgraded room had minimal cupboard space and there are no drawers to place t-shirts in. Thus, we were forced to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclive our of our suitcases\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for an entire week! In the middle of our stay we were unable to sleep for two nights due to noisy guests. Security could not control the noise and they were smoking in their rooms and corridors the entire evening. So the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim of being a non-smoking hotel is also fictitious. When we questioned the staff about the discrepancy between the internet pictures and the disheartening reality, they claimed that this is what the hotel USED TO look like.... I found this false advertising preposterous in today's internet age and I seriously recommend that you DO NOT BOOK to go to this hotel. Overall, a big disappointment.

The breakfast was served in the Sports Bar as the restaurant is undergoing refurbishment. It was an interesting experience; a bit dark and with music channels on the TVs, it didn't create an atmosphere which encouraged you to linger over your meal. Another small thing was the lack of bread options - sliced for toasting or croissants - no bread rolls. Thought the small pastries were very tasty!

The positives stop there, unfortunately. I'd been warned about the building work and that I'd been \"upgraded\" to an executive room. The hotel's interpretation of an executive is clearly someone who enjoys all the same sorry, dated, furniture and decor from the 1970's the other rooms have, but in bigger surroundings. Terribly tatty, stained carpets, shower mould and peeling paint. Windows that opened directly onto the ubiquitous scaffolding outside. Corridors where the carpets are held together with gaffer tape and rain poured through the ceiling when the storms came earlier in the week. They're taking actual money from people for this, remember! The safe in the room didn't work. The TV provides five (that's a whole five!!) channels, three of which have poor reception and one, solitary radio channel that's anything close to being tuned in. The shower in my room didn't work. When it did, it was cold. There was often not even any hot water available from the taps, so my morning routine of a wash at the sink with cold water isn't one I'll miss anytime soon. Complaints about the faulty shower were never really resolved, although it was suggested I come downstairs with my toiletries and use the showers in the gym. Well that's alright then. On to the building work. Whoever took the decision to let the rooms on the 7th floor when the building work was going on directly above should be sacked at best. The drilling began every morning just after 8am, and by drilling, I'm not talking your average Black & Decker hand-drill putting up some shelves. This was large, pneumatic drilling, working on what sounded like concrete floors and walls. On more than one occasion, this was DIRECTLY above my room. Every fixture and fitting in the room was shaking from the vibrations - the noise was way above anything even remotely acceptable by health and safety standards; it was genuinely deafening. Complaints were met with 'we're having building work done, it was advertised and we can't move you as the hotel is full'.

On the surface it looked like a very good deal for a four star hotel, but beware....The hotel is NOT worthy of a four star rating and there is no way the saving from rack rate (as presented on the website) is real. They could not charge the rate they say is their usual given the appalling state of the place, The bedroom on the website bore no resemblance to the one we stayed in, which was cramped and shabby, and I have experienced far superior facilities (TV, tea and coffee tray) in a two star hotel. We could not access the inclusive internet service, were given wrong information about blockbuster films being included, had an over bath shower that leaked despite the curtain being correctly positioned, and after one look at the 'spa' would not enter the facility. It took five attempts at breakfast to get a member of staff to produce a pot of tea. We complained afterwards and were offered a return where we would get a complimentary upgrade - I can honestly say I would not use this hotel again, even if the room was offered free. The excuse for everything is about the hotel undergoing refurbishment - a total red herring.

The room was warm, the bed comfortable, the TV worked (only 5 channels), hot water was there whenever I needed and the elevators were in service the whole time. The hotel staff was very friendly and went out of their way to answer our questions and show us around. The pool and exercise area are nicer than a health club. My room was very clean and well-maintained, but my maid wasn't very generous with the shampoo and bath gel. I'm used to getting replenished each morning. The tea pot in my room only came with two Nescafe pouches and one tea bag. I would've expected a better selection from a $250 a night hotel. Our package included the full English breakfast. I'm surprised that with National Health Care the Brits are allowed to eat so much cholesterol - I absolutely loved it!! And so did the many many other guests seemingly from all over the World. Everyone's plate was piled high with hash browns, scrambled or fried eggs, beans, grilled tomato, mushrooms, that incredibly delicious yet dangerous English bacon and breakfast sausages that taste infinitely better than anything I've ever had in the States. There are 5 kinds of juices, coffee, a variety of teas, hot chocolate (necessary in that English winter weather), porridge, fruits, lots and lots of breads and rolls. This was a great place to try out English marmalades - yeccch! The place was quiet being off the main drag, there were always cabs available outside the lobby doors (except when we needed one at 5:00 am to get out to Heathrow), it's only a block from the Kensington High Street Tube (not exactly the easiest stop to get to however since other District and Circle line trains always seem to be heading the wrong way), the Muffin Man tea room is half a block away and a cute little place to enjoy the obligatory English tea, there are plenty of inexpensive chain restaurants nearby as well as a Wagamama two blocks from the Tube station. It doesn't take much effort to find an \"authentic\" English pub in the immediate area. For those that don't mind a stroll, the neighborhood is very safe and there are some pretty wealthy folks living in the area judging by the Porsches, Ferraris, Lambos and Audi R8s parked nearby. Just a ten minute walk south on Cromwell Road will take you to a huge Sainsbury's store where you can load up on snacks and find soft drinks for under \u00c2\u00a32.00 a bottle. There are s few negatives - While the concierge desk was extremely helpful with directions, suggestions and early arrival luggage storage, someone REALLY dropped the ball when we asked them to book us an early morning cab to Heathrow. We had been told that in order to make our 8 am flight we couldn't use the Tube since it didn't open until after 5 am. The kind concierge suggested sharing a cab. The three of us could ride out to the airport in a mere half hour for a negotiated rate of \u00c2\u00a345. We agreed and the concierge wrote down our requested departure time and names. That evening a different concierge was on duty. My wife reconfirmed with him. \"No problem\" we were told. In the morning when we checked out and prepared to leave, yet another concierge was on duty. He knew nothing about the cab request. He tried calling for one and none were available. Finally a cab came by as he dropped off another fare. The concierge helped us with the bags and we drove off. A few blocks from the hotel we asked if the concierge had negotiated the same \u00c2\u00a345 rate for us. The driver said that our cab only ran on the meter, but the rate would be \"about\" the same. Since we were leaving the UK we had pretty much spent all of our on hand cash the night before and on tipping the hotel staff that morning. We only had a little over \u00c2\u00a350 in cash. As I watched the cab's meter click up .20 every few seconds I also noticed a sign inside the cab stating that credit cards were not accepted. We had already reached \u00c2\u00a340 before even reaching the Heathrow exit. I imagined having to hop out of the cab miles from the terminal once we hit the \u00c2\u00a350 mark. Somehow my wife found enough extra change in her pocket to pay the cabbie when we arrived at Terminal 4 to the tune of \u00c2\u00a356.20. Sorry, but no tip for the cab driver. Needless to say, we were not happy with the concierge's desk after that embarassment. There was also construction work going on about the scaffolding all around the hotel. At 8 am the workers started, even on Saturday. Fortunately we were getting early starts as well, but this might be a huge pain in the rear for someone hoping to sleep in. I would assume this work will be done by the much busier summer season. However, even in the the dead of February there were a couple of high school age tour groups staying in the hotel. Back in the rear of the hotel where my room was located I had no problem with them, but walking toward the elevators I could hear kids carrying on in the hallways. Once school's out I suspect the Kensington Close will be hosting many more school kids. Insist on a room on a different floor. Nearby sites are the Victoria and Albert Museum, Kensington Palace, Albert Hall and Memorial and the Science Museum. In addition to the nearby Tube, you can use the convenient #10 bus to take you up through the shopping area of Kensington and to Hyde Park and Marble Arch. My overall impression of the Kensington Close is quite favorable, but I am probably also subconciously factoring in the great time we had coupled with the outstanding package we had purchased. If I were paying the standard $200+ room rate without breakfast, I would probably have a much different opinion. But then again, the days of the sub $50 room in London are pretty well gone. One last note: the hotel does have WiFi, but at \u00c2\u00a315 a day, the rate is insane. A block away, inside the Kensington High Street Tube station the Pret a Manger sandwich shop was free WiFi.

When we arrived to check in there was a queue in front of us which was understandable as it was peak time for check in. When I finally got to check in I was met by the receptionist who was not one bit friendly. No apology for the wait or anything when I told her my name for booking she had all the details on screen, i had signed in and she walked away from me to see could she find a room to suit us as she didnt think she did. When she returned then we asked to pay in full as it would be easier for us. On top of this she charged us an extra 80 pounds as guarantee that would be given back on check out. I felt this was a bit steep and surely if there was no deposit paid then it should not be possible to charge to our room?? When we got to our room there was a double and single bed which was suitable for us.However the bathroom was dirty - the bath wasnt clean properly but other than that it was ok. There was no information booklet in the room to inform us of any of the hotel facilities. On the double bed there was no proper duvet more like a heavy sheet that didnt cover the full bed.

The rooms are small - your in central London you don't get large rooms unless you spend a lot! Room Is big enough and the bathroom has full bath with a shower again not something I have found often!

The room itself was old and falling apart and the bathroom and toilet were not even clean. The shower was probably made in the 1950's as was the laughable television. The bed was basically a wooden block with a mattress on. Even with the room being this c**p I thought, who cares, I'm only sleeping here. Proceeding into the bathroom for a shower was like walking into a swimming pool - without even being used the tiolet had flooded over and covered the bathroom and part of the bedreeom floor. These things happen ofcourse, so with the inconvenience of missing a shower due to a restaurant booking elsewhere we proceeded to reception. Upon informing the staff of this we were told the room would be made ready for when we returned - no offer of a new room. How ridiculous. Ofcourse we asked for a new room and they said they would have one ready for when we got back. 1am - And we return for our night out ready for bed - new room key in hand we enter to find we have been given a twin room, rather than the double we booked. Back to reception to change rooms AGAIN and finally a double bed - ofcourse both rooms featured the same awful presentation as before. To top it all, after all this hassel we had a lovely veiw of the inside of a construction site from the window - no special treatment for being messed around at all. No apology, no nothing.

However I am never received such appaling service before from a hotel. Upon arrival we we asked to give our credit card details so they could charge any extras to the room, we had already prepaid for the rooms so asked if we could decline from doing this as we would not be using any of the hotel restaurants or bars. This was refused and they insisted on card details for preauthorisation, I handed over my card and was appalled that they tried to charge \u00c2\u00a3400, I was not made aware of this high preauthorisation amount required on booking. The staff were extremely unhelpful with this and did not seem to appreciate that it was such a high amount they were asking for and threatened to cancel our reservation if we did not proceed with the preauthorisation!!! The rooms were simply tiny and ridiculous for the amount charged, we had a twin and there was not any space between the beds and it was more like sharing a double. There was no room for luggage in the room and we actually had to place our things in a colleagues room who had a bed spare. The TV didnt work at first and when it did the picture was unclear and only the basic 5 channels were available, quite suprising in the days of Freeview!!! The bathroom wasnt as clean as one would expect and the general hotel decor was very tired and certainly not how the website portrayed. Another thing the hotel boasts is being a spa hotel on its webpage, however when I tried to use the pool at 8pm after a busy day it was actually shut. I contacted reception to be told they had to be notified before you wanted to use it and there was actually an \u00c2\u00a38 charge to use it! I have never known a hotel to charge residents to use its facilties before - especially when paying over \u00c2\u00a3150 per night!!!!

The duty manager told me that I was going to be charged for the room if I left so I lost it! I went back up to the queue which had around 10 people in it and in a very loud voice carried out the discussion with the duty manager while waving my window sill with nails sticking out of it. After 10 minutes of this I told him that I would make it my business to bring the hotel to court if they charged me. The best he could offer me was to ask me to reconsider leaving and if I did then he would have to get clearence from the GM the following day to refund my money..........talk about lack of power, they put him charge of a hotel but wont give him discrecion over 69 quid? Anyway they got their sill back, I left and the following day in fairness they called to confirm they wont charge me but the moral of the story is if it looks crap, reviews crap, sounds crap then it nearly always is crap!

Ten minutes went by and he came up to me and said they had no fresh fish. I said that was OK I would have the fish goujons instead. Ten minutes later he returned and said they had run out of chunky chips. I then asked if they had any potatos .... he said yes did I want them instead. I started to laugh at this point and said please tell the chef to get the potatos, peel them, cut them into chunky sections and deep fry them.

The idea was to stay somewhere quite cheap as we wouldn't spend much time there but quite nice at the same time. This hotel pretty much fitted the bill - cheap for a four star so it wasn't vile but then it wasn't amazing. If I hadn't got a cheap deal I would never have even considered staying there. The downstairs was quite nice but there always seemed to be a massive queue for reception. I was glad that at check out all you have to do is drop your key in a bin otherwise we would've missed the train home. The room wasn't as bad as what I had read on here. It seemed tidy, nicely decorated and wasn't as tiny as everyone seems to make out. (Though it's not exactly huge either.) It could have done with a spot of work though, the electricity plugs were in highly unuseful places, the bar holding the shower curtain up had broken, as had the loo roll holder and the tv was tiny. I work in a 3* hotel myself and our tv's are double the size! However none of that really affected the trip, that's just me being fussy. What was annoying was the bed was on wheels and it moved about at the slightest movement. There was also an incredibly loud genorator outside the window (even though we were on 7th floor). The main annoyance was the heating. February this year was freezing, it snowed the whole time we were in Londonso when we came into the hotel from the cold, going into a cold room was not nice. then if you want the heating on it whirs away so loudly you don't get any sleep. So you have two choices - get no sleep due to the freezing temperatures or get no sleep due to the very very noisy heating. (I imagine this isn't a problem in summer!) One last thing that was annoying was the location. I thought circle line was a good choice but when we were there the circle line seemed to close early in the evening and the district line never went straight there, We had to go to Earl's court and then change to another district train. I was late for my dinner reservations because of this. I would not stay here again and I would not recommend to a friend just because I think you could find something better.

It is lso true that I encountered staff who had limited English and were unable to understand some basic questions (which was rather frustrating-especially when attempting to order drinks at the bar). This proved to be annoying when I went down for breakfast in the morning. The lady was supervising the busy restaurant told me that I had not paid for breakfast (when in fact my company had) and after supposedly checking by phoning reception, told me that I definitely had not. This then necessitated my going to reception to check myself, and the receptionist coming back with me so that I waas allowed in. As breakfast was a very busy affair, this whole process took 15 minutes, which was not ideal as I had an appointment inthe office I had to make, and almost skipped breakfast as a result.

This hotel is great for guests who want to spend a night/weekend close to central London. The price we paid was reasonable value for money in Kensington. You would pay a lot more to have a better room elsewhere in the area. However, I have stayed in other hotels in London for example in Greenwich (about 15mins from the centre by train) for significantly cheaper with better rooms. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. However, the room we stayed in was tiny. The double bed was pushed against the wall and there was barely enough room for two people to get ready at the same time. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the bedroom and bathroom was very tired and there were very basic and limited toiletries provided. There is a general feeling that the hotel is uncared for and the bare minimum is provided for the guests. The stairs to the fire escape looked like they had not been cleaned for years, many of the staff appeared tired/abrupt (however some were very friendly and helpful). The hotels website did not make clear that the (normal) car parking is actually the same price as the valet parking which is \u00c2\u00a332 per day. The car keys are left in reception as hotel staff may need to move the car during the stay. However, our experience was that staff seemed reluctant/not very confident in manoeuvring a car to allow us to get out of the car park at the end of our stay. We are also not advised that the hotel was within the congestion charge zone (although we had already researched this before our visit). There is also an extra charge for using the swimming pool and gym (\u00c2\u00a38 per day).

Rooms are absolutely tiny but ours was fairly clean: the bathroom was immaculate, sheets and towels were changed daily.

Very close to the underground! Also very close to Kensington High Street with a big variety of shops and restaurants, such as Urban Outfitters which kept me very happy :) There is even a cimena, which I went to at night time. There is also a little cafe called 'The Muffin Man' just a few steps from the hotel entrance, which served sandwiches, hot food, cakes, buns and snacks and stayed open 'till about 8pm I think which I ate in lots of times. I stayed here for four nights, but I wish I had stayed longer. The hotel is also beside the EMI music studios, so I thought that was cool :) The concierge was very helpful! The friendly man managed to book us tickets for things such as The London Eye & Madama Tussauds so we didn't have to queue. We really appreciated this. Despite all these advantages, there were a few downsides. The rooms were quite small I suppose, as stated before, but when you're visiting London, you want to get out and see the exciting city, not sit in your hotel room all day. Another dissapointment for me was that you had to pay extra for use of the hotel swimming pool, which I found very strange, considering the price for staying at the hotel. I can't remember much about the breakfasts, but I don't remember ever being hungry! They must have been adequate enough to satisfy me :) All in all, I enjoyed my stay here and if I was travelling to London again I am fairly confident that I would be more than happy to stay at this hotel again. Just a few words of advice for those travelling to London... if time permits, try to see at least one show. I recomend 'The Lion King' which I have seen twice, but still want to see again sometime. Also, be very wary of pickpockets!

We had to extend again, still no flight so he went back to reservation, requested that breakfast be removed from the room and he was given a rate of 109lb. We then had to extend again and they put him through on the phone to reservation who quoted him 79lb for Thursday. Having been given this information we decided to stay put since this is where our transfer from the airport would leave from. Many of the other travelers that were on our same tour went to another hotel because of the rates. But we felt that with these rates our travel insurance would cover us. Let me add that we had 2 rooms at these rates as there were 5 of us traveling. We finally got a flight on Friday. 30 minutes prior to our departure we went down to check out only to find out that the rates that my husband had quoted had not been honored. The Tues & Wed that he was quoted 109, we were billed 149. The last day we were given the 79 on one room, but the other was 109. We spent 40 minutes trying to get some satisfaction before we had to just sign it and go since our transfer was waiting for us. They did not budge 1lb. He would not even explain why we were charged different rates on the last day. He even tried to pull that these were the rates because of the volcano and that they had a lot of bookings even though we know that there were many cancellations because people couldn't get in. We had looked into renting a holiday rental on Wed. We went to talk to them Tues. night about checking out Wed. and they said we'd be charged because it wasn't 24 hour cancellation. There was ZERO assistance or consideration for all the travelers that were stranded. Here at home people were telling me how in Orlando, stranded travelers were being given free rooms and free tickets to the theme parks. We didn't get one break until we got home and were given a discount on the additional days that our car had been parked. The lesson learned and the advice I'd give to travelers, get everything in writing and not only the name of the person, but have them sign it. They don't honor what each other say and did nothing to help us in a bad situation. And don't get ripped off paying for the in room internet. 15 pounds and we constantly had to reconnect. Also, keep your bag on your lap. My mother's wallet was picked while we were sitting in the Lion's Pub. The gentleman in the pub was very concerned when we bought it to his attention and said he'd have someone talk to us before we checked out, but no one contacted us.

It is always clean - even if some rooms are tired; the staff are always efficient. I usually get good prices (booking direct in their site rather than through third parties); and the gym and pool are great. I don't mind paying an extra \u00c2\u00a38 for the gym when the room is so reasonably priced.

A hotel that really, Tries!\u201d", "Author": "renwaaarr", "ReviewID": "UR58351405", "Content": "1st of all, from reading the reviews, I was wholly prepared to be under whelmed by my room size....and I was pleasantly surprised! All I wanted was a single room for a solo traveler. Wasn't the jazziest of rooms...heh...but size was, fine! A desk with an uncomfortable, no arms, straight back chair, a TV, and a window that actually opened, right next to the bed, a bathroom that was fine for showering. The 5 channels on the TV, was ok...and if one wanted---well--for a few lbs, more you can get a bunch of channels with a variety of themes. 1 day I bought the International news channel network, and sure enough---the CNN's and FOX's of the world are on dozens of channels. Was a little complicated to operate but, I liked it for a day. I will say this about The Kensington Close.... They try really hard to be a 4 star hotel. I applaud that....and for the most part, they achieve that star rating. In some aspects they exceed it. Some, fall below that status. For instance, they have an extensive menu for room service...but the impressive part is, it is a 24 hr, 7 days a week service. Including alcohol. Amazing! That is a 5 star service. Then, there's the pool and the whirlpool. There are tons of 5 star hotels that don't have that and the pool at the Kensington Close is an EXCELLENT pool. That they charge 8 lbs a day to use it is a blessing and well worth it! Keeps the so called..haha..riff-raff out. I always had a lane to swim and the intense, steam room was virtually empty for the 3 days I used it. The whirlpool was tiny...but exhilarating. I was in it every day for a 1/2 hr each day and was the only one in it, every day. That's good, but, if there were another in there, it would be very close quarters, and if you went crazy and had 3 in there, knees would be touching. As it was, tho, it was perfect for 1...and that's what I had. A little bonus, if your room is around or AT---#645, the elevator, takes you virtually from the pool, to your room! In fact, where my room was-----I had, what was almost----a private elevator. Hard to explain how behind the scenes my elevator was....but it was a direct shot from the pool, below the 1st fl, to my room, . And btw---it is NOT, the main elevator. Ask about it. Because that must be an incredible benefit, in a large hotel. Then, there is...24 hr concierge service. I could be wrong about that, but, at every hr of the day, that I happened by the lobby, of which, there were many hrs, in the wee-ist of the morning.... lol----.there was a guy there at the concierge desk. Just to start with, there was the Super Bowl on TV at the Sports Bar, on a Sunday night at 11:30 PM. That game is over at 3:30 AM. I only hung until hafltime, and watched the rest in my room... but...heh...the concierge, was there. As he was at all my late night hours. That is another 5 star quality. Never tried the restaurant or breakfast, because that just didn't fit into my schedule. I swam at breakfast and was out and about for the rest of the time. I used the room service a lot. Here's a pretty good service that, the hotel, probably doesn't even know it provides. There is a 3 lb charge for room service. Twice, I called down and asked them to bring up 2 champagne buckets full of ice, so I can keep my champagne, and Belgian Beer, cold. As was always the case, within minutes, there was a beautiful girl with a tray full of 2 filled champagne buckets. What is even nicer about this was...in, ice-NOT, crazy Europe, one invariably has to go to the local supermarket, and lug a bag or 2 of ice back to the hotel....costing----3 lbs! To Americans that might sound stupid, because... heh...even the seediest of, MOTELS, have ice machines for free. That's why that room service charge, was a virtual steal. Room service overall, was very, very good. I even had a real dinner one night at....3 AM. Beer and all! Food was good too..tho...I'm not a picky guy. I was just stunned...I could be doing that at 3 AM....and, was able to. I did hit the aforementioned, Sports Bar they have. Nice atmosphere...but, just a bit uncomfortable for a solo traveler, since the only places you could sit, were in chairs at, 3 and 4 or more...people tables. No barstools. Very crowded on Fri and Sat nights. Was a half filled crowd for the Super Bowl and the sound was very low...if at all, on. All one could hear was the buzz of people talking. If you turn your head for a minute, you would easily miss a play or 2. There is something to having the volume raised, especially, for the Super Bowl. It's almost too much work to be riveted to the TV, without sound, to keep up with the game. You want to HEAR the announcers. If you're talking with someone and hear, \"Manning fades back..........there's a longggggg bomb to Wayne.................TOUCHDOWN!!.....\". Well...when I hear the beginning of that, I'm paying attention and not missing anything. If that same sequence happens, and there is no sound....well...you're still listening to someone talking about little Johnny's 4th grade field trip...lol. When you look up---- You see a touchdown was scored. Anyway...that bugged the hell out of me. No Sound. I only watched the 1st half there. They need a little polishing up, over there, on how to watch a Super Bowl...heh. The bartenders are good, there...but the beer list is limited. The computer center was unbelievably busy for lots of the time. Is a drab area but bustled. What was more amazing was, these people pay 1 lb, for 10 minutes. I did it once....but found out...if I don't use all my time...I just lose it as soon as I leave. I only used it once, and that was fine. I took a pic of it, empty. You at least can see it's non-charm. The counter personal were stand out. They even got me a room ahead of many others, because I was so jet lagged. (check in was at 2 PM and I was there at 8 AM, due to leaving Phila Airport, 4 hours earlier on the flight before, due to a blizzard starting). I only had to dabble for about 3 hrs before they got me in. The tube stop is close and if you take the tube, to and fro, Heathrow--you will save, $85, (EACH WAY), and get there, 60 % quicker, with no traffic, in an uncrowded tube. It's almost too much to pass up. And I didn't. Was the 1st time I ever tried it...and it was fantastic! Was faster, and more efficient, and except for the 150 yards you have ] to walk from the hotel to the tube stop---is almost as effortless as a taxi door to door.. Over all...The Kensington Close earns a 4 star...or close to it. Not over 4 tho. My room was blase' at best. Even the hallways could use some brightening up. Everything was clean, but the drabbiness of the carpets & walls were evident. Certainly, not enough up there to not endorse this hotel. You get everything they say they offer.

We found the staff in the bar to be absolutely atrocious, very unhelpful, and one barman in particular stood out as being particularly rude and unwilling to offer any service whatsoever. Concierge were at times helpful, opening the door and the like, but on other occassions would be standing around looking very disinterested and would watch you struggle with the doors and not offer any assistance. There did always seem to be a lot of staff around in Reception, but there were always queues, with no system in place to manage these i.e express check out, key drop, concierge cutting keys etc, so you had to line up for the smallest of queries. Our room didnt get serviced on the Saturday, and the trolley was in the same place in the corridor as when we left early in the morning, so we did wonder what the housekeepers were actually up to. If you are after a nice cup of tea and cake/muffin there is a little local cafe, The Muffin Man 20 metres from the entrance of the hotel heading towards High St Kensington. The Thai restaurant on the opposite corner served tasty meals and is open until midnight on Friday n Saturdays which proved very handy for us. For a tasty pancake (breakfast, lunch or dinner) head up to High St Kensington, turn right heading towards the city and the first street on the left has 'The Old Dutch' which serves up massive pancakes taking up half the table of all different flavours, along with some dutch favourites of Bitterballen and Cheese balls.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDodgy plumbing\u201d", "Author": "Ribby34", "ReviewID": "UR53788533", "Content": "I was so pleased to only being staying one night at this hotel.

It is close to Kensington High Street tube station and also to Olympia and Earls Court in the opposite direction. On arrival I was greeted by the friendliest, most helpful doorman I've ever encountered, there was a small queue at reception, but this quickly went down and I was greeted by a friendly receptionist. The public areas of the hotel are a little dated but mainly smart, there are two restaurants and a bar. The bar has a sports bar feel, there is one small restautant and one larger one. I only ate in the smaller one - I can't remember the name but it is painted blue. The food was very good (although quite expensive - about \u00c2\u00a340 a head for three courses and drinks so when you're in London you might as well go out somewhere more special for this price), and also there was a slight chlorine smell from the pool in the restaurant which was a little off putting. My room was a twin room and was a little shabby and basic for a 4 star hotel. The TV was very small, (and not LCD), no biscuits to go with tea and coffee, no dressing gown. The room was small - it was just me staying in it which was ok, but I don't know how I would have coped sharing with another person. The bathroom was again shabby, but it was very clean, as were all the towels and sheets. There was no shortage of mirrors - a large one in the bathroom and then two (including a full length) in the bedroom. The bed was fairly comfortable, although the sheets were a litte thin for winter (I ended up wearing a jumper in bed!). One major critisism was that once all the lights were turned off, quite a lot of light from the corridor still came in from under the door so I had to block this with a towel. Also lots of the guests allowed their doors to slam shut in the middle of the night so I had one gfairly disturbed night of sleep - the walls must be quite thin as I could hear the guests in the next room talking ALL night, but then I found out that there was a Stag party going on, so this was probably a one off. The breakfast was ok, but not of particularly good quality although there was plenty of choice - continental or english. Some of my colleagues used the gym and pool facilities and said they were of a good standard. One feature whihc stood out to me was thee friendliness of all the staff, they were very pleasant and helpful even though the hotel was fuull both nights. Overall, I had a fairly good stay and if you weren't bothered about quality accommodation and could get this at a good rate for a trip to London then I would recommend this hotel.

We left our bags with the concierge after a very long wait and went to our room. The room itself didn't smell fresh, was tiny with a very old TV with only 4 channels that didn't work very well. The bathroom had mildew, was also tiny and floor was treacherous when wet. We weren't in our room for 5 minutes when 3 members of staff individually knocked on the door looking for bags that they had obviously put in the wrong room and now couldn't find. We went down for breakfast the next morning at about 9.40 and were promptly ignore by several members of staff. When we stopped one to ask where to sit we were told that breakfast was over - when I then questioned this stating that breakfast finishes at 10, the waitress responded by saying \"isn't it 10 yet?\". We were then waved to a seat and then promptly ignored. We had to find our own tea and coffee, weren't offered any toast (this wasn't self service) and had to find our own way around.

When the coffee arrived it was weak and tasteless, the croissants were as anemic as the white fat they are made of (you know the type that you can taste the grease of for the rest of the day), and the muesli resembled floor sweepings with lots of added sugar.

When we got to our twin room, my brother and myself discovered that not only was there no gap at all between the beds, but they occupied virtually all the space in the very tiny room. There was no space whatsoever between the foot of the beds and the wall - they were literally wedged into a space exactly the length of the bed - so the only way to get to the bed nearest the window was to climb over the first one. Utterly preposterous in an establishment that describes itself as 4 star. On the evening of the second day of our stay, I went to reception and joined a queue of people waiting to complain about the size of their rooms. It seems every room in the hotel is ridiculously small. I asked the manager on duty to come to my room and look at it, and when he arrived asked him how he proposed I get to the bed nearest the window. He agreed that the room was unacceptable for sale as a twin room, and arranged for an upgrade to an executive twin. I was about to go out for dinner, and the room wasn't ready, so we agreed that the keys would be waiting for me at reception when we returned that evening. They weren't. I got a long-winded, and patently untrue, explanation from the night manager as to why the room had become unavailable. I suspect they'd given it to one of the many other people who were complaining about the size of their rooms while we were out. In the end, the night manager offered me a complimentary Continental Breakfast or a glass of wine. He wouldn't even stretch to a full English Breakfast. Awful hotel. Some of the staff are very good - they clearly know that the place is a joke, but do their best anyway. Some of the reception staff, including a hair-gelled young man in a trendy but bad suit( by the name of Simon?) are arrogant, supercilious and generally unpleasant.

Main reason for having chosen this hotel was for its location in Hi St Ken - only 3 minutes walk from the tube station and yet not disturbed by the tube noise. (was familiar with the area from many years ago) Upon check in, we were told that our rate did not include breakfast, when it was clearly stated that breakfast was included for the entire stay on our HotelZon confirmation which we had printed out from the website. When I showed it to them, their front desk staff said \"Well, my copy doesnt say so. I don't know where you got yours from.\" And she smiled widely. We politely asked her to check with HotelZon on this matter and to get back to us. She merely said \"I'm sorry, you will have to take it up with HotelZon. We don't deal with them. You can call them tomorrow morning yourself.\" Of course we were furious by the remarks and demanded to see the manager, who was next to the staff we were speaking to the whole time, and did not bother to better the situation until we demanded to see him. He said to us \"Yes, I was overhearing the conversation. I'm sorry it's Sunday today and I'm sure HotelZon isnt working today.\" He said he would call them the next day and get back to us, but of course no news from him after that. My confirmation also said \"Room comes with internet\" but when i asked, they said, yes, the wi-fi is reacheable in your room, but it will be charged at GBP5 per hour. It didnt say comes with FREE internet! Apart from that, the lobby was always very crowded and we waited for about 30 minutes for our check in. Only 5 arm chairs available for seating and there's always a queue to check in. The room we had was very simple, quite small but adequate. The safe deposit box didn't work. Moderately clean with a small tv and tea/coffee making facilities and no minibar. However - the window had big, long gaps and we could feel strong cold draught in the room! We switched on the heater but the room was still very cold. I had to stuff a towel along the gaps in an attempt to avoid being frozen in my sleep. Their housekeeping, for two consecutive mornings, were punctual to knock our door at 8am to clean the room, when we hadn't put up the make up room sign, and we had chained the door. This did not help after a bad night's sleep. Upon check out, they managed to irritate us again - I asked if the room was needed immediately, else we would like to request for a checkout at 2pm instead of 12pm if possible. Another very smiley staff said \"Sure, of course! Not a problem...You will be charged 10 pounds per hour. So that would be a total of 20 pounds.\" And there was a small sign on the counter that wrote \"Late Check Out Promotion - only 10 pounds per hour!\". I've never seen anything like this before. If you want to stay in High St Kensington area (lots of shopping and good food! Whole Foods Market and big Marks & Spencer are there too), try Copthorne Tara or Royal Garden.

A very soft comfortable king size bed with plenty of pillows and a nice snug duvet. The room was hot and I had to open a window although I was on the road side of the hotel so there was slight noise but I slept through it. The bathroom was very compact but was good for it's purpose. You had a bath with a shower as well and om my god the shower was powerful and amazing. Next was down to the Conservatory meeting room for a buffet style meal with my colleagues. The food was fantastic and very tasty, no complaints there. Next onto the Lions Sports Bar, very dark wood based furniture in here but was very homely and warm feeling. Felt like a pub from back home in Manchester. Drinks a bit pricey but hey you are in London. Breakfast was served in the Blue Smoke Steakouse restaurant but we had a private dining package but meals normally served in Senses restaurant. This was a self service buffet breakfast with a choice of continental breakfast or a full english breakfast. Staff couldn't help you quick enough. We spent the day at leisure and even had a few treatments in the spa. You are about a 2 minute walk from Kensington High street which I can recommend for the shopping. I had an Elemis Muscle Melt Back Massage and I can highly recommend this for getting all the tension knots out of your back. I had a girl called Emma perform the massage and she was amazing, highly recommended. Next for the evening meal, we dined in the Blue Smoke Steakhouse once again but it was also private dining again for us. We had a set menu but with a couple of options. Staff were amazing and our wine glasses did not go empty at all. They could not of done enough for us. However only one young girl was serving and it looked like she was running the hotel single handedly by serving water, wine, meals to a big group of about 17 of us. Well back to the bar for us and again very homely feeling and friendly staff. Well sunday morning came and check out time. We asked the Consierge to order us enough taxies for 15 people to take us to Euston and he ordered 3 of what we thought were black cabs and was told \u00c2\u00a355.00 for all 3 taxis and we could pay one driver. Well one taxi turned up and it could only take 4 people. We had a little arguement with the consierge who said we told him we only needed 3 taxis and we did tell him 15 people. In the end we jump in 3 black cabs from the taxi rank straight across from the hotel. Taxi driver later advised us never trust the hotel to book your taxies as they are making commission on it. I tend to agree with the black cab driver. In result of the mess up with taxies we missed our train back to manchester. All in all a very good hotel and a very good location.

Caught the train from Waterloo station for a day trip to Windsor. Excellent, about one hour train ride. The cost is 9 pounds per person round trip. All in all the Kensington Close met my needs. We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants. Kind of expensive. Of course everything is in London. Ate at Hard Rock for $30.00 for two and ate at Friday's for $40.00 for two. Harrod;s was unreal. About $28.00 for a hot dog. Oh yeah, you do get fries with it! We had a great time.

Reception queues can be long, although the Corporate check-in offers a much faster service. Receptionists are all polite and helpful. The hotel is in the process of upgrading many of the rooms, and the newly upgraded Club rooms are excellent; they do vary in size and some are a little small, but ours on this occasion was spacious and newly furnished with high quality linens and carpet etc. The other masssive advantage of the Club rooms is the automatic free entry to the swimming pool and fitness centre. Swimming pools are very rare in central London, and this one definitely adds value to the stay and to the upgrade. Renovation appears to be working downwards, with the public areas last to be done. The carpets are older and the lifts somewhat tatty. Equally the huge breakfast room, designed for large groups, is a little downmarket compared to the rooms. The Lions Sports Bar is large and informal, more attractive to younger guests than to the business customer.

One of the highlights of the stay (If you ever get to room 742) was to play the krypton factor...Using only your balance and the squares on the carpet, try to get from the door to the bathroom without making the floor squeak. I say it's impossible but maybe you have to think outside the box and use the area under the bed - but I think that's cheating... The rest of the inhabitants on the 7th floor were marauding teenagers and by day two, the hotel decided it was easier to mover me rather than protect what little of their hotel remained. I did make a point of saying I didn't want a bigger or a better room or anything \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I hadn't paid for one and all I wanted was a quieter space... They could have got this so right but in the end they made such a big issue about my being given a club room and it was one of the best rooms in the hotel etc. etc...but before they would swap keys they had to take another imprint of my cc as they couldn't trust me not to nick anything from the mini bar - and then put me in 420 next to the lift shaft \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I ask you! Originally they said my new room would be ready at midday but that wasn't the case when I returned in the afternoon, but don't get too excited \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its just a paint job and a new telly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c every thing else reused from old rooms and if they look behind the room door there is some ones old shower cap. So anyway, they've turned me into a 'rant' - they won't or can't control their guests and in the meantime, I get punished twice and get charged \u00c2\u00a3270 for the privilege. You cant play the krypton factor in room 420 as they have swapped the squares for lines - which is fiendishly difficult. On day two at 4 am (17.02) the fire alarm went off and we all went outside to watch the fire engine. No one was on duty to shepherd the people at the back of the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very confusing and only one bloke on the front who shouted 'Gpherrede yeahahy mellodonnnehkay' down the loud speaker before disappearing and we all went back to bed except for the teenagers of course... At least the fire klaxon did work. I did wonder about that as 742 and 420 both have 'stepped' ceilings and I thought that all ceiling areas were supposed to be covered independently? But they are not. I took a picture to show the fire officer just in case. Later that same morning we were offered neither apology or explanation, was that the 'Gpherrede yeahahy mellodonnnehkay' ? Just the prospect of another wait behind a 20 deep queue for breakfast in a half full room. Hotel is on record as being very proud of its international staff but I can assure you that all messages are translated and re translated several times before you get an answer. I think they should multi-train the chattering receptionists or several concierge staff to go and manage the breakfast queues when they get busy. The true highlight of my stay was finding the Cafe Concerto for Breakfast. This is 100 yards from the hotel on High Street Ken. There, you are treated to a warm welcome, a smiley helpful team who provide excellent service and a great breakfast. That was a real find after the debacle of 3 nights at Kensington chase. It looks like all the rooms are quite small (Probably due to space and business rates.?) so if you are going with a friend, make sure it is some one you have a habit of bumping into, or someone that you would like to bump into, as this would be inevitable. Internet on 7th floor is non existent but they are happy enough to charge you up to \u00c2\u00a315 for a days access. Outrageous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c go and get yourselves a booster and a deal with Orange! Internet access costs diddly squit these days. They did give me my money back but was asked to sign a form saying they were giving me money, although they don't give you a signed for saying you had paid them in the first place! I'm not interested in their internal accounting practices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I just wanted my money back for something that didn't work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c simple. They debit your card for the room before arrival too. On hotel web site it proudly boats '4 star hotel' but this is a self assessment (not explained) and they are mistaken. I would urge every one to check and make sure they are staying in a place where the hotel has invested in a worthwhile scheme and not rely on self judgement as this can be very misleading and lead to disappointment. In a couple of years, London will host the Olympics and we stand to be the tourism laughing stock of the world if these places don't get their act together. If you want to go and stay at the Kensington Close then do so, but please arrive with little or no expectations and all your wishes will be fulfilled.

When we got to the room I was pretty shocked to find these rooms described as executive - they were slightly shabby, very average and noisy. The plumbing in the bathrooms were slow and noisy. Very few toiletries. On the second night a fire alarm went off at 4.30am - however it was so faint the sound that we only realised it was a real alarm when we heard all the other guests evacuating on to the street below. We didn't realise that we were supposed to evacuate for at least 15 minutes - thank goodness there wasn't a real fire! On departing the hotel my daughter left her ipod in a drawer by the side of her bed, when I phoned housekeeping 2 hours later they informed that nothing had been found in the room.

I booked online through the hotels own web site, which they claimed gave the best rates, well in advance. Three nights accomodation in a standard double room for single occupancy Monday to Thursday came to \u00c2\u00a3318 after tax. This did not include breakfast which like other reviewers I found to be a bit mean but felt the location compensated for this. On arrival the doorman rushed to take my bags and was very friendly, the receptionist welcomed me and hoped I would once again enjoy my stay with them. I had asked specificaly for a quiet room and was given a room on the 5th floor at the back of the house. I had no sooner entered my room when what sounded like an alarm went off. Not knowing what it was I ignored it as it soon went off. When after a few minutes it went off again I rang down to reception and was told it was the fire alarm but everything was ok. The room was small for a double and I was glad I had gone for it and not a single. The bed I have to say was very comfortable and that means a lot. One thing I have to say about this hotel in my experience is that things can look ok on the surface but if you examine them closely they are very dated, sometimes damaged and actually dirty. The shower head over my bath I think had been wiped down as much as it could be but if you look at the photo you will see that it need to be replaced as it all grimy and brown.(See Photo) The extractor fan in the bathroom did not work at all. The lift closest to my room leading down to ground level was lined with carpet on the walls that was torn and fraying and generally gave a bad impression of what might be going on behind the scenes of the shiny frontal area of the hotel. (See photo) On the night of my second stay I was woken at about 4am by the now familiar sound of th fire alarm. I didnt know what to do and was disorientated trying to find my clothes, wondering was it just a false alarm again, what if it wasnt, should I get my passport and money or just run. Normally Im quite a together sort of person but at that time of night I actually went to get the lift down before copping on to myself and taking the stairs. The stairs led to an alley at the side of the building and people were streaming out in pygamas and generally looking disheveled and confused. Outside the fire brigade were already in action having done whatever they needed to do. I stood at the back well away from the building, someone said something from a speaker phone but I couldnt make out what it was and everyone started streamin in again. I wanted to know what had happened, were things all right, but didnt see or hear any staff hanging around to reassure residents. It took me 2hrs to get back to sleep. At 9am I decided to have breakfast in the hotel and go back to sleep for a bit before walking around London. There was a queue at the restaurant and when it came to my turn the woman directing seating said as my stay did not include breakfast it would be a charge of \u00c2\u00a314 something. I told her I would go and get breakfast somewhere else for that price and asked her did she know what had happened last night. She said someone had taken a shower and left the door to the bathroom open and that the steam had set off the alarm. Note to management of the hotel - Maybe there is a link between faulty extractor fans in bathrooms and this happening or maybe the fire alarm system has to be replaced. I went across the road to the Muffin Man a place that is recommended in travel guides and by some other contributors to this site for half the price. Getting into the lift on the way back to my room I saw a workman and asked him if it was all right for me to enter ( maybe he was fixing it) He asked how I was and when I told him I was tired because the fire alarm went off last night he said \" Oh yeah that happens every now and again\" I was startled and asked how every now and again? He seemed to want to take it back and said it might not happen for a month or so. If you do a search on Kensington Close Hotel fire alarm you will find other reviewers writing about this happening before. I met a manager walking along the corridor and he said \"How are you today madam?\" I said \"tired\" and he asked if the fire alarm had woken me. Well it was hard to miss. His attatude was it was better to be safe and no one was hurt. Ok. I think if I was running a hotel I would tell everyone working in it the next morning to be particularly good to customers coming down that morning, TO APPOLOGISE to them, to let them know what happened, to reassure them about the future i.e. what they are going to do about faulse alarms and to ask them if they can do anything to make up for the inconvenience.

And I hate places that charge a 'oscretianary 15% charge prefering to tip directly to the staff member and not get into a iscussion about it over the bill. The decor and furnishing at the hotel were dated and in need of a re-vamp, however the bed and bedding are among the most comfortable I have encountered at a hotel (including 5*). Our room was also very quiet. Although the room servise and mini bar prices were quite expensive. As a christmas party venue the tables were beautifully decorated but the food was very standard. However we had pretty much enjoyed everything so far, therfore it was a great pity that breakfast was such a disaster and really soured the whole experience and I don't think we will be returning any time soon. Sunday breakfast is served until 11am which is great for a lie in. My husband myself asnd son arrived down for breakfast just after 10am. The waitress confirmed breakfast for 3 people (which was fairly obvious), then looked around (it was quite busy) and queried if we wanted a table for 2 people os 3?! I don't know if she expected one of us to remain standing. Breakfast is served buffet style which is typical of this type of hotel and several people were waiting for more cooked eggs to arrive(fried scrambled etc) eventually we were told that they had run out of eggs! this was at 10.15 a full 45 mins until breakfast finished. After speaking to several staff members we asked to speak to the manager who duley arrived spoke to some staff and came over positivly bristling with indignation, she asked what the problem was although she obviously already new and when we explained that it was ridiclous to have run out of eggs (surley breakfast is the easiest meal to cater for, ie so many people staying overnight = so many for breakfast) she said quite rudley had we not been informed that they had been let down by there delivery people, Not my problem I'm afraid!

The satellite tv had message \"sorry not available\" for the entire stay. The down comforter was a little warm. It'd be nice to have just a sheet for summer time. We went down the next day to get our room around 12 p.m. only to find a good queue at the front desk. We had brought luggage. After waiting several minutes, we noted some people were just jumping the queue and going right to the desk. They sure could use a queue lineup barrier and sign \"queue here\". When it was finally our turn, they said they'd check with housekeeping. Of course house keeping didn't have any rooms. We were told to come back in 30 minutes. We came back and they still didn't have any rooms available. (Good thing we left suitcases upstairs with one elevator working). Later, I asked myself, why doesn't reception call us when a room is available, why do we constantly have to ask reception? Eventually, we did get the room, but it was somewhat smokey. After all that, we pretty much lost a full day of what we needed to be doing instead of wandering around the hotel getting a room. The breakfast was good, but beware of rude people jumping in front of you everywhere. Sometimes food stuffs ran out, but they seemed to eventually refill. As others probably stated, internet costs and it only works on a couple floors - 4th and around the lobby. The room was a little rough. Scratches/broken bits of formica on furniture, mold in bathroom, carpeting seemed to need a hot water cleaning etc.. One day, we noticed some blood or something on the towels. Satellite button did not work on remote. Too tired usually to stay up late to watch only 5 channels of tv. During checkout, the person said we'd have to pay extra for the club room. We told them the story and apparently even though they said they'd note on computer when we checked in, he didn't say anything about the note. Otherwise location to tube and restaurants is good.

I requested a standard double room with a travel cot and received a prompt reply from reservations that this would be arranged. First impressions were good - when we checked in we were told (without asking) that the cot was already set up in the room (Room 379). On arriving in the room there was no cot and there was no space in which to assemble a cot. I left my wife and (tired) son and went back to the front desk. The receptionist told me that she would send the cot up and that she could do nothing about the size of the room - noting that this was the standard size of all double rooms in the hotel. I told her that I wanted a room fit for purpose (i.e. we would gladly stay in the room if you could fully open the door into the room without hitting the cot). I also produced the email confirming our booking of a double with cot. She then suggested that I should pay to upgrade to a larger room. I refused. After a long wait, while she consulted with management, we were 'upgraded to an executive room' (Room 3001). This turned out to be a normal-size double room, comparable with other 3* and 4* hotels in London. No-one offered to help us with our luggage - either when we arrived or when we switched rooms. Next morning the spray head of the shower was missing. Standing under the shower was like washing under a garden hose. At 8.30 am I rang housekeeping who promised to deal with the matter. I told the lady that we would be out of the room all day (apart from 12 noon to 2pm; when my son has his nap). I also told her that I needed the shower available by 6pm (as we were going to an evening party). I was told not to worry. On returning at 12 noon, no action had been taken. At my request, housekeeping made a follow-up call to maintenance. The maintenance guy arrived and stated that the problem might not be fixed if a part was not available. Housekeeping then rang and suggested that we move room. I asked to speak to the manager, who rang and offered a room change. I was unwilling to change room due to the further disruption involved (it was a 2-night stay and we had already moved once). I reluctantly agreed with the manager that we would use the showers in the swimming pool free of charge. All of this happened between 12 noon and 2pm, when my little boy was trying to sleep. We returned after a fantastic afternoon in the nearby Princess Diana Memorial Playground (in Kensington Gardens; great for kids). When we arrived at the swimming pool we were asked to pay admission of \u00c2\u00a35 each. I explained that we were pre-authorised. The girl at the pool made a telephone enquiry to the front desk and was told that we should not be allowed into the shower area unless we paid. I personally rang front desk and explained everything that had happened since we arrived and noted that we were under time pressure. She asked me to wait 'about 10 minutes' while she spoke to the manager. I told her that I would not wait and was going in straight away. It is a nice facility - but I could not relax after the unpleasantness with the front desk. Fortunately, there were no difficulties when we went back for our showers next morning. In summary, the hotel is well located and has potential to be a good mid-range hotel. I believe responsiblity for the problems encountered primarily rests with the senior management of the hotel - many of the staff we encountered were unsure how to proceed and were unwilling to take even the most obvious steps to help their guests without talking to management first.

We chose this hotel among others (we were given a list from our travel agent) mostly because its reasonable price.

Of course,we were aware of the fact that the rooms would be small, but not THAT small as they finally turned out to be.Do you know what was the first thing we did when we arrived and were led to our room? We immediately dashed out and bought sheets and blankets.No way would we would lay our bodies and cover ourselves with these sheets, they seemed that they had not be cleaned for a long time. Now as far as the room which we were given is concerned,it was so small that there was not enough space for our luggage and personal belongings.I suppose that one could say that we could have used the wardrobe, but it was so dirty that we didn t even think to leave anything in there. The carpet was filthy, too. The toilet was ok and there were clean towels though. The bed was on one side of the wall. Above it there was a window.Well, we soon realised that the handle was broken. As a result the room was cold, especially in the night.(even though the heating was on). We heard that other people from our group were dealing with the same problem but nothing was done for it during the 4 days we stayed there. The breakfast buffet was average. They provided mostly english breakfast which is not what we are used to. What we found really annoying was that every morning we had to wait in the line in order to have breakfast,(sometimes up to 25 minutes) even though we woke up really early (8 o' clock) just beause we wanted to avoid this kind of a situation. This is unacceptable for a 4 star hotel in our opinion. Above that, we soon realised that our sheets were not changed daily as we think they should have been. In particular, not once were they changed during the 5 days we stayed in this hotel. All they did was change the towels in the toilet, leave toilet paper and... that' s it. It is a 4 star hotel, if they leave the same sheets for 4 or 5 days, leave the room dirty, leave the damages it makes you wonder, what do they really do?And for what reason were 4 stars given to this hotel?Mayby only because of it s location?

Not only are the staff friendly, it's coupled with efficient service, great facilities and contemporary and chic rooms with great corporate prospects! I saw some of the mixed reviews on this website and was a little doubtful with everything I had read; however, from staying there this weekend it has completely changed my mind! Even before I got there, I had a few special requests as my partner and I are both vegetarians and there were a few other requests also. The lady at reservations was not only very efficient and prompt in her email responses, but was extremely resourceful and did everything to help us! She had even got in touch with various other departments in the hotel in order for our requests to be satisfied. When I got to the hotel, it is so easy to find, literally a 2-3 minute walk from the station away from the hustle and bustle at the end of the street in a quiet location but convenient enough to be near High Street Kensington station and a range of shops! The check in was relatively simple with extremely friendly staff and a concierge service (to check your bags in early) which was great! We had a room a little larger than the standard, but even seeing a friend's standard room looked to be an average size especially for the rates and location! Our room in fact was great, it had a little seating area also with a table for breakfast where you can either have continental sent to your room (where they even let you pick what you want and send a paper within 10 minutes of ordering!) or the English we had paid for with great service, hot food, loads of choice in quite a nice large restaurant room (senses). The room had a very clean and well decorated shower/bath as well as a Fridge, Ironing Board, a lot of cupboard and walking space and a desk with a nice view out to the street (not sure if Fridge is in the standard rooms though!). It also had a TV with a range of movies, and standard channels. The hotel also has quite an exquisite in dining menu which provides a range of cuisine for all different tastes and preferences. The restaurant does serve good food with an emphasis on the value for money, and do take special requests into consideration as the staff are generally quite friendly (and actually want to be there). There is a strong sense of community feeling amongst the staff, which was nice to see. They also have regular events and sports shown at the Lion Bar and a nice steak house restaurant and a garden (I think) for just relaxing! It has a lot of spaces just to chill out including the iBay (computer area) and various seating areas around the hotel with quite a modern cosy style. The corporate rooms are great, especially for the value for money and especially as one cannot even hear the outside corridors once inside (which is brilliant!) and can accommodate even large groups of people. They also have swimming pool and spa facilities which by far is a cut above the rest of some of the hotels one sees in central London. This is open from 7am -9.30am every day I believe. This is great if you just want to unwind and relax after a long day, and isn't available in a lot of hotels for the price you pay. I strongly disagree that this is a three star hotel, as it is edging now towards definitely four and nearly five star as it provides a wonderful service and provided me with a great weekend. Even though my partner was ill throughout the night, the night staff at Housekeeping, Reception, Room Service collaborated together to do everything possible to help my partner (medicines, hot packs etc...) whilst keeping in contact to let us know of the progress which was helpful to say the least! This hotel has great prospects for corporate clients due to the location, for young singles looking to have a great weekend, families who want to unwind due to the leisure facilities, older travellers due to the general efficiency of the staff and generally everyone as the hotel can accommodate for all types of people and still provide a 5* service! After my stay, I shall definitely be staying there once more and shall post some pictures up of the hotel once I have uploaded them from my camera. The duty manager was extremely helpful as was a lady at reservations especially, and the three girls who helped during the stay at reception, including all the night staff! I would definitely recommend it, as it is such a friendly hotel with great facilities in such a convenient location with good transport links.

(I'm 5'11) This first room was also directly over the pub and the loud thumping of the music and peoples conversations made it impossible to fall asleep. The following morning we asked if the room could be changed as it was just too loud. We got the identical shoe box sized room one floor up. The next day after we showered and got dressed I left my towel (the one I brought from home because hotel towels are usually very small, and I'm tall) to dry over my suitcase. (I should add that it was a very nice large towel with an obvious logo on it) The book I had been reading was left on the night stand next to the book my friend had been reading.

I've just returned from the latest trip and while the establishment is definitely a little more worn and, I think, less cared for, the hotel hasn't changed greatly over the last four years as far as the rooms and general atmosphere are concerned. The biggest change I noticed was that the equipment in the gym has been fairly recently updated. Booking online, check-in and the room itself were all fine. The room itself was a little on the grubby side (the almost obligatory 'stranger's hair' in the bathroom) and it was small, as most rooms in this hotel seem to be. I did hear my neighbours sneeze and a good deal of noise from the corridor as people passed. I hadn't noticed this on previous trips. The hotel is not palatial, but given the location (tube, restaurants, caf\u00c3\u00a9s, Kensington itself) it is possible to stay at the hotel and avoid the hotel's own bar, restaurant etc. Indeed my sole contact with life in the hotel was walking through reception and climbing the stairs to my room (quicker than the cramped lift, even to the fifth floor). I had few problems, the key-card to my door failed: it was fixed immediately. The shower head was wobbly, I reported it, but later fixed it myself. There's often a bit of noise at night from late night revellers returning home from nearby establishments, but it is the heart of London! The \u00c2\u00a35.00 a day charge to use the gym is a bit much for residents if you stay more than a few days as it mounts up, but I've always found it a good enough gym with decent equipment.

My boyfriend and I were very excited about the facilities (the pool, sauna, jacuzzi, etc) so we decided to spend our 9 nights there. The second day we decided to use the pool and were not informed that there was a fee(5 pounds per person per day) to make use of it. We paid our five pounds for the day and never went back. The next event was when we went to the front desk and asked to pay in cash to see a movie (3 pound 95). The guy at the desk, Shazar, said \"okay, let me see your debit card\". AFTER, NOT BEFORE, swiping my boyfriends debit card, he told him that 120 pounds would be locked as a security procedure for the movies. This meant a 30 pound security for each of our remaining nights. If Shazar had told us before that he would be locking 120 pounds, we wouldn't have done it. We made a billion phone calls to the bank to unlock the money asap. We couldn't believe it. After speaking to the idiot manager who didn't understand the situation and kept saying, \"but that's how it's done\", we flipped out. We told him that we didn't know that and we were sure other guests didn't either. The real cherry on top of our stay was when Shazar called our room and begged my boyfriend not to tell the manager in the morning about the incident because his job was on the line. For it's facilities and location, the Close is great.

We were waiting for people back home to call us and for some reason received no messages from reception or on our room phone. When we picked it up to make a call, we discovered it was broken.

The noise isolation internally is not what it could be and I found myself woken up several times from 7 in the morning by doors slamming.

Why do I say this? Because during my wonderful 5-day stay at the hotel for the Easter holidays, I did not experience even the slightest bit of inconvenience from the amenities or the staff. The staff actually were the highlights of my stay as they were, though young indeed, very helpful and more importantly enthusiastic. There was never a dull moment. I loved the Bar, the Spa, the pool, everything. The location is also great, as others have already pointed out. But the rooms, I agree could use some more space, but this is not uncommon in a crowded metropolis such as London.

The bar was very good, with average drink prices and comfy sofas perfect after a long day of sightseeing. The pool was also very clean and the jacuzzi and saunas a welcome relief. My only real complaint was breakfast which was always very busy. The self-service areas were fine; the food tasty and we never had any problems with missing plates, etc. The downside was that coffee was always a nightmare to get hold of.

They had taken the only money we had in our account out, we were so worried that it would not get put back into the account for 3 days whch the bank say.

It stops at all the major attractions, reasonably priced, and a great way to experience London. You can also buy tickets to some attractions at the ticket counter. The hotel has a gym and spa that costs extra but I didn't have time to utilize them. A longer visit and I might have. The hotel room was very small. We had a standard double (2 twin beds). I now understand why the toilet is called a watercloset in England. It wasn't much wider. Definitely upgrade to a larger room. I think the Executive level of rooms are larger. Spend the extra money.

Our room had 2 twins beds, which was great because we like to get our sleep when on vacation - doesn't mean can't still get frisky BEFORE ;o) Anyway, the desing theme was just as the web site show's - and I quite liked it, thruth be told, clean lines, clean & uncluttered looking. We found our rm. to be clean, the housecleaning staff couldn't speak English but we had no problem. The hotel has restaurant on premises and breakfast as well, however we never eat in hotels. We, as others, saw the Muffin Man down the street - we ended up having breakfast most mornings at the GIRAFFE Restaurant, go up to the Boots (Kens. High Street) and turn right..... walk a few blocks to pretty much the start of Kensington Garens. Breakfasts are GREAT !!! Many choices - eggs, ham, toast, fruit smoothis and great lattes.... We were SO pleased with the location - we shopped all along Kenisngton High Street - we found great bargains and new Fall styles @ the H & M dep't store beside M&S (we don't have H&M in Canada) We walked to Notting Hill, Bayswater, thru Kensington Gdns. to Mayfair & Buckingham Palace etc... FABULOUS location. Even if we chose another hotel, he would still choose this location -- GREAt restaurants close by. We loved Arcadia (Italian) just down a lane, on the way to Giraffe -charming, fabulous service and great food!! The one thing to remember is that the rm. door lock works funny - when you open up, if you leave too long the door deadbolt activates and you close the door and leave - coming back to the door not fully closed.

We don't have many Circle Line services, so we had to wait at least for 15 minutes every time we took a train. Our first impression of the hotel was that the it was a big hotel, not clean, and that the staff were very young. I felt that there were some staff who were not trained well enough to serve in the polite way we usually expect from hotel clerks. Nobody came out to carry our luggage. We were given two card keys, but they often didn't work. The room was OK, but very tiny. One good thing was that it had a fridge, though it often made strange beep sounds that annoyed us at midnight. The beds moved very easily probably for easy cleaning. One of the beds had a big hollow at the centre and was very uncomfortable. I had a backache at the end of my stay. One of the biggest reasons we chose this hotel was that it offers internet access service in every room. Though the hotel had not answered my question via e-mail whether they had \"fast\" internet access service or not, we finally decided to stay there because one staff wrote to me saying that the voucher for 24-hour access was available for 15 pounds. We thought it quite reasonable, and actually bought one. We used the internet for an hour on the first night (which turned out to be very very slow!!!), didn't use it on the next day, and tried to use it again on the following day. What we found then was that the voucher was already expired. I asked the reception and was informed for the first time that we have to use the internet continuouslly for 24 hours!!! Nobody had told us about that, so I complained to some of the hotel staff that they must offer us more information about the voucher (which just says, \"24 hours\") beforehand. But they didn't accept my complaint. One [---] guy even told me that the fault was mine because the voucher clearly said, \"24 hours.\" But who would take it literally? Who would use the internet for 24 hours continuously? He also said that the internet service is offered in the same style at every hotel and every internet cafe in the UK, which is obviously a lie. The way this guy talked to me was so rude that I even forgot for a moment that I was talking with a hotel clerk. Finally I was compelled to give up and leave the reception. But still unable to consent to the [---] guy's explanations, I went to the reception again. This time I was advised to visit there again on the following day and talk to another staff who might solve the problem. It turned out then for the first time that when I bought the voucher the staff at the reception forgot to give me necessary information about the voucher. The voucher had already caused some misunderstandings among customers, so the staff had usually explained that the voucher is for a continous use. I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't returned to the reception. On the following morning I went to the reception, talked to a lady staff, who understood my situation and gave me a new 24-hour voucher. To tell the truth, we had only one more day to stay, and didn't need one at all. We weren't satisfied with the hotel from the beginning, but this event made us decide to change it. We chose Country Inn, which is quite close to Cloucester Road. This station is more convenient than High Street Kensington. It is located very close to Sainsbury's which is open 24 hours. The staff at the reception is a well experienced gentleman, and young staff help you carry your stuff. It offers wireless internet access service in every room, and you don't need to use the internet continuously. What was disappoinging was that you can't log in to Gmail possibly because of firewall. When I told the reception about that, a man came to solve the problem. Though the problem wasn't solved, I felt a very sincere attitude of the hotel. What's more, this hotel is much cheaper than Kensington Close Hotel. I will never choose Kensington Close again.

I had as my top criteria a hotel that was either in Central London or with easy access to a good tube line with Air Conditioning. I am a person that needs AC- I've learned my lesson in the past that when people say \"Oh, you don't need AC there it never gets that hot that time of year\" that I definitely need to get it. I had almost no problems and just a couple of small difficulties with the Kensington Close. Check-in was the first surprise. I had added an extra night to our stay and requested that it be combined with the other 3 nights. This apparently was not possible due to the computer system. I was assurred that we would have no problem staying in the same room and that I would just have to stop at the desk the next morning and pay the bill for the first night. I was glad that it worked out the next morning with no problems. The only other problem I had I did not even notice until after I had left. When I checked out for the first night I was careful to make sure that my bill had not been converted to dollars already as a courtesy to me. I neglected to check this on my second bill. they had converted my bill to dollars and the conversion rate was not as good as I got on bills presented to my credit card company in pounds. I was glad that I planned ahead as while we were in London the temperature was in the high 80's and low 90's. The room was very small and the bathroom was also very small with no ventilation so it could get very warm in there after a shower. The AC worked OK- not great but it took the edge off the high temperature. I had no problem with it running all night- my biggest problem was the maid opened the curtain during the day and the sun beat down on the room and made it hotter. The one good/bad thing about the room was that you are required to put your room key into a slot by the door for the electricity to work. Take your card out and things shut off. I see that this is an energy saving tool. This is not a big deal if you have two people and two room keys but since the room safe requires the use of the card when you take it out of the wall slot and run it through the safe slot the lights go out. The staff was very courteous and took care of any concerns we had. The room was clean with some signs of wear but in good shape. the bathroom did have a small amount of mold/mildew up in the ceiling corners but it was very minor and the rest of the room and bathroom were spotless every day. I knew before hand that the food wasn't that great and the prices a bit high but we did end up eating there the first night after getting in a bit late (our flight was delayed two hours) and doing a bit of sightseeing we just didn't feel up to going back out in the heat looking for something. The food was over priced and just OK. It wasn't bad it just wasn't anything special- especially for the price. The tube station was just about 3-4 blocks away and very convenient. It's on the District/ Circle Line and it's very convenient to most Central London Attractions. We had only two service problems- the one day we needed to buy one trip tickets the machines were down and the clerk was late due to illness. The second problem was an electrical problem on the Circle Line when we returned that meant making a detour and taking a different line to get back. Bottom line- I gave the Kensington Close Hotel an above average rating because it met almost all of my expectations. It's not a 4 star hotel but it's a very convenient, clean, comfortable place to stay. There is a very close by tube station that gets you where you want to go easily. There are some nice restaurants closeby to eat at- we ate at the Muffin Man for breakfast 3 out of 4 days (it's between the hotel and the tube station). We ate at McDonald's the other morning- with a piano player playing tunes on a baby grand piano (it's beneath the \"Best Piano Bar in London\"). If you go in with reasonable expectations of this hotel you will be satisfied. You can't judge it by the standards of what you would get in most US cities. you have to judge it fairly- against other hotels in London.

When we got to our room, at the end of a loooong corridor, we had to use our keycards about 6 or 7 times before the door opened. The room was clean but very small. Bathroom even smaller. I sat down on the corner of the bed to take off my shoes, when the bed collapsed... the leg had gone off the bed and screws were lying on the floor under the bed. We went downstairs to the reception and told them about the bed. They said they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be sending maintenance.

In that case you could use the new room for sleeping and the old room for showering until bed is fixed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We chose the other room. They had someone coming to our room with new keycards. When we entered the new room, we could hear water leaking. We checked the bathroom and there was a big puddle on the floor and the shower was leaking... not dripping, no, really leaking. It was so noisy that we were sure we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to sleep. We returned to our room and called reception... they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up. We tried a second time and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up. We called concierge explained our problem and he transferred us to reception again... nobody picked up the phone. After a few minutes I called reception again. This time they answered and after me telling them our problems, they said they tell the manager. 10 minutes later a guy knocked at our door with a new keycard for a third room. There was no hot water in that either but we could also keep our initial room. We went to the room and when we wanted to go to bed we noticed that the mattress was very small. In fact it was almost 20 cm smaller than the bed. We decided to sleep in it anyway but it was so small we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn around without fearing falling out of the bed. The next morning we went to the reception again to remind them to fix our bed. Then we went to the Carvery restaurant and opted for English breakfast by paying 9 pound for the both of us (upgrade). We were very disappointed by the buffet. They had eggs, sausages, bacon, 1 plate with cooked ham, one plate with one kind of slices of cheese, some fruit that was not fresh, very soft (old) croissants, quite hard rolls (quite stale) some cereals and that was about it. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taste great at all. We decided to try the continental breakfast the next day, since that was included in our room price. When we came back in the evening the bed was fixed. One good thing. But the bed was very bad. Whenever one would move a bit the other one would just be moved up and down on the bed (it was no waterbed)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we ended up in not sleeping much because of the moving on the mattress.

They had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buffet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with one plate of sliced cheese (one kind only), which was on some spots already hard on the corners. That was their promised selection of meats and cheeses\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then they had the same stale rolls and soft croissants that we had the day before. Some cornflakes some jam, butter, rice crispies and some oranges (not fresh) and that was about it! No forks and knives available for a few minutes etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The next day, they had the same except that they only had half a plate of cheese, probably the day before\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left-overs.

I booked a single room which on the internet was GBP140 per night. My checkin guy was pretty rude. They gave me a single room and when i saw the size of the room and the single bed I thought there was a mistake because it was so small so I went back to reception and got a lady who was very helpful and agreed to upgrade me to a double and said \"no problems we will leave the rate at the single room rate\". When I checked out they charged me GBP160 for a double room - I protested to no advantage. In addition an english breakfast is GBP13.50. Internet costs GBP10 per 12 hours.

Occassionally, there are problems with rooms but never anything too serious. If you are unhappy about anything, the staff are usually happy to move you to another room. One thing I would say is that the room service is a little overpriced for what you get. Instead, I would definitely recommend trying the lovely Thai restaurant just a few steps away from the hotel. The eating options are endless in this area, sitting in your room is such a waste anyway! The hotel is very popular and is always bustling with tourists from all over the world. I would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone. My Canadian partner joined me on a recent London trip, it was his first stay in the hotel and he just loved it.

We unfortunately did arrive in London on the \"red-eye\" and hence arrived at the hotel well before their rigid 2pm check-in time. We both fell asleep in chairs in the bar area for several hours. When 2 pm arrived, our room was \"not ready\". The desk clerks spoke little and very poor English which was a surprise to us. We waited until 4:30pm for our room, which turned out to be, as many others have said, most miniature in size. There was not even enough room for my husband and me to open our suitcases at the same time, so we had to stack them on top of each other and take turns rooting through them to find things. The so-called \"double\" bed required gymnastic feats to get into it that I am sure we could not do even in our 20s. The bathroom was adequate and had a tub which is rare in Europe and as my husband adores baths it was the one thing he liked about this hotel. The continental breakfast hovered very closely near \"dreadful\". We found the hotel to be in need of many repairs; it was none too clean and the staff were most unhelpful. The only good thing, as many others have said is the location. It is a few minutes walk to High Street Kensington, where there are many shops, restaurants and the High Street Kensington Tube station. The tube is actually fairly easy to figure out, despite the most intimidating of maps produced of it. The Pret a Manger had good take-way and there is a Marks and Spencer close by. One restaurant in the area not to miss, we think is Wagamamma. It is a unique dining experience, reasonably priced with friendly staff.

When I had asked at reception when I arrived for messages I was told there were none and my phone light would flash if there were, it didn't flash and I missed three messages.

The general hotel service is also good; when I rang reception to enquire where ironing facilities were, I had an ironing board delivered to my room in what must have been under a minute. That's fast! The rooms themselves have air conditioning which is a bonus, as well as a safe, but the tv channels are limited to the basic 5 terrestrial ones. The gym is open to the public as well as hotel residents so is reasonably well equipped with various resistance and cardio machines, as well as a swimming pool. A couple of other hotels I've stayed at have claimed to have a gym, but when I turned up these were literally no more than one running machine and an exercise bike. The Kensington Close hotel actually has a gym that is decent! My only gripe with this hotel is the size of the room, it's one of the smallest I've stayed in so far.

The room was of a decent size and the elevator problems mentioned in the earlier reviews seem to be thing of the past. I never waited more than a few seconds for an elevator. As another reviewer noted, there is no top sheet on the bed, just a bottom sheet covered by a duvet. The duvet on my bed had a huge rip - more than two feet across - on the underside. I left a note for housekeeping asking for it to be replaced and it was, but the bottom sheet on the bed was never changed. The bed is a bit short by Amercian standards. Anyone over 5'10\" is going to be uncomfortable. I came home very late one night to have the television set come on after I stuck my key in the slot. Quite disturbing since I had not used the TV. I called the front desk to complain and to make sure I had not been charged for a movie and was told by the woman who answered the phone that she would call me back in five minutes. I never heard from her again. The spa is only a swimming pool, but it is a good sized attractive looking pool. I didn't use it. There is no exercise equipment and no weights. They have yoga and aerobic classes (I think they charge extra for them) but there weren't any the weekend that I was there because it was a three day holiday weekend for the Brits. This seemed like a very stupid reason to cancel exercise classes. The biggest problem I had with this place was trying to locate it. Although they are near the Kengsington High tube station (not to be confused with the Kensington South tube station) they did not provide detailed directions on their web site and I walked around carrying my luggage for a while until, by process of elimination, I was able to finding the street that they are on. From there, it is a full city block to the end of the street to the hotel. I had asked three locals (employees of shops at the tube station) and none of them were able to direct me to the hotel or to the street that it is on, so if you choose to stay here and arrive by tube, get yourself a map and call ahead for detailed instructions. The location of the hotel, although near a commercial area, was not ideal for a first time visitor to London. As far as I can tell, it is not walking distance to a single tourist attraction and the tube line that it is on is one of the minor ones, requiring a transfer from one line to another - and perhaps to a third - for each trip to the tourist areas. There is nothing especially wrong with this hotel, but for this reason alone I would not stay here again.

Twenty years ago I stayed in this hotel on my first trip to Europe. I remember I paid $1050 for a package deal that included room, air and hotel transfers. I returned to the Kensington Close 2 years later for another stay. 20 years later the Kensington Close has changed management and names a few times but it is still a great deal in a great neighborhood. The exterior of the hotel is a bland brick building and the public areas are a bit faded. Guest service is decent and accomodating should you require assistance. The hotel also has a concierge desk to assist you with you tourist, travel and informational needs. The rooms are modern and have been updated. Although they are a slightly worn around the edges, they are in good condition. The rooms are not large but are still comfortable and compact. The furniture in my double room included a desk and the bed. The television was built into a wall cabinet and the room had a closet and a built in bench to put my luggage on. Although I was comfortable in this room, I could not imagine two people using it. It would be impossible to dance around the bed! Speaking of beds, the bed was soft but not firm but included enough pillows and soft sheets to get a good nights rest. The bathroom was modern and very clean. The shower had great water pressure and the towels were soft for the most part. My only complaint was the lighting in the bathroom was horrible and offered no vanity lighting at the mirror at all. I could deal with this ok, but it may have been more difficult for others. The door to the bathroom was a sliding door so it offered a floor to ceiling mirror to see how big your butt was getting from all the good food you have consumed. At \u00c2\u00a383 a night for a double this hotel offered the best value in its class out of all the hotels I viewed. To book or check prices for the Kensington Close Hotel you can use their websight.

I have also seen the Kensington Close come up on Priceline at even lower prices. If you need to relax or want some pampering, the hotel also has a full service health spa on the premises. I will post some sample prices in a few days. Why not take some money you saved on hotel rates and enjoy a bit of luxury? The Kensington Close is an old reliable friend of mine who always delivers value for the money. The location is idea since it is within walking distance from the High Street Kensington tube station and near shopping and many sights. It may not be the Ritz, but it's clean, comfortable and well situated.

We got a good deal on lastminute.com (60 pounds), and when we checked in, we were upgrade to an executive twin. To be short: yes, the rooms are small (so small that to get to the other bed on the other side, you have to turn sideways and try not to fall over as you pass by the first bed). But they are manageable (if you are good at long jump haha). The beds are comfortable, and most importantly everything is very clean. The breakfast in the morning was also very good. The thing we liked best about this hotel (that others have complained about) is its location. Yes, it is a little bit out of the way, but one or two more subway stops isn't a big deal, especially when you're riding the underground all day long. We thought the location was great because you truly felt like you were among locals. The hotel is also on a street that is very quiet by London standards, yet if you want busyness, you can just walk up the road to Kensington High Street (where the underground stop is located- very convenient) and partake in all of the madness that goes on there. It was awesome, we loved the neighborhood. On Kensington High Street, as others have noted, there is also a Safeway on the opposite side of the road, and a Marks and Spencer next to the underground for groceries. I would suggest going to Marks and Spencer for groceries as we always saw the locals returning with bags of food from there, and not from Safeway. If you are buying your lunch in this area, there are often neat little avenues between some of the buildings that lead to little courtyards where you can sit on park benches and eat your lunch. The hotel is also located about a 5-10 minute walk from Kensington Park, which leads into Hyde Park. Definitely take a walk through there! To conclude, Kensington Close is a very nice hotel with adequate rooms and a great location. We did, however, stay in 2 other hotels during our time in London, and found one better one, called The Bonnington in Bloomsbury. We got a great deal on their website at 50 pounds a night.

Lots of hot water but the tub was raised off the floor and very narrow if you are a large person and the toilet was in a narrow niche also. The concierge desk was very helpful. There is only a tiny shop for necessites but the hotel next door (Tara something or rather) has more shops and a money exchange besides costing twice as much to stay. On entering the lobby there is a small ramp to the right if you don't want to climb the three steps. The place seems to get many tour groups from Spain, France etc but they were no problem. We asked if we could see the gardens and they unlocked the door and left there as longa as we wanted. They explained it was a little early considering English weather for peopel to use it much. I noticed an outdoor pit with a gas grill so they must make more use of it in the summer. There was also a notice asking people to hold down noise in the garden at night out of consideration for neighbors although there was a high brick wall. There is a nice place called The Muffin Man a block up towards Kensington High Street. We would drop in for tea and scones, etc. We also tried a nice Thai Restaurant across the street one evening. They had a fixed price meal which was nice since I didn't know what to order so it helped. Two blocks up is Kensington High Street with subway connections and all kinds of shops. Marks & Spencers has a department store there and Boots is an American style drugstore if you need something. In the basement of Marks and Spencers is a full fledged grocery store with lots of individual servings. I noticed people grabbing things on the way home from school or work besides regular shopping since the subway is next door. They had a bakery with scones and hot cross buns which you could serve yourself. We took some things back to the hotel just to try them out not to save money. They had wrapped sandwiches which actually tasted like food. One was called chicken with stuffing. It sounded odd with \"Crumbly sausage\" but but was neat. When you walk up to Kensington High Street turn right and Kensington Palace is within walking distance (maybe four blocks). Its better to go there not connected to a tour. We spent three hours and often were alone in some of the rooms. I only saw a couple of guards (man and woman) chatting as they walked through although I know there is additional security.

We opened the door to find a little desk, luggage rack (which was behind the door so you could not open the door) and a bed. The bathroom had a sliding door. The room was so small my husband could not get around. The tv is stuck into the wall.We could not even sit down. After speaking to another couple next door they were told that the rooms were standard and she had paid ?60 (we had paid ?150!). After returning to reception (by the way my husband had to sit on the luggage rack because the chair was broken) we were told that there were no executive rooms available yet as no-one had checked out yet - this was 3.00 p.m. We were told to come back later. On returning back we were given another room but could not believe it when it was the room next door to the previous one.After our third attempt we had to settle for an executive twin room which I would still describe as small but we had had enough by this time.Sorry to go on about the rooms but on speaking to other people it turns out that the standard double rooms used to be single rooms when the hotel was the Posthouse. They then stuck a sliding door on the bathroom as there would be no way you could get in.Bar okay, breakfast was wonderful but if you have to pay for it go into Kensington High Street. The area is easy to get around lots of buses and tube station 5 minutes away.Would I stay in this hotel again - never. They are the smallest rooms I have ever stayed in. The Travel Inn/Travelodges have bigger rooms just to give you an idea of the size of them. I do appreciate that you are not in the room all the time but having to sit on a bed/luggage rack because of lack of space is unbelievable. Please read the previous reviews they are correct. This hotel although the rooms are allegedly refurbished needs to be demolished and rebuilt. The standard rooms are the old single rooms. The furnishings are not luxurious like they say. Our twin beds had covers on them that had been split at the room because they were too small for the quilt.Hope this review helps.", "Date": "March 16, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkland, WA", "Title": "\u201cThought it was very nice\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1671444", "Content": "I stayed here in October 2003 and the only problem I had with the place, is the fact that it took forever to checked in because a gas leak had been found.

Once in my room, I thought the comfy bed with a down duvet was wonderful. The room was definitely big enough and the bathroom was decent sized too.

As with all other postings, the location is fantastic...Yes. you are like 2 minutes from the Tube and the location is fabulous (Kensington). There are plentiful shops, cafes, restaurants all around on High Street Kensington. The neighbourhood itself is one of the richer areas of London and is within a 15-20 minute walk to Notting Hill and Kensington Palace. Its in quite a lively area of London. Coming from North America, the exchange is quite steep when you go to the UK and I found that rather than eating at restaurants all the time it was more cost efficient to head just down the street (like 5 minutes from the hotel) to the grocery store Safeway to purchase food items. It is much cheaper this way especially since most of the time was out and about walking the streets (bought food to eat in my room for Breakfast and sometimes dinner - hot food available at Safeway). As well, there is a internet cafe a few store fronts over from Safeway - handy if you wanna stay connected to the world. All-in-all, I found the Kensington Close hotel a very nice place to stay. Yes, the hallways and main foyer look kinda 'motel-ish' with the dark-red carpeting...Yes. the rooms are tiny but they are clean and the bathroom was clean (my room anyhow) but I really think that you would be hard pressed to find another place in London and receive the same for the value paid. Overall, this an ideal place to stay in a very nice part of London...Don't have any complaints and would definitely recommend if you are looking for the biggist bang for your buck. Next time in London, I will book here again. For a 3 star place, I would give this a 8.5 / 10....I really don't think you can find much superior place comparatively speaking...", "Date": "February 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston Upon Hull England", "Title": "\u201cValentine weekend treat 2004\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1662871", "Content": "Found the hotel and restaurant to be very clean and the staff to be extremelly friendly and helpful.
