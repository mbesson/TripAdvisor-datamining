{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice place for a night or two Cortecito is a friendly, funky little village. The Cortecito Inn is in a park like setting with extremely high security around the clock. Not directly on the beach, though. Our room was kind of average but inexpensive. Staff was friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was nothing short of outstanding! All the fresh mango and pineapple juice you care to drink with eggs to order, bacon, fruit, etc., etc. Wonderful pool, also.Downside: power was off for the first two hours I was there which, apparently, is common in the Dominican Republic. Also, there was a country western biker bar (go figure) adjacent which emitted ear splitting noise till midnight and was moderate thereafter. Apparently, Cortecito is popular with young partying Europeans. My recommendation is to try it for a night or two then move on. Of course your experience may differ from mine.

It seemed to attract mostly Dominican tourists and a few Europeans. I booked using an on line site paid in full and printed out the voucher to present upon arrival. from 18/01/08 to 21/01/08 My partner and I stayed for 3 nights decided to hire a car from Avis. They greeted us at PUJ airport and took us by the hotel first to show us where it was and then back to their office to sort out paper work. Be prepared to be sold an obligatory $1000 insurance deposit for a car hire. Anyway, luckily my Spanish is proficient so I was able to ask detailed questions before I signed the contract. Avis is considered a franchise outside of the US so they have different rules. Upon arrival to El Cortecito I presented the voucher and they were quite welcoming. I had to surrender my US passport in order to get the key. The hotel has 2 three story structures and 1 two story structure near to the foyer. the pool is located in the centre. the rooms are very modest almost like a Thai guest house. Very simple, quite firm mattresses, a large refrigerator, TV with no remote, ceiling fan and AC, a nice outdoor terrace with rocking chairs, a large enough bathroom. They don't provide amenities apart from the smallest bars of hand soap I've ever seen so pack shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Also they don't provide flannels or hand towels so bring your own. I also brought my own pillow and glad I did as theirs were quite stiff. At first the water from the sink wasn't flowing so they repaired that and we had to ask for towels many times before we got them but, they move at a slower different pace there. Just keep smiling and you'll get what you need much faster. One lucky thing is that within the complex of the hotel, Bank Popular, was a proper super market that sold everything from fresh produce to fingernail clippers. So you could stock up on everything you needed. I bought a few hand towels for about $1 each and a roll of paper towels which came in handy for just about everything. The staff was generally friendly and helpful and had good general knowledge of the area. They also have security parking so you don't have to worry about your car. Their cafe was quite good and the menu selections were simple. Mostly grilled meat, fish and chicken with rice and salads. the seafood cafe across the street was nice with the tables viewing the sea. We had rice dishes and pizza. all of which were adequate and tasty. The service was very friendly and very relaxed. They never push the check at you. The cigar shop next to that had an excellent selection of Dominican and Cuban product. the streets are lined with souvenir shops and cafes. Across the street from the parking lot is an open air billiard pub blasting meringue music you can hear from the room. Bring ear plugs!! Apart from that it was a lovely experience but remember it's a developing country bordered by the poorest country in all the Americas so it's safe to say you should stay aware of your belongings. Use common sense when talking with people trying to sell you things. If it seems awkward trust your instincts. Driving at night is a bit trying so try to stick to daylight hours for road trips. The main roads were fine but the connecting smaller roads were a sea of endless and impossibly deep pot holes. Do hire a four wheel drive if you can!!We only ventured at far as Higuey to see the Cathedral. And happened upon a major celebration of the Patron Saint of Dominican Rep. There were thousands of pilgrims and the experience was unexpectedly wonderful! Enjoy, R Estevez Santa Monica, Ca.

We were shown rooms that were in the process of being cleaned and rooms that had no toilet seats. Finally, we found acceptable rooms and settled in. We were quoted one price by the surely night clerk and given a better rate by the day guy. The staff was very cordial and helpful. The pool was clean, the pool bar staffed and the grounds kept up. We could tell that, in its prime, the hotel must have been pretty up scale. Now, it is an affordable alternative to the all-inclusives that are ruining the area. The beach is across the street, past the trinket vendors and through the pizza/pasta place. On word of warning: lose the red wristband right away. It will make you a target for the venders. Your room key is all the proof you really need to get the breakfast buffet. The off-street parking with a 24/7 attendant is a plus.", "Date": "Jan 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR714833685", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "jthbird"}, {"Content": "Avoid this hotel!!!!! Do not give them your business!!!!! We arrived at this hotel, reservation ready, prepared to stay the night. The price we had been quoted when I called was $55/night, When they arrived, they gave us a higher price, and told us that for an exhorbitant charge, they would be pleased to take us to the airport the next day. They showed us a 1st room, which was dirty, and then a second, which while clean, did not have switches to turn on the light in the bathroom.Leaving our bags in the room, we went back to the front desk to further discuss the price, which I requested be a little lower. Initially, they were unwilling to change the price, then the reception clerk told me he wanted to talk with my friend alone.He told her that if she would sleep with him that night, he would give us a better price.She told him she found that highly offensive and left the hotel. As this is a small town, shortly later we were in the street and located the owner of the hotel. We told him what had happened. He called the reception, spoke with the clerk, then told my friend he didn;t believe her, and she could still stay in the hotel that night.Needless to say, we found somewhere else to stay that night which did not include an option for prostitution as part of the payment plan!", "Date": "Dec 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR810584864", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "happy_travellerUsa"}, {"Content": "Few steps from the Cortecito beach The Cortecito Inn is right in the center of Cortecito, a nice village in the Bavaro/Punta Cana area. The hotel is composed of 5 two-storey buildings nested in a beautiful garden, and around a small but pleasant swimming pool. It is not right on the beach (which is very beautiful). But the beach is just a few steps away, on the other side of the road. Rooms are spacious, most with 2 double beds. The place is silent and peaceful, and the room was offered for US$55 a night including buffet breakfast. Guests are mainly Dominicans, plus some budget travellers or travellers that just want to stay out from the large-scale standard all inclusives.Having said about the lovely setting, the place has some problems in the lack of mantainance of the rooms. Before settling down in a final room, we wisited a number of rooms, each with some item which was out-of-order: either the aircon or the roof fan was not working, or it was noisy, or the fridge was noisy... At the end we opted for a room where everything was working except the television (which was not important to us). In All the rooms show the sign of the time, and, the one that we took at the floor level, was extremely humid.All these drawbacks would have not prevented us from giving five bullets to the place, given its beautiful and convenient position, together with the the low cost, that all together more than outweighted the problems listed above. But one drawback did: the lady (the supervisor) and guy at the reception denied to have offered us a lower rate, should we had stayed longer (that we did), and tried with insistence to apply the original fare. In the end, the receipe for a fully pleasant stay at the Cortecito (that we strongly recommend) is: check your room before moving in, in order to verify that all the devices you need are working. In addition, define and state clearly the price of the room at the front desk.", "Date": "Aug 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR803220644", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Claudia69"}, {"Content": "liked Cortecito Inn - loved Dominican Republic My husband and I recently stayed at the Cortecito Inn. Its grounds are lovely, with many palm trees, flowers, and a small pool. Most of the staff, except the surly overnight manager at the desk, were very friendly and helpful. It's quite reasonable at $60 per night, with a delicious if not gourmet breakfast included. Our room was large and clean with two double beds, balcony, TV, air conditioning, and a small lock-box for valuables. While the hotel is not on the beach, guests may cross the town's main street over to the gorgeous beach (and take a short walk to escape the friendly but sometimes overbearing vendors) and the fantastic Palm's Sand Restaurant, which is owned by the same proprietors as the Cortecito Inn. We got to know the restaurant staff, especially Alejandro, the manager and Roberto, the best and most accommodating cook around. The Cortecito Inn can't compete with an all-inclusive, but if you're a budget traveler who wants to escape the tourist crowd and keep the local vendors and restaurant owners in business (the all-inclusives are like Wal-Mart - they put the local places out of business), then this hotel just may be right for you. If you're really on a modest budget, try the lovely guest-house across the street, La Posada de Piedra, which backs right onto the beach. Its six rooms (three cabanas, three upstairs), while not air conditioned, have plenty of fans and natural breezes for only $30-$55.We enjoyed our hotel and loved the warm and gracious townspeople who made our stay so memorable.", "Date": "Apr 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR669278566", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Lilly'smother"}, {"Content": "Ideal f\u7709r Individialurlauber   showReview(14321990, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR411063579", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mibor"}, {"Content": "Normal   showReview(8511692, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR273900534", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JavierBogot"}, {"Content": "carino il CORTECITO INN   showReview(8377891, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR552293732", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ftjli"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g147293-d572429-r18793500-El_Cortecito_Inn-Punta_Cana_Dominican_Republic.html", "HotelID": "572429", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
