{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved Bakungs--will return in 2006 I loved Bakungs Beach Cottages. A good budget hotel, which helped for me as I come from U.S. and flight is very long--so I want to stay in Bali at least three weeks. The staff were all friendly and helpful. I felt right at home there and enjoyed the other guests as well. Pool was great after a day at the beach. I encountered NO rudeness from any of the staff, and that is unheard of in this day and age. Everyone was eager to help, assist and just have a normal conversation. I travel alone for the most part and the hotel is safe and quiet. There are shops along the road and when you want something different than what is on the menu at Bakung's, there was a great warung just down the road to the left of Bakung's Beach Cottages. Staff was friendly there also. Right across the street in the little store, a lady will do your laundry for a very reasonable price. I frequented her often. The store sells ice cream, water and snacks. I can't wait to get back there again. I intend to go in October or November 2006.", "Date": "Jul 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR870907650", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "CTAChicago"}, {"Content": "good for budget holiday We stayed here in Feb 2005 because it was one of the package deal hotels listed on our booking. We didnt expect much as it was a lead in hotel but were very happy with the location. It had a clean pool by the meals pavilion. Mostly the guests seemed to be more the retiring type so it was very quiet day and night. It is located down a lane away from the main road which also helped keep it quiet. It was serviced by a strip of shops covering all the basics from internet access to t- shirts and art etc. on the way to the main road. It was also walking distance to the beach. Only a 10 minute walk to the centre of Kuta and in the other direction a fabulous and modern bakery and supermarket owned the Chinese Emporium. Surprisingly this shop presented as ultra western with fresh (imported)barbeque meat and fruit/vegetables as well as familiar snacks for those who want something comforting. The hotel was dated but clean. We had a balcony which was quite large but often warmer than inside as the aircondition was very good. Not a 5 star by any means but perfectly adequate and cheap. We didnt use a taxi for anything local as it was all walking distance but for long trips the front desk were very helpful giving assistance and organising a taxi for us.Many of the guests had stayed there before which is always a good indicator and although a few Aussies, mostly they were Dutch and German speaking but as I said it was quiet and even conversations remained private.Definitely recommend for the budget conscious and for those who like me rate more for location than marble finish. Breakfast was included in the price and was typical Asian (substantial) selection. The restaurant was open all day. The evening meals were adequate but not huge. For Asian food lovers it was very good but for western selection probably a bit scarce.", "Date": "Jan 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR434802813", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "5thgeneration"}, {"Content": "\u9289\ue042\u5157\u9288\u6052\u5115\u9289\u6825\u5137\u9287\u0441\u4f1d\u9287\u253f\u4f1d\u9287\u253f\u4f04\u9420\u677f\ue568\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u9286?#x201d;       \u7039\u3085\u5534\u9287\u5b28\u501d\u9350\u6b0d\u4ed0\u9287\ufe3a\u4f29\u9287\u4ff1\u4ed0\u9287\u71b4\u20ac?/a>", "Date": "Dec 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR483795152", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "\u951e\u5eaf\u7df9\u951e?> \u951e\u5eaf\u7df9\u951e?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u3123\u501e\u9287\u5098\u4eaa\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19160196, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR112157697", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue218\u506a\u9288\u5e7f\u5057\u9288\u3123\u5044\u9287\u4ff1\u4ef9\u9287\ue21b\ue122...   showReview(19923550, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 16, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR493372098", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g562690-d588404-r5438719-Bakung_s_Beach_Cottages-Tuban_Bali.html", "HotelID": "588404", "Price": "$52"}}
