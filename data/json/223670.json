My husband and I stayed here at end of March 2011. Small resort with personal attention. We booked a regular room for part of our stay and a oceanview suite for the latter half due to availability. Upon our arrival we were suprised to learn that there was a cancellation and the gal at the check-in desk held a suite for us for our entire stay of 9 days!!! Area definitely off the beaten path, quiet, unbelievable infinity pool,seperate kids pool, one of the best beaches on the island at the end of the road about 2 minutes away with a lighthouse and very cool hiking path, turquoise blue water to die for. The suits are perfect oceanviews, very clean and quiet. Outdoor bar with restaurant was steps from the ocean with a inside area as well. You could purchase meal passes for breakfast and dinner with room charge which my husband and I decided to do since resort was a bit of a drive from area restaurants. Food was very good, ceviche yummo, grouper even better,never disappointed in a meal. Breakfast buffet was nice as well sitting by the water every morning. There is a white and yellow parrot named Salina by the welcome office who is out during the day who made my mornings, she talks and will let you pet her with a little patients. Great wildlife viewing, as the resort is on a protected mangrove wildlife area, lots of sea birds and reptiles. Staff friendlier than any we have encountered in our travels. Joel at the bar and restaurant was our favorite, such a kind soul, always a smile and full of helpful info, we tipped heavily for such personal and kind service. Owner of the resort was always present and a very sweet lady. Night before we left, the owner and Joel gave us a bottle of Puerto Rican rum and a few other gifts to say goodbye, how cool is that!!! We felt very welcome here and recommend this place to anyone who loves the ocean, personal attention, great food,romance and quiet!! Best thing we took away from this vacation was the memories of the smiling faces of all the staff, the personal attention and the new life we made on our vacation here!!

When you arrive there's a big WOW factor when you see the grounds and the scenery. Very \"off the beaten path\" and secluded with a beautiful infinity pool (with waterfall), lush lounge chairs, and even a cute white parrot that says hola as you go to the lobby for check in. It's a little difficult to get there (3 1/2 hours from San Juan airport) but if you are looking for a place that's relaxing, quiet, without the hustle & bustle of the metro area, this is the place to go. Now the title is a little bit misguiding since it's more of a budget friendly hotel than a resort. The package we got was a villa with full breakfast and dinner. Room was ok, needs to be updated/renovated and needs a vanity space. Breakfast is great, especially with the puertorican style coffee with hot milk. Dinner only includes the main entree. No appetizer, dessert or drinks other than tap water, so don't think it's all inclusive, you will spend some money. The food is very very good on the weekdays and amazing on the weekends (buffet dinner). Their buffet is high quality puertorican food. For buffet service you do not serve the hot food yourself, they control it. I didn't like the hot food male server at the breakfast buffet, he made comments when I went for a second helping of plantains...made me feel uncomfortable about asking for seconds at a buffet....?....The waiters on the other hand were excellent, felt like we had known them for years, gave tips on where to go when we wanted to explore the area and go dancing. The staff was very friendly, always smiling and ready to help. However, one day my room was not made up, even after mentioning it to the front desk staff at the lobby. I found it really strange that there are no phones in the rooms, so if you need something or have a complaint you have to go downstairs to the lobby, or call from your cellphone. There are many many mosquitos, please bring OFF, otherwise you will not enjoy it, the restaurant area is open air and I got over 20 bites the first night at dinner! Playa Sucia is very near by, best beach on the island in my opinion. We took advantage of the spa, the masseuse was very good.

There are nice hammocks around the property and cute little gazebos and sitting areas to take pictures and admire. My baby enjoyed looking at a big white parrot that was caged near the restaurant. There is also a kiddie pool which is excellent for parents with infants toddlers. My husband enjoyed the lighthouse and beach close to the 'parador'. BEWARE: You really need a car to drive around, as the access to the beach and lighthouse is through a difficult dirt road (you almost need wheel drive to go through, but we were able to make it in our rented sedan). It'll probably take maybe an hour or even more to walk towards the beach through the dirt road. There aren't many other activities other than beach, pool & lighthouse, so I would not recommend staying for more than 3 or 4 days. Also, there aren't any nearby stores to purchase stuff or even to eat. Luckily, the restaurant is decent enough.

My girlfriend and I spent six wonderful days throughout the island; we had only positive experiences wherever we went but this hotel stood out amongst all the wonderful places we had been. This is not a resort of the type that you might find on the east side of island, which seem to isolate themselves from the natural landscape of the island, but rather a small independently owned parador with a gorgeous view of salinas bay, a beautiful pool, very comfortable rooms, and a friendly and very professional staff. The room was tastefully decorated, with a bed so comfortable I wanted to take it home. The resort itself is located right next to a nature reserve and you could see all manner of sea birds diving for fish while relaxing in the infinity pool. The location is very tranquil, with no noise from cars or nearby settlement. The staff was always smiling and helpful, not in a disney sort of way, but with genuine interest in their work and the comfort of their guests. The food at the restaurant (one of the mesones gastronomicos) was very good and fairly priced. In summation- if you like to be out in nature and aren't an affectionado of package tourism resorts, this is a wonderful place to spend a couple of days.

The first time I went to San Juan and while there, I talked to a local person and she told me that there were so many other beautiful parts of the island that people never see because all the tourists go to San Juan. Was she right!!! I did a lot of research and found this hotel on the southwest tip of the island. I have to say that it was breathtaking. I can't wait to go back and plan on going back too. I'm not sure if I can say the same about San Juan. Just some information about the area....it is very secluded and if you want peace and quiet, this is definitely the place for you. The actual resort area is beautiful and relaxing. The beach is literally 10 feet from the hotel's pool and although you can walk on the beach, it is not recommended to swim in because of the seaweed. If you take a right out of the hotel and drive for about 5 minutes, you will find the most beautiful and secluded beach. It is in the shape of a bay but it still has the beautiful colors of the caribean and is located right by the lighthouse. We went there on Christmas morning and we were literally the only people there and when we returned a few days later, there were people but not many at all and it still had the feeling of seclusion. It is a very very bumpy ride to get there but it is very reachable by car. You will hear that you need a 4-wheel drive to get there but we made it there fine with a Hyuandi Brio. There is another beach located in the opposite direction of the hotel of the hotel in Boqueron (about 15 minutes) but it is nothing like the beach by the lighthouse that I just mentioned. There was a lot of litter and there was a homeless person sleeping on the beach in Boqueron (not that I care about that) but some people may feel uncomfortable about that. The food at the hotel was pretty good but very expensive if you didn't have the meal plan, which we didn't. The breakfast buffet for the two of us was $27 and dinner was $77. We actually ended up driving to Cabo Rojo (about a 20-25 minute drive) and picked our own groceries up and ate mostly from that. There are no refrigerators in the rooms so we had to get food that didn't need to be refrigerated. The rooms were very nice, small, but nice. They were very clean and fine for the two of us. The beds were a little hard and that was really my only complaint about the room. The water pressure in the shower wasn't that great but who cares??? The pool was great! It was big, beautiful and clean. I didn't realize it but there is another pool for kids so that would be great for families but the overall feel of the place was for couples and not families, not saying that there weren't any because there were. This was a great experience and I highly recommend it to anyone. If you're the type of person who is not easy to please or feel that you deserve the best of the best, than this is probably not the place for you. If you're an everyday person who needs some peace and quiet in a beautiful place and don't mind the small rooms than I would go here! Enjoy! Oh, btw, we flew into Ponce, which is about 1 1/2 hours east of it but there is also an airport in Magjuez, north of it. And of course the San Juan airport but that is over 2 hours from it. Ponce was the cheapest for us to fly into.

If you stay two or more weeknights, the rate is only $80 per night (with breakfast included). It is a bargain! The rooms are not spectacular, but they are clean and comfortable.

The cost for the breakfast was more expensive than what we would have like to pay but worth it. The breakfast was awesome, delicious. Make sure you get to the buffet at least 30 minutes before it closes. If not, your selection will be limited\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Nearby Beach Make sure you first buy a cooler, drinks, sun block and whatever else you think you might need. A drive to El Combate and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to find everything. A 5 minute drive on the dirt road from the hotel and your at Playa Sucia. During the weekday, hardly no-one was there. It was as if we had the beach to ourselves. The water was warm and calm. Shade was very close to the water and the view was excellent. There is also a Light House next to the beach, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a must visit. We parked next to the gate and walked up the hill to the light house then continued on to the beach.

The ambiance and decor is lovely in the outside (the big pool looks like something out of Town and Country magazine), short of spectacular (they're in the middle of a wildlife preserve, truly blessed when it comes to location), but the rooms leave much to be desired. I found a cockroach in the bathroom, the floor tiles were a bit gritty, and the bed's linens deserved a throught cleaning. Yuck. The prices do not reflect the value offered.

There is nothing else to do here. 3) Since the hotel is in a nature preserve, they are not allowed to spray for mosquitoes, gnats, ect. We ate at the beach side restaurant on our first night and were driven inside by swarms of gnats who ended up swimming in our wine.

We ate at Mary's bakery every day right down the street. Which brings me to 5) The Rate. We paid about $170 a night - no breakfast incuded. In my opinion - way overpriced.

Could you please mail it to us and bill our room? Certainly. Waited a week, called. Woman said she could not mail without charge card number. I politely told her to use the one her business used to charge our room. Waited a week more, nothing. Called, she claimed Federal Express had not come by. Frustrated, I drove for two hours across the island to pick up the bag myself. When I got there, the phone was missing, though two of the female employees had seen the phone, safe behind the office desk. Nobody could say where the phone was since \"anything was possible!\" The manager/owner was, naturally, on a trip to San Juan. We left. I have been calling for over two weeks now. In the U.S. I would have called the police. What a nasty experience. This hotel owner has no moral, no standards, no class. I wish I could report him to...someone. Truth is: In Puerto Rico, Americans get ripped off on the regular-even by so-called \"nice\" places like this moth-bug infested hellhole. Second, you can't go in the water because it is...toxic. Really, you cannot go in the bug-infested water in front the the \"spa\" because it contains dangerous microbes, too near the mangrove and salt flats. The water stinks and is murky. We paid way too much for our nasty room. I woke up with hotel throat, though the place is supposed to be some sort of spa. For the same price, in Mexico, you can stay in a \"truly\" wonderful hotel. Not this dump. Guess what: we should have known better. We checked in on a weekday, thought at the height of the tourist season-not another guest the whole time. The manager glared at my well-behaved children splashing in the deserted pool. It was clear the place was structured for the singles set, or honeymooners. I cannot imagine spending a honeymoon in this dump. The truth is this: If you took this place and set it down in an area not infested with bugs and crawling, slimy things, it might be kind of nice. But then you would still have the surly workers, and dishonest management/owner. When we checked in, the woman acted as if we were disturbing some great moment. But this is typical of the Puerto Rican hotel workers; they obviously hate their jobs and could give a rat's butt about customers. The salt flats are very interesting, if a bit deserted and not safe for families. The local beaches are really quite wonderful, but I would perhaps stay in Rincon next time-which I usually do. This place has bad vibes, and I am guessing it starts with the owner. By the way, for the prices you pay, the restaurant kind of sucks, too, and the service is lame.

This is a great place to just relax, watch the sun rise and the sun set (both of which are phenomenal). I discovered this hotel last year when I was trying to get to the light house. Getting there may be confusing. The easiest way of getteing to the hotel is probably Highway 2 to road 100 then 301 all the way to the end. The hotel is located in a wildlife sanctuary and close to an area where sea salt is produced (there will not be any noise to bother you). As you pass these the road will appear to seem to end, since there will be large pot holes, but go slowly and you will encounter the hotel. (the reason for not repairing the pot holes I was told by the wildlife people is to control access to the area. If the road was pristine they say many more people would enter the refuge. Once you see the beauty you will probably agree). The restaurant serves good food, the service is friendly but slow. Order a medalla or other drink while you watch the sunset. Ask for the bread with papaya flavored butter. The fried red snapper, the snapper fillet, and the mofongo (mashed plaintain with garlic stuffed with whatever you want) are excellent and well worth the wait. On the weekend they had a guitar player who played great music during dinner. The pool was nice, but there is no beach on the property. However, there is a beach, a lighthouse and hiking for those willing to bring water and food, get into their car and drive further along the road with the pot holes. As you drive the road will fork, on the right you will encounter the path leading to the beautiful light house and cliffs overlooking the ocean (be careful with the edge of the cliffs since the edges may lack support). The wind is great for flying a kite (save the one that you might have used at El Morro in San Juan). From the light house you will be able to see Playa Sucia (it is unclear why they call it sucia- dirty in English. I was told two stories; 1. the ocean brings up the garbage from the cruise liners and the surrounding islands, 2. the seaweed washing up makes the beach look dirty.) If you go back to your car, take the left portion of the fork in the road, the pot holes here are larger than the previous one you may have encountered, but drive courteously and carefully and you will reach the beach, which is great, clean and pristine. Parts of it are rocky, but there are areas where you can get in the water without problems. If you walk to the end of the beach there will be some hiking trails, I did not go because my significant other would not let me. However, there were many people there. The room at the hotel was nice, there was a small balcony where I would sit outside at night, read and drink a beer. You could also sit by the pool at night and feel the breeze. At night we would sleep with the door open so that we could hear the coqui, and there was never a problem. For breakfast, we would go into town to try the local food and it was well worth it. This place is well worth going to if you just want to relax, and enjoy the surroundings. I will certainly return, and would recommend this place to my family and friends.", "Date": "April 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "pr", "Title": "\u201cCheck your\u201d", "Author": "ricktap", "ReviewID": "UR6803324", "Content": "I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. The time you wait for your food is mind boggling. It takes hours just to get your order on the table. The place stink like hell..........coming from the shallow beach front...do they have one really?.........The employees have the premium parking space. I park once inside and they chase me away....as if I was some local who happen to sightsee. The pool is nice...but nothing like the Frenchman Reef Hotel in St. Thomas. It was an ordinary pool nothing to be proud off. The spa? nothing fantastic and awesome....I will not trade it for The Golden Door Spa in Hotel Conquistador. I was treated like a real paying custumer there. The spa offer is basic and redundant. I can go to any beauty saloon and they offer a much better bargain for it. The beach front? Cant swim! Can use the water it is infested with mosquitos and jelly fish. Food is good and tasty but nothing superb like the Rincon By the Seas. This Resort I highly Recommended due to their professionalism and promt service when ordering your meals. They are very good and attentive to your needs. And the food is excellent. Bahia Salina is good for people who are looking for a resort who want to sacrifice convinient. From the dark and damp rooms, to a restaurant in which a meal takes a lifetime to be serve and the smelly water from its beach front (specially in the Morning and Late afternoon...EWWWW). Mosquitos? They are plentiful...I ask them if they can lit up a citronella candle and the response was....that I have to live with them since they are part of the package. I almost blew my top....helllllloooooo!....horses! Mosquitos!?......This place isnot for people who are pinicky and have been to hotels and have their needs taken care off without asking for it. I do have one good experience with one nice gorgeous lady there at bahia Salinas.......and she is not human.....she is the Parrot they called Chalina.
