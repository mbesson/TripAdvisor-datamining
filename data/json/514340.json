I loved its location - walking distance from the train station, easy to find and, even better, just off the main tourist thoroughfare through the city (linking the train station with St Mark's Square). Once you get off that thoroughfare, suddenly it feels like you have Venice to yourself and the Cannaregio area (which the hotel is located in) is perfect for enjoying a quiet but attractive part of Venice away from the masses. The hotel is excellent value - I chose one of the cheap rooms and, as a bigger one was available for the first two nights (of our four night stay), we were invited to use it for those two nights and then move to the room we'd booked after that. We were grateful but decided against given the amount of packing and repacking we'd already done on the trip! I would, however, advise booking one of the larger rooms unless you're minimising travel costs because you'll get a canal view and the bed may be bigger. This was the one downside of the room we had - the bed was just too small. I'm not exactly tall, just 177 cm (slightly under 5' 10\") and my feet were over the edge which made sleeping uncomfortable. The smaller bed might have been a necessity given the size of the room. Other notes: The bathroom, like many in Italy, offers only the hand held shower head that can't be mounted on the wall for the type of shower you might be used to in other countries; breakfast offered some good options though I'll never understand why, in Italy, a country full of wonderful food, there is an obsession with providing cold croissants (known locally as cornettos) as a standard breakfast item. Finally, the hotel provided free wi-fi connection and we were given the details for it on arrival.

Previous reviewers are right again. We have just returned from a four night stay in this fabulous little hotel/B&B situated in an ideal part of the city. We decided to get the bus directly from the airport which takes about 20 minutes and cost 5euros each. We then walked the short distance to the hotel (we actually did it in a little over 10 minutes but I would say 20 mins at a more leisurely pace!) I'd seen planty of pictures on trip advisor so new what to expect from the outside and this is typical of most of the buildings in the city. We arrived very early expecting to drop our luggage off and head off for the day before booking in, we were pleasantly surprised to be offered a lovely cup of coffee upon arrival and a very warm welcome from the member of staff (I didn't catch her name but she was the maid) The owner arrived a few minutes later and showed us to our room. I had booked a superior double based on other reviewers recommendations. I thought I'd be a bit cheeky and ask if we could have a nice view with this room and was told this wasn't available!! We stayed in room 3 which is on the first floor at the rear of the building. It looks directly over the neighbouring property, however I can thoroughly recommend this room if you want peace and quiet. Breakfast was simple but sufficient (fresh croisants, yoghurt, cornflakes) and as much piping hot strong coffee as you can drink! Regarding the walk from the hotel to St Marks Square..... I'm afraid I can't give you the best timings for this strole because each time we headed off in the morning we kept finding different alleyways all of which lead to something new or another beautiful monument or building. The room was cleaned and beds made up every morning. All of the staff were pleasant, professional and unobtrusive.

It was a large room with a small seating area; it was huge compared to other hotels I've stayed in Italy, London, and Paris. We were able to eat breakfast on the canal and it was fun watching morning deliveries being made via boat up and down the water. I liked the fact that it was a bit out of the way; no throngs of tourists everywhere.

On the map it looks a bit out of the way, but I can assure you that is well connected, only 10' walk from the railway station and with the Guglie stop of the boat-bus just yards away. The service is friendly and efficient. The TV in the room has English, French, Spanish, German and even Chinese channels. The WiFi is good (ask for an plug-adapter at the reception). The only two things that I consider can be improved were: the lack of a screen in the bath-shower and that you can hear every step of the people occupying the upper room. Maybe a thick carpet may prevent the continuos \"toc, toc, toc\" of our neighbours heels and a simple clear screen may prevent the shower water splashing the floor and becoming hazardous. The breakfast, although simple, was sufficient. I did not look at the other rooms, but -definitely- my Green Room was worth the price I paid. We had a king-size bed and a double sofa bed, so a couple and two children can easily sleep in this big room. It has a mini-fridge in a cabinet and a safe-box in the wardrobe.

In very close proximity to the waterbus station and two minutes from a great street for shopping, eating, getting a few groceries (water, fruit, wine/beer), baking, etc. Breakfast was adequate with cereal, croissants, tea/coffee, and served by the canal when weather permits. The rooftop is a great place to sit with a bottle of wine to watch people on the street and the canal below. Some of the staff did not speak much English but others got by just fine. We walked to the bus station(15mins from hotel) the day we left at 4am, to get the 5euro ride to the airport. The bus ride took 25mins....was an easy cheap way to get there. We heard of others that took water taxis for 110euro that still took 20mins. Would recommend a transport pass when you arrive of 18, 24 or 36hrs depending on your needs, so that you can ride the water buses all you like.....if you want one-way or return bus ride to airport included you must ask specifically for that kind of transport pass as it costs a little extra. The pass is well worth the money as each water bus ride costs 6.50 euros for 60minutes of use. You have to validate your ticket each time you get on the water bus to make sure the time is still valid. You can purchase these passes after you exit the railway station, there is a booth along the canal to your right, and I am certain you can buy them at a similar booth at the airport. We loved Venice, it is so beautiful at night. You will be charged a service charge to eat at most restaurants and even at some bars, so be sure to check on that before sitting or ordering (we adjusted our tip according to how much this charge was). Eating can be very expensive so watch the menus and be sure of what you are ordering. If you take a seat in San Marco's Square, it can cost you a pretty penny just to sit, so make sure you can afford to sit down. A trip to Burano is well worth the 30min water bus trip to spend a lazy couple hours walking around.

If those are your top 2 criteria, then this is THE place for you. The hotel is a very easy 10 minute walk from the train station and given the uneven walkways, countless bridges, and the heat of August--we were thankful for the proximity to the train. As for price, they are extremely reasonably priced, especially in a very expensive city. Obviously you get what you pay for, but for this price--I was thrilled to get a spacious, clean, and beautifully furnished room--with very welcome air conditioning after a long hot day of sightseeing. I will not complain about the fact that I had the ground floor room that others have complained about, b/c as I just said, you do get what you pay for--and I knew when i booked it that I had booked the cheapest room in the hotel. So no, there is no view of the canal from the back room on the ground floor. (if you want that you have to pay a premium). However, there were a few small issues that did not ruin our stay....but were still enough to be a minor annoyance. 1--I do not understand why the room did not have a shower. I dont know what the bathrooms are like in the other rooms, but the one we had only had a tub and a hand-held shower head.....so needless to say, \"showers\" caused a mini-fllood in the bathroom every morning b/c there was no curtain or way to stop the water from going all over when you tried to use the hand-held shower head. 2-The breakfast was good but sparse compared to other hotels. You were served canal side (very nice!) a box of cereal, yogurt, and a croissant. 3--Perhaps the most annoying thing (but unfortunately common in European hotels) was the fact that the bed was 2 twins pushed together so it was a little hard for my husband and I to get comfortable with a big crack in between the two of us! Overall, if you can overlook the minor annoyances that are actually very common in 3 star European hotels, the Ca' Dogaressa is a wonderful property, with lovely owners, clean spacious rooms, and very reasonable rates considering the high prices of Venice.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot what I was expecting but was pleasantly surprised!\u201d", "Author": "SydneyTravellers22", "ReviewID": "UR117558483", "Content": "As this hotel as rave reviews on here, I booked having some expectations.

Some tips for Venice: If staying for a few days and are going to use the vaporetto & bus from the airport then it may be worth getting a pass from hellovenzia which covers 24, 36, 48 etc hours. Book more than 1 week in advance from veniceconnected to get discount. I think you can also get discount on attractions from this website too. Take bus number 5 from Marco Polo airport to get to Pizzale Roma (the stop is just outside the airport). Then take vaporetto 42 or 52 to get to the Guglie stop for the Ca'Dogaressa, and 41 or 51 to get back to Pizzale Roma at the end of your stay. Everywhere is in good walking distance - it's great to walk and get lost down the little streets and alleyways as you nearly always come out at the Grand Canal. Take comfortable shoes and stop at one of the many cafes, and it is useful to take a map and/or small guidebook with you so you can look up what things may be around you. Note things are much more expensive the nearer St Marks Square/the tourist areas you get (e.g. bottle of water is 1 Euro near this hotel but over 3 Euro near the square) - stock up before you go! Gondolas are expensive - around 80 Euro in the daytime and 100 Euro at night, although it's a very special experience at night.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa", "Title": "\u201cRecommended hotel fairly close to the train station.\u201d", "Author": "usfBullsFan1", "ReviewID": "UR103224877", "Content": "The hotel was very nice and clean.

I downloaded the Rick's Steves podcast of the Frari Church and this walking tour became a special experience. Try Rick Steve's DIY Grand canal tour. It works very well.

The Old Jewish Ghetto is well worth a visit, not least of all because it feels very different from traditional Venice.

The bathroom was full of marble, with a bath (and shower attachment) and bidet. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a terrace on the roof with furniture to enjoy.

He told us he would keep the same price as the other room - we had booked the night before on an online website and were only there for one night.

We chose the hotel based on the excellent tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed. We arrived by train and, despite horror stories about the difficulties of finding anything in Venice, had no trouble at all locating the hotel, which is situated on a secondary canal that was big enough to be interesting (lots of varied boat traffic to enjoy) yet more quiet and authentic feeling than the Grand Canal. It was an easy and enjoyable 10 minute walk from the train station, even with a light drizzle. We were greeted by Daniel, who we (wrongly) guessed to be the owner based on his knowledge of the facility and his stellar customer service. We chose the junior suite to have some extra room for our 4-year-old and enjoyed the canal views and the large size of both the room and the bathroom. The room was very clean and comfortable. The small tv has one or two English-language stations and the fridge has a little extra room for a drink or some just-purchased cheese. The room was large enough to even enable us to host friends also staying in the hotel with us for an impromptu picnic dinner with some great wine (decanted from those large glass jugs you'll see in some of the smaller shops), cheese, meat, and other goodies procured from the stores that shared the block. Breakfast is served either in your room or in the small breakfast room, and although not extensive, was fresh and filling (and the good cappachino certainly helped). Too bad it was winter, as I understand you can take breakfast out along the canal in warmer months - and mornings on that canal are really interesting with an interesting mix of boats passing by. We also had no problem with the free internet access, once we were lent a plug-in cord. The hotel even helped arrange a babysitter one night, which allowed us to really enjoy some of the fantastic restaurants in the nearby area. In addition to the hotel itself, the neighborhood is a great draw as well - not sure there is much of an \"authentic\" Venice left that is untouched by tourism, but we were so glad to be in a neighborhood where school kids were walking to class in the mornings and people were going about their everyday lives. Although only a short boat ride or longer (but rewarding) walk from St Marks, it felt far from some of the tourist excesses nearer to the square. Four nights allowed for hitting most of the tour book highlights, a few boat trips to nearby islands, and some worry free \"lost' moments where nobody was in much of a hurry to get found! Finally, I'd recommend a multiday vaporetto pass - much easier and less annoying than shelling out 6.50 euro per ride. And even the 72-hour pass for two cost less than one gondola ride.

The bathroom was modern, clean, spacious with a really good size shower (with a screen - not curtin) and the water was always hot which is fantastic after a day of sightseeing. The staff are all wonderful, helpful and friendly. We had some unexpected business to attend to one day and they were more than happy to send and receive our faxes for us. We had beautiful weather whilst there so were able to enjoy canalside breakfast every day. This is wonderful, the canal is large but not crowded and noisy like the Grand Canal can be, it was the perfect way to start each day. We also spent an evening on their rooftop terrace, although the wall is too high to see down to the canal whilst seated you could still look out over the surrounding buildings and listen to the sound of local life below. We bought some cheeses, meats, fruits and other snacks - coupled with a bottle of Chianti wine we bought whilst touring Tuscany, asked for a bottle opener, glasses and plates and had the terrace to ourselves all evening. This was by far the most enjoyable meal we had in all of Italy (and we had some great ones whilst there)!!! With a less than 10 minute walk from the train station you couldn't ask for a better location although I must warn the walk into St Mark's will take a while - you're in and out of so many shops along the way you tend to lose track of time!

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a buffet, but just nod when the long list of options is listed. We stayed in a family room, had one double and a sofabed for the children. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very good sofabed, suitable for adults. Being Scandinavian we never get use to sleeping between sheets, not having our duvet, but the bed is good, a little on the hard side, but we experienced they often are in Italy.

When you arrive don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get scared by the old padlock door. The entrance is just round the corner. The location is within walking distance from where the airport bus ends and the train station is even closer. In our opinion a perfect location. Very easy when you arrive and leave Venice. And when you are heading for the main attractions they are very easy to reach either by waterbus or by foot, giving you plenty of atmosphere to soak in. We walked to Rialto Bridge and back with the children on our first afternoon/evening. The main attractions are great, but you must make sure to just wander around the narrow streets and the numerous bridges.

In Venice, of course, there are no cars. The water taxis are not really too convenient with luggage. From the train station, it was nice in the heat and humidity to only have to walk 5-7 minutes with our luggage as opposed to 25 - 30 minutes to get to a hotel closer to St. Mark's Square. As we later walked to St. Mark's Square empty handed, enjoying all the street performers and sights along the way, we saw many tourists dragging suitcases, overdressed and very hot, trying to find their way to their hotel and eventually pulling over to the side using their cell phone to call for help.

The owner, Paolo, and his wife, actually live in the building next to Ca' Dogaressa, which is a well-maintained boutique hotel. It sits right on the canal, and on sunny days, breakfast is served right on the canal, which is a delight. We were greeted by Daniele, who is the best English speaker on staff. He is extremely helpful and very congenial. Paolo take over reception desk duties in the evening and he is equally up to the task. He recommended many good restaurants for us, including Fontana (just a few blocks down) and Vini da Gigio, which is a freshness-obsessed, high-end restaurant about 10 minute walk away. As most people should know, Venice is a pedestrian city and the Vaporetto (public water taxi) is one of the most reliable and efficient systems in the world (I am a New Yorker and I take public transit every day, so you can trust my assessment). Ca' Dogaressa is within a 1-minute walk of the Guglie vaporetto stop (41,42, 51, 52, and A lines), which can take you to San Marco. However, more often than not, we walked 6-7 minutes to either the San Marcuola (Casino) stop or the Ferrovia (main train station) stop to catch the faster number 2 vaporetto. It was also great to be able to walk 6-7 minutes from the train station to the hotel and vice versa, which was so easy with our rolling luggage. Overall, their location is residential and quieter than the touristy parts of Venice, and 100x more convenient to access from the train station. It is perfect. We would come back in a heartbeat.

So the real benefits of this hotel are:- a peaceful, colourful, location on the Canal di Cannaregio (one of the old ways into the city) where you see real Venetian life around you - mothers taking children to school by boat, delivery barges plying the water, old ladies with cats leaning out of balconied windows. The local restaurants have local customers, and the small grocery shops are also for residents so don't have 'tourist tat'. an easy travel distance from the station and airport - not to be underestimated in a city of small canals/streets and many bridges, where a water-taxi is ludicrously expensive. It is a short walk from the Guglie water-bus stop, where one of the special airport water-boat also stops (12 Euros per person each way, but the easy and comfort are worth it). a friendly, family run hotel where you feel at home with the thoughtful/friendly little touches. It has beautiful traditional Venetian decoration, clean marble bathrooms, and modern conveniences - safe, air conditioning, TV (not flat screen), fridge. When warm, breakfast is taken on the canal side - a nice feature. the sites of Venice can all be walked too quite easily if you are able-bodied; but the best thing to do is to buy a water-bus travel pass and jump on and off at will - useful if you need to cross to other islands or want to explore the outer islands of Venice. Two other stops besides Guglie are very close by, and another two only a short walk away. The hotel is practically next to the historic and evocative Jewish Ghetto - one of the few havens for Jews in Europe since the 14th century - at a price. The things you may not like:- Only a low level shower attachment on the wall over the bath - so take some aromatic bath oils and have a wonderful long soak after a hot day site seeing instead. TV is small and some people may not like the fact it is not flat screen. But you can spend the whole evening sitting in one of the small restaurants only a stones throw away - watching the Venetians and tourists parade out in the evening cool as the sun goes down. (Obviously different when the weather is chilly.) Breakfast is 'continental' and may not be enough if you are used to big breakfasts.

With a typically Venetian feel, in a quiet location with easy access to the historic sights and bustling waterways of Venice, Ca Dogaressa is just ideal. Situated very close to the local waterbus stops, the Grand Canal, and the Jewish Ghetto, a place of great historical significance for Venice. The room decor is ornate 16thC Italianate and our room was on the ground floor at the back and had a great view of a wall, but the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom immaculately clean and modern. The shower was suitable for people 3ft high or less, but we learnt to live with that, and the air-conditioning worked astonishingly well, controlled from within the room. Everything worked as it should and the free internet was very fast and reliable. I recommend that you book a spacious canal view junior suite - the slight premium is worth it. The hotel is owned by Paulo and his wife, who live right next door. They really are a lovely, friendly couple who go out of their way to make their guests welcome and happy. . Paulo is a popular character - a greengrocer turned Hotelier - and all the passing boatmen seems to know and call to him as he tends to guests and helps his wife look after little Omar, the very well behaved small son of one of the Dogaressa staff. Everything contributes to a peaceful homely feeling that we took to in minutes. The front desk is manned in the daytime by Danielli, a well educated and urbane man who had us laughing with him often. His English is superb, and he is a marvellous source of information. Everyone makes you feel welcome here, and we felt like invited houseguests rather than yet another set of annoying tourists. I would like to say this sort of welcome was typical in Venice, but in my experience, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exceptional. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to fit into this neighbourhood. The lady walking her ancient dog slowly down the canal side and then taking him home on the waterbus every day was touching, the skill of the boatmen little short of breathtaking. The elderly ladies dressed in their best finery heading for Mass, the younger mothers gossiping in the small alleyway beyond the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is real Venice, with real Venetians. In good weather, breakfast is served canal side, with excellent and attentive service from Paulo and his staff. Breakfast in Italy can be disappointing to the uninitiated and could be more imaginative here - I would like to see more choice, but the coffee is great! There are few better ways to start your day in Venice than sitting at the edge of this lovely wide canal, watching the city wake. The Hotel position is ideal. 300 yards away from the busy Guglie bridge with its waterbus stop, but you are 15 minutes walk from the heaving sweaty masses of St Marks Square, and there is a serenity here that has long been lost in the commercialism of other parts of this lovely city. If you a wine lover, steer away from the outrageously overpriced restaurants and find the little wine shop 250 yards from the hotel, towards the Guglie bridge. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tiny shop and next to a small provisions shop. The wine shop owner is a gentle, friendly man who speaks English well, who is happy to let you sample before you buy, and he decants from large containers into plastic bottles for you. We bought really good quality wine here for as little as Euro 1.60 a litre! Compare that to the Euro 4-6 a glass average for indifferent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plonk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and rush down there - he even provides the bottles! The small shop next door has a good range of hams and cheeses, and the bakery a few doors down has good bread. We took a picnic up to the Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Dogaressa roof terrace and toasted all the boats that passed as the sun set. There is a great little chemist / pharmacy by the Guglie waterbus stop, with helpful English speaking staff. For those who have been travelling there is a good self service laundry nearby, up to the Guglie bridge, turn left away from the bridge and 30 yards along on the right. The hotel will arrange laundry for you if you are too busy and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind paying the premium. Prices in Venice are outrageous for tourists. If you really want to pay a lot for a little, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t difficult. Try the green canopied place next to the Rialto hotel, by the Rialto Bridge for instance. 10 Euro for a glass of iced tea and a coffee - that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly \u00c2\u00a37 or nearly $14! You also get really rude and cheerless service here too - give it a miss! A much better deal is the little cafe in the Jewish ghetto - in the Ghetto Nuovo square, 5 minutes from the hotel. The food is good and the service is fast and cheery. The prices are better than most in the Cannaregio area and the house the house white wine is crisp and good. There is a good restaurant virtually opposite Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Dogaressa. Turn right out of the hotel, 100 yds down to the Tre Archi bridge, cross over the canal and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first place you come to. Food is very good, service excellent. We met a local family here and were invited back to their home, along with the restaurant manager, and had a wonderful evening on their roof terrace. Danielli, Ca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Dogaressa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager, will show you how to avoid the crowds and take the waterbus out to the Lido and to Burano. Lido has wonderful beaches. We bought 30 euro tickets for unlimited waterbus travel for 72 hours, which is a fantastic deal compared with the 6 euro single trip ticket. These tickets also cover land bus travel. The waterbus stop is just along the canal side - Numbers 41 & 42 are the ones that circumnavigate the city. Check which way they are going, as they go both directions. This is a great way to get a feel of the size of Venice and the way the city works. Unless you are an incurable romantic with deep pockets, 80 Euro for a 40 min gondola trip is pricy- take the waterbus and see a lot more for a lot less. If you really must do a gondola, find someone to share with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up to 6 people can go together for the same price. Good way to meet new people and keep costs in budget. If you have a late departure the hotel will look after your luggage for you and have a shower room available for freshening up before your trip home. Take the waterbus 3 stops to the bus station, Piazza le Roma, and take the airport bus. The very comfortable buses run every 15 minutes and only 2 Euros. The airport is the last stop, about 20 minutes from the Piazza le Rome terminal.

After spending the day amongst the breath taking Venetian architecture/interiors how perfect to return to the Ca Dogaressa and relax in its elegant surroundings. The room itself was spotlessly clean and offered every modern amenity to make our stay so blissfully comfortable. During our week (in June) Venice experienced a heat wave so we were very grateful for the air conditioning which although had independent controls in the room, it was automatically set at the perfect temperature particularly for sleeping (no waking up during the night shivering)! The bed was so comfortable with immaculate bed linen and white towels in the bathroom, all which were changed daily. The shower was spacious and powerful and included a hand held attachment for us girls who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to get our faces wet whilst washing our hair! It was also the little added extras such as the powerful hairdryer in the bathroom, plenty of coat hangers in the wardrobe as well as a mini-bar fridge and safe which made this such a perfect choice of hotels. There was only one thing I would have added but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a minor detail and that is a full length mirror, (for us girls trying to compete with the immaculate Italians a full length mirror would certainly help) like I said a minor point! The best start to the day was our leisurely Ca Dogaressa breakfast sitting by the canal with fresh apricot filled pastries, fruit juices and yoghurt - fantastic! As for the coffee it was most certainly the best in Italy particularly the espresso \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highly recommended for that kick-start!

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a romantic trattoria where you can eat under a vine-covered pergola along side the canal with pretty glass votive candles on each table.

Past reviews have commented on the location being 'quiet, far from the centre of Venice, etc, etc...', but for this hotel I would say the location is a definite plus. The hotel is adjacent to one of the minor canals, and there is a waterbus stop only 5 mins away. However, this is not on a main route and we only used this stop on the first and last days when we had our luggage, but the Hotel is also only a 15-20 mins leisurely stroll from the busier water bus stops at Ferrovia and Port le Roma, which makes travelling up and down the Grand Canal very easy. The hotel is also a 15-20 slow walk to Rialto bridge with Saint Mark's Square slightly further on, just follow the signs. All in all, the hotel is in a great location if you're looking to stay somewhere away from the crowds where you can relax in comfort, but still be in easy reach of all the sights and sounds of Venice during the day. Our room was fantastic, very comfortable with excellent decor, daily maid service and the management and staff couldn't have been more helpful. They responded in a very friendly manner to our terrible Italian, but everyone spoke excellent English so language was never a problem. Breakfast can be enjoyed at tables next to the Canal if the weather is good, as it was during our stay, and this just adds to the hotel's enchantment There are one or two decent restaurants more or less opposite the hotel, with one in particular that was excellent (if you enjoy a great home made pizza) - turn right, go over the bridge and back along the opposite bank and it's the first place you come to. You may, however, prefer to venture a little further for a better standard of food and service for the majority of your stay. If you're looking for a hotel in the centre of the action, or a 5 star+ hotel at 3 star prices this may not be the one for you. But if you're looking for a quality hotel that 'does exactly what is says on the tin' I couldn't recommend this one any more highly.", "Date": "May 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely fabulous\u201d", "Author": "ChelseaLass", "ReviewID": "UR7686543", "Content": "Loved this hotel & loved the location even more.

Our room #3 was a \"regular room\" but had 2 nice windows onto a narrow alley and a modern bathroom. The roof terrace was pretty much our private domain as I never saw another guest there, and one night we simply ordered pizza to go from the pizzeria across the canal and dined under the stars with an inexpensive bottle of Italian wine purchased from one of the groceries on the main shopping street.

The location on the canal was very convenient for going to Murano using the waterbus or saving yourself the walk to St. Mark's. The hotel will sell you a 24-hour ticket for $15 Euro, definitely a good buy for a short stay. However, walking to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's is not difficult, and you would miss much of the beauty of Venice if you don't walk the island. Breakfast was fine, the owner very helpful as other's have stated.

The whole of venice is in easy walking distance with St Mark's square being about an hour to an hour and a half away or a pleasant 20-30 minute chug by Vaproetto. Eating out is hideously expensive in Venice and the best deals are to be found off the beaten track and definitely not on the main drag or near any bridges.

The location isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quiet area on a side canal that does have a vaporetto stop nearby. It is somewhat far from all the action at St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square, which can be a positive or negative, depending on how you look at it. I chose the location because we arrived by train and left by bus, so we were able to walk to both, which worked out well. It is a good walk though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c note it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t next door to the train station. Our room (#6) was a good size, and the bathroom was very modern. Both the room and bathroom were very clean, though there were some significant cobwebs in the ceiling beams. Breakfast offered a good selection. The bed (two twin beds pushed together) was very firm, which I know some people really like, though we prefer a softer mattress. The first problem we had was that our room was very warm. The thermostat was at 26 degrees Celsius, which is almost 80 degrees Fahrenheit. We called the front desk, but the person on duty had no idea what to do, so that night we roasted. The next day we told the day person about it, and he agreed that the room we were in gets very hot in late fall and early spring, due to its location near the furnace. He agreed to do what he could. However, the solution they arrived at was to leave the window open. It may be perfectly safe to do that, but in a city I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not familiar with, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just not comfortable having the window open, especially because there was a roof right below. The next issue we had was that the internet site clearly states \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free ADSL internet\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you do not have a PC yet you would like to use the internet, the hotel will make one available to you right in your room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd So when we inquired, they pulled out a laptop. They failed to state that there was a rental charge on the laptop, but said that such information was on an information sheet on the desk. They did reduce our charge in half, and perhaps we were partly to blame for not reading the sheet (though it was written in half English, half Italian, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not even sure I would have fully understood it anyway), but this was our third hotel in Italy, and the first one provided an in-room computer at no charge, and the second one had one in the lobby at no charge. The last issue was that we were leaving very early in the morning. The sign stated that breakfast was from 8-10, so we did not expect we would be able to get breakfast. However, when we told them we were checking out very early the next day, they told us we could get an early breakfast, but it would have to be the previous day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s croissants, because they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have picked up the fresh ones yet. As this was much more than we were expecting, that was absolutely fine. We told them we would be in the breakfast room at 6. The next morning, we went down at 6, and nobody was at the desk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all was dark. Had they not told us they would have something, I would have thought nothing of it, but telling us about it, then just not showing up was not good. So overall, it was a very nice place, but these three issues do force me to take off some stars.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cJust right\u201d", "Author": "codladh-samh", "ReviewID": "UR6005793", "Content": "Just right for us.

The hotel is in a great location, close to everything we wanted to see, and in a charming location away from the crowds. Ten minutes walking to or from train station, and about 20 minutes to major sights, but we took the vaparetto (water bus) as much as we could. What a wonderful vacation! Owner, Paulo, is as nice as can be, and so is his key employee, Danielle (who speaks English). Hotel is located on a small canal that runs off the Grand Canal. Vaporetto stop is Guglie. Room was nice with very modern bathroom. Comfortable bed. Local noise (from the boats) at about 7:30 AM, but we did not mind because we are early-risers. One night there was a band playing across the canal at a restaurant, and the music stopped at 11:00. To the extent those are negatives, they are all the negatives we can think of. In the morning, Paulo set up tables right off the canal, where all guests ate breakfast. Usual assortment comprising a continental breakfast, including cereal, yogurt, cheese, bread, jams, crackers, teas, juice, and delicious coffees. (I got hooked on Apricot juice.) Charming breakfast room inside, but in mid-May, who would want to eat inside? We had perfect weather from May 11-14. We were sorry to leave Venice. When we return, it will be at the CaDagaressa. Room cost (standard)was reasonable ($500) for three nights (that's dollars, not Euros). More expensive rooms available facing the canal. We ate three dinners at a nearby fish restaurant that was just to the right of the hotel as you faced the hotel. Two minute walk from the hotel. Osteria Vecchia. Excellent fish dishes and pasta. Friendly service by English -speaking servers and English translations on the menu. But we were the only tourists. Everyone there is a resident of Venice. Great mussels. Dinner for two with wine and water was about 30 Euros. Here's a tip: Instead of going to the Cathedral at St. Marks Square during the day with thousands of tourists being moved quickly through the Cathedral, go at about 6:20 PM for mass. Lovely service, singing, and they light up the frescos. Feel free to leave the service any time. We did walk, and it was a wonderful city to walk in. Very safe at night. But get 24 hour or 72 hour passes for the vaporetto and use it for wonderful sightseeing. We became addicted to the vaporettos. Get on a crowded boat, and soon you'll be seated, preferably at the front of the boat. We took a bus from the airport and then bought our first 24 hour vaporetto (water bus) pass. We should have bought the 72 hour pass. I think it was 25 Euros, but we got our money's worth. The 24 hour pass was about 12 Euros each. One water bus ride is 5.50, so the bargain is either the 24-hour or 72-hour pass. The following day, we bought another set of 24-hour passes. Oh, hotels give a discount for cash, even dollars. Worth bringing cash since new credit card charges are steep for conversions into dollars. I'd be happy to answer questions.

It was a small room but very comfy bed. The worst thing was the size of the window, very small, facing a wall. We had to put the light on every morning as there is no natural light to speak of. The staff were friendly and they gave me a lovely bouquet of roses on our Wedding Anniversary which was really nice. We loved Venice and if we go back we would stay at Ca Dogaressa again as it couldn't be faulted on cleanliness and it was our favourite area. Just NOT the downstairs room next time please, Paolo.", "Date": "May 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver, bc", "Title": "\u201cBest value hotel in Venice\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5211841", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel and loved it. The rooms were clean and the bathroom was definitely North American standard. It had a bath and new tile floors - very clean. So much better than other hotels we stayed at in Italy. This hotel is in a quieter neighbourhood, but still only 5-10 minutes walking from the Train station. We picked it because it was so close to the train station and were totally surprised that we loved it. (usually being near the train station is a crappy neighbourhood). The best part was eating breakfast along the canal. In the morning there were lots of boats going by and we watched as Venetians left their houses and went to work. It was fantastic. Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. It was so much better than the hotel we stayed at on Lido.", "Date": "May 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockton-on-Tees", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, Good location, Friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "ian\u2220ie", "ReviewID": "UR5146494", "Content": "We Have just returned from a four night stay (May 2006) at this small family run hotel.
