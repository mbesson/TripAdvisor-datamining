To begin with, I'm not usually one to write reviews (I read a lot of them but don't usually write them) but I decided to do so after staying here. First I'll start with the stuff that was actually good about the hotel: Rooftop Garden Terrace - the garden terrace on the 4th floor is actually very nice. There is wi-fi on the terrace (but not in the rooms) so my wife and I would get some Italian beer at a little market store about 2 or 3 doors down (really cheap, only 1.40 Euros for a 40 ounce bottle that most restaurants in the area charge 5 to 7 Euros for the same bottle) and relax, check our emails, etc. Market Store - There is a little market store (looks more like a butcher shop with fresh meats, etc, but they sell cheap soft drinks, water, and beer/wine and some snacks) that came in handy for a quick, cheap drink or snack since the hotel doesn't provide anything. And now for the bad: Room and Bed - The location is ok, it is a 5 minute walk from the Vatican walls and 10 minute walk fromt he nearest metro stop, but the street and surrounding neighborhood doesn't exactly feel safe. The bed is the WORST I have ever slept on! It is rock hard, almost like sleeping on a yoga mat or something. The weather was beautiful 70's during the day, low 60s at night, however for some reason the room would still get very warm with the window closed. When you open the window, the noise from the trucks and moter scooters zipping down the road echo off the walls of the buildings and into your room with an annoying roar. Window open with noise, or window closed with sweating at night....I didn't want to chose between the worser of two evils, so I went down and asked about air conditioning. I was proceeded to feel like an idiot by the desk manager because I asked for A/C before the month of June. However, after continuing to push the issue, he said it's thier policy to charge 10 Euros per night for A/C. So be it! But the desk manager could have been nicer about it. He was making it out like it was the BIG chore to have someone bring me the A/C remote controller to turn it on. Key - The hotel gives you one key that has a big, awkward paperweight attached that you must return to the front desk before leaving and retrive when returning everytime you leave the hotel. It sometimes became a chore, especially when only one of us was leaving and the other was in the room. I understand that the hotel wants to keep thier rooms safe, especially since the hotel shares the building with some other company, but they could invest in the new card key technology that most hotels use now-a-days. Shower - The rooms are actually very spacious for European hotel rooms, however the bathroom shower is very small. So small that the shower door was cracked from when a previous occupant must have put a knee or arm through it trying to wash themselves. The waterpressure was very nice, but the water would switch from warm to SCOLDING hot without warning. Service - There were three desk managers that we saw during our stay, and two of them were very nice and helpful, but one was very rude and would always just try and shoo me away quickly when I had questions/concerns. I understand there is a language barrier and it can be difficult and sometimes fustrationg to speak a non-native language to tourists, but to be rude to your customers and show that you don't really have a concern about their requests/needs is not the way to make them feel welcome. Overall, Rome is a wonderful place bursting with history and charm, but it can be somewhat confusing and difficult to navigate, and usually your hotel is your \"home base\" that you can feel safe and obtain info to make your trip easier, but don't expect that at this hotel.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cStopped in Rome for 2 nights---2 single Female/NYC\u201d", "Author": "Babyleo726", "ReviewID": "UR126560984", "Content": "We stopped in Rome for 2 nights on our quick 7 night Italy trip. Found this hotel on orbitz.com $112USD for 2 night--good price. I read the reviews on tripadvisor and then booked the cheap rate on orbitz. *** Location: great!!! We opted to take a taxi from FCO airport for about $20Euro each but honestly if you are looking to save then you can take a train from FCO to Termini(Main train station in Rome). THen take the A line metro ($1Euro) and get out at Octavia stop. From the metro stop its about a 12 min walk. Not so bad. The hotel is about a 5 min walk to St. Peters/Vatican----great location. *** Room: Free wifi on the 4th floor only, which again---its free so who cares right? THe 4th floor offers a beautiful solarium or outdoor garden with ivy fence/table/chairs. Very pretty----amazing sunset view but honestly the best sunset view in Rome was at the Vittoriano. You must go there for a sunset view. We had a room on the 4th floor and 1st floor. The first floor had a small balcony---cute. Clean room, showers. No complaints. Again for what we paid and what we really did in the room(sleep only) it was a bargain----I recommend this room to anyone who is truly there to visit Rome and be out all day. If you need fridge in the room, doorman, cafeteria in the hotel, feather pillows then this place is not for you. Again---we paid appx $30pp USD = ) *** Front desk: the 2 men who work there were excellent!!!!!!! Gave us a cool map and circled places to visit and eat. Great service--thank you. **** WALKING DISTANCE **** Again we are from NY...where walking is 2nd nature to us. We literally walked everywhere....from the colosseum to the hotel is about 1hr or so. But we made so many stops on the way as there is alot to see in Rome. One night we were tired-----hung out at the spanish steps which was very cool and took the metro home ( I think they close around 12am). So worth the $1Euro. There are buses near the Octavia metro stop for $1 Euro and they are ok, just alot of traffic. Just remember to ride the buses you must buy a ticket at a cafe/shop-----you cant jump on and pay the driver (nyc mind lol).

Although this is a two star hotel, we have stayed in much worse three star hotels. The room we had was small this time unlike the large room we had last time but it was clean and had a pleasant view. A light above the sink in the bathroom did not work but this was sorted when we showed the chambermaid - she immediately summoned a workman - even though she did not speak any English and our Italian is virtually non-existent. The roof top terrace on the fourth floor is lovely.

When we first booked, we were thinking of three things - air conditioning, location and value. We chose the Adriatic over a less expensive hotel, and found that an extra 10-15 Euros per night bought that air conditioning and terrific location at the Adriatic. We couldn't believe our luck (using Trip Advisor reviews) in finding a two-star so close to the Vatican, etc. Wow. The hotel itself is okay. Clean, efficient staff, etc. There's a very nice rooftop area for fresh air - no drink service or anything, but very pleasant. The staff members are indifferent, but not intimidating. Our only negative encounter came when we asked a desk person where we could find the hop-on-hop-off bus and/or buy tickets for it. He simply said, \"We don't work with them.\" I was surprised he didn't try to offer directions as a courtesy. But that was that. As it turns out, the buses (several companies) can be found outside St. Peter's, which is a short walk. Of all the hotels we stayed at in Europe - or anywhere - the Adriatic had very few brochures or maps that would be helpful to tourists. It wasn't a big deal to make our own way and find things on our own. We don't sweat that kind of thing, but I'll admit we were a little frustrated because we had very little time in Rome and didn't want to waste time searching. It all turned out okay though. Otherwise, the experience was a good one and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again (and again) since the location can't be beat.", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cascais, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cAdriatic is ok, cheap, central and clean.

The (huge) bed was very comfortable and clean, towels were changed when we left the used ones on the floor and although the shower room was more of a wet room and had a few chips out of the tiles it was clean, the shower was very powerful and we never had problems getting loads of piping hot water (although cool showers were the order of the day as it was 34 degrees while we were there). The location of the Hotel is ideal, very close (less than 5 minutes walk) to St Peters Square and Vatican City and also within easy reach of the Ottaviano Metro Station which we used frequently to get around, most of the main attractions are within easy reach of a Metro stop. Watch your bag/wallet on the Metro though, pickpockets are rife and will pull all sorts of stunts to distract you from your valuables! Be alert and you'll be fine, we felt safe using it through the day and early evening. Don't know if we'd have used it at night though.
