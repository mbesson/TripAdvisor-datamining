Stupid me thought I would \"save money\" by booking this hotel for something like $70. Taxi both ways to airport cost another $30. - Room EXTREMELY small and DARK - Stains on EVERYTHING made of fabric: towels to curtains - Bathroom ancient - creepy elevator - located on tiny side street off a highway with NOTHING around it except mobile phone spare parts shops: I am NOT exaggerating... Hyatt across highway. We looked at it longingly. - Location makes it VERY difficult to get a taxi. They are already full speeding down the highway. - I am also not exaggerating when I say b'fast was inedible. Had some Russian steamed dough thingy with watery scrambled egg in chaffing dishes, all the while blaring VERY raunchy Russian music videos on a TV. It was like Cafeteria From Hell. Ended up having to eat at airport. It was just foul, foul, foul, foul, foul. Don't even want to think about it. Only reason to stay here is for a business person looking to but mobile phone spare parts. Strange thing is the front desk was actually REALLY friendly and helpful. Go Figure!!! Seemed like they were trying to personally compensate for this horrible hotel!! We've stayed a budget hotels before under similar conditions (wait for connection). A clean room and edible b'fast is not too much to ask for. Should have booked Holiday Inn at the airport.

The hotel was perfectly adequate - fairly basic, but good value for money. I recommended it to my mother, when she stayed over in Dubai and she was really happy with it too. The thing that really stood out was the helpfulness of the staff. My son was taken ill in the middle of the night ,with severe chest pains. The security guy carried him down to the lobby and then two of the staff on reception (plus another man, who I later learned was a guest!) took us to the hospital and actually stayed there all night with us. As my son seemed much better the next morning, but needed to wait for the results of some tests, I encouraged them to leave. They did so reluctantly, but told me to ring the hotel to be picked up, when we were ready to go. The guy who picked us up insisted on carrying my son into the hotel (much to his embarassment!!)

There are numerous eateries nearby like KFC and Shwarma vendors. Small shop right outside. Lots of interesting shops near the hotel I walked all over to get a feeling of the area its very safe there are always people outside and the Police also patrol. During the Day you should walk to Ther Grand Hyatt its about 5-10 minutes walk by the beach and you will get a spectacular view. I loved my stay here and you can get taxis everywhere.

We were lucky and had a female taxi driver who knew the hotel from the airport. The hotel is right next to Al Khaleej roundabout 15 mins from the Hyatt. The hotel do not advertise it as being opposite it, and the best map of the hotel is on asiarooms.com. The free shuttle buses to the beach and the mall will save you more money on taxis. Ignore other reviews of a lack of taxis in the area. Due to the credit crunch, they are desperate for tourists and will gladly pick you up. The brekkie was fine, abit like dinner though! The hotel is full of Russians but they were fine. Across the hotel is a local restaurant called al jazeera, where i had a curry dinner for \u00a31.35!! Delicious too. My wife didnt like the area as its full of indians/pakistanis who stared at her and sometimes took photos!. But we never really hung out in this area, so it wasnt a huge problem. The best bet is to take the free shuttle bus to Jumeirah beach then take a bus or taxi to your destination, this saved us alot of money. Everyday they take you to a different mall. Do not take the Friday shuttle bus to Ansar Mall in Sharjah though, that place is awful! The staff were friendly and the rooms were kept clean.

It is located in easy walking distance to the Gold Souk and is in a very busy area. It is tucked away down a small street and until you reach your room, the hotel doesn't look too bad. However, the room was a very big disappointment. The twin room was extremely cramped and shabby looking. There was nowhere to put your luggage and once the luggage was squeezed in, there wasn't much walking space. There was a horrible stale smell, which you eventually got used to, but the bathroom was really something else. It was disgusting and if we could have found somewhere else that week, we would have. We didn't even want to use it bt needs must. i didn't want to touch anything. The towels, although changed most of the time were old looking and there was nowhere to hand your clothes except a mould ridden clothes line. he grout was black and the shower curtain looked old. There was no bath just an open shower cubicle with a curtain as an enclosure. The breakfast was mainly hot and reasonable which changed daily, but there wasn't a big selection. It would help to have breakfast on till 11am as when you're on holiday, having a lie in is something cherished especially when you have been up till late the night before. Finally, getting a taxi was a major problem, which is surprising considering it's in a very busy location. If you asked the hotel to book you a Taxi, you either waited at least an hour or it didn't turn up. If you ask them where to get a taxi from yourself, you were told from the Grand Hyatt. However this is a good 10-15 minutes walk away, which can seem alot longer when you are walking in the heat. I would give this hotel 1 star, however it does have a swimming pool (which we didn't use). The staff seem friendly enough. The tour operator did not understand or speak english, which made things difficult. At another hotel, their tour operator had been extremely helpful, advising us which buses to get and how much taxis should cost to get to a destination etc. In conclusion, i would not stay there again.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Randers - Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "Jensine", "ReviewID": "UR20966222", "Content": "Fairly cheap hotel in the old part of Dubai.

I came back from shopping, a day after i had checked in and met my room locked-i couldnt use my room card to open the door. So, i now went to the reception to complain and one of the staff now said 'maybe you've not paid thats why the door isnt opening'. Luckily i had my receipt where i paid for my room for the one week i was going to stay, and instead of apologising, they merely rectified the mistake. I was so angry, i now berated the staff and he even had the nerve to tell me i could go to another hotel if i wasnt satisfied staying there! I now asked them wether that was how they treat their guests or was it because i was black? I noticed i was the only black lodging in the hotel. The only good staff with exceptional customer service was the indian (cant remember his name) that checked me in. Anyway, they can continue having the russians stay in their hotel for all i care-since it belongs to a russian-if thats how they want it! Afterall, there are better hotels in dubai.

This hotel is located in Deira Dubai which on the other side of the creek. We paid Dirham 550 for a triple occupancy room. The room was tidy and very well maintained. The bathrooms/toilets were clean. Only complain here was that the hot water pressure was too less and so having a nice hot water bath was not convenient. There is a restaurant in the Hotel which serve buffet as well as ordered food. The food was ok, but the food items in the buffet weren't labeled. So identifying the food items was not straightforward. Fitness freaks would be glad to know that there is a gym in the hotel which can be used by the customers. Its not a big one but has reasonable equipment for a nice little work out. Another thing I liked about this hotel is that there are no noisy night clubs in its vicinity. So no late night music and you can enjoy some peaceful sleep after a tiring day of sightseeing. The room price includes breakfast in the morning. Breakfast is served as a buffet and had a wide variety of options like toast, omelet, samosas, juice, vegetables etc. Due to the short stay we hardly interacted with the staff.

You need to put the water heater on before you want to have a shower though, i had a cold shower because i hadn't realised straightaway. The pool area is on the roof and is pretty small. There are only 4 sun beds. We managed to get one every day evenutally but not many people were using the pool during our stay. The water is freezing! An importnant note inline with the other reviews, don't underestimate the problems you will face getting a cab! I had read the other reviews but didnt think it would be much of a problem because i have been to dubai before and been followed down the road by cabs. Apparently it is a real problem though, cab drivers dont want to pick people up in busy areas. We aited an hour for a cab the first night, we actually flagged down 5 or 6 and they said no. Then on the last day we actually ordered a cab to the airport and it still took an hour to come to the hotel.

We booked through HotelClub as the rate seemed good and they had a free shuttle bus to the shopping centre.

The hotel is located off the beaten track in Deira - forget walking to any shopping or restaurants - it sometimes took 20mins to hail a cab, though fortunately these are cheap in Dubai. The hotel is dark and dank - windows look directly at walls next door in most cases. The room was clean but bathroom was massively disappointing - reminder us of communist block rather than the Emirates! Very shabby and water got everywhere. Towels small and scratchy. Breakfast and room service were not up to par for a 3 star hotel - bread was stale, jam tasted likie cordial, breakfast room itself not cleaned properly and the buffet (like the hotel) is over-run with Russian package tourists. I will say though that the front desk staff tried their best to be helpful with tours, phone messages, and directions. But they didn't have a whole let else to work with.
