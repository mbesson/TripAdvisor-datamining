I agree with other reviewers that the staff was amazing. Friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The hotel is in an old converted bank that has more character than 99% of hotels. The room doors are even the originals and the meeting rooms are converted vaults. The location is convenient to most downtown places, but its a decent walk to the convention center or baseball stadium. We have a trade show in SD in 2013 and I hope to be at the same hotel. Rooms: nice and big, very comfortable beds, flat screen TVs, free wired internet (no WiFi that I noticed, but I was always working at the desk). My room was on the 12th floor and had giant windows with a view of the area. Value was very good for the area. Bathroom: nothing remarkable, but clean and perfectly fine. Service: From the minute I got there, everyone was friendly and did everything they could to meet my requests. I never felt like a distraction or ignored in any way. I felt like a valued customer. Location: about 1 mile from the convention center or Petco Park (Padres), tons of restaurants in walking. I didn't have a car (walked everywhere and loved it), but I think parking is somewhat of a hassle and expensive. Probably not much different than any other downtown hotel, I just very rarely stay in downtown hotels. Only bad comment on the location is that its sort of the dirtier end of the Gaslamp area and you should be prepared to be confronted by many homeless people. Some of the stores and restaurants in the immediate area are a bit on the seedy side (pawn shops, dirty little restaurants). If you walk a few blocks more, it gets better. None of this really bothered me, but it may not be what some people expect. Exercise room: I'd give it 4 stars. Far better than a typical Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express closet with some crappy 10 year old treadmill, but I've seen better. The machines were good (maybe 3 treadmills, 1 bike, all with internal TV, weights, etc) but the room was fairly warm even after I asked them to make it cooler.

While the properties are different, I can say that the employees here were on par with the aforementioned locations. I do not hesitate recommneding this hotel and location. The building is quite interesting because it is an historic building - previously it was a bank. They kept a lot of the architecture and it is beautiful. The rooms are well appointed and the hallways are memorable because of the architecture. The sub basement where the workout facility is was previously the location for the bank's vault and safe deposit boxes. The different areas were turned into meeting rooms - awesome!

The hotel really is great...lots of old character. Something you don't run into in your everyday hotels. First off, location is great, about a 15-20 ride from the airport. If you're interested, there is a bus stop that runs to the airport that is about 1 block away and it's cheap...$2.50. That will save you over a $15 cab ride. There are tons of great restaurants within walking distance. The only negative I would say is the hotel is located right next to some type of concert place. Each night walking back to the hotel, there were long lines of young kids and most of them appeared intoxicated and even witnessed one girl vomiting on the sidewalk. I was alone so I didn't care, but with the wife and kids I would have been a little apprehensive. Check-in was a breeze and finding my room was easy. Elevators were quick and there were several of them so I didn't have to wait too long for one to stop at my floor. The room was nice, but the view unfortunately was of the backside of the hotel so all I really saw were rooms across the way and the top of a lower level roof. Bathroom was spacious and appeared updated. Overall, I was impressed with the room. Business side of travel was also well done. First off, the hotel does have wireless internet so be sure to get the password from the front desk as it changed daily. They also offer wired internet for free in the rooms so I was able to do all my business work at night. The meeting rooms in the basement were nice, but the wireless signals were terrible. Everyone was pretty much relegated to checking emails in the lobby during breaks because it was extremely difficult to get a signal. Makes me wonder why many of the hotels I travel to seem to neglect wireless signals in their meeting rooms to their business clients. Overall, I was pleased with the hotel.

My stay was actually back in the summer of 2011. I live here in San Diego and my family came to visit for a wedding. We decided to stay downtown to be next to the wedding and couldn't be happier about our decision! From the minute we pulled up to valet to the minute we departed we were provided OUTSTANDING service! Nicholas in particular has an above and beyond personality! He made us feel comfortable with his sense humor and knowledge. Two other associates Ashley and Brandon were extremely friendly and helpful with my requests prior to and during our stay. The location is truly one of a kind. This building was formerly the historical bank, San Diego Trust and Savings. This Courtyard by Marriott has done a fabulous job by keeping the structural design in tact and actually embracing it. This is what makes this hotel such a one of kind. My father owns and operates a commercial and residential construction and development company. I couldn't have taken him a better hotel as he in particular took to the beautiful and unique architecture. I stay at many different brands of hotels. This is an example of why my first choice is to stay at Marriott. It is not just because I can stay on a more than reasonable rate, but because the service and environment are consistently amazing. I have had my fair share of experiences that were subpar, however for the past year or so, Marriott continues to be provide the incredible service that we all desire and expect during our lodging experiences.

We never walked in the door without being greeted by the front desk and anyone else we passed. The history is interesting and the staff loves to share it. We were given a tour by Nicholas - he even took us to the roof at night to let us see the lights of San Diego- beautiful!!

However, the first night we were there, our AC broke and started making this horrible loud noise around 3:30 in the morning (which somehow did not wake my friend up though I felt like a helicopter was landing in the room). After being unable to figure out how to make it stop, I went down to the front desk upon which they sent someone up to confirm the noise. After being unable to make it stop I was given the room next door and told my friend could move over whenever they woke up and we could move our stuff in the morning. This was not the case - maintenance let themselves in before 8 in the morning and then the front desk told me I had to get up and move my stuff immediately or I would be charged for 2 rooms. Not really the kind of customer service I would look for in a $200/night Courtyard or really any Marriott property. I shrugged it off and figured I'd say something about it when I checked out (thinking I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe they'd discount that night on my room bill) - not even close to the case.

I have been to many hotels but this, by far, was the cleanest. Check in was a breeze. As a former front desk clerk I always look at that. Ashley was very welcoming, efficient, and professional. When the bellman, Nick, brought our bags to our room he asked if we would like our ice chest filled with ice and even had a refrigerator and microwave brought up without our asking. The room was very, very clean, quiet, and comfortable. Breakfast was very good and room service brought up the tray at the exact specified time. The service provided by this hotel was more than exceptional. Nick provided a tour of this historic hotel that was once a bank and he was very informative and a great tour guide.

Sometimes a beautiful setting can be ruined by poor service, or one employee's bad attitude or lack of tact. But this Courtyard, at least in December of 2009, employs outstanding and cheerful workers who are efficient and carry themselves with poise that matches the glorious building. We were given one of the suites with a jacuzzi tub right in the room. Fabulous. Even the mattress was a tad more comfy than most Marriott beds. One problem was the huge bathroom door which opened up with its entire face directly against the nightstand of the bed. The problem was that the door jutted out further than the table.

From the moment the valet supervisor (Stephen) greeted me to the front desk staff, they were all warm, welcoming, and professional. I have to commend them for their hospitality and upbeat energy. This CBM is not like others in the chain. It was a former bank and many of the architectual details have been woven into the hotel. The front desk uses some of the old marble teller windows and the hotel restaurant uses the high arched lobby as its setting. The vintage oak doors to the bank offices have been retained for use as the hotel room doors - definitely a nice distinctive touch. The elevators have classic brass doors, too. One little detail: from the reception desk to the elevators, there is a small staircase of 4-5 stairs. No way around it and it makes for an odd bit of ergonomics. Too many to fling your bag down but too few to stow the rolling wheel feature to carry. Being at the edge of the Gaslamp Quarter provides a good buffer from the noise of the nightclubs yet allows easy access to the nightlife. Valet parking is the only option - at $24 per day, it is not the cheapest but you have unlimited in-and-out privileges. Give the guys about a 15 minute lead to fetch your car and you'll be fine.

We did not have much expectation from this provided our past experience with another Marriott (at Biscayne Bay, Miami). We arrived a little earlier than normal check-in time (around 2 pm) but the lady at the front desk let us check in without any question. She also later helped us redeem a Marriott Gift card (for some reason it was not activated by the issuer). The room was clean, large and nice with free internet and TV. Our remote was not working but one phone call was enough to get it replaced. We didn't order any room service, but the maid-service was excellent. They took extra care to make stuffs organized. The parking option in Gaslamp Quarters was limited so we had to go with valet parking (a whopping $24/day). The hotel itself didn't have any parking lot, my guess is they park the cars a few blocks north of the hotel. Anyhow, the price will seem reasonable once you stay in that area. Most hotels charge similar. As others have already mentioned, even if you're not staying in this hotel, just peek inside to see its interior decoration in the lobby. You won't be disappointed. The hotel was originally a bank and they have kept the original tellers and original roof intact. The hotel is conveniently located near many restaurants (some of them are best in San Diego), trolley station ( one block north at 5th Ave) and convention center (20 minutes stroll due South). We were tired on the day we arrived and decided to eat at the restaurant at the lobby. To our surprise the food was really good (or it could be that we were really hungry :)). The price was very reasonable, although the service was a little slow. The breakfast was not as good and you can have better breakfast elsewhere. I felt this was the only shortcomings of this hotel. However, there are so many good restaurant nearby one might not want to stay inside the hotel for long. I suspect this was the only reason they don't advertise their food so much. One reviewer mentioned about safety issues near the hotel. We did not have any problem during our stay. The area is well lit and we walked in and out of the hotel late at night without any fear. So if you don't want to book a car, that's absolutely fine. The MTS and trolley systems are pretty good in San Diego. Yes, there is an adult store just one block south of the hotel, and yes 6th street has less buzz than the 5th but its not scary at all! There are many restaurants in the nearby area but I will just mention a few very close to the hotel. For breakfast try Sixth Avenue Bistro. They make the best French Toast in my opinion. It is located just two block north of the hotel and right next to it there is Mama Gucci, which is voted the best Italian restaurant for lunch. A few block south on 6th avenue there is Chopahn, an Afghan restaurant, known for its kabobs.

I went on Orbitz, Expedia, and Priceline and the average price was $379 this was high in my eyes but I figured I would venture away from the Starwood hotels that I normally stay in when I\u2019m in SD, so I called the hotel and tried to work out a lower price. Eventually I did.. I was able to get the room for under $200 and thought I was getting a STEAL for a SUPER luxuries hotel. Well.. I was wrong. As soon as we arrived at the hotel we walked over to HOB to ask the security guards how early we needed to be in line the following day so that we could get front row seats to our concert.. while talking to him we ran into some fans of the band that were spending the night in line to ensure they would get front row seats.. we overheard a conversation where the police were telling the crowds that the street behind them was the MOST DANGEROUS street in San Diego and that it WASN\u2019T safe for them to be out there overnight. We started looking around and noticed that there were prostitutes and druggies all around.. that area by the trolley is VERY bad at night and not so great even during the day. Apart from the surrounding areas I was also very unpleased with the hotel itself. The lobby area is nice and the fact that it use to be a bank is interesting but the rooms are AWFUL\u2026 I have never been in a Motel 6 but I assume that the furniture would be similar to what we found in our room. We had what was supposed to be two Queen beds but in reality they were 2 twin and a half beds.. 2 adults could fit snugly in them but not very comfortably and they were as hard as a rock.. I was REALLY missing the comforts of the \u201cheavenly beds\u201d that the Starwood hotels provide. When we checked in we tried to confirm the 3pm check out that was promised to us over the phone but a not so nice women informed us that she could not guarantee the late check out until the next day and that we would have to call in the morning\u2026 but on a positive note we only had rudeness on arrival.. during the remainder of our stay the rest of the staff was cordial. Valet is $25 which is average for the area, if for some reason you decide to stay here PAY IT.. you don\u2019t want to be walking around this hotel as a lost tourist. If you are young and looking to party I would recommend either The W or The Ivy.. if you are looking for a nice clean comfortable room in a GOOD area near Gaslamp and all other SD attractions I would definitely go with The Westin at Horton Plaza.", "Date": "November 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sun City, CA", "Title": "\u201cperfect location\u201d", "Author": "steph92586", "ReviewID": "UR10088366", "Content": "Spent Saturday night, October 13th, at the Courtyard Marriott in downtown San Diego, at the corner of Broadway and 6th, at the edge of the Gaslamp.

This hotel is pretty much next door to the HOB. I really had no idea what to expect. It was a last minute thing, so I didn't spend the usual time reading the reviews. Everything went fine upon arrival. Parked right in front of hotel, valet was there, and so was a bell hop to take our luggage. Check in was quick and effortless. We were taken right to our room. Just had a basic room, with a AAA discount $189.00. We asked for the lowest floor possible and were put on the second floor. We didn't make any view requests. We had a view of the street and a few of the buildings across the way. The room was clean (and I'm really creeped out by cheap rooms, cheap bedding etc.) It was nice, bed was very comfortable, pillows and bedding were fine. Bathroom was clean, shower area was clean .....room was very comfortable. Also, the gym/workout room is very spacious, well equipped,,,,a definite plus As many people have mentioned, this is a great building. It was a bank in 1898 ( in that time frame) really nicely redone and preserved. Great atmosphere in the lobby, and tons of interesting features to look at, like the bank vault, the beautiful wood in the elevators, walls, everywhere. Really a nice experience just to be there. . As far as the area being \"seedy\", well, I agree with a previous reviewer.....you are in a big city. It's a typical big city. There are plenty of people out and about. We ate at the YardHouse, just a couple of blocks away. Definitely go there. Great Happy Hour, Great Food and Beers/Wines. The hotel is a one minute walk to the HOB. Really easy and fun. I would rather pay $24.00 to valet park, than drive around a busy city looking for parking. We didn't use our car the entire time. Everything is within walking distance. I would definitely stay again and would reccommend to other travelers if you plan on being out and about in the city. If you want to hang out at a hotel with a pool, bar and other amenities, you might want to chose a different experience.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay Downtown\u201d", "Author": "So_Few_Vacation_Days", "ReviewID": "UR8591542", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for one week and had a great time.

As per the previous comments about vagrants in the area, the descriptions are accurate. However, there are no more homeless folks than in any other large city. I found the breakfast buffet ($13) a good value as it includes a drink, fresh fruit, pastries, waffles and an omelette bar. Additionally there are many very nice places to eat within a 5-10 minute walk into the gaslamp.

The location is ok in terms of its proximity to restaurants, but the immediate area is somewhat seedy and overrun with homeless people. The rooms are very dated in in bad need of renovations.The first room we stayed in was extremely poorly cleaned. There was a magazine with remnants of some food (yuck!). The front desk people were very nice and after apologizing profusely moved us to another room. It was cleaner, but still in need of renovation. As for the food, we only had breakfast, but it was BAD. We requested a late checkout and were given until 1 pm. At 12 housekeeping knocked asking us when we were leaving. 30 minutes later someone else knocked asking us the same thing.

It's one block from a trolly stop and a short taxi ride to many attractions. The neighborhood is on the edge. Homeless people on the street and a shop that sold undergarmets for the adventuresome. Doesn't bother me much, but I was with my daugher, so I don't recommend staying here with kids. The room didn't have a mini bar and the some of the moulding in the bathroom was rusty. Also terrible bed. I woke I with a back ache each morning. The food was REALLY bad. Even the breakfast... which is usually hard to screw up. The staff was very nice.
