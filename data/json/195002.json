The lobby is also huge with several sitting groups which is very rare in Venice hotels.The magnificent part of the hotel is the terrace right on the Grand Canal. You can enjoy your breakfast or drink while listening to the music of the small waves splashing early in the morning or watching the crowded traffic of the canal and the gondolas as the time passes. The breakfast menu consists of a huge selection of everything. The only downside is it is really expensive like all Venice.

The hotel has considerable WOW factor upon first viewing of the lobby. Shortly after that, things go downhill. In 1949 after considerable renovation, the Bauer proudly announced that it was the most modern hotel in Venice. Now 60 years later, they boast of being very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Old World.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Well, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Old World\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start in 1949, and, quite frankly, things are looking old and tired! The 1940\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s era bathroom fittings are decidedly out of fashion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the Bauer, like so many European hotels, refuses to use shower curtains, or any other effective means of stopping the floor flooding that is a constant in so many Euro-hotels. The tub had a marble slab which extended from the wall to about the one-third point of the tub. It is annoying that water must be cleaned up, but it is also annoying that the bather has to contort in an effort to prevent too much water from getting on the floor. Taking a shower is not a pleasant, easy going event at the Bauer. One evening I returned to the room to find water leaking thru the walls, or coming up from below the floor tiles. A call to housekeeping brought a gentleman with 8 huge towels to mop up the water. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Call if you see more water.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fortunately, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Lighting in the rooms was dim and grim, the desk had two of its three drawers nailed or glued shut. There were switches on the wall which no longer seemed to have a corresponding use. There was an electronically controlled safe in my room, but none in the suite. Front desk staff seemed off-putting. I approached the front desk and asked for a map. The uniformed gentleman informed me: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Concierge takes care of that matter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I could see the Concierge was fielding questions from a couple of other guests, so I waited four minutes. When he was free, I asked him for a map. He turned to the original gentleman and asked him to move, so that he, the Concierge, could open the drawer to retrieve a map. The maps were right there in front of the first man I asked. Supreme example of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my job.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A clear indicator of poor service. Breakfast was a complete joke. The bar which adjoins the dining room is pressed into service for the breakfast event. Both the bar and the dining room are serviced by those cheap wooden chairs that are covered with a dull colored linen fabric \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much like the chairs you might encountered dressed in white at a wedding reception. No style, no class. And the entire breakfast experience is very much like a mad house. Tables are pushed together to accommodate larger parties, the aisle ways are blocked by chairs taking up walkway space, choke points impede traffic flow. And all for a very mediocre buffet. I was amazed that there was no good Italian bread \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only tasteless dough balls. The scrambled eggs originated as powder. The food selections were dismal. The OJ was, however, excellent. The fruit was all canned. The buffet was not worth the effort. Even if lucky enough to be seated in the main part of the main dining room, which overlooks the Grand Canal, the windows are so small, that hardly a view to the exterior can be had, unless you were super-lucky enough to be at one of the three tables that were co-located with the three forward-facing minimal windows. Of course, the Bauer is very well located and it seems to be getting by on that one attribute alone. By no stretch of the imagination is this a great hotel. It is very short on style and grace, and the modern amenities just aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there. My room was on the fifth floor, and the tiny little elevator (no more than three people) could take me there. But once on the fifth floor, my room was on a slightly different fifth floor, so I had to walk up and down a flight of about 6-7 stairs. At night, I discovered that the stairs are not lit, and there is no handrail. The door to my room was so worn at the edges, that light poured out from around the door jamb. I was never really sure it was completely closed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it certainly did not seem secure. The hotel still uses old fashioned keys. However, they would not give my sister and her husband two keys. Their plan was to escort the party without a key to the room and let them in. Perhaps, to be charitable, the Bauer management thinks this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153service.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I loved Venice, and expect to return.

When our room was ready, my husband and I were puzzled we had to leave the main building and walk around a very dark corner to this old boutique hotel. The elegance was gone! The ancient buiding did have Gothic decor but no real charm. The room decor was dark, cold with no real thought put into making it more inviting for the guest. The extremely small room (more like a closet) had a creepy feeling, not bad it you're on a ghost tour! The mattress too seemed to be as old as the building. We had no view of the city from the small window. We actually were a little stone throw away from another window where one could easily look into our room! On the positive side was the updated marble bathroom. It was more spacious and quite clean. The location of the hotel was in walking distance to restaurants.

The ground floor of the hotel is very large and luxurious giving false hope about the rooms above. After a lengthy check-in we were shown to our room which was smaller than the Ibis we had stayed at in Verona. The bathroom was marble (guessing that was their justification for the 5* rating) but small. The view out of the window was commercial roof tops - air conditioning units and the like. Never mind we thought, put it down to experience. We thought we'd at least try out the spa - it says to call the concierge to book which we did. Whilst the Sauna is free to use (if reserved) you have to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 to use the jacuzzi?? Why? Surely I didn't pay several hundred euros to have to pay to use the facilities?

We were truly disappointed. After spending 5 wonderful nights at the Byblos Art Hotel in nearby Verona (also a Leading Small Hotel of the World), we were expecting the same fantastic experience at the Bauer but it didn't happen. Since we didn't know how to get from the Venice airport to the hotel, we called the hotel & asked them to arrange transport for us. They charged us 264 Euros for the transfer when, we later found out, it normally costs only 100 Euros! Check in took a long time. We found that the staff in general was cold, snobby & not very welcoming. Everyone seemed to only want to do the specific job that they were assigned, and did not go out of their way to help. For example, I went to the front desk & asked for a map of Venice. The lady at reception told me to go to the concierge & wait in line, when she could have easily reached behind the concierge & got the map for me. The lobby was nicely decorated though very dark. Our room was huge & nicely furnished & comfortable. The bathroom was very small for the size of the bedroom & the shower was only about the size of a cruise ship shower - small! Beds were comfortable & sheets were clean. However, housekeeping in general was 3 star, not 5, as this hotel was rated. There was evidence that the previous guest had shaved in the bathroom & this had not been cleaned up prior to us checking in. It was still there the next day after they supposedly cleaned our room again! Toilet paper was not replenished. Carpet was not vacuumed. I would have let this go if I was paying for a 3 star hotel, but at 565 Euros a night, I expected a lot more than what I got. Wireless internet access was HORRIBLE. It would cut out constantly, making any attempt to surf the net or do any work on your computer impossible. Again, not acceptable for a 5 star hotel. Do not eat at the hotel restaurant. The food was fine but way over priced. A dinner for 5 with only 1 bottle of wine cost us almost 550 Euros & most of us did not have appetizer or dessert. I know Venice is expensive but this was ridiculous. The hotel is centrally located & has a nice view of the square & the canal. I guess this is what you're paying for. However, there were too many deficiencies for a so called 5 star hotel & at the rate that we paid for, I did not feel that we got our money's worth.

I must have read most, if not all of the trip adviser reviews before booking this particular hotel, as well as some from other review sites. I was a little anxious before arriving, in fear of being put into one of the back rooms which may have been older and smaller. We stayed in room 327 and 328, next door to each other which was a bonus. (and something we had requested of time of booking). POSITIVES; Most of the reviews give much hype about the wonderfull location, so i was not at all surprised to find this is the case. I dont think it is posible to get accomodation anywhere better in Venice. Buffet breakfast; We found there was a good selection and it ran from 07:00 until nearly 11am. Sparkling wine as well as a selection of mineral waters and juices were included. It was nice to see the orange juice was fresh, not from concentrate. It was also possible to order fresh coffees and tea at your table. Overall we were more than happy with the breakfast, and would fail to see any reason for anyone not being happy with it. The location of the dining area was another bonus which really made it special. Furthermore, on floor seven there was another dining room and buffet on the terrace overlooking the grand canal. Guests can choose which they would prefere, or even dining at both in the same morning as i did once ! The staff were friendly, charming and efficiant, as one would expect from a five star hotel. We loved our room. It was decorated in traditional quality furnishings with good quality beddings. The bathroom was finished in marble throughout. The wardrobes were ample. Lighting and mirrors were plentiful and good. The a/c worked brilliantly, a cool welcome after a hot and sweaty tour of the shops. The towels were soft and fluffy, and we got dressing gowns and slippers to match. The bath was lovely and we had two showers over the bath, one hand held and the other fixed on the ceiling. Water pressure etc was faultless. Overall the showers were fantastic. We carefully examined our room for any trace of dirt as we are quite particular. It was spotless everywhere, full marks. The shower heads had a few limescale marks however but this was the only negative. NEGATIVES; Many of the reviews stated that the rooms were small. We were more than happy with the size of our room even with the addition of a third bed for our todler. That said, i have stayed in many five star hotels which have had much larger rooms and i can appreciate that if an individual is accustomed to large five star rooms then they may be disappointed. The bathroom again, was smaller than what some might expect from a five star room but we did not find this an issue. (I have stayed at the Ritz before and not even had a full size bath !) Price; we paid a lot of money for our room but was glad we had not gone for a budget option. However the food and drinks prices were a little alarming. 8 Euros for a can of cola, 6 euros for a small pack of biscuits. 9 Euros for a cup of tea. Luckily we had a deal whereas we were given a 50 Euros per room free spending voucher. Great we thought, that'll pay for a meal and a bottle of wine. (As we had 2 rooms thus 100 Euros), but not so. It just about covered a handful of snacks and soft drinks. An individual pizza in the hotel restaurant was 22 Euros, which could be had for 7 Euros down the street. But that said, i take it those folk who are paying five star prices are happy to pay more for such items. Also, after checking with other five star hotels in the area, these prices did not look out of place. Overall we had a wonderful stay at the Baeur hotel. It is perhaps not quite perfect for everyone or without it's issues but i dont think we would have enjoyed Venice quite as much if we had stayed anywhere else.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "cadugan", "ReviewID": "UR116219803", "Content": "This was our first visit to Venice.

This time, the Palazzo was nearly full so the only rooms remaining were very high priced. Since Venice is already super expensive, we elected to stay in the Bauer. We booked a Deluxe City view room which was nice but very small (not unusual for Europe) but they gave us a room with a huge deck. It had a table and 4 chairs and looked out on the campo below in front of the San Moise church and the Prada / Versace/ Bottega Veneta stores. Wow! We got carry out food every day and ate outside on the deck. We had views in 3 directions of all of Venice. Just incredible! The hotel would have been fine without the deck but it was spectacular with it. It is an old hotel in Venice and is just what I expect. Old Italian luxury hotels are opulent and formal. Our room was quite nice albeit small but as I can see from some of the other reviews here, not all rooms in the Bauer are up to snuff. We had a flat screen TV for example, and a walk-in closet. The concierge is eager to book guests on all sorts of expensive day trips. He looked down his nose at us for going to Cannaregio every night but we went anyway with great results. The breakfast at the Bauer is fantastic. We ate both downstairs and up on the 7th floor and couldn't' decide which we liked better. The primary difference is the angle of the view (food is the same). The location of the Bauer is unbeatable. It is close to everything but away from the Piazza San Marco crowds and the noise. The elevators are very small- those comments are correct. Coming down from breakfast one morning a couple got on with us and it tipped the needle! My guess is that if you stay in the cheapest room at the Bauer, you will likely be dissatisfied. I think they have spent their remodeling euros on nicer rooms. (Ours was not the top end at all but it was in a category that I think they have focused on and improved). One more thing: they gave us a code for the internet that worked on all of our devices at the same time. We had 2 laptops, 2 IPhones and an IPad with us. All the other hotels would give us a code that we could use for our laptops only. Very convenient.

We were fortunate to get this hotel on an amazing deal so paid pretty much half price for the stay. The hotel is really easy to get to from Marco Polo airport, we got the bus and then the Vaporetto. It says on the hotel directions to get off at San Marco Vaporesso but get off at San Marco itself as you can then get the quicker vaporetto and there's literally a minute extra walking. Our room was huge - beautiful wooden floors, lots of space, the bathroom was really nice and fully stocked with everything you need. We didn't have a room with a view but that didn't really matter, they were just so nice anyway. The buffet breakfast is great - it's served in a room with a fantastic view over the Grand Canal. The food is really varied, there's hot food (the best buttery yummy scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes and sandwiches) and then lots of different pastries, ham, cheese etc. I saw people requesting different things and getting them too. It can get very busy but the wait isn't usually that long. We didn't drink in any of the bars or the go to the attached club so can't comment on that. The bells from the basilica can wake you in the morning, but it's quite a nice sound and it didn't really bother us. The location is terrific, you are literally 60 seconds walk away from St Mark's Square, a 10 minute walk from the Rialto Bridge - (Venice is a lot smaller than it looks like on the maps!). You're in the heart of some designer shops, it's close to bars, restaurants and other shops. Don't ask the hotel to organise your gondola ride, it will cost you about 20 Euros more than the standard cost (good job we asked before we sorted it ourselves!). Also worth noting that if you use the gym (my partner is in training for the marathon so needed to) you have to pay - he was on the treadmill for just over an hour and that cost 20 Euros! We were very surprised by that as the gym manager didn't mention that when we went up to look so we only found out when we checked out.

The Bauer connects with the Palazzo which is much pricier, but shares the restaurants. Just outside the Bauer entrance is Campo San Moises and it's very Baroque church and on the right the most expensive shopping in Venice. Every top designer is there, along with the corresponding knockoffs just in front of the stores. (I was warned not to buy from these fellas it is against the law and you the tourist can be fined. The hard part is not letting them see that you are looking at the handbags,because if you do then they don't leave you alone, and some of the bags look awfully good.) Continue walking and you will follow the crowds to San Marco. If you go left you will after several bridges end up at La Academia bridge and a whole other world.

Gorgeous views of the canal while eating breakfast (unfortunately it was too cold, being winter time, to eat outdoors on the terrace). Outside the hotel were many souvenir shops and nearby some wonderful eating places (including a great restaurant we ate at several times called Vino Vino) where the staff were very hospitable and extremely friendly and the food truly delicious (this restaurant came on recommendation to us from the concierge at our hotel).

However the food was very nice. The hotel has an entrance/exit right on the canal edge so arrival and departure by water taxi was easy and added to the Venetian experience. I would advise not to use the Gondolas in the canal directly outside the hotel as they charge quite a lot more for a ride, and the ride is a lot shorter than if you shop around. They wanted to charge 130 Euros for 40 minutes, and we ended up getting a one hour ride for 100 Euros from a Gondoleer in the main lagoon near the main Plaza (St. Marks).

We decided not to use it and opted for the hand-held shower that came with the jacuzzi bath-tub. The room size of 240 was tremendous, and the view from its various balconies was wonderful.

The hotel is great and I think we got a great value (however, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expensive but along other 5 stars in Venice it was a good deal).

Bauer is absolutely one of the better hotel I never stayed in, and I have usually high expectations. Everything was to the point great with efficient and friendly staff, well equipped and charming rooms, clean, great views, sober atmosphere and a breakfast buffet of your dreams. We had a Deluxe Room in the new part with a small balcony overlooking the tiny canal and lively street with gondolas, roomy marble bathroom and a great bed.

A wide selection of fruits and berries made the breakfast as great as it can be. Only one disappointment, the restaurant was very expensive and I had expected better quality of food and service. If you had breakfast every day, and a drink in the evening, the restaurant view isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worth the money for dinner.

My initial interactions over the phone were good. The agent was very professional and my request for an upgrade was granted which I found a nice gesture. This however was tainted by the fact that our room (Casa Nova Suite) was in another building adjacent to the Bauer Hotel and not the hotel itself. This was quite disappointing however all hotel facilities were on offer and it was only 20 metres away. This however should be very clearly indicated when booking. Location- The hotel is very centrally located and only a stone's throw from St. Marcos square. You access it by water taxi \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 or water bus \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50. There are lots of Ristorantes and exclusive shopping nearby. Room- The room was very well appointed with a decent sized bathroom, bath and shower. The room itself was large (30m2), as was the bed however there was a large ridge in the centre of the bed (two beds joined together) which wasn't very comfortable. As a Leading Hotels of the World member, the hotel was true to the classical style accustomed to this group, strong patterned room decor with old world furniture or Venetian style as it was described by the hotels reception staff. The room was fitted with all luxuries associated with a five star luxury hotel. There was however no iron and at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50 to press a polo shirt and the pressing service open only during the day, I wasn't very impressed. The room had no views and alluded even the slightest glimpse of Venetian architecture or waterway, disappointing given you are surrounded by it everywhere else. Despite the above, the room was large, well furnished and comfortable. Food- Whilst we only had breakfast (not sure of the lunch or dinner quality), the food was at best average for a hotel of this standard. The breakfast charge of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 per person was expensive (although included in our rate) and to be honest it did not match up to our expectation. The breakfast terrace was picturesque overlooking the grand canal and was beautiful in the morning. The pastries\\bread were not as fresh as one would expect and it would have been nice to have a toaster and more choice on the buffet. Service & Staff- My only gripe is when I called reception with a query which was meant for concierge, rather than put me through I was told to contact them directly, not typical of five star service. Overall though we found the staff to be very professional, courteous and well presented. Overall- I would recommend this well run classical style hotel. It was well located and the staff were well trained and on the ball. I was particularly impressed by the Concierge who informed us well. There are little changes that need to happen in their breakfast offering and to be fair, we were given a rate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac200 for a suite including breakfast in high season which was good value.

There are 3 'parts' to this Hotel - Il Palazzo (the original and most expensive part of the building overlooking the Grand Canal), L'Hotel (the 1940's section adjoining the rear of Il Palazzo overlooking a side canal and square) and Casanova (an annexe adjacent to the Hotel). We stayed in the 1940's section - a little cheaper than Il Palazzo, but essentially the same building. We had booked a 'deluxe room with a panoramic view' and upon arrival, were invited to view a selection of rooms to see which one we would prefer - not an easy task as each room offered something a little different from the others and all were well equipped to the extent of having scented toilet tissue! Eventually, we decided upon a room on the 4th floor, complete with its own good sized terrace overlooking S. Mois\u00c3\u00a8 square. When attempting to decide upon our preferred room, my partner mentioned, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your birthday and your decision\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and minutes after settling into our room, complimentary champagne arrived. On the first evening, we had a thoroughly disappointing and over-priced meal at the famous Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar, which is close to the Hotel. On the subsequent evening, we decided to try the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant, De Pisis. We were seated at a table overlooking the Grand Canal and the evening could not have been more perfect. The food was utterly divine and the service second to none \u00e2\u20ac\u201c attentive, but never invasive. It was simply a most memorable evening. We enjoyed our evening so much that we decided to enjoy the experience again on our third night. On making the second reservation, the Ma\u00c3\u00aetre d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 offered to reserve the same table for us and, again we had a sublime evening. Thankfully, breakfast was included within our room rate as, at 50 euros per person, it is expensive. There was a wide range of to choose from, including bottles of chilled Prosecco if you felt like an early morning tipple! Lunch and a bottle of wine on the Bar Terrace was also a thoroughly enjoyable experience, watching the hustle and bustle of the Grand Canal. The only criticism is possibly the in room air-conditioning. Whilst, the weather was warm during our trip, it was certainly not mid-summer temperatures, but the air conditioning unit blew warm air despite turning it to the lowest setting. Each unit seems to be independent as opposed to a central system and they probably need topped up with refrigerant. I could imagine in the height of summer the rooms may be unbearably hot.

The staff at the Bauer went out of their way to help me my husband could not join me on this part of my Italy trip, as he had a delay in getting his visa. We had booked 2 rooms at the main hotel, but as I was alone with my children I only needed one. The staff very kindly put me in a suite at the Bauer Casa Nova right next door and charged me the same rate without any fuss or penalty. The Hotel is gorgeous right next to a main gondola stop and right in the center of the prime shopping. San Marco Square is also just a few minutes walk. I was considering a hotel off the main Island but I'm glad I did not as going back and forth on the ferry is tiring and little confusing when you have so little time in Venice. The Bauer has its own dock so you can arrive in style on a private water taxi (worth the 100 Euros) after getting off a long flight from Bombay via London. My husband finally joined me the day I was leaving. I told him to take the public ferry as he was alone. Unfortunately, he took the slow boat and it took him over an hour to reach while speedboat took 20 minutes. The public ferry also stops 1 block away from Bauer you just have to make sure you get on the right(fast) one. We met in Venice for lunch, then took the water taxi to the rail station to catch a train(www.trenitalia.com) to Florence. Once we were on the train my older daughter realized that she had left her Ipod in the lobby of the hotel. At first the staff could not find it as they were looking for an IPhone, but by the time we reached Rome they sent me an email confirming that they had found it and couriered it to me overnight. According to me that is 5 Star service, bending over backwards to make your guests comfortable when things aren't going smoothly!!! We have stayed at 5 star hotels around the world so I know what I'm talking about :) The other tips I have are to take a free ferry to Morano there are many gentlemen standing near San Marco Square who are sponsored by the glass companies and they offer free boat rides. Venice is expensive but I was ready for that...shopping is very enjoyable in this beautiful little city. My younger daughter loved Vino Vino restaurant near the hotel excellent pasta, pizza, salad. Also before I forget to mention the hotel gave internet for a charge of 20 Euros for the entire stay! This was a blessing with bored teenagers who need a break form \"culture\" in the evenings. The Bauer also provided a free DVD player so the kids could enjoy some english movies as BBC the only English channel on TV. We did not take a hotel rate with breakfast as 2 teenagers never get up in time and the cost was 50 Euros per head. I realized that the Italians do not eat eggs, waffles, panckaes etc for breakfast everything is hot or cold sandwiches,& cappucino/espresso. I couldn't find any place that served traditional American/English breakfast.

You also have to be aware that Venice is really expensive, not just a little but very much so. If you sit down for a meal the menu prices multiply before your eyes with charges for sitting at the table, high chagres added for taking bread from the basket and for 'extras' like water.

(Not unpleasant at all!) On the second floor our 2 rooms were adequate sized and appointed with spacious black and white marble bathrooms. The walls of the room were upholstered in silk and the king beds were comfortable. There was no view but our location was very quiet. This building was more in keeping with \"old Venice\" and not the more modern decor of the main hotel. We actually felt like we were accessing our own private venice apartment building when we went into our building. We had a great view of the Regatta from the patio on the canal and the hotel happily held our luggage until our rooms were ready (my husband left his blackberry in his carryon and it was still there when our bags were delivered to our rooms!). Our water taxi was arranged for a 4:45am pickup and arrived right on time. When we walked into the main lobby shortly before 4:45 the disco was still in full swing!

Turn left, you will pass a book shop on your left, Fendi on your right and then into a square where you will see Prada on your right and across to the left the Bauer hotel.

Entering the hotel is impressive and first impressions were very favourable. But first impressions often lie! When I arrived our room wasn't yet ready - no problem except that our suitcases were thrown into a corner with no visible protection. We ordered a lunch while we waited - a simple salad of boiled vegetables with an olive oil dressing came to nearly e30 a head. A little pricey, but still....The shock came when we finally got our room. Apparently breakfast was not included in our rate. It would cost us e20 for a coffee and croissant or e50 for a so-called 'English breakfast'. We were certainly not going to pay that when we could get something much cheaper in a cafe, which we did. Worse was to come though. We decided to relax with a gin and tonic (1 each) in the hotel. This came to e46. A simple g&t cost e23! Needless to say we didn't drink or eat at the hotel again. There were other problems as well. We found the service from the concierges varied a great deal. The night concierge was the most helpful. The one in the day-time was quite rude and had to be prompted to provide basic information. I have been in other hotels in Venice where the staff have been extremely helpful. The Bauer was a disappointment in that regard. Overall, the Bauer lives on its location. However, there are equally good hotels in its vicinity which offer a much better service. This is a five star hotel with no internet access and inflated prices.

The location of the hotel is what really makes it so wonderful and if like myself you can get a good price by definitley booking way ahead you will save a load of money! Breakfast is quite steep to pay otherwise and at 50 euro nearly per person it all add's up! The breakfast I agree needs alittle upgrading but really if it's included you still get a really good choise also with champayne (Italian) on offer also as well as hot and cold buffet on option. The view and experience of sitting out on the terrace is worth it alone you feel like royalty! Also there is a set up that you don't just sit down you have to ask and wait to the side until they sit you alot of people were just sitting down and they will move you politely if you do and someone else is waiting over at the desk. We stayed in the Casa Nova annex area of the hotel there are 2 area's to stay in the main hotel and the Casa Nova. The casa nova room we had was really lovely so... clean one of the cleanest bathroom's I have ever been in and all the amenities were fabulous very luxurious bath product's and towels slippers bathrobes. Although we did not have a view it didn't matter to us as they upgraded us to a suite for my husband's 40th so it is worth mentioning this when booking and we had a non-smoking room. They also sent up a bottle of champayne(Italian) to us with compliments a really wonderful touch! So I would have no hesitation in recommending this very efficent hotel to stay in you could not get better in Venice if this is what you are looking for also a wonderful little expensive but special resturant to eat in is the Bistro De Venise 10 min. walk the most amazing food with little extra's added really lovely! Enjoy. Also there is an offer of a shared water taxi with the Bauer hotel guests from Marco polo airport very good service, you book and pay for it through the hotel on depature. It is 30 euro per person each way a real gem to get right from the hotel step it is really alot cheaper than 100 euro each way other wise its called the shared water taxi service.

We'd asked for options and they told us that the private taxi would cost 100 E and take 40 minutes and the public boat would take an hour.

Before arriving in Venice, we stayed in Florence at the Westin Excelsior, a true 5-star hotel. The Bauer Hotel in Venice is the exact opposite of the Westin. From the moment we checked in to this gaudy, cheesy, 1970's style hotel we were shockingly disappointed. The staff were snotty and rude and acted as if they couldn't believe the questions I were asking. The water taxi drivers were nice enough to help us with our bags, which is more than I can say for the staff of the Bauer. It's almost as if nobody working in the hotel had been trained in the hospitality industry at all. Our room was small and dank and overlooked a noisy alley. A nasty used green wash rag was left in our shower (and there it remained for the duration of our stay). The room smelled as if it has been doused in some sort of deodorizer and made me nauseous. Yes, it is located right next to San Marco Square, but so what. Everything is an easy walk in Venice so location is not a huge factor. I tried to cancel or change my reservation when I arrived with no luck. The hotel refused to let me cancel without an early-cancellation fee and informed me that if I wanted to upgrade, it would cost me an extra $5,000 euro PER NIGHT! I'm not sure if the hotel clerk was actually serious or just intentionally being a jackass (I suspect the latter). In any case, I was not going to give the Bauer the satisfaction of any additional money, so my wife and I suffered in their nasty, hole of a hotel for 3 nights. The bottom line about Venice, is that there are many small, boutique hotels (mostly 3-stars), that would provide a very nice stay. I would recommend finding a smaller, highly-rated 3-star property if you are looking to Venice.

Our room had a small fridge, a microwave, and a small cooktop stove. (even though we didn't use it, this is great for travelers on a budget, especially in Venice) Our bed was large and comfortable. The bathroom was large with the biggest shower of all the hotels we stayed in during our trip. Housekeeping came to our room twice a day. Once to clean and open up the curtains, and once to turn down the bed and put out slippers and robes. All of the linens smelled of lavender and the provided soaps and other bathroom products were very nice. I'm suprised to read the reviews that others did not have a clean room.

The American Express travel store is a few doors down which was a convenient place for us to exchange money and book train tickets. By far the feature we liked the best about the Bauer Hotel is that it is SO CLOSE to St Mark's Square and the public water taxi stop. (depending on how many days you stay you will learn to appreciate the public water taxis seeing as the private water taxis cost a small fortune...60 Euro alone just from the train station to the hotel) Since the Bauer Hotel is such a short distance from the square and many surrounding attractions we were able to explore Venice at night without any worries about not being able to find transportation late at night.

Our bedroom was a lovely size, and as with the hotel in general, was fresh, clean and modern. The marble bathroom was gorgeous and spacious and contained two sets of dressing-gown's and slippers which were changed daily. The location was absolutely perfect; we couldn't ask to be situated anywhere better. Literally a stones throw from St Marks Square, it took all of thirty seconds to be right in the centre of things. The hotel was located right next to a gorgeous canal full of gondoliers and water taxi's, and directly infront of a parade of designer shops - a girls dream!! The breakfast room was also lovely, airy and fresh althought the food itself was slilghtly boring and repetitive. Luckily the gorgeous views made up for the otherwise mundane meal! We discovered a beautiful restaurant called 'El Forne' which is down one of the side streets off St Marks Square; and enjoyed it so much that we had dinner there twice during our four day stay! The interior is designed to replicate that of the Orient Express - and done so very well - so is a beautiful restaurant in which to enjoy equally as beautiful food. You HAVE to try the ice cream at 'Gelato Fantasy' - the best ice cream in Venice- it's like nothing I've ever tasted! All in all I couldn't have asked for a better birthday experience.

I had some reservations after reading some recent reviews but have to admit I was left wondering if in fact I stayed at the same hotel! We arrived late in the evening and were met at the door by the concierge. Check in was very efficient and friendly and we were offered a room upgrade without requesting one. We were escorted to our room and our cases followed. Our room was excellent - a huge kingsize bed, separate wardrobe and dressing area and immaculate marble bathroom. It was decorated in traditional Venetian style - some comments on the site suggest that rooms are dated and worn, however ours was quite the opposite offering elegance and charm. Venice is not a place to come to if you are looking for sleek, modern accommodation - the traditional style is part of the charm. We did not have a canal view, but to be honest this was not a problem as you enjoyed the view at breakfast and spent all day looking at the canal! There is noise around the hotel from the hustle and bustle of the canal, but again we found that added to the experience and atmosphere of our stay in Venice. You can't expect to choose a hotel situated on the Grand Canal and expect to hear no noise from the canal traffic - it is fascinating and a welcome change to the road traffic we experience around hotels in the rest of the world. The location of the hotel really is fantastic - a 2 or 3 minute walk from the main San Marco Vaporetto stop and the same distance to St Mark's Square. The hotel also has it's own landing dock for Water Taxis. The terrace overlooks the Grand Canal and is where you have a relaxing breakfast watching activities on the water. Breakfast was fabulous with an excellent selection offered in the continental buffet. Make sure that you have breakfast included in the price of your room though as it is charged at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac44 per head if not! There were one or two pigeons hanging around all of which were quickly removed by staff if on the terrace. Again, if you have researched Venice you will know to expect pigeons, especially in the vicinty of San Marco, but they really weren't a problem. There is an award winning restaurant, unfortunately with award winning prices of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 for steak alone - however, don't let this put you off. Venice is full of lovely restaurants offering traditional quisine and all on the doorstep of the Bauer.

Can't believe some of the terrible reviews I've been reading, as our experience of the Bauer was wonderful. Ok, maybe I had the advantage that I took the time to learn some of the Italian language (something others don't appear to even consider!!) - however all staff on reception and concierge team seemed to be fully conversant with the English language and very friendly. We paid 374 euros - (\u00c2\u00a3260) per night, a rate obtained via Expedia for a Deluxe Double Room. I telephoned the hotel directly about 5 days prior to our arrival and explained it was our honeymoon and that any special touches would be appreciated. We were amazed when we realised we'd been upgraded to a Junior Suite - No. 538 (usual cost over 900 euros per night), with a large terrace overlooking the square (Prada/Gucci etc). Only small complaint was the church bell that woke us up at 7am each morning, but we couldn't really moan about that!! We also received a complimentary bottle of champagne on our arrival. The buffet breakfast was far from ordinary - I have never seen so much choice, from fruit, pastries, smoked salmon, eggs, bacon, pancakes and even champagne. Breakfast was included in our room rate, but 50 euros does seem steep. Hotel is located within a stones throw of St Mark's Square and the Vaparetto stop. TIP: Catch the Gold Line (Oro Linea) from the Airport. It costs around 25 euros each, but we ended up being the only passengers, so it was almost like a private water taxi transfer anyway. Water taxi is good though if you're willing to pay 90 euros from airport to hotel (better value if there are 4 people) Didn't actually try Hotel Restaurant 'Pisces' as had heard bad reports, however, we had lovely meals at Trattoria 'Da Giorgio' in Castello - 12 minute walk from hotel and the Trattoria 'Alla Madonna' near Rialto Bridge (20 walk approx) is truly exceptional (a true venetian experience - not classy but extremely popular. We also enjoyed a nice meal on the Terrace at the Monaco Hotel (Grand Canal Restaurant), which is 2 minutes from the Bauer. Ok, everything is expensive in Venice.....however, for 4 nights on honeymoon, it was truly worth it. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, but bear in mind that July and August are busier months and it's harder for the hotels to accommodate everyone's preferences during this period.

The stay at the Bauer represented the first four nights of our 14 night Italian Honeymoon. I booked a Superior Jr. Suite for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac836/night. Now, I figured that for this amount I'd get a pretty nice room, with some exposure to the Grand Canal (which this hotel does have, balconies over their patio). Nope. The room was outdated, wallpaper and drapery worn, and generally overused. Our room had a small balcony over the small canal. Constant flow of Gondolas and other boats under this room (Room 249) because of 1. the hotel's water entrance is right below you and 2. the public gondola \"Stand\" where everyone gets their ride is right out in front of the hotel. So, if you don't like the noise, don't stay in this room. Next, the bathroom was cramped, and the double sliding pocket doors wouldn't close all the way, nor stay shut. We had to rig a system using the bathrobe's belt to hold the doors together. No shower curtain or door (very European) so the floor gets soaked. BTW, the bath products are made by female prisoners. Kinda cool. Now, we all know Venice is wet. That's no reason for there to be mold in the rooms. In fact, looking at the blackness around the vents, it was scary to think what we were breathing. In fact, both of us felt ill after two days there, and remained so for days after we left. It had to be the mold and mildew. Ok, for the finale....no free internet. In fact, the Bauer charges \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15/hr. Yup. You read that right. I talked to the manager Paolo Federici. Nothing he could do, despite my paying so much a night for a room. He got me a free drink in the bar. Here's the deal: when you're in Italy, get the Telecom Italia public wireless access. Readily available and much cheaper. That being said, the hotel has an amazing location. You're right on a little square with Prada and all the high end shops right outside the hotel's front door. St. Mark's square takes about 2 minutes to walk to, if even that. The lobby was nice, lots of marble, very shiny. The staff was mixed. When we were downstairs talking to one of the concierges, he didn't mention that the museums were all closed, and had been for a day, due to a strike. Managers seemed to not be so helpful. Sure, they sent a bottle of complementary sparkling wine, but it's cheaper than water. Hotel Restaurant, like most other food in Venice is very overpriced and mediocre. They try to give the appearance of fine dining, but in the end, it's not so good. It got to the point where we just started calling the restaurants, \"Crapeterias.\" Didn't matter how much we spent or where we went. It was funny; in the morning, we found a little town area where locals live. Bought a 333mL Coke light for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac0.85 Later, we sat down in St. Marks square at Florian. Paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.50 for same Coke, plus \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6 cover charge. Gotta love Venice. In the end, shouldn't have stayed in Venice nearly this long. 2 nights, 3 nights max. You can hit the major sights in Venice in 1 or 2 days. We were left wondering if there truly are any better hotels in Venice proper.

The room was a large and airy corner room with 4 double french doors looking out onto a square and canal.

It was not as extensive as I would have liked, however, dining out on the patio area over looking the grande canal, being seranaded by the many passing gondolas more than made up for it. The service was excellent. We dined in the hotel restaurant one night. It was the quietest dining room I have ever been in. I found it rather stuffy and pretentious. The food was decent, although not awe inspiring. The wine however was terrible. I was disppointed with the service in the dining room. Many times we were left with an empty glass and my husband had to stand and reach for the wine bottle. This shouldn't happen in a restaurant of this standard. I wouldn't have minded paying the 200 euro price tag for 2 starters and 2 main courses if the evening had been enjoyable, however it wasn't and I wouldn't recommend it. Another night we dined in La Caravella. This is found by turning left out of the hotel, over the bridge and situated on the left hand side. The ambience is much more pleasant. It is outside in a courtyard. The tables were decorated with fresh flowers and lit by candle light. The meal was more pleasant and the atmosphere far superior. The price for the food was the same as the hotel, so if you like fine dining, be prepared to pay for it. Overall, we were more than happy with the hotel.

It seemed like a good deal - water taxi to and from Murano - English speaking guide - personal tour - all for 60 Euros.

Our Deluxe Room came in at GBP\u00c2\u00a3150/ night. This was our first visit to Venice. We got the public water bus from the airport into Venice. The water bus service is a reasonably priced \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12/person/one way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can buy tickets for this service in the arrivals area inside the airport and it leaves every half hour. It took 1hour 20 minutes to San Marco \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste the extra money on the express water bus. The Bauer is then only a 5-10 minute stroll from San Marco stop. We arrived at about 1pm, we knew we were early, but hoped that our Deluxe Room would be ready. This is the first time we have ever stayed in a 5 star hotel, and this is the first time I have ever arrived in any hotel to find the room not ready (rooms are only guaranteed from 2pm). But I guess it is a trade off as the check out time is midday, which is fantastic all the same. We were escorted to the room when we returned from lunch and a short wander, and had our luggage delivered only minutes later. The room was quite a reasonable size (although I was expecting a little more), very clean and comfortable, with a large marble bathroom and the best water pressure I have ever experienced. The only drawback was the lack of kettle, which for a tea addict is not good. I guess the lesson is, if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to pay \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.50 for a room service cup of tea or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.50 for a room service coffee, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay at a five star hotel. The breakfast (included in the price) was the best I had ever experienced. It is served in the restaurant from 7 till 10.30am with ranges from 5 cereals, egg, bacon etc, salmon, meats, fresh fruits, a choice of cold juices, and pastries/cakes too. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry for those who like to sleep in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was never any danger of food running out, there are so many attendants on duty that everything is topped up right until service end. I would not bother eating/drinking at the restaurant/bar in the hotel as it is a little pricey. Venice is full of great restaurants, so many will be cheaper, you just have to wander around until something takes your fancy. Our favourite restaurant was the Ristorante Marco Polo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Salizzada, Castello, S.Lio 5571 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this restaurant gave us a complementary glass of champagne on arrival, was reasonably priced, had great service, and even gave my friend a Murano glass necklace when leaving. And the best (in terms of quantity) gelato we found was at the Boutique de Gelato \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Salizzada, just south of the Ristorante Marco Polo. Location wise, the Bauer is perfect with a very short stroll to St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, 10 minute stroll to the Rialto and a quick 30 minutes to the train station (assuming you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get lost multiple times like we did). Ahh the Gondolas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not that easy to negotiate a cheaper price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we ended up paying standard price which is now \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 for 40 minutes, not \u00e2\u201a\u00ac72 for 50 minutes as was in the previous version of Lonely Planet Italy. The worst part was the Gondolier continually received text messages and made phone calls throughout the 40 minutes and only occasionally included us in the tour. Needless to say he did not get a tip at the end. It all seems just to commercial now, my recommendation is to skip the gondola ride and do something more interesting like sit in St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square and watch people feeding the pigeons. Would I return to the Bauer? \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Yes, but only if someone else paid and only if I got an online special \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would sooner spend a little less on accommodation and spend a little more on other luxuries like another day trip to Verona or sitting at a restaurant on the Grand Canal drinking a fine wine. Would I return to Venice? \u00e2\u20ac\u201c No. It is not really for me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the weather was just perfect during our stay with all day sunshine and temps in the late teen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, but even in early March the streets were very busy, and the focus really is on selling to tourists and not the history.", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cnow that's an upgrade!!\u201d", "Author": "2630", "ReviewID": "UR7197983", "Content": "We recently returned from Venice and a stay at the Bauer.

The bathroom was large, and included a stand up shower and a deep bath-tub (I took a picture, but it doesn't justify it), not to mention the black and white marble throughout. Our bed was in fact two twin beds pushed together (so many hotels do this, it's always a little disappointing), a little on the hard side, but we still slept well.

Venice isn't very large, and everything is within walking distance, so one could say that there isn't a bad location either. If high end shopping is your thing, then Prada, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Valentino, Hermes, Gucci, etc are litterally right at the doorstep. St Marco's square is 5 minutes away, and the Rialto bridge is less than 10 minutes away.

From what I understand this is about the cheapest you can expect to book a room at the Bauer. I even checked again just before leaving to see if the last minute rate had dropped, but hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, so I think you should expect to pay around this for a room. There is also some confusion which surrounds the Bauer Hotel and the Bauer Piazza Hotel. Both hotels are attached to one and another and appear to be run by the same company, the Bauer Hotel is a five Star hotel with a modern frontage and faces onto a busy street, whereas the Bauer Piazza is a 5 Star Deluxe hotel with a Venetian frontage and faces onto the Grand Canal. If you are planning on staying at the Bauer Piazza there is a separate hotel review page for this specific hotel. This was my first visit to Venice and not knowing what to expect I booked a Hotel that I knew would have good central location (which it certainly has), however this shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t govern any decision you need to make because Venice itself is reasonably compact and any hotel would be within walking distance of the things you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to do. Generally the hotel is what you would expect of a 5 Star hotel, very nice but does have a few niggles that could do with improvement. I will give my personal review of both the Positives and the Negatives, plus a small insight into my impressions of Venice, to assist you with any a decision on the hotel: Positives: The room was very nice with a big bathroom and all the extras one would expect. The Buffet Breakfast which was included in the price was extensive and very nice. Items ranged from Salmon and Champagne to Bacon and Sausages all of which were freely available. During the stay it was my girlfriend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday and without any prompt a complimentary bottle of Champagne appeared in our room. The Staff and Concierge were very polite and helpful. The Concierge arranged a well organised trip to the local glass factory for 60 euros; it included a guided tour of Venice from our water taxi which was excellent. However if you opt to do this watch out for the blood sucking glass tour guide \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are after your money and boy do they go in with the hard sell. Just ignore them because most the glass that is being sold at the factory can be bought cheaper in just about every other shop you will see in Venice. Negative: The hotel drinks and food was grossly overpriced, previous comments have said it is what you would expect to pay in London but I disagree. I have stayed in many hotels in London and never paid what the Bauer was asking for drinks and food. You can expect to pay 10 Euros (\u00c2\u00a37) for a beer or 20 Euros (\u00c2\u00a315) for a ham sandwich. If the Bauer was more sensible they would realise that people paying \u00c2\u00a3150.00 for a room are not very likely to pay the prices they were asking. I am normally quite happy to pay for a food and bar bill at a hotel, even when the prices are well above average, however the Bauer prices were over the top and they lost out in the long run, as instead of spending another \u00c2\u00a3100+ at the hotel on drinks, I instead spent nothing. The room in which I was staying backed onto a side street, not a huge problem in itself until it came to 6.00am in the morning when I was awoken every day by a lot noise and commotion which continued all morning. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite pinpoint what the noise was but I think it was just local Venetians carrying out their daily work tasks. Had my stay been for longer I would have needed to ask for a different room. There is only 1 English Channel on the rooms TV which is CNN News (exciting...not), especially as CNN repeats the same stuff over and over again. It occurred to me that the hotel was mostly geared towards English speaking tourists and I felt 1 rubbish TV channel was a bit on the poor side. A bit petty I know, but it did bug me a bit. Overall the Bauer Experience made the Venetian Experience worthwhile; personally I would not recommend going to Venice as I did not like it. Venice is in poor shape with graffiti absolutely everywhere and scaffolding on every building, this view of Venice was shared by others I spoke to. Shops Restaurants and Bars are all very expensive, and it feels as though everyone who lives or works there is trying to suck that last penny out of you.

Also, the room service was really lacking. My husband ordered an evening snack and we waited and waited for it. Eventually we both fell asleep and awoke to realize that it never even came.

Not that we went to watch TV but the only English language channels were BBC world News, CNN and Sky Cinema. The mini bar had the usual at medium \u00e2\u20ac\u201c high prices. No complimentary bottles of water in the room. No additional blanket or pillows in the room. No bath robes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only towels. I would describe the room as a mix of traditional and boutique. It was not in a Venetian style with palatial antiques and paintings on the wall, however it was not a corporate box. There was a very small balcony \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just for standing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not for sitting on. In our opinion it was excellent value at this price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if I paid any more I would have felt ripped off. The service in the hotel was average. Polite but not going out their way. The concierge gave us misinformation sending us to restaurants that had closed down! and wrong river bus times to the airport (luckily we checked ourselves or we would have missed our flight home). Breakfast was very good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a buffet style with most things you can thing of range of: a range of fruit juices, sparkling wine, cheese, salami, smoked salmon, fresh and tinned fruit, breads and pastries, and hot plates with sausage, bacon etc.. and eggs cooked to order in the kitchen. Jams however were not of the finest quality. Breakfast is served in the De Pisis restaurant (7am - 10:30am) and offers exceptional views over the Grand Canal. This was a big plus point and probably part of the reason they charge so much for the hotel! The breakfast is advertised at 44 euros and if you have it included in your room rate as most do and wish to have it in your room there is an additional cost of 10 euros. The location was excellent in low season \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however when it gets busier you will be in the midst of all the tourist activities. Venice is small and easy to walk around so we felt that hotel location should not be your driving factor when deciding on hotel as we initially thought when booking. When the weather is hot this hotel would not be ideal as there is no garden or pool to retreat to. However, there is a fabulous terrace overlooking the grand canal. In short, at low season prices it represented good value for money, breakfast in a fabulous setting, clean and tasteful rooms. However, there was no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow factor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or real traditional Venetian style in either the lobby or our bedroom. At high season I would not consider this hotel a good option. We have stayed in quite a few other Leading Hotels in Europe and Asia (Bauer is in this marketing group) and we are quite critical people however, we would conclude that this was an average experience compared to other hotels in this group.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "miami", "Title": "\u201cGreat Except 1 Problem....\u201d", "Author": "sammytmiami", "ReviewID": "UR6552790", "Content": "Great Hotel, The Best Location, Great Views, Great Restaurant.

A previous e-mail to us from Keti, the reservations manager, had confirmed a room on a higher floor; Roberto, the manager on duty, showed us to our room #538 (with terrace view of Campo San Moise); concierge Paolo helped us with directions to the Tintorettos at Scuola San Rocco, not to be missed, as well as the evening Easter service at Chiese San Moise; and, after returning home to Kansas City, we received a personal letter acknowledging our \"comment card\" and hoping to welcome us again to their hotel from Francesca Bortolotto Possati, Chairman and President of the hotel.

The location is second to none - literally a minute from St Mark's Square and, despite the rather odd modern appearance of the city side of the hotel, it overlooks a tiny pretty canalside square in Venice where the gondoliers congregate. The piece de resistance is undoubtedly the terrace - it is better than you imagine - even after reading the reviews and looking at the photos! The highlight of my weekend was watching the bustle of the grand canal in the early morning sunshine over breakfast. That in itself makes the Bauer the best choice in Venice.

The hotel staff were excellent - courteous and responsive to any requests. Our room was fine - beautifully decorated with a spacious bathroom. My one wish is that we'd had a view (we overlooked an \"inner courtyard\") but for the price we paid, I couldn't possibly complain. Everywhere in Venice is extremely overpriced - the Bauer is worth the money. I am mystified at the complaints from other reviewers about the decor. It's 1940/50s recreated - lots of beautiful wood and opulence - please note - not original and therefore dated, but a nice mix of original features and modern touches (ie spotlights set into the ceiling of the room along with the glass chandelier that was straight out of a 40s movie). If you want modern clean lines and minimalist rooms then it isn't the place for you - but then again, I suspect Venice isn't either! Just two tips - splurge on a water taxi from the airport (90euros) as the experience is fabulous and a stress free way to approach the city and go to Harry's Bar for a Bellini (don't eat there unless you don't need to look at prices on a menu).", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "So Cal", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Esquire", "ReviewID": "UR5145214", "Content": "Stayed here on our last 2 days in Italy with my sister and 2 teenage boys.

Due to the position of the hotel there are NO rooms with a canal view, (maybe some of the standard rooms above the water taxi landing stage have the side canal view), but the suites are central around a main courtyard with no view at all. That being said our suite was breathtaking, two huge bathrooms with wall to wall marble and robes, an enormous sitting room, a large bedroom with king size bed, dressing room, baggage room, electric window shutters and two lots of air-con. The only negative item in the room was the musemn exhibit that they called the TV, granted we didn'y come to Venice to watch TV but this 14inch example could be bought for about \u00c2\u00a310 in a second hand shop in the UK! We did comment on it to the hotel. ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING TO PACK: a travel iron, yes, believe it or not I was told by the front desk that it was a 'law' in Venice that hotels guests were not allowed them due to 'health & safety' and a fire risk. However, I could arrange for house-keeping to do it for, I believe 8euro per item!! Who cares about a few creases anyway??!! There was no noise at all that we heard from our room. The buffet breakfast situated on the sun terrace of the adjoining Bauer II Palazzo was a fantastic setting with a superb range of food, the bucks-fizz was a great way to kick off the day! IF it's a room with a view that you want then look above you and see that the Palazzo II is the hotel for you, (but be prepared to pay a lot more!). We found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful unlike a few comments that I have read. We wanted a little 'culture' and venture out into the countryside as we had seen most of the tourist parts of Venice so the Concierge arranged through 'International Limousine Service' an english speaking driver and mercedes to take us out for the day (9am - 6pm). It was well worth the 560euro and a day I will not forget. All in all we found this hotel to be very good, (TV excluded!!!), and the decor', staff, food all worthy of a 5* hotel unlike the experience of some other guest's comments made here. Venice is very very VERY expensive and I agree the room service and mini bar prices are a joke - but they are the world over. One restaurant worth a visit is 'LA PISCINA' Dorsoduro 780/782, it's on the water and the food is excellent. If you stay here I'm sure you will enjoy it, we did.", "Date": "October 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe Outstanding Bauer Hotel Venice ItaLy...!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3766996", "Content": "Our first room was so-so so we asked to look at another and it was wonderful..The buffet reakfast that we had during our four day stay was really terrific.

The porters and other staff were excellent. The rooms are dated but quite charming. Bed was very comfortable and room was dark and quiet. Did experience disturbance from neighbours which reception dealt with promptly. Massive bathroom. Well cleaned every day. Good supplies. The hallways are a bit worn and need brightening up, but at the end of the day you don't spend much time in the hallway, do you? The location is fabulous - right near the shops and St Marks and all forms of transport. Several restaurants are close by (check out La Piscina on the Grand Canal - great seafood lasagne).

The Bauer was our introduction to Italy. (we were with a tour group and Venice was our first stop.) When we checked in after a 10 hr. flight, we knew we had come to the right place. When we got to our room, we were pleasantly surprised with a suite, which had views to die for and was huge! Location: PERFECT! When their website says that they are steps away from St. Mark's Square, they're correct. The Basilica and the Doge's Palace are just a skip hop and a jump away. Some rooms have a view of the Grand Canal as well, and there is a Gondala area right next door. Food: The hotel has two bars and one restaurant. The breakfast, which I believe is included, is perfect, with a mix of a good American breakfast (eggs, sausage, etc.), and a very European breakfast (meat, cheese, fruit). I only ate dinner at the restaurant once, but it was wonderful (not to mention expensive). It you sit outside, you'll get a breathtaking view of the Grand Canal and the Adriatic Sea. Overall: The staff at this hotel are pleasant and always have a smile on. Almost all speak English, and I had no problem with not knowing any Italian. This hotel continues to keep up their reputation of being chic, yet child friendly, and which makes this a perfect place to stay for anyone! Venice is such a beautiful city. It's calm and exciting at the same time. No cars, but water taxis! The Venetians are really friendly as well.

The staff are all efficient and pleasant, particularly Paulo, Head Concierge, who can be relied upon to give informed and helpful suggestions for visits, and can rustle up anything you want with one flick of his fingers! Although this hotel is apparently frequented by such luminaries as Sting and John Grisham, we were treated at all times like VIPs. From our balcony on the 5th floor we had a view of the Grand Canal and Santa Maria del Salute which was difficult to leave. The room itself was beautifully decorated with silks and antiques, and room service was wonderful with meticulous attention to detail - there were fresh towels in the gorgeous marble bathroom every time you turned around! The rooftop terrace is perfect for breakfast (or a Bellini!) the food in the restaurant is interesting, rich but not heavy, and the terrace alongside the Grand Canal is the perfect place to relax after photographing all 470 of Venice's bridges!

I can't rave enough about how fantastic the location of this hotel is. St. Mark's square is literally a hop, skip, and a jump away. Great shopping is right out the door. Harry's bar is just around the corner and right next to a vaporetto stop. The gondoliers at one of the major gondola stops could double as hotel doormen because they are so close. And, the hotel sits along a wonderfully quaint side canal in addition to fronting the busy and dramatic Grand Canal. But, then there's the not-so-good. The hotel is way too stuck on itself and for no real reason. Yes, there's marble. Yes, there are fine woods. And, yes, gilded items abound. But, it's just not THAT nice to have the attitude that emanates from the front desk and the interior of the rooms. In fact, the niceties of the lobby are quickly lost when you venture down the dull, gray-carpeted hallways of the room floors. The bed was the single hardest thing I've ever slept on. And, the pillows were like nice concrete blocks to boot. Our room was large and did shimmer, but the ambience was more cold and stuffy than warm or luxurious. The bathroom did have a generous amount of marble, but the jetted tub didn't work. And, the soap--while it smelled nice--was in the ridiculous shape of a tiny half-sphere that you could never properly grip. Our room did have a nice view of the St. Mark's campanile--which was better than looking at the other antique view coming from the room's obsolete television. The food and mini bar prices are humorous--and I mean humorous: Try 50 bucks per person for continental breakfast--which is obscene in my book even according to the \"resort\" prices I'm often willing to pay. In the end, we paid 170 euros with tax for our room and thought that we paid too much (even though it was the cheapest hotel we stayed at in Italy). I can understand why others who paid 3-4 times that amount were flabbergasted. Finally, I must say that we stayed at the Bauer over Christmas. I'm sure the Il Palazzo is a little better, but I'm sure with a little more attitude as well. Bottom line: you'll be okay here and you'll never forget the location.
