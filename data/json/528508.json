Getting to and from the hotel to the airport was painless. Got off the bus at the IBM stop, as directed on the hotels website. However, from there, no real indication of where to go. However, my awesome sense of direction, and guesswork, got us there. :D Nothing really in the area, just offices. Check in was grand, no problems. Room was nice, a touch smaller than I was expecting, but no issues. Breakfast was nice, the little pancake things were great! While we were there, they were redoing their lobby art thing, so the art side of things wasn't represented well. Snack type things were pricey, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3 for a 500ml Coke. On departure, we wanted to kill some time before we got our flight to the airport, but they don't really have anywhere you can just lounge. Bar/breakfast area is tables and chairs, there are some couch type things between the lobby and the bar area, so we sat there. Not comfortable, but adequate. It was easy getting in and out of the city, tram was only 15 minutes away, but after that, it was a 25 minute ride into town on the number 2. Not a hassle, but just far enough to take a chunk of of your day. We went into the city in the morning, and were there for the day. All staff I met were pleasant, and fluent in English. If I was on business, it would have been grand, but as a city explorer base, just that smidge too far for me.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brighton", "Title": "\u201ca hotel to be recommended absolutely 100%!\u201d", "Author": "miaBrighton v", "ReviewID": "UR127753993", "Content": "a sleek looking hotel, very very comfortable, excellent breakfast, excellent service - best bit - the lovely, friendly extremely helpful staff. the hotel is not right in the city centre but this was a bonus - it was a 10 min taxi journey to the airport and 7 min walk to the tram stop - tram passes sold from reception at the hotel and the tram journey in to the centre is so easy - on the number 2 line which takes about 20minutes to the van gogh museum and vondel park a thoroughly enjoyable stay", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - outside the city.\u201d", "Author": "Telfish1969", "ReviewID": "UR127716420", "Content": "My wife and I stayed in this hotle March 2012 for 3 nights.

It is situated in what appears to be a business district near PWC and IBM. It was about 30 euro from the airport. From chairs made of nails and tennis balls, the reception has it all. The staff were very friendly at check in and offered all the relevant advice regards our stay and the faciities. Round to the left of reception is a small lounge and bar area plus a restaurant. The breakfast is 19.50 euro and offers a cold/hot buffet. Nothing to complain about but the price could probably be more realistic at 15.00 euro. Evening meals offer a little more than you would think and the 3 pepper soup with Paprika was delicious. Followed by the Puy Lentil curry,again tasty and wholesome. The service was very good despite the restaurant being busy. For 4 of us, starters/mains plus a bottle of wine was 162 euro - Not cheap but by hotel standards, not too unrealistic either. Room service is also available if you don't fancy leaving the comforts of the bedroom. The beds are like the rest of the hotel. Trendy and functional. Chairs, desk and flat screen allow you to work or relax. The TV offers a selection of movies/music and internet( all chargeable). There is also a direct dial phone if you need it but I would suggest using your mobile, probably still cheaper!! Tea/Coffee and a mini bar( the mini bar is chargeable)round off the room. Shower and bath pair up with the toilet and too keep you cosy they have underfloor heating:) Wifi is free throughout the hotel( so why use the internet on the TV??) but can be slow if everyone is online. This hotel is good for a business traveller but not so good for those people wishing to visit Amsterdam to sight see. It will cost you about 25 euro to get into town each way and there didn't appear to bea tram in sight. Bear that in mind.

Hotel rooms have been suffering a lot from wear and tear, broken things that do not get fixed, TV problems, problems with water running of in bath tubs and sinks and such. The management should really keep an eye on that and everything would be much better. I stopped using the hotel for these reasons, but also because the beds really provide poor sleeping quality...the pillows can hardly be called pillows, and you can hardly speak of a mattress.

It's well-connected for public transport into the centre of Amsterdam, and is also easily accessible directly from the airport. Tram line 2 takes approx. 30 minutes to get to the city centre from the nearest tram stop (Louwesweg). There's an easy pedestrian route from the tram stop which isn't plain from online maps; it would be useful if the hotel had this on their website. It's in a business park, so most of the weekday custom is business travellers and seminars.

The staff were efficient but initially a little brusque. When we got to the room, we discovered that the smoking room we'd requested was not given. We phoned reception and were told very sharply that it was a booking request, not guaranteed (which, if true, was not made clear anywhere when we booked). The receptionist went on to tell us we'd be fined if we smoked in the non-smoking room - no apologies or explanations were given. We were not pleased with their attitude. We went downstairs to deal with the matter in person and the desk staff were much more helpful, apologising and offering to give us a room exchange when one became available, which would be the next morning. The next day, we packed and were given cards for a new room which, when we tried to access, turned out to be already occupied!

The hotel is VERY nice -- the design is contemporary, high-style Dutch interior design -- the staff was friendly and my guest room was well appointed, Like others have said, the hotel is on the outskirts of Amsterdam. To get into the heart of the city requires a 10-minute walk to the #2 tram stop, then a 30-minute ride to Leideseplein (the main tourist entertainment area). The trams are clean, safe, cheap and reliable. So while it's not an ideal location for a pure tourist, it's not an unbearable journey for those visiting on business -- and that's a good thing, because there is NOTHING -- absolutely NOTHING \u00e2\u20ac\u201d close to the hotel ... no shops, restaurants, coffeeshops, cafes ... NOTHING. So, if you want to have dinner, have a drink or catch a buzz (you ARE in Amsterdam after all) you will have to travel. It's true that the hotel has a restaurant -- but the food is rather mediocre and EXHORBITANTLY expensive. A hamburger and potato chips were 21 Euro and breakfast was 19.50 Euro. At the current exchange rate, that's just under $30 for breakfast or a burger. Truly ABSURD -- but you're captive and they know it! A few rather odd things about the hotel: 1) There is no clock in the room. Yes, the telephone display shows the time and so does the TV if you turn it on, but lying in bed there's no way to know what time it is. 2) If you want a wake up call, you can set your tv to come on at the appointed time BUT it just turns on and shows a screen that says it's time to get up -- but there's NO SOUND element, so how it's supposed to wake you up is baffling. Call the front desk and they will wake you up. 3) There's an ice machine on each floor BUT there's no ice bucket in your room, so you have to take your little water glass to the ice machine every time you need a few more cubes. A few rather nice things about the hotel: 1) The bathroom floor is heated -- unexpected to say the least. 2) Free internet that was fast and had great signal strength. 3) A beautiful terrace overlooking a reflecting pool filled with lily pads right next to a canal. 4) A lovely, serene park less than a 5 minutes walk from the hotel.

Cross the road and walk a few meters to the right take the road left between the Atradius and a second IBM building. At the first junction you will see the hotel on the right. It is a very short walk. The hotel website makes it clear that it is out of town between Schiphol and the city centre - so I do not understand why some people have complained about that. It is in a very pleasant business area. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind a 20 minute walk you can reach several places to eat and find two large supermarkets.

Remember to swipe our chip-card in and out. We found that the number 2 tram was the best bet to get into the city - even though it takes about 10 minutes to get to the stop (Louwesweg) because it runs very frequently and goes all the way to Centraal Station. You can also use all of the trams in the City. The nearest bus stop is for the 145 bus - just at the rear of the hotel but it served by the rival company Connexxion and it does not accept the GVB card.

Once we booked the hotel in January this year we read a few reviews that did not show the Artemis in a good light, this was a bit disconcerting as we didn't know what to expect, we read many reviews, and the main qualm that people had was that it was so far from the centre of Amsterdam and the transport links were poor. Although the hotel is outside the centre of Amsterdam in the business district i dispute the comments made about the transport links, Amsterdam has one of the bus, tram and train services i have ever experienced, it was a few minutes walk from the hotel to the nearest tram station, Louwesweg, and then 10 minutes on the tram number 2 to the main entertainment are Leidseplien and a further 5 minutes to Centraal station. The airport was also close to he the hotel and it cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 to get to the hotel which was cheaper than the hotel shuttle between to two of us, alternatively there is a bus you can catch which is the 195, we took the bus back to the airport on our last day as we had purchased a 72 hour OV-Chipkaart from the hotel for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15.50 which allowed for us to have unlimited travel over that 72 hours which was great for the tram and bus links to the main entertainment areas in Amsterdam. The hotel was warm and welcoming with very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable staff who spoke pretty much fluent English. We didn't try the hotel restaurant but we heard that the food was absolutely fantastic which i can believe due to the quality of the hotel. The Artemis was well furnished and we had everything that we needed for out trip. All of the rooms at the hotel are well furnished well and extremely comfy, and all include a guide to the room, hotel and Amsterdam. Problems with the hotel: During our stay we only had one problem, which was that the minibar in the room is automated, which i did not realise so as soon as anything is taken out it adds it to the bill, i say this was a problem but as we did not consume anything we picked up we did not get charged we just had to explain to reception and they removed it from the bill. (it says that the minibar is automated on the actual fridge, i just didn't read that) Overall i would most defiantly recommend The Dutch Design Artemis Hotel, in fact we are already talking about going back over to Amsterdam for new year (2 days after our return) and will defiantly be staying in this hotel.

We had intended using the service bus which we knew costs about Euro 2.50 but after waiting for half an hour in sub zero temperatures we were informed that the bus was delayed by another half hour. We decided to opt for a taxi but the driver was apparantly not interested and directed us to the Shuttle Bus Service. This service is independent of any of the hotels and charges a flat Euro 15.50 rate so I landed up paying Euro 31 for a five minute ride. Many of the hotels in the area have combined to provide a free bus shuttle so I would suggest Artimis follow suit.

We went on a city break to Amsterdam last year - which is an amazing city! My friends decided to book a cheap hotel and we found this one to be as cheap as they got for hotels. It turned out to be a huge mistake to book this hotel. We landed in Schippol airport in Amsterdam and got a cab to the hotel (which was advertised as being close to the airport). The Taxi fare was an absolute fortune for a 20 minute drive but luckily we could manage as we split it 5 ways. The hotel itself is located MILES outside of Amsterdam City center. It is located near many industries and commercial center's such as IBM and the hotel is geared towards business people. Inside, the hotel has large modern artistic displays everywhere and I found it cool and funky to look at. The rooms had a fairly basic television in them with a basic bath tub and shower combo. The beds were pretty comfortable and overall I was happy with the room. Now for the bad parts: Firstly, we were told that there was a residents bar in the hotel. Or \"24 hour bar\" as it was advertised on its website - this was false and the bar was NEVER open in the four days we spent there. Then there was the staff - VERY RUDE.Although we were initially greeted by a nice receptionist our general opinion of the staff was not at all good. I recall one waiter barking at me for taking a glass of orange juice from the breakfast buffet table as \"breakfast stopped five minutes ago\" and I was then told to \"get lost\" - as if I committed a personal offense against this man. Other staff members were rude to my friends also and we all seemed to have a bad story about the staff members. The worst, absolute worst thing about this hotel has to be the distance it is from Amsterdam center.. To get to Amsterdam center you can A) get a very expensive taxi or B) get the bus/tram (I recommend getting the bus as its much faster). You will find yourself having to walk along a deserted street for ten minutes to get to the bus/tram stop. Then your waiting another ten minutes for one to show up and then you might be stuck on the bus/tram for 25 minutes while you are dragged all over the city before you get to central Amsterdam. This for the four days I spent cost a lot of money. Overall: Dont come here. Im a pretty easy person to please but I just did not like this place. Rude staff, no bar, much too far away from the city center. wasting money on cabs and transport etc..", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aachen", "Title": "\u201cnice trendy hotel outside of Amerdam\u201d", "Author": "meisterQB", "ReviewID": "UR93593932", "Content": "the dutch design hotel is a nice location to stay at.

Well my partner and I spent a weekend as part of our anniversary. We were put up in a twin room because they had no doubles left, even though a request was made 3 months ago when I booked the room. So it was two single beds we had to push together ourselves. The room itself is very nice. The view, not so nice. The bathroom is beautiful, spacious, clean with a lovely shower and all the usual ammenities. The room has a safe & free wifi, TV with a range of European Channels, Coffee & Tea with a kettle, and an Iron. The big let down on the room is the beds... They are not very good at all. Very old mattresses make for an awkward sleep, they dip in the middle from the years of other sleepers. The pillows are as flat as pancakes. The hotel is very expensive to eat at too. E19 euro for BREAKFAST?! ... I suggest taking the nearby tram 2 stops west (away from the city) there are two decent supermarkets and a few places to get food. Travel to the city is about 40-odd minutes by the tram. The tram is a 5min walk away if you cut through the back streets. There is a bus that stops right near the hotel straight to the airport, and on a Sunday-took us 15/20minutes. Service, was... average, nothing spectacular. The hotel inside is nice, its kept well, its kept clean. If you're a couple wanting a romantic break, its probably not for you. If you're on a budget, and 19 euros for breakfast is out of your reach, its also probably not for you; if you want a comfortable bed, its not for you; but if your company is paying and you couldn't care less about the sleep quality-I well recommend it!!", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weiterstadt", "Title": "\u201cvery comfortable\u201d", "Author": "TommyTwoShoes", "ReviewID": "UR87984659", "Content": "Very conveniently located for business purposes.

We used a car to get itto the downtown and met no problems at all, but as I understand - metro station is quite far from the hotel and it is not nice enough to walk. 4. This item is number four, but I have had to make it first. Extremely BAD and TERRIBLE staff. 4.1 They were very rude when we came. They are very slow and there were a lot of people standing at the reception and I took my time to see how Artemis staff is doing their job. I saw a lot of European hotels but I NEVER met such an attitude even in Etap hotel.

When we returned after 14 hours - the kettle was dirty!! Could you imagine that for 4* european hotel?! Me not. 4.3. The room is dirty, floor is very (!) dirty. Bathroom is dirty too. 4.4.

The hotel is minimalist in decor but very spacious, clean and refreshingly arty. In the main areas of the hotel, contemporary art and sculptures sit alongside bespoke pieces of modern furniture to give the place a unique atmosphere. The staff were all helpful and polite without being over the top. Our room was on the small side but nicely finished. As ever with hotels, a hi-fi wouldn't have gone amiss, but all other facilities were present and correct, including (very expensive) minibar - e.g. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 for a small Toblerone. The total absence of complimentary biscuits was a little disappointing however, especially after a night taking full advantage of some of the city's more liberal policies. If you have some time to kill at the hotel, there's a peaceful, Ibiza-esque riverside terrace which is worth visiting if you want to chill out with a drink or two. Getting to the hotel by public transport from the airport is a struggle - figuring out the myriad bus stops at Schiphol is a task for the brave. Best to jump in a taxi if there's more than one of you - the blue, official looking shuttle bus is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 per person, so with two persons plus a taxi will work out cheaper. The Artemis is good value and has bags of character. Although it's a good 4-5 miles from the centre of Amsterdam (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac20-25 in a cab), you can get to the action easily by tram or bus during the day. It's in a business district so very quiet at night, but be warned - it's miles from any shops so make sure you load up on essentials at Albert Heijn on your way back from town.

When we requested for the shuttle to bring us to the airport, the reception supervisor suggested we take the taxi instead as it was cheaper (14.50EUR per person for shuttle vs 25EUR flat for taxi) . Also, the shuttle may not always come particularly in bad weather (think: snow). Alternatively, if one doesn't have a lot of luggage, one can just take the bus 195 for 1.50EUR.

Things got off to a bad start when instead of getting a \"double\" room I was checked into a room with just a sofa bed/couch. I was very disappointed that a four star hotel could not even provide a \"real bed\". The room was nice and clean and perfectly decent, all apart from the lack of a real bed. I felt like because I got a deal on line and was a solo traveler I was being shoved into a small annex room of a suite, like the children's room or something, especially as the room had an adjoining door to another room and had no bed!. I asked to be moved to a different room shortly after i had checked in. I had to spend the first night in this sofa bed room. The hotel did not seem particularly full so i'm sure they could have found another room. I managed to get moved into a double room for the remaining nights. I was told to leave my luggage in the first room and that it would be moved to my new room and I could pick up the keys. When I came back to the hotel to get my new room key the agent knew nothing of my request to move rooms and my luggage had not been moved anywhere and was still sat in the first room. I had to go back to my old room and move my bags myself to the new room. Having worked at a hotel front desk myself I can understand the communication breakdown at the desk, but I would expect to at least be offered help with my bags and it was just a little bit of hassle that could have been avoided. The staff were reasonably friendly and helpful and answered queries about transport to and from the hotel. They dealt with the issue of my room quickly and efficiently apart from the passing of information from one agent on the am shift to the agent on the pm shift. The double room i was moved to for the rest of my stay was good, nice and clean apart from a stain on the duvet. The breakfast was average for the fairly expensive price, a reasonable selection of food but still a bit of a let down for the price tag. Transport from the hotel to the city and airport was straight forward and cheap and the location was nice and quiet. The bicycle hire was good value and easy to arrange too. For the price I paid my stay was adequate, just spoiled by the lack of a proper bed upon check in. I expected slightly better service and a better quality breakfast at a \"designer\" four star hotel of this price/standard. I would recommend this hotel only if you get a good deal, as you can probably get a similar standard of hotel at a similar price nearer the city. The hotel is nice inside and the designer aspect of it and furniture is different and interesting as is the art work in the hotel but at the end of the day good service a good nights sleep and good food are what you want when you stay at a hotel.

There isn't too much else to say about this place except for the fact that their breakfast is extremely expensive (around 15 euros pp) for this kind of a hotel while their parking garage seems to be a bargain compared to the prices that you usually pay in Amsterdam: To make it short: Good hotel without any charme, though.

I'm not sure what the expectation is but if your expectation is to be in a business hotel 40-60 minutes outside of the city this fits the bill. The rooms are in line with a business class European hotel; small by American standards but with the expected amenities. The free wi fi is a definate plus not expected in Europe. The strongest point in favor of this hotel is the breakfast. Our room included the breakfast and was paid for by the company. Normally, I believe breakfast is quite pricey so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking staying here, and of course you care about breakfast, try to negotiate breakfast into the room price. Hotel breakfast includes unlimited espressos and cappuccinos, croissants, fruit, pancakes, smoked salmon, local meat and cheese, eggs, bacon, juice, etc. A very nice spread and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve eaten at a lot of hotel buffets. There is nothing close by for eating establishments so plan to eat dinner in Amsterdam. No comment on the hotel for dinner as I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat there. The hotel has a small fitness center, tread mill, bike some minor amounts of weights. Not much. Everything from this hotel is a drive or a tram ride. I read amount service comments. There are some bad apples here, basically some youthful slackers but I felt they were contained and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impact me. On check in my wife commented that the clerk was a bit curt. However they let us check in at 8 in the morning and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge us a second day which was also unexpected. This is big deal as we were both exhausted from the flight. We hit the bed at 8 AM ish and slept until 4 PM without any disturbance. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming from the US, check this out. The WSJ did a piece a few years ago about London hotels that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let people check in until 3PM. So I think a very nice feature. The worst thing about this hotel is its location. A five to ten minute walk gets you to the tram station. From there you wait. There is a schedule but essentially a tram comes every 10 minutes or so. Thus, the wait isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad. The tram ride is 30 minutes to a major tourist area. It runs right through central Amsterdam so you can get to most everything with a straight shot of a tram ride. The museum district, the dam, and the main train station are on the route. The hotel staff are not very helpful in terms of traditional concierge service. Essentially you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a very marginal amount of assistance compared to a concierge at a Four Seasons or Ritz. They try marginally to help and are polite but not very knowledgeable. So all considered, I would rate this as a three star hotel. The service is not great but not horrible. The rooms are reasonably clean. Proper amenities are applied for the style of hotel expected. The restaurant appears to be well stocked and in line with a higher caliper facility. Workout facilities are basic and there is no outside gym option. Attractions are too far away and add a hassle that, if you pay $300 plus a night, you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to deal with. In my mind, this is a hotel for people stuck on a layover from the airport who are going to stay one night and clear out. From that perspective, it is aces. The other group here would be tour groups on group rates. Tours can tout the \"5 star\" hotel BS and one could argue it loosely fits the tour guide description. From a critical view, this is puely a thee star location. From any other view point, I have to think anyone who recommends this hotel just hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t traveled enough or experienced enough of the other options available given the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price point. There are far better options inside the city with easy access to the sights you came to see at better price points, so why bother with this place?", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "surrey", "Title": "\u201cabsolutely beautiful\u201d", "Author": "higgins31", "ReviewID": "UR20699703", "Content": "we stayed at this hotel ,my hubby and i ,and i must say ,it was the most beautiful ,welcoming clean comfrtable hotel,i ever stayed in,.

Its located somewhat between Amsterdam city center and the airport. Its in the same building complex with IBM and other corporations. The hotel itself is very interesting. The front desk staff is not the nicest. Not quite rude, but somewhat arrogant. Once we got to our room, i have to say it was nice. The only room left was a smoking room on the 8th floor costing 138 euro. Very Very expensive, but somewhat average amongst the other amsterdam hotels. The room was nice with a double bed and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was also very nice with standard ammenities. The room comes equiped with a mini-bar, and pay-per-view movies (12 euro each). Overall, not a bad hotel. The distance from city center is significant but honestly it is still very accessable by Tram or night bus requiring just a short walk.

Two years ago give or take a couple of months. We where impressed enough to return to the Artemis by the modern spacious design, the adequate fresh clean rooms and the excellent buffet style *FULL* cooked breakfast included in the price. On this first stay we had found one member of reception staff (who checked us in) to be quite unwelcoming almost to the point of being rudely abrupt. However, we never thought much of this and the rest of the stay was perfect. We stayed again this year (from the 1st Jan 08 in fact!). Whilst some aspects of the hotel where the same, the general appearance and well maintained quality feel of the room and the rest of hotel remained, other aspects had without a shadow of doubt, got worse. When we arrived at the hotel at around 9am, we intended to get a couple of hours sleep to top up the few hours we had managed to get before our early flight. We where told that the check in time (earliest) was 2pm. We looked, and this was indeed stated in small print on the reservation form. Whilst of course it was not the receptionists fault at all, and we where fine with coming back to check after 2pm, it was the way she dealt with us which concerned us. She was very unsympathetic and inhospitable towards us. We ourselves had to suggest simple things like leaving our luggage in the hotel until check in, and filling out our forms and necessary details in advance so she could have our room ready as quickly as possible when we returned after 2pm (we still intended to catch those couple of hours sleep before seeing some Amsterdam nightlife). When we returned at *5pm* to check in things got worse. We stood at the reception desk for *TEN MINUTES* looking at the*TWO* receptionists behind the desk and trying to make them engage with us or at least say that they would be with us in a minute or anything just to acknowledge that we where standing there waiting. They *BOTH* continued however to deal with a rich European woman who was also it seemed still waiting to check in. When we finally got seen to by the frosty female receptionist, we explained that we had already given our details and signed check in forms that morning. She left us waiting for a further 5 minutes before the guy asked us all the same questions. It turned out the girl earlier had messed up and had left the form lying around or something. When they eventually found the it, the guy said (after trying to charge us a further 100 euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for a deposit we had already paid) that we would have to wait to check in as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the system was down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He gave us 2 free drinks (one each lol) at the bar whilst (he said) he would fix the problem as soon as he could. Another 20 minutes past. We had long finished out tiny Artemis cocktails (he specified which drinks we could have!), so I suggested to him we WOULD be having another complimentary drink which he agreed to. When we eventually checked in the room was clean and fresh as was the bathroom to the credit of the cleaning staff. The other problem id' like to mention will no doubt seem very petty to some of you but let me explain. Remember, we had stayed here before and the things we liked about the hotel where why we returned for a second stay. The breakfast before had included hash browns, tomatoes, and a selection of eggs (not just scrambled). Worse still we where told at check in that the breakfast service would finish at 11am. We went down at about 10:15am to find that breakfast was (for a reason which nobody bothered to explain to us) finishing at 10:30am instead of 11am. Again the staff where very defensive about this and again not apologetic in the slightest! They where taking away trays of food whilst people where coming down to eat!!! The earlier time was the same for the whole stay. From reading other reviews it would seem that the rudeness of the staff at the Artemis is a problem for lots of people. A smile and polite hospitable attitude are expected from hotel staff the world over. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allot to ask for. (*pleas read*) What we are most upset about is that we missed pretty much a day of our stay in Amsterdam because when we finally checked at 6pm, we fell asleep and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wake until the next morning as we where so tired.

The guy there seemed to be irritated that we couldnt name the exact spot that was to be cleaned but asked for a second \"run through\" by the houeskeeping through the bathroom. He promised to care anyway. When we got back in the night the bath was no cleaner than in the afternoon. The Parking is - comparing to the distance to Shiphol and City centre - much too expensive (15 \u00e2\u201a\u00ac the day). Too sum it up: A nice surface but with imcompetence beneath.

It was really a nice price for the hotels in Amsterdam but you have to \"pay\" for it being in an industrial suburb of the city. I mean industrial because it is a kind of park full of companies such as IBM and more, but it is really close to another neighbourhood were people live apart from the city chaos. The hotel is very very new, with an styilish design and very modern. It took as a little ride in the bus from the airport which lead us to the door of the hotel. It is out of the city noise but indeed out of the centre of Amsterdam but it was nothing problematic due to the fantastic tram service which is 5 minutes walk from the hotel. It took us around 20 minutes to get to the center but we used to spend all day out of the room so it was perfect for us. We were on a weekend and the monday and tuesday after and there were no noise from the outside during week days. The room was huge and we had a nice flat tv and a nice bathroom as well. Everything was perfectly clean and the bed was very comfortable and wide.

It is in a business park and surrounded by constructions. To me it was ok and it was not noisy. However, admittedly, I stayed there only in the evening just for sleep. I slept well. The hotel itself looked good. I did not use any other services or facilities except wireless internet, nor any meal there. The refrigerator contained pay drinks only and was not for guest use. Depending on your purpose, the location might be a problem, but a minor problem IMO. It is half way from the airport to downtown. It takes about 20 mins to the central station by tram #2, of which the stop is around 5-10 mins on foot from the hotel. It is reasonably acceptable if you're used to live in a city bigger than Amsterdam, especially considering that it's more cheaper than hotels of the same class in downtown. Bus #195 takes you to the airport from the hotel in about 10-20 mins. I took the bus to the airport and then took the train from there to The Hague and Delft. If you carefully plan your connections, you will be in The Hague in about an hour, cheaper and probably faster than starting off from a downtown hotel.
