However, after checking in and taking a tour of the property we were very satisfied with the resort. We had two adjoining rooms and they were wonderful. The mattresses are great, the rooms were kept clean and the two pools and hot tub were wonderful for our family. They may not have a lakeside advantage but the property is very well kept up. There was even a wedding while we were there.The continential breakfast (cereal and mini donuts, milk and juice)tied us over until we could eat breakfast in Branson. Having mini fridges in our rooms was also helpful. We plan to stay again next year although the property will only be open for reservations from May thru August. Our recommendation book early for the condos. A wonderful family-friendly resort.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas", "Title": "\u201cNever Again\u201d", "Author": "legalbreeze", "ReviewID": "UR17844144", "Content": "We just pulled in from a get away to Branson where we stayed at Bradford on the Lake. We chose this hotel because we have stayed at its sister property, Bradford B&B which is wonderful. we booked a king, lakeside rm, rm 114. Upon arrival, we discovered the only view is a very small glimpse of the lake if you look through several other properties and trees. We could live with that because while older, the property is actually really neat. Due to my husband getting ill, we were in bed and sound asleep by 10pm. Around 11pm., we heard knocking at the door and before we could answer it, someone was using a key to enter our room. I started screaming, and my husband ran full speed into the door with his shoulder, slamming it. We called the front desk prior to calling 911 and learned that they were trying to check in another family into our rm. I was so upset being woken from a solid sleep I couldnt get back to sleep all night. I really thought someone was breaking in. Then, to top it off, the room was to include breakfast from 7:30-9am. Well, there was no breakfast and the entire office building was locked up, lights off, no one there. We had given up and just wanted to check out, but couldnt because no one there. Finally, I called the sister property who called a manager who came over and checked us out. No breakfast and no offer to make any of this right. We are done with this family of properties which is too bad because the B and B was a really classy act. I am sure the manager will respond to this post, and let me just say regardless of what he writes, he was face to face with me this morning and didnt do a single thing to make this right, didnt even acknowledge that someone coming into our rm wasnt ok. He tried to say we were a walk in and it was somehow our fault, and NO we werent, we had reservations for some time. Then it was just that well the manager has to check the rm before renting it. HOW ABOUT KEEPING TRACK OF WHO YOU RENT ROOMS TO? And if you arent sure, for goodness sake CALL BEFORE ENTERING A ROOM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND GIVING PEOPLE A HEART ATTACK!", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "arow97", "Title": "\u201cGreat value!\u201d", "Author": "arow97", "ReviewID": "UR15436531", "Content": "I, frankly, chose this hotel for the price. It was the least expensive lodging listed on www.reservebranson.com (my favorite website for booking anything in Branson!). After reading reviews, I was a little worried, but not enough to go for something more expensive. I'm glad I wasn't scared away! I thought it to be a great value for the price. The room was clean and I loved the homey furniture. It didn't feel like I was staying in another cookie-cutter hotel. The room had it's own character. I loved that! My husband thought the room was a bit small, but he has little hotel experience, and I didn't see anything wrong with the size. It was about what I would expect. The one problem we did have was that our door was a french door with blinds, and no curtains. At night, parking lot lights and any passing headlights were pretty bright. And when the sun rose in the morning, it shined bright and early into our room. I had an eye mask for just such an occasion, but my husband did not and he was not very happy about it. As far as the location, we thought it was perfect as the sole purpose of our trip was to visit Silver Dollar City and this hotel was the perfect location, as the park gets a lot of traffic from Branson on 76, we were able to avoid all the traffic and slide right in.

It is convenient to Silver Dollar City, just down the road, less than 5 minutes. The beds were very comfy, had 4 regular pillows and 1 small pillow on each bed. The bed had 2 sheets sandwiched with a blanket between and a bedspread on it. The room had the look of your bedroom at home. Silk flowers on the round bedside table, pretty curtains, plus a valance on the wall between the sink area of the bathroom and the bedroom. Our room was always cleaned and re-stocked during our 4 day stay. What we did not like, no elevator, so ask for a 1st floor room if needed. The curtains do not close, there are mini-blinds, but we like it real dark at night, so I had to resort to using clothes pins to pull the curtains closed. The room had a musty smell, which I wish I had some Fabreze to use in it, I think that would of helped, maybe an air-conditioning problem, I don;t know. We never heard anyone during our stay, so it must be pretty sound-proof. It is maybe a 15-20 minute drive into Branson for shows or food, there are very few places to eat in West Branson.", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat Room, Great Price\u201d", "Author": "inveni0", "ReviewID": "UR8538481", "Content": "My wife and I had the privilege to book a unit in the Chalet while they were still available.

The King size bed was incredibly comfortable, and the big screen T.V. in the living room was great to watch while snuggled up on one of the two overstuffed sofas. The Bradford on the Lake also had two outdoor pools available. We used the pool on the back patio of the property. The water was great, and the patio overlooked Table Rock Lake. You could watch the sunset from the hot tub every evening. Beautiful!
