Everyone is very friendly and when we stayed here the log fire in the lounge was almost always burning, which worked wonders (it was flipping cold outside). The rooms are looked after very efficiently and so, all in all, this hotel is good value for money. In a city like Paris, this is worth a mention. Such a shame, then, that the walls were so thin that whatever goes on on your floor can be heard at any time of day.

We were very happy with our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel. We choose it for the location, and because they offered a good rate for our time of year on their website. We stayed in room 41 on the side of the courtyard and I loved the view of the Paris rooftops. It was very quiet, only three other rooms on our floor and the hotel accommodated our request to have our family member stay in the room next to ours. The staff was so friendly and helpful. We had breakfast three mornings at the hotel which costs 13 euro per person. You can get complimentary coffee in the lobby/bar area and an option to purchase an assortment of 3 pastries for 3 Euro if you want to save money. There are a other breakfast options just outside the hotel, one is just to the right as you walk out that made delicious crepes. The location is very close to several Metro stops. We purchased 10 tickets for each of us and it was the perfect amount for our 6 night stay. You only need one metro ticket and can make as many transfers as needed, but hold on to your ticket as you may need it to exit some of the metro stations after a transfer (only ran into this on two occasions). My husband downloaded several apps on his phone for Paris metro maps, along with the TripAdvisor Paris city guide\u2026very helpful. Our phone was not able to make calls, but we could use it for WIFI which was provided for free at the hotel upon check-in. The rooms are small, but not so small that they are unbearable. They are in the process of remodeling some rooms, ours was the older version which I loved and my mom had a newer modern version. Plenty of toiletries were provided along with a room hair dryer. There was also a mini-fridge that\u2019s part of the minibar that we could put food in and drinks. The only negative was the weekend staff whom would not let us drink our cocktails that we brought down from our room. Because they have a bar in the lobby they apparently do not allow this. Kind of a disappointment since the hotel attendant was someone we had not seen the whole week and the others had been very friendly and accommodating with us. Guess those are the rules though.

Our priorities were to be in a safe neighborhood, near good walking streets, and excellent service - since we had such limited time, don't know the city, and aren't good French speakers. Based on other reviews, we chose Hotel Le Clos Medicis. Well. The location is great, it's true. St. Germain des Pres is a lovely neighborhood. The hotel is a block from Jardin Luxembourg park, formerly palace grounds - gorgeous, and a special bonus for kids because they can sail toy boats in one of the pools, see a puppet show, etc. There's a nice cafe on the corner (Luxembourg Cafe) to use as a homebase. The hotel was tiny but clean, with a chic little lounge and lobby. The idea that the little bar is open all the time is a bit sketch - you're dependent on whomever staffs the reception desk to come over and serve you (do all front desk staff train in mixing drinks?). We did not breakfast there, so I can't comment on that. The room itself (\"Deluxe\" category) was smaller than I'd expected from web photos; maybe we got a particularly small one or the photos are a bit misleading, but it was acceptable by wacky Paris standards. Very nice bathroom with good shower-bath. Air conditioner worked quietly and effectively. Beds were comfortable with nice linens. Here's where the experience really fell flat for us: Hotel Le Clos Medicis did not at all deliver in the service department, mostly due to one woman who unfortunately manned the desk for most of our stay. She was so inexplicably rude and haughty, it was almost laughable - the living, breathing negative Parisian stereotype. We absolutely did not come in as demanding Americans, overly familiar and barking at everyone in English - quite the opposite. I did my best with halting French, we were sensitive to the French predilection for more formal manners, expressed gratitude, etc. But she was so unpleasant from the get-go that we loathed having to approach the desk for information or recommendations - precisely what we'd hoped this hotel would provide. Her discourteous response to even the tiniest requests - such as a room key or a glass of water from the bar for an elderly guest - were so unpleasant that we just tried to stay out of her way. A neighboring guest kept us awake late one night with loud drunken telephone conversation, but I just didn't have the heart to call the front desk to do something about it. The loud drunk was almost preferable. The one time she was inexplicably friendly turned out to be the day her boyfriend came to visit - as we left the hotel, they began making out passionately in the hotel doorway. Pas professionnel. One other young woman and a gentleman we encountered briefly at reception were both very gracious. Unfortunate that the hotel has someone on their staff during prime time (Friday and Saturday afternoon and evening) who made our experience so negative. A couple other notes: - Avoid the Japanese restaurants on the street - harmless but subpar. - For guests with children: what they call a child's \"cot\" is, in fact, a pack-and-play type thing, unsuitable for children over 2 yrs (their limit is 3 years). It'll also cost you $25 euro extra per night. - Our room safe did not work. Upon inquiring whether someone could fix it, or we could put our items in their desk safe, I was told to bring it to the front desk. They put my ipad and camera in an envelope. Upon later return, I was shocked to have it handed to me off a sideboard sitting behind the little front desk. The envelope had sat out the whole time within grabbing reach; much of the time the reception person isn't sitting at the little desk at all. It was never put in a safe - I don't think they have one.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant hotel in an ideal location\u201d", "Author": "CoffeeHound58", "ReviewID": "UR105383542", "Content": "Earlier in April I traveled to Paris with a friend, via the TGV from Zurich.

We love the area around the Pantheon/Jardins de Luxembourg/St Germain and it was ideally placed for all of these and much more. The hotel itself is clean, cosy and comfortable and the room size was fine for purpose ie. sleeping and a rest between exploring the city all day and going out for dinner at night. Bathroom was a decent size with a good shower but why do they insist on these 'sticks with air' purporting to be hairdryers? A recipe for frizz! We didn't have breakfast in the hotel (around 12eu) as we prefer to go to our favourite brasserie, Le Comptoir du Pantheon, where you get the usual Continental for 6.50eu in the coolest of settings... Oh, to have been a student at La Sorbonne! Alternatively, there's a fab friendly little bakery, Le Fournile, doors along from the hotel which serves coffee, OJ & 2 croissants for just 4.20eu. If it had been summer, we'd have bought quiche and pastries there, popped into the Nicolas wine shop opposite for some vin rose and had a picnic down by the Seine or in the Jardins des Plantes. For dinner, there are loads of places nearby. I wanted to try Au Pere Louis but it was jam packed so we went to La Ferrandaise instead. To be honest, I was disappointed as I felt it had aspirations above its capabilities and for the price, the food was hit and miss. We had a much nicer meal in Chez Nadine in the Mouffetard. Personally, I think in Paris, your best best is to have the Plat de Jour/Menu Fixe or go really high end. Re the hotel, I would definitely recommend it for location and comfort - absolutely no complaints. Note to hubby - thanks for making our 10 year Anniversary magical.

The block has excellent restaurants, a sandwich shop next door that opens for breakfast 7 days a week, two mini-grocery stores on the corner, along with a wine store, and even a laundrymat on the next block. When we asked to stay longer, the Hotel accommodated our request and let us keep our room (at the discount rate.)

The room was quiet, clean and the bathroom was spotless and spacious -- probably the only strong points of the room. The entranceway in the hall was very narrow and cramped, not the best place for hauling a few pieces of luggage up one flight of stairs then past a self-closing doorway that had to be held open with one arm while luggage is wheeled thru with the other, all the while standing on the top step of stairs! Acrobatic or what? There was free internet at a Dell computer on the main floor, for guest use. That's a big plus, since many Parisian hotels do not provide computer use (i.e. you don't need to bring your laptop if you just want to check email). The location was great -- across from the Luxembourg Gardens, and a few steps away from the 21, 27, and 63 bus lines for scenic travelling in central Paris. Lots of restaurants and cafes nearby, so that was an additional bonus. This was my 9th trip to Paris in 12 years. I prefer the Latin Quarter for its ambience and laid-back atmosphere.

To give a you an idea of how we reviewed this hotel; We are both in our early 30s and I in particular enjoy attention to detail and excellent service with complementing surroundings, he on the other hand is content with a bed and roof over his head. I found and booked the hotel through http://www.cybevasion.com/ and got a very competitive rate, almost 100\u20ac a night cheaper than all other on line booking sites! The room was very well sized by any standard and especially by Parisian standards. The reception area was excellent with an open fire and very welcoming with helpful staff who went out of their way to accommodate all my queries. Good points: A little on the small side but had a well enough sized bath- a welcoming comfort after a long day exploring Paris in the winter months. However nothing to write home about(who would about a bathroom!) but still not inadequate. The size of the room and storage space was plentiful. The colour scheme in the room was very modern and had really charming exposed beams making for a very romantic setting. The room we stayed in was the one advertised on the website- room 14. The only minor complaints we had were: 1. our bed was two singles put together to make a double and this was not overly comfortable. 2. The room is on the street side and at 4am on Tuesday the rubbish bin collectors were picking up waste and had flashing orange lights and loud pick up trucks waking us up at a very early hour- not the hotel's fault, but might be a better option to book a room not over looking the street. Or risk it as the room is wonderful! Overall rating of this hotel is as described. It is a very comfortable and a well kept hotel in a brilliant location. 2 minutes walk from Jardin de Luxembourg and 10 to the Notre Dame. Highly recommended. We travelled to Paris Beauvais and transport from the Airport was very easy. A bus departs from the airport after every flight arrival and tickets cost \u20ac13 each way bookable on: http://www.aeroportbeauvais.com/bus.php?lang=eng or you can purchase the tickets on arrival. The bus then takes you to Port Maillot on the Metro line this takes approx 1 hour. There you can either purchase a single from the booth in the metro or a Carnet of 10 for \u20ac11. If you intend to use the metro a little it's worth the book purchase (une Carnet) and you can share the tickets. I advise you map your journey before you arrive on the web site: http://www.ratp.info/orienter/cv/carteparis.php. This is a very easy metro map to use and SO useful. Click on the green flag for your departure point and the red for you arrival point and the map will show you the line. There are too many wonderful things to do in Paris that I will leave it up to you to plan you itinerary but if you have any queries please e mail and I will be happy to advise. Have fun and pack some good walking shoes with you. Please note; Paris is a very expensive city and most bars will charge a standard \u20ac10 for a spirit and meals cost from \u20ac20 per head, unless eating in Brasseries which are very reasonable.

It was my treat to celebrate a Special Birthday. We travelled to Paris on the Orient Express - FANTASTIC - best food ever, cooked by Anatole ( TV Jeeves fans will know him) and took a taxi to the hotel from Gard du Nord. Very pleasant reception in this Left Bank hotel in a street which oozes Paris (it has its own Website !!). Our room (31) looked out over the inner courtyard and was so quiet at night you thought you were in the middle of the countryside.. not one crying baby or discordant music. It had a modern showerroom/toilet, comfortable bed, flat screen TV with BBC World (little news about Britain !) and that was about it. So a room to sleep in rather than relax in. But the neat breakfast area served up the traditional Continental breakfast under the delightful eye of a charming young lady. There was a cool courtyard for sunny (?) mornings. Other guests were most respectable (!), whilst all the desk staff were the same, all speaking good English and very helpful. Paris was closeby. But we got lost !! The nearest underground is Odeon, though equally close isCluny la Sorbonne. Coming out of the wrong exit of Odeon we took 30 minutes to find our bearings - in pouring rain of course - as the street maps did not show our hotel road - we were in the 5th arrondisment not the 6th !! So take a good map with you. Cluny la Sorbonne gives you direct access to Boulevard St. Michel. Walk South along here until you get to the junction with Rue de Medicis and the Luxembourg gardens. . The tiny street adjoining is Rue Monsieur le Prince and the hotel 50 yards on the left. From Odeon its a little more complicated though the other end of the hotel street is close by and you'll have to climb the slight incline to the far end to get to the hotel. But make sure you exit at the 'back' entrance from the train... As for Paris ... well no tourist book is adequate. Just wander and enjoy. The only downside - especially after the food on the Orient Express - was the cuisine, mostly disappointing, sometimes awful and too expensive - four coffees: FOURTEEN POUNDS. So sorry cannot recommend any restaurant, including the much lauded one in the hotel street. Sadly the nearby branch of the famous Chartier chain was closed for the holidays - now THAT would have been OK.... But if you want a quiet hotel, no frills and and a helpful staff can certainly recommend Le Clos Medicis - they might even have finished the external decoration by the time you go.... Final tip - make sure you tell the taxi driver EXACTLY where you want to go. On leaving we asked for the Garde du Nord - and ended up at the Gare du Lyon. That was an extra 15 Euros on the fare..... and nail biting to connect with the home going Eurostar - the best way to travel (apart, of course, from the Orient Express....and Anatole's food.....) back to the UK.

We ate at a Japanese place right across the street and had breakfast on the corner.

Although many people on this site declared themselves to be happy with a RER very close by, that only works if you want to go to Charles the Gaulle, or Versailles. Most tourists would prefer a metro, and the closest station is Od\u00e9on, or Cluny La Sorbonne, both at least a ten minutes walk, which I personally find to far. But then I am definitely the lazy type. In the end I would probably prefer a hotel near Maubert, in the 5th, but that has nothing to do with the quality and service of Clos Medicis, which are excellent.", "Date": "June 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hants", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel in the 6th\u201d", "Author": "Binsted", "ReviewID": "UR7801655", "Content": "We were planning to be in Paris for 3 days as part of a touring holiday.

I can only say that the hotel and its staff enhanced an truly enjoyable and memorable trip. The hotel was easy to get to from The Gard de Nord station, (arrived using Eurostar) having 2 Metro Stations (\"Odeon\" and \"Cluny la Sorbonne\") less than 10 minutes walk away, and an RER station (\"Luxembourg\") less than 5 minutes walk away! The hotel is situated conveniently about 15 minutes walk from the Seine and the Ile de la Citie upon which stands Notre Dame, a further 10-12 minute walk will take you to the Louvre. So the Clos Medicis location is a very good base to explore the city either on foot or using public transport. The hotel is in a side street Rue Monsieur le Prince of the main road Boulevard St Michel which runs north to the river. The street is not noisy or overly busy, but has numerous Japanese and Sushi resturants, all very similar. We were told that they are all owned by just 2 persons, and are worth trying out. On first viewing the hotel is smart and chic, but inviting, with a sunken lounge area to the right with a small bar, sofas, tables and in the evening a real fire. The reception area is manned 24 hours a day, and without exception the staff were polite, friendly and very very helpful. They put themselves out to give advice, directions and recommendations all of which was useful and accurate. Behind the reception is the dining area. This is a little small, especially if all the guests wished to part-take of the continental breakfast at once, but perhaps more by luck than judgement the guests \"staggered\" themselves, and we were never without a table to ourselves. There is a small, very small lift to the upper floors, we used the staircase. There are only about 24 rooms, so the hotel has a close knit \"homey\" atmosphere often missing from the larger homogenised establishments. We were taken to our double room, which was of a size commensurate with a 3 star hotel. It was very clean and tastefully appointed. The en-suite was also a reasonable size and clean, well decorated and appointed. The outstanding feature was the extra high ceiling (as throughout the hotel) which had the original exposed beams, which were wonderfully warped and of different dimensions and different joints. The shell of the hotel is several hundred years old, and the retention of these period features oozed character amid the modern facilities. As a sleeper who is disturbed more by light than noise I was gladdened by the inclusion of a heavy curtain liner, when drawn the room was PITCH BLACK! Excellent. The bed was comfortable, and we both slept soundly during our time at the hotel. Each day a maid service made the bed and replaced the already ample supply of towels, and the en-suite was contantly topped up with toilet rolls and kleenex tissues. The room was equipped with a TV, but the only channel in English was CNN, the BBC news channel wasn't transmitting for some reason. But you don't go to Paris to watch the TV ! The continental breakfast was also very good, with a selection of cereals, croissant's, jams and preserves, pastries, bread rolls, cheese and hams, eggs, fresh fruit and freshly squeezed fruit juices, aswell as a pot of excellent coffee. The girl who served was the only staff member who spoke no English, but she was charming and so helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel, I have personally put it in my back pocket for my next visit to Paris. The staff particularly made the place, which had a charm and character of its own.

I booked a last minute trip to Paris and was having a tough time in choosing a 3 star hotel. The only available properties seemed to be in charmless generic looking properties that charged about $175-$200 a night and none of them were getting the types of customer reviews that made me want to book there. Anything somewhat attractive or stylish were in the 4 star properties at a much higher $350-$500 a night. I am a sucker for boutique hotels as I appreciate more of a clean modern style, but that look was completely missing in the three star category. The Hotel Le Clos Medicis was one of the few that had more of a 4 star look to it; more upscale and stylish. The room prices seemed in line with other three star hotels but unfortunately single and double room rates were sold out so I splurged for a Queen size room which at $275 was still much less than a much smaller room would have been at a 4 star hotel. The hotel lobby is very charming, with comfortable couches and chairs and a mixture of modern and eclectic looks including a fireplace. It's the type of room you'd be happy to hang out in and have a coffee or a drink, and many of the guests were doing just that. As for my room, the size was better than average but most likely because it was a queen room. The style was very clean and modern with a flat screen tv (that looked and sounded worse than a normal tv). Also, they don't use those disgusting generic bed spreads that shouldn't be touched with tweezers let alone by a body. Instead they use changeable duvet covers; much more in line with better hotels. The bathroom was of average size (small) but very modern and attractive, with a nice towel warmer. I will never get used to those half glass shower doors that allow water to spray all over the bathroom. Lastly, for those of you who like me, are slightly germ conscious (this applies to those that open bathroom doors with paper towels), they use plastic bags in the garbage pails. For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, then please disregard. The staff is friendly and helpful but one can tell the difference between a 3 and 4 star hotel when 1. you ask for a wake up call and they forget, and 2. you ask for a box of tissues at 11:00 pm and they tell you that you will need to come down to the lobby to pick them up. If that is the worst thing to happen, then you are in pretty good shape. If you can get a rate that is in line with other three star properties or even slightly more, than absolutely stay at this hotel. Also, the area is great; a few blocks away from St. Germaine and the Odeon metro. Keep in mind that I did not see a single or double room so do not know the sizes.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cWill recommend!\u201d", "Author": "CaribeMiami", "ReviewID": "UR6044183", "Content": "As first timers in Europe, we started our 2wk vacation in this little/ intimate hotel.

It's a secret for only those TripAdvisor fans who are clever enough to read before they go. ROOM 12 is a deluxe room - two twin beds/king with a blue and white tiled shower. It's at the top of your semi-private stone-hewned spiral staircase accessed just ten feet from the front desk. Yes, the room is tiny - you can view photos on the hotel website...Room 12 is seen in the very last two photos of the slide show - but there are two sets of French doors which both open onto your very own private terrace. Voila'! Darn if the terrace is as big as the room itself! And there's a table for two and a view of the rooftops around Luxembourg. Street noise? Not in Room 12! But in the morning you can eavesdrop on the breakfasters in the courtyard below and enjoy the songbirds and the sounds of Paris coming alive. Trust me.

We made our booking directly with the hotel, as this gave us the best price, rather than using some of the hotel sites, which were more expensive. We originally made a 3 night booking, but ended up in London for the 2nd night of the 3. I amended our booking by email, and the hotel kindly agreed to keep our luggage for the night we were away. We therefore had different rooms for our first night and last night, and were impressed by the style of both the rooms. We paid \u20ac102.50 a night, which was a special offer with the hotel. Our first room was number 65, on the top floor, accessed by the lift to the fifth floor and then a short flight of steps to the two rooms on the 6th floor. We were delighted when we opened the door, to find a beautifully decorated room, just like the photos we had seen, with a flat screen tv, nice linens, velvet edged bedspreads, matching velvet edged curtains, and we had a stunning bathroom upstairs, accessed by a spiral staircase in the corner of the room. The bathroom was white tiled, (very clean), twin sinks, power shower with shower screen, thick bathrobes, huge bright mirror etc. Our second room was on the third floor - number 36 - and is the burgundy and white walled room with the navy blue bed, which is shown in some of the photos on other sites. Again the bathroom was clean and well decorated, although smaller and decorated with terracotta floor tiles. Rather confusing tho is the fact that there are two lifts - one takes you to the even rooms, and one to the odd rooms. The floors must be split somehow, as there only ever seemed to be three rooms per floor, so there must be some split level thing going on. We chose not to have breakfast in the hotel - we felt the \u20ac12 per person charge was slightly steep - but a five minute walk from the hotel (turn left down Rue Monsieur le Prince) at the corner of Boulevard Saint-Germain there is a super eatery with red awnings where we had a set breakfast of croissants, jam and coffee for \u20ac6 each. I'm sorry I forget its name, but its a large establishment with lots of tables outside, and plenty of tables inside by the windows, so you can't miss it. There were painters and decoraters in the the hotel during our stay, but they were very polite and very unobtrusive, and we certainly didn't feel that we were in the middle of a redecoration. The hotel is a five minute walk from the Luxembourg metro station. This is on the RER blue line, which takes you directly to Charles De Gaulle airport. All in all, a lovely hotel, and we would certainly stay here again.", "Date": "August 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA great little Parisian hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5423172", "Content": "We stayed here in early June for three nights and throughly enjoyed our time.
