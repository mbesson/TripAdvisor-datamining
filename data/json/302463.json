We arrived at the hotel at around 7:30 am and were very impressed that we could immediately check-in which made us feel very comfortable, particularly after a 9 hours' flight! One excellent service was that the hotel provides hourly shuttle bus to Jumeirah Beach Hotel on one side and the Dubai Mall on the other side.

Checking into this business hotel whilst in shorts (due to where we had travelled from) and with a 10 year old son in tow probably influenced the greeting we received as we had a problem at check in and felt we were dismissed by the gentleman on reception and also initally by the duty manager on the phone. The matter was resolved finally by the duty manager when i went back down to reception to talk to him but why it took this i still don't understand. On arriving in the room we found no bed for our son and had to request one. This arrived, was made up and left in the middle of the room! Now the last thing i want to be doing in the middle of the night is climbing over beds to get to the bathroom, a little thought would have saved me the effort of pushing a bed around a room, i didn't think that i was expected to do this in a three star hotel let alone a 5 star hotel and i certainly never had to do this previously in the JBH or the Mina a salem. We stayed at this hotel due to the fact that we wanted to be closer to the Dubai Mall and the airport but the benefit of this hotel is the fact you can still get access to the wild wadi and beaches via a free shuttle. However the free shuttle when we tried to use it was full. There was two groups still left but a car was quickly found to take one party and the one with the child (who were next in line) were ignored and told to take a taxi and get a receipt! The hotel is an excellent property and clearly caters for a business clientel but if forgets that sometimes other guests may wish to stay there too, particularly at weekends. As a family i would certainly choose either the JBH or the Mina before this hotel in the future as they cater for all types of guests. In the main though the staff are friendly and helpful (thanks to Rolando for helping arrange transport) and have responded to the comments i left on departing so there does appear to be a really concern as to guest experiences. I just feel slightly disappointed in that i believe had i been travelling on business and arrived in a suit, i would have had a different customer experience. Having read previous comments submitted, if there is any issues this hotel has, it seems that the majority are with check in staff (Hassan?) when not on business.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DeAndre W", "ReviewID": "UR125398826", "Content": "My friends and i were visiting the hotel for a friends birthday.

I arrived in Dubai at 5am, after an extended trip from Australia via Korea. I was fed up with travelling and was desperate for a shower and a lie down. Without a huge amount of confidence, I requested an early check in and was not surprised that there was no room immediately available. What was very impressive, however, was how staff at the front desk responded from there. My bags were whisked away and I was taken straight through to the very nice Moasici restaurant. A newspaper was put in front of me and I was invited to enjoy a free breakfast buffet while they sorted a room for me. By the time I'd worked my way through a plate of the best pastries I've ever tried outside of France, my room was ready and my bag had been taken upstairs. THAT'S the kind of service that makes you feel welcome, and it's an example of all of my interactions with staff over the course of my visit. My room was large, and well fitted out. A great little bonus was a coffee machine in the room, with my jetlag chased away with vast amounts of espresso. Toiletries and all the little extras in the room were wonderful quality and made for a very comfortable experience. Internet was Wifi (available for free throughout the hotel) and very fast. If you have a few moments during your trip, don't miss the gym/health club. It is equal to any that I've come across in hotels around the world, and again the service is excellent. Although I didn't swim, the pool looked very good, too. There are a number of restaurants on site, which are pricey but very high quality. Overall, I can't fault this hotel.

Unfortunately, the whole experience was spolied within the first 45 minutes by the attitutude of the staff member that checked us in and the fact that the hotel room allocated to us was not suitable for two adults and a child of 9. Note to staff - offering a pillow and a blanket for my child to sleep on the couch in the room is not acceptable. We were clearly allocated a room suitable for one business person - i.e one tooth mug, one bathrobe etc I booked with my plantinum Amex, which normally ensures a room upgrade - was told there were none available without the system even being checked and when I challenged this (because I had checked on my way there) I was told that it was not possible because they had 'important guests staying' Funny, I thought Jumeirah considered that all of its guests were important, especialy Sirius card holders. The card also grants 4pm check out and after the check in team member questioned my status and read the whole email (all 4 pages whilst stood in front of me) again I was told this was not possible. It was the only reason I booked as we had an 8pm flight time home. So we all trouped back down to reception I asked to speak to a manager and was told 'he's busy' - again this one done without checking. I asked about cancellation policy so that we could check out the next day and got into a debate were the check in clerk refused to tell me the hotel's policy and insisted I pay for the whole stay or spoke to American Express at my own expense. My son was in tears by the time we eventually got to the room with our luggage and of course we were late for a dinner reservation that had to be cancelled. I spoke to Amex who phoned the duty manager. A bed eventually arrived in the room for my son, we had to climb over it to get to the bathroom. The duty manager agreed a 4pm check out the next day and we left - never to return. I was left feeling like we should really have used the tradesman's entrance. This is a lovely hotel and very well situated in Dubai, especially if you are on business. There is a metro station close by and so other areas are easily accessible. I am sure it has many satisfied guests - it just wasn't for us.

Once THE destination for business, it might have been now somehow surpassed by some of the newest and much talked about hotels that have been recently inaugurated, but without doubts it keeps its unmistakable classy touch. On the positive sides: very large rooms, astonishing views over Dubai thanks to the full glass wall that never fails to impress you once entering your room, large and clean bathrooms, excellent and very rich breakfast buffet, very good gym, personnel extremely polite and helpful. Taking the high speed glass elevator is always an amazing experience, with the view over Shaik Zayed Road that suddenly disappears once the elevator reaches the mezzanine. Sipping a cocktail at Vu bar on the top of the hotel is another experience you don't want to miss. Just a small little annoying detail (but really minor) is the noise of the elevator that you can hear, especially in the silence of the night, in some of the rooms close to the elevators. I have been staying in Emirates Towers many times over the years, and I would surely recommend it for business travellers that want to enjoy their free time and that want to impress their business acquaintances. However I would not recommend it so strongly for leisure travellers, as Dubai has alternative destinations more focussed on them: here the pool is nice but clearly made for a quick dip rather than for sun addicts wanting to spend the whole day there. Although there is an efficient shuttle service that connects to the Jumeirah beaches, still you have to spend 15 to 30 minute in it before reaching the beach, depending on the traffic. The hotel is actually quite close to one of the metro stations, but it is a little bit challenging to reach it by walking (10 to 15 minutes fast walking), especially considering the heat that you have in Dubai for 10 months a year, so you may prefer the usual taxi solution for moving in the city. All in all, as said, I would strongly recommend the Emirates Towers for all business travellers.

The JET is not new by Dubai standards but it is very well thought out and got everything you need. The rooms are large and functional with a desk, good bed and large bathroom. There is a large gym downstairs and an even larger one in the mall below.

Opulent and stylish, the service was beyond reproach, and the quality of the amenities was generally great. I would have no hesitation in staying here again if I was travelling to Dubai on business, but, if I was just looking for a place to unwind between flights I would definitely choose somewhere more relaxed. Jumeirah Emirates Towers is full of people doing business - from the always busy lobby bar to the fine dining restaurants, the adjoining office towers and shops, and the man in the Armani suit on the 30th floor finalising a deal on his mobile phone, the hotel exudes the \"busy people doing important things\" atmosphere that attracts high-flyers in droves. If, however, you're just stopping over between flights and want to be able to relax and walk around in your not-quite-Armani holiday clothes, you might, as we did, feel a bit under-dressed in this establishment. Check in was well handled when we arrived at 7 am (well before the 2:00 pm check in time). Not only did they manage to find us a room, but we were also given a refreshing fruit drink - just one of the finer touches offered by this hotel. Our room, on the 30th floor, was enormous compared to most of the places we had stayed in Europe, and slightly bigger than the other Dubai hotel we have stayed in. If the haze had cleared it would have also had a great view. A wide range of amenities came with the room including a Nespresso machine, a tv bigger than the one we have at home, a huge and very comfortable bed, and a bathroom that was big enough to throw a party in, should you be so inclined. Surprisingly, the quality of the bathroom fit-out was let down by the extremely slow drain rate of the shower and the vanity. While the shower did not overflow, I spent most of my shower standing in water over my toes, and when I brushed my teeth it took over a minute for the vanity to drain. When you're ready to eat, a selection of restaurants are available within the hotel and the adjoining \"Boulevard\". Luckily, the hotel guidebook lists the dress code for each of these restaurants, so you'll immediately know whether or not your clothes will get you into your restaurant of choice. We chose the casual dress code \"ET Sushi\" for lunch, which turned out to be so good we went back there for dinner. Highly recommended. In the afternoon we went out on an Arabian Adventures tour, and when we returned someone had visited the room and turned down the bed. Complimentary chocolates were on the pillows, slippers next to the bed, and a bucket of ice was on the coffee table. Another nice and unexpected touch. Interestingly, we noticed that while you can switch on the electronic \"do not disturb\" sign while you are in the room, it goes out as soon as you remove your room card, and there does not appear to be a way to enable it while you are out. We're used to being able to place a \"do not disturb\" card on the door if we don't want anyone visiting our room while we're out, and it was surprising that this facility is not available here. After a great sleep we managed to fit in a quick visit to the included buffet breakfast before we had to leave for our next flight. What a delight. It was one of the best breakfasts of our entire holiday. Melt-in-the-mouth pastries, very fresh fruit, decent coffee, and a wide range of other foods we would have loved to sample if we'd had the time. If you do decide to book into this hotel, make sure you include breakfast. Check out as just as smooth as check in, and the doormen went out of their way to make sure our transport to the airport (pre-booked through Emirates) was on the way when they didn't arrive at the scheduled time. This is a fine hotel, with great staff and opulent surroundings, but it's got a rushed feel to it. If you're a business person on a schedule, you'll feel right at home here, but if you're looking for somewhere to dress down and relax while \"stopping over\", there are better choices in Dubai.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur", "Title": "\u201cLoved it.

When we first went there back in 2003, we were blown away by the high standards of service. In latter years, standards dropped a little, but I'm pleased to report they're right back where they started and you'll find it hard to get better. We were met from our plane by the hotel car and were impressed to find that, though we arrived very early in the morning, they could take us straight to our room - and I mean straight - we didn't even stop to check in, a member of the hotel staff did that for us from our hotel room. It is hard to lift a finger here, staff call lifts for you, open and close doors, hail taxis and open and close every car door as well and there's always a \"welcome back\" to greet you as you reenter the hotel. It's the same level of service at the pool, with staff on hand to put towels on the sun beds, hand out complimentary iced water, cold towels and various other fruit snacks and drinks. For a few years now we have been disappointed by the hotel's so called \"beach club\" which was really very basic indeed (the original one was to die for!). They now offer complimentary beach facilities at two sister hotels with a hotel shuttle - we tried the \"Madinat\" and it offered a very high standard of service, a fantastic beach front and allowed us the flexibility to charge drinks to our hotel room. Just like the old days! We stayed in a premier room - which is basically a suite with lounge and bedroom. It also gives you access to the club room which offers 3 light meals a day, afternoon tea and complimentary drinks. Again, we were becoming dissatisfied with the atmosphere here, because they had previously offered this facility to a wider range of rooms which could make it crowded at times, but now it is back to the peaceful haven we knew and loved from earlier times. Staff are quick to remember your names and your favourite drinks - one member of staff even remembered us from our visit the previous year! This is primarily a business hotel - and that is why we like it so much. It gives us a much quieter holiday than at the beach, which is much more family oriented, and yet you can still get to the beach but return to peace and quiet. My husband has also stayed here on business and finds the central location, the free wifi and the huge work desks in the bedroom a real blessing. Despite being business oriented, this did not stop housekeeping from fashioning a pair of hotel towels into the cutest white swans and covering them with rose petals for us at the entrance to our room. I am quite sure they don't do this for their business clients (at least I hope not!), so it really was a personal touch and quite a surprise for us, given that my husband and I are decidedly not honeymooners! One small gripe - prostitution is definitely on the increase since we started staying in Dubai and, for the first time ever, I found myself sharing a hotel lift with a prostitute and her client one evening. I have lived enough of a sheltered life to be quite embarrassed by this. The prostitute herself was very discretely dressed and well-behaved in the lift, but unfortunately her English male client was not! I'm not sure there is much hotel staff can do about this, but it's not an experience I want to repeat.

From the outset, I should point out that this review is written from a business tavel perspective as if you are travelling for leisure, there are so many better located hotels in which to stay (my most recent stay was at the Palace, Old Town, which was excellent and will write separate review. In March 2011 I will be travelling with wife to Dubai for the first time and staying at Grosvenor House Hotel - review to follow :o)). Each stay at Emirates Towers has been in Premier Room, which are of a decent size and have king size bed, decent flat screen tv and plenty of storage. Work space is excellent with large desk but if you have to use the business centre for internet access, it is a bit pricey. Breakfast is buffet style but you'll be hard-pushed to find better with a wide range of options available and the customer service of breakfast waiting-staff is perfection. Should also mention in-room dinign which was excellent. Other hotel facilities are exactly what you would expect of a 5 star business hotel - gym and spa of a very good standard. Also the pool area is very well maintained and generally quiet as there are so few tourists staying on th premises. The only other facility worthy of note is the Rib Room restaurant on the ground floor which I cannot recommend highly enough. Below the hotel is a shopping mall (shops are ridiculously expensive even for Dubai - the Dubai Mall is a 10 minute cab ride away!) with restaurants/bars that are slightly cheaper than hotel and that show English footbal/cricket, if you get withdrawal symptoms. Try the Lebanese restaurant here - it's fabulous! Overall, this is a great hotel if you are looking for comfortable business accomodation and especially if visiting the DIFC, which is right across the street. If on your hols - go elsewhere as although the rooms are great, they're pretty clinical and its a fair taxi ride to join any fellow tourists.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monte-Carlo, Monaco", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "Andy11081977", "ReviewID": "UR92841984", "Content": "Is a business hotel, but for the leisure is perfect too, service is very very good.

Next day they have authorized another 2400+ DHS on my other card (first card was provided to hotel during check in, the second one is the card i've used when i made reservation). When i ask about this at reception they told me that this was made \"by system\" and they can do nothing with it. Not a really clear answer and not the answer I've expect to get at Jumeirah property but - OK, no problem... Soo... 2 nights passed and we moved (as planned) to Bab Al Shams (another Jumeirah hotel). During check-out the receptionist was a bit confused with all this system transactions and printer malfunctions but in 5 mins she solved the problem with printer, print me invoice and wish me great time at Bab Al Shams.

And she need another credit card from me to charge it once again. I've asked her to solve HER problem with JET management and their bank, but she told me that she can't do anything and I should give her another credit card. OK, I have to call my bank and ask for instructions (because of roaming charges and waiting time for investigations this call cost me about 65USD). I've send all transaction details and instructions i've got from my bank to JET GuestRelations and ask them not to bother me because this situation was their mistake and they can solve it with their bank. Needless to say that I got no reply and that JET guys continue to calling our room at BAS (we go to SPA, so we didn't answer)... They even call Duty Manager of BAS and ask him to find us. And he did this - he find us during our dinner. And ask me to go to reception (needless to say that i felt very uncomfortable because of this). He tried to call JET Duty Manager but got no answer, so i have to explain the situation to him. He said that this shouldn't be my problem (because this is JET mistake) and promise me to solve it - and he did (dear Ashraf - THANK YOU!).

I did read a lot of reviews on this website. A lot did not point out to it being good. However something about it appealed to me and I did book it in for my vacation to Dubai. I must say the from the service to cleanliness to the very nature of the hotel was truly amazing. This is a grand hotel Dubai style. From the outside to the inside. Do keep in mind though that it is primarily marketed as a business hotel. However I would say that from the moment we walked in at 6 am - we were met at the airport by their staff - escorted to the waiting limousine and checked in - through the car. When we reached the hotel we had a manager waiting for us at the door and took us straight to our Room - Level 36. Extremely polite and gentle man. He took our passport for check in and brought it back up in 5 minutes flat. I was booked in to the Apex suite - which was in the shape of a triangle - like the hotel itself. The view from the bedroom was really cool overlooking Dubai and the palace stables. The bedroom was at the apex of the triangle so was novel in my view. The bathroom was well appointed with accessories. We did need some extra accessories and a call through to the reception at 730 had a prompt response and delivery. The hotel is very ideally located to the Dubai Mall - simply amzing mall I must add - unparalleled in my travels so far. Do make a note to catch the fountains outside it. The staff were really helpful to a fault. My room was made up to high standards. All attention to detail was paid. I had asked for specific papers and medical pillows et al before I came. They were all there well aranged for me. TIP: Dubai is a tipping nation. Do ensure you tip the guys - generously if you can. That just makes their day. Porters,c abbies restaurants all included. The hotel is also connected to a shopping mall - however would not really recommend it - as it is a bit pricey. Would rather go to the Dubai Mall. Also used the H2O spa services. NOTE: If you have come off a long flight take a dip in their salt pool. Worth every dollar and then head for a massage. The staff were very polite and were more than what is expected from a 5* hotel. Vu's Bar is something worth going to. The lift opens directly at the bar which is pretty cool. The views are really amazing from there and the drinks are off the hooks. Ask the bar tenders to make one of their special cocktails. I did not even bother what they put in to it. Also had breakfast in the ground floor -r estaurant not sure of the name but was really cool. With views of the pool and sunlight streaming through. Could not ask for more. The chef was making stuff on order plus a huge plus buffet! Riveting stuff! Also had the oppurtunity to sit in the ground floor lobby cafe/restaurant - food was excellent and so was the service. Check out is a breeze. You can check out online and simply walk out of the hotel. Else can go to the reception and they should have you ready to go in under 2 minutes. Staff that were really good - Myo at the reception. Christopher at the Bell Desk. Also to add I did leave some feedback for the hotel in my room. I received a prompt response the next day from their general manager. What else could you ask for when such attention is paid to such detail. Another good thing was it had FREE wireless internet in the room. What else could you ask for - along with a printer et al. No issues printing out my boarding pass :)! Do go check out the hotel's beach which is with the Jumeirah Beach hotel - with the Burj Al Arab in back ground - worth going to. The amount of water sports available is MAD! Not like the usual 5 minute ride around the corners stuff. We took a banana boat kind of adaptation. By golly we went right in to the heart of the Arabic Ocean. Simply mind blowing stuff. You have water scooters and the likes available. So if you are a water person - by all means go for it. Even if it is just for a walk. Else you always have the Al Wadi water park which was pretty cool & empty so what else could you ask for. No lines for going on any ride you like. Also went to Vu's restaurant which was nice. Nothing extraordinary but all the same was good. Do ask the hotel - if you are interested that is - to book you in to Lunch Dinner or Breakfast at the Burj Al Arab - review on that in a later one - but simply will say this - it is not expensive - and you should make it a point to go. Totally worth it. Also the location for the hotel is really good - close to the Burj area and Dubai Mall. Yes if you need to go to the Burj Al Arab side - not sure what it is called then it is about a 80 AED trip. We needed some sightseeing et the likes. A call to the reception - once again spoilt me for choice - Dubai style. I would recommend to go check out the falcons - worth it again. Taxis are available right out side on your beck and call. Else if you need style the hotel gives you a limousine for 300 AED/ hour. On note of taxis - will recommend if you are doing a lot of going about - to hire a taxi for the day - a private taxi. Not those yellow ones. I lost my mobile phone in a cab and veen though we tracked down the cab - thanks to the hotel - the taxi guy was not helpful. Was recommended to me to use a private taxi for the day - and it is cheap. Else taxis to and fro are extremely cheap and the way to go... I used a guy by the name of Mehmood - with a Chrysler 300. It was amazing. Always waiting for us on or before time. We would be the ones running late. I would recommend him if you plan to take a private cab :) I think the only thing missing from this hotel - is LCD TVs. They still have back in the day CRT TVs and small ones at that. All in all will highly recommend this hotel. Did check out the The Atlantis et al but I think this hotel is all that it is made out to be and more.

The bathroom was the size of a normal hotel room plus after living it rough in europes absurdly overpriced small rooms i was gobsmacked. The room had two B&O tv's with excellent movie and news chanels, and you could order from a long list of DVD;s. We had our own expresso machine in the room and everyday at midday they would bring us a platter of fruit and some deserts to have with our coffee. We were on the highest floor so we had a great view of the dust! Room Service: Awesome food - we had deserts, club sandwiches and some drinks and it cost us next to nothing maybe $50AUD or 150AED which is so cheap for room service food at 1 in the morning. Food: In the Mall next door there is a great asia resteraunt that serves your usual pad thai, peeking duck, rendang curries etc grab a meal and a drink each for about $40AUD for two people or 120AED. Mall: In addition to the Asian resteraunt the mall had a great sunglass an optomitrist that had a sale on for 50% - they were basically the same price as the other malls and had a great selection. The best thing about the mall in the hotel is that its empty so if you do want to look at some of the prohibitvely expensive designer goods you can do so without 50 people getting in your way. Location:This hotel is perfectly located - not more than $30AED to further place of interest eg Burk Al Arab/Wadi World or Emirate Mall ?(the one with the skiing) which is about $10AUD or $9USD. Breakfast: is excellent - they provide home made yogurt and freshly made bircher which is great if you dont like eating bacon and eggs or fried rice for breakfast. They also have fresh strawberries and blueberries etc and they will make you pancakes which is a nice touch. Coffee was decent too. To do: they provide free wadi world tickets for guests (which is a 30aed taxi ride away). The mall closest to the hotel (the one with the aquarium in it) is the best in my opinion. They also offer hotel guests access to the Burj Al Arab hotel for free at certain times. Airline tips: for those who fly into Abu Dhabi with Etihad the hotel is very close to the bus drop off point at Chelsea towers and you can check you baggage in there. When i say close it cost us 10aed to get there which is about 4 mins in a cab. The dubai airport is also very close. I think my overall perception of the hotel was skewed by the fact taht we were upgraded but from posts written below it appears taht they do it quite often. The thing is these guys really looked after us and i walked into the hotel wearing thongs(flip flops for our americn friends here) shorts and a grubby tshirt that i spilt food on during the flight and i had a months worth of bread grwoth untaimed so i must have looked like a bum. He also allowed me to have a late checkout and cancelled my last night as i had paid for a night even though i intended to checkout late.

Had a look around the hotel and the lobby was busy despite it being ramadan and no drinks being served. However, in the club executive lounge soft drinks were served all day, with breakfast, snacks throughout the day and canapes and alcoholic drinks (inc champagne) from 7.30pm until 1am. It was very quiet in the exec lounge and a welcome respite away from the busyiness of Dubai. Lyndsey (Asst. lounge manager) was really nice and it was great having a chat with her before we left. The corner suite was wonderful with a small hallway, leading onto a toilet/sink and lounge/dining area with desk for laptop etc, around the corner was the main bathroom with large shower, toilet, bidet, bath with window over looking the main road and a glimpse of the Burj Tower and a single sink. All amenities were Aigner Black and 2 robes were provided with slippers available too. As we arrived late on a Thursday, we didn't both eating and just had a few snacks in the club lounge before retiring. The next evening (after a fairly heavy shopping trip) and a very relaxing drink, we dined in the Rib Room and had a very nice steak which was easy to cut unlike some of our steaks in the UK which can be tough. We did try to get in to Vu restaurant but was advised as it was a Friday during Ramadan it would be closed. The pool is relatively small but adequate for a business hotel in the daytime as most people are at work. The gave out cold water, evian spray and cold towels while sunbathing. Having checked with the concierge what time the car would be available, we were collected promptly and dropped at the airport with no problems at all. Our bags were see to throughout by the hotel and then the airport staff which made life really easy. Overall, a very nice stay for a couple of nights, with easy access to most things by taxi.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pewsey UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat for business\u201d", "Author": "tangleWoody", "ReviewID": "UR34061631", "Content": "Arrived here for a leisure break - Excellent quality hotel - rooms very spacious and well appointed.

Emirates Towers is located centrally, about 15 minutes from the airport, and opposite the Stock Exchange. We were greeted on arrival at the airport by a gleaming BMW and well dressed driver, who give us cold towels and water. The driver was very courteous and really only spoke to check that we were ok and that the A/C was set for our comfort. On arrival at the hotel we were whisked straight up to our room on the 43 floor. Check in was swift but the lady didn\u2019t tell us anything about the executive club lounge or what we had access to, or the fact that no shorts were allowed in the Executive Club lounge after 6pm (which we were later told off for). A friendly porter dropped off out luggage and showed us some basic things like how the A/C works. We did ask the porter for some ice, but this never arrived. The room was small by Dubai standards. We did have a good view of Diera towards the creek though. The office space was quite well equipped but there was no laptop (but there was free internet access if you had our own laptop). We later found out that internet access in the business centre is not free unless you are staying in a suite or all you want to do is to check in to your flight online. The lounge area in the room was comfortable and canap\u00e9s and fruit were delivered in the evenings. There were a good selection of magazines and a rather smart coffee machine. The bathroom was small but well equipped with bath, large power shower and men\u2019s toiletries. I don\u2019t think they realised that I was coming, so no female toiletries. The bed was large but the pillows were the worse we have ever come across. The Executive Club lounge is a fantastic space with panoramic windows looking over Sheikh Zayed Road, with comfortable arm chairs, and two large flat screen TVs, one showing the news and the other showing sport. Unfortunately though, this lovely area did not make up for the very snooty service. This is the first Executive Club lounge that I have been to that we were not allowed to help ourselves to drinks and that the food was cleared away without being finished. We were also told off for wearing shorts after 6pm, and they did not accept that we were not told this on arrival. The food was a bit hit and miss in quality and flavour. I would normally advocate spending the extra money on the Executive Club, but as a tourist, I don\u2019t think it represents good value for money at Emirates Towers. Service throughout the hotel in general was a bit slack. We tried to call reception a few times to ask various questions and either we were told to call someone else or we were cut off. Everything we asked seemed to be a bit of a pain for them. Nonetheless, on leaving the hotel, one member of staff recognised my husband, and was falling over himself helping us. It\u2019s a shame that we could not have had a level of service somewhere in between this enthusiastic guy and the snooty staff in the Executive Club lounge. The outdoor swimming pool at the hotel is a relatively good size considering that the hotel is in downtown Dubai and doesn\u2019t have the space as the hotels on the beach, but it is over looked by offices. Also you don\u2019t get the same poolside service that you do in other hotels. The gym is well equipped also with a good range of cardio-equipment and weights. I am a big fan of the Jumeirah properties, but Emirates Towers was a thorough disappointment. From what I saw, this hotel makes a fantastic business hotel \u2013 it\u2019s very businessman orientated \u2013 stiff service, no charm and certainly no appreciation for tourists. There are much better hotels to stay in for the same money if you are a tourist that will display Dubai\u2019s charm and hospitality much better. I\u2019m not saying that I would never stay here again, but it would have to be either if there was a bargain deal or if my husband is on business.", "Date": "June 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cUpscale city hotel; Ideal for business\u201d", "Author": "Sunny777", "ReviewID": "UR31247869", "Content": "Everything about Jumeirah Emirates Towers hotel screams professionalism. From the lobby filled with businessmen talking over coffee and tea, to the quiet glass elevators that whisk you to your room with a view, to the rooms themselves - tastefully decorated and complete with every essential (desk, internet access, robe, slippers, etc.). The towers themselves are a landmark in Dubai and stand out against the landscape with their innovative design. It's a convenient 20-minute taxi ride from the airport. On our first night, we had dinner at Al Nafoorah, a Lebanese restaurant in the mall attached to the hotel. Food was great and prices reasonable. Service was spotty - sometimes hard to get the waiter's attention. Also, check your bill - ours had double the charges on it when we first got it. We had drinks in the hotel's cocktail bar later on...nice spot, if a bit small. We also tried Awtar at the Hyatt - also fabulous food, but excellent service, live music and belly dancers as well. The hotel's breakfast is well worth the price. You'll be well-fortified through the day and likely won't need to eat until dinner time. It was a huge spread (the same that you'd find in many high-end Asian hotels) - Japanese breakfast (miso soup, rice, noodles), British breakfast (baked beans, etc.), Lebanese breakfast (hummus, yogurt, veggies), omelette station, cheese & breads, pastry section (muffins, croissants, even camel-milk rice pudding, which was delicious). The front desk was helpful in booking us a private tour around the city. For the relatively low price of 120 AED (compared to anywhere in Europe at least), we had a private Lexus and driver at our disposal. If you are visiting Dubai at the time of year, I highly recommend this option. We had considered the hop-on, hop-off bus as well as taking taxis around. Trust me - in 105 degree, humid weather, you do not want to be waiting outside for a bus. Within 8 hours we saw the major sights - tour of the Jumeirah Mosque (this was a highlight - educational tours are offered on certain days of the week at 10am only. the front desk initially told me, a woman, that I wouldn't be able to get in as I didn't have a head scarf or long pants - but they have scarfs and abayas for loan at the mosque, so no worries), Dubai Museum and fort, spice/gold souks (including a boat ride across the creek), Dubai Mall (including Ski Dubai), Madinat Jumeirah and the Burj Al Arab (guests of the Emirates towers hotel can visit the Burj before 11am and I believe after 5pm), the Palm (this part wasn't too exciting - would skip this if you're pressed for time). We were going to have dinner or drinks initially at the Burj Al Arab - my recommendation is that you go visit it first. We felt that our curiousity was satisfied enough and that we didn't need to go back and pay exorbiant prices for what seems to be mediocre food. Would I stay in this hotel again? I'm not sure - it was great and if I were to ever go to Dubai for business, I'd stay there for sure. If I go on another vacation there, I might choose to stay in one of the beach resorts - there are just so many of them and so many interesting options. My overall recommendation for Dubai is to stay away in the summer. It's just too hot to enjoy it. The beach was gorgeous and the hotel has a nice pool - ordinarily I would have loved to take some time to enjoy these...but it was just way too hot.

The lounge area is comfortable. Our S320 Mercedes arrived, and we were shown to it (had two staff walking with us, but they did not offer to push the trolley). The car was comfortable with bottled water, newspapers and magazines to read. The journey took around 30 minutes. Arrival at Emirates Towers - There was no one to open the car doors (noticeable over the next 5 days that maybe 1 in 6 cars arriving were met by doormen). We went to the reception area, and checked in. I had booked a promotional rate called \u2018Gold for Life\u2019 that basically gave you free limo transfers, access to the club lounge and all the amenities associated there (more later), a room up grade if available, 10% discount on all food in the hotel, and late check out. The receptionist was not aware of the promotional rate, and when I asked her if there was an upgrade available, she said we would have to pay an additional US$270 per night. I showed her the print out with all the details of the promotion, and after some time, she up-graded us to a Towers Room from the Deluxe Room. A Towers room is a Deluxe Room on a higher floor. So we were now on the 37th floor instead of the 31st floor. For a hotel of this caliber, I would have expected an escort to the room. Having stayed at the Shangri La, Dusit Thai, Fairmont, Ritz Carlton, and Grosvenor House in Dubai before (as well as Emirates Towers before), my report compares this stay to previous stays at 5 star hotels in Dubai. Room - We made our way to the room, as we had been \u2018up-graded\u2019, the room was set out for one person (i.e. in the bathroom one bath towel, one hand towel, one face cloth, etc.) I found this quite odd. The rooms as spacious with good views. The furniture is looking worn, as it the carpet. The TV is not even a flat screen, let alone Plasma and was small. There is a good size work desk with a very comfortable chair, and also a long lounge by the window that served as a day bed / dumping area. Storage space is adequate. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room, as well as a well stocked mini bar. There was quite a bit of reading material in the room. The bed is king size with a duvet and quality pillows. For the first three mornings I had to call House keeping to get additional towels. On the 4th morning I spoke to guest relations and told them that there should be towels for two guests in the room. They were blas\u00e9 about it, but I did notice that from that day onwards, the room looked cleaner, the bathroom was well stocked, etc. It was a shame that the house keeping staff had to be told to maintain a 5 star standard. Everyday there was a presentation of one type of fruit and one spice with a detailed note about the spice. This was a nice touch. Room Service - One morning we ordered room service. The order was clearly taken, and the food was delivered in the stipulated time. The trolley was well laid out, with all condiments, etc. Several times we asked for ice, and this was brought promptly. Club Floor - To access the club floor from Floors 10 \u2013 39, you have to take a lift to the ground floor, and then take a lift to the 42nd floor. This was an inconvenience, but with free access, I am not complaining. I overheard some guests who were staying in Apex Suites (a suite on each floor) that they had to do this. The Lounge has a smoking area (after 12:00 noon), and non smoking area\u2019s, as well as board rooms. A full breakfast (better then the breakfast in the main restaurant on the ground floor) is served from 6:30 am -11:30 am. Eggs are cooked to order, and there is a good selection of juices, fruit, cereals, breads, pastries, cheese, and hot foods. Nothing to complain about here. Service was good, courteous and efficient. At around 12:30 a light lunch of sandwiches, cheese, fruit, salads, pastries and desert is served. There are complimentary drinks (including alcohol) from 12:30 pm onwards. At around 4:00 pm afternoon tea is served with scones, pastries, cakes, etc. Then at 6:30 pm it is hot and cold canap\u00e9\u2019s including caviar, quail eggs, smoked salmon, crab, prawns, etc. An excellent selection. After 8:30 pm there is a sample of deserts. It is quite possible to eat all of your meals in the lounge with free beverages. It was a great lounge with good service. As we were not staying on the Club Floor, we were asked for our room number on a few occasions, but once the staff knew us, it was fine. Check \u2013 out Was efficient and fast. Emirates had sent a car to collect us. Overall Service \u2013 For a 5 star hotel in Dubai, this was the biggest weakness I saw. 5/10 Room \u2013 Needs refurbishing.

These 4 days were business for me, but I traveled with my wife and 2-yr old son, and they spent most of their time at the beach. The hotel was booked by my employer. I changed the reservation from a standard room to a deluxe room at my own (modest) extra cost. A king sized bed, desk with wired broadband, and a bathroom with bath, single sink, and separate shower. Spacious enough for the three of us (with a baby cot). Check-in was quick, and we were given room 3206. Travel to the 32st floor (out of 51) is done in a glass elevator, which means you can see the sea and the artificial islands of \"The World\" as soon as you reach above the towers at the other side of Sheikh Zayed road. Broadband did not work immediately, but this was quickly fixed. The room had all necessary amenities, a water cooker, fresh fruit daily, as well as fresh chocolates in the pillows. Our room overlooked the Dubai International Finance Center (DIFC), the Burj Dubai, and, in the distance, the Burj al-Arab. With my work being at the DIFC, this was a very convenient location! Either we had no neighbours, or the walls and door and superbly soundproof: we never heard anything of other guests. Dubai in December is certainly not not, and I wished I could have switched of the A/C. Not that it was too cold, but I could have done without the constant buzz. While I was away during the day, my wife and son spent their mornings, free of charge, at the beach hotel of the same chain (Madinat Jumeirah, right next to the Burj al-Arab). Complimentary beach tickets were available at the front desk (we are not sure these are available all year round). There is also a shuttle service, but my wife preferred to take a taxi to be more flexible. According to what I heard, service at the Madinat was excellent and she did not regret joining me on this business trip for one minute. There are many options for breakfast and dinner in the hotel and the shopping mall attached to it. We had our breakfast at Starbucks every day and had dinner twice at the Noodlehouse. In our view, there is really nothing to improve for this hotel. Beware that when you arrange airport transfer through the hotel, you are offered the limousine service at 10 times the rate of a normal taxi (250 instead of 25 dirham).

There is a good bar next to the Grill Room just off the lobby with friendly staff and also Vue Bar on the 51st floor where the atmosphere was good despite the cigarette smoke... Leisure facilities are good with a gym and a reasonable sized pool. The area around the pool is fairly small so does become crowded at weekends plus a large proportion of the sitting area falls into shade around 3pm. This is one of two negatives I have about my stay but perhaps its not so important to have a good pool area in a central business hotel. The other negative was that the restaurant stopped serving breakfast on the dot of 10.30am at weekends. I was told that the reason was that brunch needed to be set up and this starts at 12pm. As Dubai brunches are usually fairly boozy and as after a week of work not everyone wants to have weekend breakfast at 10am this is not ideal. I stayed in a deluxe room which was perfectly adequate.

Internet access which gave me a great office to work from whilst there! We had free access to the (well equipped) gym, sauna/steam rooms, and the pool area (outdoors) had many comfortable sun loungers. The pool itself was refreshing and immaculate and there was also a large jacuzzi (for anyone who finds 37 degree heat a little too chilly!) There were two lifeguards at all times, a separate children's pool and a poolside bar. The bar staff would also come around on the hotter days with cold towels, free crushed ice drinks and occasional fresh fruit skewers! The only downside to this great pool scene is there is no separate way of getting to the pool other than getting the lifts through the main reception area, which means you have to dress very conservatively over your bikini/shorts as you tend to ride the same (glass!) lifts with the Emirate Sheiks and western business people! (Many business meetings are held in the reception area). For the business traveller there are a couple of things to note. For some reason they do not have an iron/ironing board available in the rooms and room service for this can take some time to deliver. Also breakfast is NOT included with this Deluxe room type and is approximately $45.00 AUD if you choose to eat in the hotel. There is, however, a Gloria Jeans coffee shop in the shopping area beneath the Emirates which is a little less heavy on the budget. Also beneath the hotel are many restaurants (not cheap, but beautiful food) and a bar, Scarletts, which seemed to serve the cheapest drinks ($18 average for a white wine!) However, you are permitted 4 litres to take into Dubai which is good to have for the room! All in all, an amazing experience and we will certainly return.", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doha", "Title": "\u201cBest Business Hotel in the World\u201d", "Author": "PrakashTilokani", "ReviewID": "UR19999844", "Content": "The Emirates tower has to be without doubt the best business hotel in the world.

Paid about GBP\u00a3160 ex. breakfast, which is great for a hotel like this. This is a pretty good business hotel. I just had a standard room, but it was spacious and decently equipped etc. D\u00e9cor is a little odd in the rooms - funny long blue sofa and carpet make me think it could do with a refresh. Feels a bit mid-90s. No LCD or Plasma, just a standard TV. Deep tub in the bathroom, large separate shower cubicle. Room service food was great - ordered a few times, arrived promptly. Business centre wasn't bad - expensive and service sometimes slow, but they did everything I asked them to do and got it all right. Pool area was excellent - not crowded at all, because this is primarily a business hotel (and maybe also because it was June\u2026). Lifeguards stood around and had very little to do. Nice cold towels and free slushy drinks. Gym isn't bad; reasonably sized and has an ok selection of free weights - for a hotel (up to about 20 or 25kgs if I remember rightly). The attached shopping mall is filled with all sorts of designer stores, most of which can be found cheaper in London etc, but there are also a bunch of restaurants worth checking out. Went to the teppanyaki place - quite nice. Also tried the bar at the top of the hotel - again, not bad. Ground floor bar also alright. Other places to eat - try the Madinat Jumeirah, which is another hotel belonging to the same chain. Quite touristy and designed as a sort of fake ancient city, but loads of bars and restaurants. Used the airport pickup and drop-off service - great BMW 7 series both times. If I'd known, I would have opted for the enhanced pickup service which I think actually meets you as soon as you get off the plane, rather than the normal one, which meets you kind of halfway between the plane and passport control. Keep an eye on the booking for the drop-off on the return journey - I think the hotel tends not to actually confirm anything with the guest; you need to call them and re-book the drop-off, just to be safe. Overall, definitely recommended for business. Bit of an odd choice if you're on holiday, but if you managed to get a good rate, I could kind of see it. Location alright - about 20 minutes to the Mall of the Emirates. Worth getting the concierge to book a car if you're planning a night out, as the queue gets fairly long at times (and it's so hot waiting outside).", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201coddest and most annoying security policy!\u201d", "Author": "Metrosexual27", "ReviewID": "UR17829264", "Content": "I stayed in Emirates Towers for 4 nights last week both for business and pleasure on the Club Level, floor 45. The most annoying and oddest policy I noticed (compared to many other 5 Start Hotels I tried in my life) is that they have a policy that you can NOT take a friend or guest of yours to your room! He/she can NOT come by him/her self to the room as lifts only work with your room key. Even worse, if you insist that you want your friend or relative or whoever to come to your room and that you are happy to escort him/her, then he/she has to provide an ID to the reception and they would copy it and ONLY then he/she can come up to the room. And every time you use the lifts you will notice a security guy standing 24 hours asking you what room you intend to go and then he looks up your room number from a list of last names he has on a paper! Something I would say time consuming and strange security policy I have not seen before. I do NOT recommend this hotel for business if you are put in situations where you need to meet colleagues in your room or the lounge of the Club Rooms.

We were quickly assisted at the check-in desk and promptly escorted to our room, 2801. The d\u00e9cor is modern but very comfortable. The bed, with nightstands on both sides, is very comfy and the linens very good quality. There\u2019s a cool sofa in front of the window, a large desk and lots of closet space with a safe and coffee/tea maker. Several complimentary bottles of water were replenished each day. The bathroom is extraordinary, with a large marble/glass shower, cool fixtures, and oh what a tub. The amenities are masculine and there\u2019s even bath salt. (There\u2019s a menu of spa-like bath treatments that they\u2019ll prepare in your tub.) The towels, bathrobes, and slippers are nice. We got a good night sleep but woke early (time zone effects). We could see the camel race track, the towering Burj and other sleek skyscrapers. The breakfast buffet is elaborate, there\u2019s way too much to be able to try it all. After breakfast, we got some info from the concierge and headed to Diera part of Dubai. Once we got over-heated, we came back to the Towers and caught the shuttle over to Wild Wadi Water Park. Guests of Jumeirah hotels are admitted for free. It was quite an experience to see the diversity of the crowd, everything from bikini clad Europeans to completely covered in black local women! There\u2019s a great spot to relax and watch the sun set behind the Burj Al Arab hotel. The Jumeirah hotel company employees are so well trained in providing excellent service. At the hotel, I asked an employee how to get to one of the restaurants\u2026they walked me all the way! Each employee greets you and does their best to help. The following 2 days were also great. Our room was serviced twice a day. The hotel seemed busy with mostly business travelers, yet we felt welcome as leisure travelers. The only thing to complain about is the internet service. There\u2019s no wifi in the rooms and there\u2019s a fee to use the business center. We strongly recommend the Jumeirah hotels.

Flew with Emirates via Kuoni. This was the second part of the honeymoon and we flew in from The Maldives, but we flew with Emirates the whole trip and totally recommend them. Due to the flight timings we arrived at the hotel at 6am, with a usual check in time of 3pm! However, we checked in and were told our room would be ready as soon as possible, and we got it about 1130 so although a long wait it could have been worse. As it was a honeymoon, we got a free upgrade to a suite(!) so we can't comment on the standards of the standard rooms, but I can't imagine for a minute that they aren't just a superb as the suites just smaller. Breakfast was in the Moasica Restaurant and was a buffet, but what a buffet!! Everything from traditional fry-up, to smoked trout and salmon, fresh fruit, cold meats, wonderful bread, cereals, basically anything you could want for breakfast and totally fresh. We didn't eat main meals in the restaurant but there are several to choose from, and not too badly priced. We did have room service which was superb and again not excessively priced. The views from the glass lifts and the bar on the 51st floor were amazing. The staff were perfect, always willing to help but never bothering you, they just seemd to 'be there' when you needed them. Of course, this hotel is mainly a business hotel and while it's worth going to say you've been there it's not a first choice for a romantic break but for luxury, it's perfect. A few tips: as a guest of the hotel you get free admission to the Wild Wadi Water park (saving 25GBP/50USD per adult) and there is a free courtesy bus to get you there and back. Also, if you want to go and have a look round the Burl-al-Arab, the 7* hotel, you usually have to go on a guided tour including tea at about 40GBP per person and your tour rep will tell you that is the only way you can go in. However, as a guest of the ET (which is part of the same group) just ask them to book you in a tour which is free and while the times are fixed (9-10am, 5-6pm 11pm-midnight) you see more (including a 3 bedroom suite on the top floor) than you would on a proper tour (which only goes to the public areas). It's def worth a look round. Our excursions worth going on are the 'Dubai nights' which included dinner and the revolving restaurant at the Hyatt Dubai, giving great views, and also the Dhow dinner cruise on the Dubai Creek..... both include dinner and only work out about twice the cost of eating in the hotel anyway..... Also good is the city tour on a open topped bus... Finally, don't walk anywhere it's too damn hot and taxis are so cheap..... our 30 min ride back from the Burj only cost 4GBP Any Q's just ask simon.wilding@tesco.net colchester, UK", "Date": "July 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham UK", "Title": "\u201cProfessional and Slick\u201d", "Author": "Big_Daddy_Si", "ReviewID": "UR8064561", "Content": "Stayed at the Emirates Towers for 4 nights in May 2007 - I found an excellent rate direct on the Hotel's own web site of around \u00a3115 per night (including all taxes) for 2 people which included breakfast at the hotel.
