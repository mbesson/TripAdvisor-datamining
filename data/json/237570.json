Our room was not huge but perfectly adequate - you spend more time outside than in in Amsterdam ! Very clean, comfortable beds, nice view over the Herengracht, not noisy. The reception was friendly, if not smiling, but really helpful when it came to dealing with our car, for example. The breakfast was simple but, again perfectly adequate. So all in all, nothing negative here, with the big pluses of its location, very near the centre, and the price, more than reasonable. Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cA perfect located hotel\u201d", "Author": "katizza", "ReviewID": "UR126030795", "Content": "We just got back from Amsterdam and we stayed in a very lovely hotel, right on one of the most beautiful canals (Herengracht) in one of the most charming cities of Europe! The hotel has been freshly renovated - we were the first ones to stay in the room. At first we were concerned about the paint smell but the friendly Brazilian at the desk counter told us that the hotel had been very careful in picking paint that is not toxic. He promised we wouldn't wake up with a headache! Indeed we didn't! Actually, we had a great night's sleep, the beds were comfortable (twin beds), the room was silent (window facing the canal) and the sheets were super clean! The shower/bathroom are in the room and despite the small size, it has the newest technology ( you can regulate the water temperature!). We didn't have breakfast because it wasn't included in our rate. You can pay extra for breakfast but honestly there are so many nice cafes on the canals, that you might as well walk 5 minutes and enjoy a quiet breakfast on a picturesque bridge. I strongly recommend this hotel, a hidden treasure in downtown amsterdam. And for those who complain that the staircases are narrow and steep, don't bother going to Amsterdam then!! Staircases are steep in every house, hotel or shop and it's part of this city's personality. One last technical remark: the hotel rooms have nice wooden floors (no carpet)", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cGood for the price and the location\u201d", "Author": "hdempsey", "ReviewID": "UR121338179", "Content": "Great location, clean hotel, satisfactory breakfast.

The breakfast was good - they make a decent coffee and there was a good selection of food with plenty to eat. I was up on the top floor which was a bit of a haul and I was stuck between two other rooms with paper thin walls - screaming baby for two nights, followed by couple talking until 2 am, following by couple arguing in Spanish until I knocked on their door at midnight - so your sleep will be affected by how polite your neighbours are. My room itself was neat and bijou - 6' by 9' with a sink. Toilet across the hall, shower downstairs. The Dutch really know how to squeeze in a toilet and I found not only here but all over that you had to be careful not to trail your clothing in the toilet! The location of the hotel is grand - a pretty straight shot to the Dam, not far from Bijbels with its peaceful garden, and the Herengraacht area is beautiful. I also love cats so a friendly Maine Coon named Othello tops the bill - you are also not far from the Katten Kabinet if that is your thing.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLocation very good, but average hotel\u201d", "Author": "saltwaterrain", "ReviewID": "UR118067380", "Content": "I found this hotel to be average, it was clean and had everything we needed for one night, but it was over priced! The location is the best thing about the hotel, it is in walking distance to all the main attractions of Amsterdam. I expected a better hotel for what we paid, but I am guessing we were paying for the location. The stairs are very steep, which I was aware of before staying so it is something to take into consideration when booking. The man on the front desk was not very friendly at all.
