Arrived late and parked in the basement car park before checking in. First impressions of the car park were poor, it is full of leaves and windblown debris and feels rather unused, but the hotel reception and common areas were both contemporary and attractive. Check in was quick although the Friday night music in the adjoining bar was so loud that the receptionist had trouble making herself heard. Our room was on the first floor facing the High Road and well insulated from both traffic and the noisy music in the bar, it was very attractive with two wardrobes and a large bathroom. Unfortunately the bathroom lighting foxed us for a while and we spent our first 24 hours washing in very low light. Eventually we figured out that the lightswitch also acted as a dimmer and you increase the brightness by holding it down. We did not have breakfast or use the restaurant during our stay so cannot comment on the food. We would have used the bar but the music was too loud for conversation so we headed up the High Road instead. Gunnersbury tube is very close although note that services to this station are more limited than on other parts of the tube system. Bit of a mix up at checkout as we had not got a parking ticket when we drove in. Parking is \u00a312.50 per 24 hours so allow for this when you are looking at the room rates. We would go back if the room rates are reasonable as the accommodation is very nice but shame they don't control the volume more in the bar as we would like to have used this.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "birmingham", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Paddy's\u201d", "Author": "fatron", "ReviewID": "UR126315311", "Content": "Stayed for single saturday night on St Patricks day.

It's very close to the tube station and an easy half hour journey in, enabling us to see the sights but stay in a far more comfortable hotel than we'd have got for the price in central London itself. It's also close to the London Science and Natural History museums, and Kew Gardens is just a nice stroll down the river path. We'd booked 3 standard rooms but were upgraded to deluxe, which was an unexpected bonus. The bath is to die for, simply huge and so luxurious. There was also a big shower cubicle. The chaise longue in our rooms was a nice extra touch. Customer service was great- we had a few minor requests re heating controls and bathroom fans which were swiftly and courteously attended to. Take your own bottle of water - the ones in the room are \u00a33.50 each! We liked the fact that the day tube travel cards are valid on buses too. There is a very frequent bus service down the High Street and the bus stops just outside the hotel. Rather than eat out in the centre, we caught the bus down the high street where there is a great choice of restaurants- we went to Pizza Express but there is also Cafe Rouge and lots others. The bus also goes to White City/ Shepherd's Bush where there is an excellent Westfield Shopping Centre, which our teenage girls simply loved. Just a short bus journey away! The only slight disappointment was that the hotel website said it was possible to buy day passes to Esporta Health Club at reduced rates, so we all took our costumes as we planned to fit in a swim. The deal no longer applies and we felt that the website should have been amended to say so, as that was one of the reasons we chose the hotel.

I asked for somewhere near Heathrow, with good access to the centre of London. Chiswick Moran hotel is in Zone 3, so people who need to get there by train as I did would need to buy the more expensive travel card. The hotel is very close to the station (less than a 2 minute walk) but the station itself has no lifts so it can be a pain with luggage. It's on the District Line, with trains coming normally every 10 minutes or so, though when I was there they were much less frequent. In order to get to Heathrow, you would need to go back to Hammersmith then go back on yourself. I wouldn't say it was convenient. My room was lovely, clean and fresh. The gossip and fashion magazines put out for me were a nice touch. The bathroom was a little weird with its triangular toilet and sink, but overall the room was excellent. I also ordered room service, which came quickly, was good value for money and tasty. The area around the hotel seemed pretty safe, and it was quite quiet too. When I booked, I was told that there was free internet, which was great because I had a bit of work to do during my stay. When I turned on my laptop I was told that the internet in my room costs 15 pounds a day. I needed to use it, so paid out. When I when to the main desk, I asked the girl there about the advertised free internet. She told me it referred to the one public computer in the corner. I replied that they might want to re-word their description on the website, to which she gave me a somewhat sassy reply and said that since the public computer was free, it's ok. As I left the hotel on my last day (after 2 nights), I decided to use the public computer as it had a printer. I was told to insert coins into the machine in order to use the computer. I don't mind paying for internet - though 15 pounds a day for wireless and 1 pound for 10 minutes on a public computer is extremely expensive - but the false advertising and the sass from the girl at the desk really made me mad.

Upon checking in I noticed personal details of other guest all over reception, including room numbers, not clever! When I entered my room on the top floor I was pleased with the layout and space within the room. There was a modern roll top bath and a separate walk in shower cubical. Whilst taking a shower on the first night I was horrified to find body hair on the tiles of the shower cubical (photos attached). It was late and I just wanted to get to sleep as I had a 9am start on a Monday morning.

When you\u2019re paying \u00a3100+ per night in a central London Hotel I have high expectations, however as I said, it was late and a few body hairs and short and curlys wasn\u2019t going to kill me so I made sure the left hand side of the bed was clean and went to sleep. After breakfast on a Monday morning I requested to speak to the manager and out came this short guy who was the duty manager. Having explained to him my huge disappointment of finding body hair in the bed and in the shower he apologized profusely and assured me that my room would be cleaned thoroughly. I returned back at the hotel on that Monday evening from a day\u2019s training course and went to my room. I checked the shower and the hair was still there, in exactly the same place but I was so angry that I forgot to check the bed and went straight down and complained again to another so called duty manager. She said she would get my bathroom cleaned whilst I waited in reception. The shower was cleaned as I checked it before I went down for dinner. However when I retired for the evening at 10:45 I was shocked to discover there was still hair in my bed which clearly wasn\u2019t mine. I called down and complained again and demanded to speak to the duty manager. Initially I was told she was off duty and had left and then if by magic she had reappeared. I insisted she came to my room so she could see for herself the hair in my bed. I checked out in the morning and refused to pay the invoice for the two nights stay.

Secondly, personal opinion, a triangular basin looks fab, but if you can barely get your hands under the tap what's the point?! I would also say the shower is okay, but doesn't give you much space as the bath is quite narrow. This would probably not bother some. Finally, breakfast. A complimentary continental is no problem, but having to get your own tea and coffee when there are staff hanging around is quite irritating, even more so when the hot water runs out and isn't replenished despite being asked! The selection of bread is awful (sliced bread - white and wholemeal does not count as a selection) and the pastries are too small.

Because of this we stayed in Chiswick sunday night, found a great pub called the Pilot by the way, and most of monday until we ventured into London to see Oliver, which took 50 mins each way.

My boyfriend rung on Thursday morning to ask for the room to have roses in our room as a Valentines present. The staff member, named R Duggal, said he would do this. My boyfriend called to check on Friday evening that this had been done- and it hadn't. By this time it was too late for him to order more roses. The staff member he spoke to was very rude and unapologetic. I consider this completely unacceptable. Not only did a staff member fail to carry out the request, but then to be spoken to so rudely is beyond unacceptable. Moreover, if my boyfriend hadn't rung to check- there is no way he would've known that there were no roses waiting in our room. This was deeply dissapointing for me and I hope the staff members know how much they have dissapointed both me and my boyfriend. Overall, I enjoyed my stay- I thought the price was very good for the quality of the hotel. We also paid extra for passes to the health club down the road which was excellent and great value. I was also very pleased with the standard of food in the Globe Bar. Most staff members were excellent but I'm afraid the whole stay was tinted with the dissapointing turn of events my boyfriend had experiened. I hope the manager will make sure these staff members are reprimanded for their poor service and understand that failing to do this made me and my boyfriend very unhappy.

The hotel is situated about 3 mins away away from Gunnersbury station and ideally positioned just a few hundred yards outside of the Congestion charging zone! The train into central London takes about 15/20mins- we found it quickest to change trains at Hammersmith to join the underground lines. The hotel itself is bright and modern and easily accessible. Check in is advertised as beginning from 2pm although we were able to obtain a room at approx 12:30pm having arrived earlier than intended. We were allocated a room on the second floor and were amazed by spacious layout. The room was brightly decorated in keeping the the modern feel of the hotel. The bathroom was a fantastic size with a separate bath and shower unit. Our room was equipped with LCD tv (on a swivel platform allowing you to move it closer to the bed), wireless internet access and for the ladies, a decent hairdryer that actually dries hair! The bed was huge and extremely comfortable! Whilst there is very little noise from the road opposite or other guests next door, we were aware of the music being played very loudly in the bar below until about 12:30am-not something that caused concern for us but may affect those with an early start. Breakfast ran between 07:00 and 10:30 and charged at \u00a310 for a Full Irish breakfast (cooked to order) and \u00a38.95 for a Continental breakfast. The hotel offers onsite car parking which is detailed in the welcome pack as \u00a320 for 24 hours. As mentioned in other reviews, this is reduced to \u00a310 for hotel residents if the ticket is validated on checking out. All in all a very pleasant stay and very difficult to find fault!

The Chiswick Moran Hotel is a four star hotel right by Gunnersbury tube station. Gunnersbury is on the District line to Richmond, and it takes about 20 minutes to get to Victoria tube station in central London. Upon arrival on my first stay I was upgraded to an executive room. The room, and especially the bathroom, was spacious and very light and airy. There was a full-size bathtub on one side of the bathroom, and a shower the size of the tub on the opposite side of the bathroom. In addition to the regular hotel room features, I liked that they had a card on the bedside table that said that they would bring you new books from a selection of bestsellers to read if you\u2019d finished yours. Great idea! The bathroom had a really cool window/light, which was very much in keeping with the general design of the hotel. Let me add that even though this is a hotel that places great emphasis on design, it doesn\u2019t sacrifice comfort. The room had all the amenities you could wish for, except for a refrigerator and free internet access (I think it\u2019s tacky when hotels make you pay for internet access). Even though the room faced the street, I could not hear any noise. On my second stay I was told that they would have upgraded me to an executive room if they had had any available. I adore that the hotel is so nice to their guests. It seems to me that they want their guests to have the best stay possible, and if they have a better category room available during your stay, they just might upgrade you. That\u2019s very good customer service. I was given one of their regular rooms, and was allowed to choose the color design of the room I was going to stay in. I chose a blue room, which was beautiful. The bathroom was the same huge size as the bathroom in the executive room, but it did not have a waterfall showerhead. I do not remember if the executive room had hair conditioner, but I sure missed that on my second stay. The room was smaller than the executive room, and it did not have fresh flowers or a card offering new books (although there\u2019s a selection of constantly changing newspapers and magazines for you in the lobby to take to your room). It was never the less a great room. Breakfast was wonderful. There was a great selection of fruit (that had gotten even better on my second stay), bread, pastries, and a full Irish breakfast. On weekends there\u2019s a hot buffet as well as the cold buffet, on weekdays there\u2019s only a cold buffet, but seeing as they cook whatever you want, you still get the same selection all through the week. On my first stay I had some communication problems because some breakfast staff members didn\u2019t speak English very well. I\u2019m happy to report that the same members of staff had improved their English considerably half a year later. The gym has all the necessary equipment you would need to keep up your work out routine while travelling. It\u2019s not very big, but it\u2019s got one of every type of cardio machine, and an ok selection of weights. I was the only one using the gym while I was there. There is some room for improvement in a few areas: The staff is very knowledgeable about the hotel, but not about its surroundings. They\u2019re very helpful, and they will do their best to look up the answer in their folder, but I think maybe they ought to be taken on a field trip to the nearby area to see where the restaurants are, what type of food they serve, which buses leave from right outside the hotel and where they take you to, where the closest drugstore is and when it closes, etc. I really wish the hotel had a computer available for guests to use or a business center. The staff is very friendly and they do try their best to help, but when you have to spell Tower of London as they\u2019ve never heard of it before, you don\u2019t really bother asking for their help. The staff members should also take more initiative. For instance on my first stay, the hotel didn\u2019t have any adapters left, so I think a member of staff should have gone to Boots and bought a bunch of \u00a33 adapters to lend out to guests. This seems to me to be a hotel that\u2019s very interested in having satisfied guests. Judging from the improvements I noticed from my first to my second stay, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s only a matter of weeks before it will be impossible to fault this hotel. I\u2019m pretty sure that this is the best value hotel in London. I love it. It\u2019s got lots of cool design, yet it\u2019s very homey and cozy, and you\u2019re very well taken care of.

The following morning ( Sunday) we made our way into the restaurant and were politely greeted by a very curteous and kind young man with an Eastern European accent, who explained to us how the restaurant buffet worked and showed us to a vacant table. The breakfast buffet was of very good quality and replenished continuously. We thouroughly enjoyed our breakfast and the atmosphere in the breakfast room was friendly and welcoming, even though it was busy. I was very impressed with the hotel and the amount of wonderful courteous staff who attended and helped us. Unfortunately this wonderful experience came to an abrupt end the minute we made the aquaintance of the assistant restaurant manager Mark This man greeted us on the Monday morning ( 3rd Nov) by asking our room number and when given stated : You don\u00b4t have breakfast included do you? When I told him that indeed we did and offered to go upstairs to look for our email confirmation, he very charmingly said GOOD GRIEF, where I AM SORRY, would have been more appropriate and then started fiddling with what looked like a printed out list of room numbers and said GOOD GRIEF yet again, before waiving us through to the breakfast room. Then we sat down and shortly after the same man returned to our table with menus, telling us that indeed we only had continental breakfast included and had to pay for warm in case we wanted any. I just said OK fine, we just have continental to the waitress, when MARK returned yet again, saying we could after all have the warm breakfast included. Now I was a little confused.What is going on? I told him, that we already had breakfast here the previous morning and no one had stopped us telling us we couldn\u00b4t eat, so he just said : Don\u00b4t worry, I am not going to charge you for yesterdays\u00b4breakfast!!!!!! This was entirely unnecessary and left me feeling irritated. Then MARK told us again that we were only entitled to contintnental due to a new rule. Now I was just a little puzzled and MARK proceeded to explain to me that once supplier had a new rule and bookings made through them only had continental breakfast from now on. This is all very nice, but WE DIDN`T book through this particular supplier, we booked through Alpharooms, which I pointed out to him. He wasted a few minutes asking me numerous times if I was sure that I booked through Alpharooms and not ( somehting TRAVEL) and GOOD GRIEF was uttered a few times as well.this was accomanied by him rifling through his list of room numbers and rolling his eyes dramatically. By now I felt far from welcome and a little annoyed to be made such a show of in front of all the other guests, looking like I wanted to steal something which I am not entitled to, so I went upstairs and returned with my email confirmation, which I showed to Mark. He read it and then said Good Grief, rifling through the list once more, letting me stand there whilst he went to make a phone call and then returned with another look into the list of room numbers and another Good GRIEF, before he said ok we could now go ahead and order the warm breakfast. We did and when we were about half done eating, MARK returned to the table stood there looming over us and said: OK I just checked and you only were supposed to have had the continental! With that said I was now furious....Can this man not leave things alone!? What did he want me to do now I am half done eating my eggs??? Does he want them back!? Everyone around us was now sniggering and enjoying the scene. I felt like an extra in FAWLTY TOWERS and half expected Basil Fawlty to make an appearance. I felt anger creeping up me, but I am not going to make a scene, so I chose to get up,leaving my half eaten breakfast and walked out, I travel a lot ( business as well as pleasure) and I have to say that in the whole 15 years of frequent travel, I have never felt less welcome by this one individual. This gentleman should be redistributed to another department, where customer contact is not one of his duties. When I travel in my spare time I expect to be able to relax and be treated with respect not having my blood pressure raised. Once again I would like to stress, that EVERYONE else working there has been absolutely delightful and curteous and that the hotel is modern, beautifully furnished in a modern 70\u00b4s twist style and spotlessly clean.

Got a great rate through alpharooms. The hotel is really nice, both decor and comfort. We really loved the big walk-in rain shower in the bathroom as well as the big 2 person tub. The bed is possibly one of the comfiest ive ever slept in. The Gunnersby tube is about 5 mins walk away, with a journey of approx 30 mins to Central London. This we found took the good out of our day, especially if the tube was running slow. The Bar is very nice but the selection of draught beer available would need to be looked at, as no Heineken or Carlsberg on tap. It is the first place in London where i have failed to get either on tap. The Aircon controls in room are a bit fiddly but once you get the hang of it, is really nice to have it during the night if the room gets too muggy. We stayed on the top floor and were woken each night by pigoens on the roof, and outside the window, so request a room lower down. The Breakfast was ok but nothing worth writing home about. On the Sunday Morning it was Buffet and the Monday Table Service. We had booked a full breakfast as part of our booking by alpharooms, but when we went down for breakfast first morning we were told that we could only have continental. On explaining that we had booked with a Hot breakfast, the head waiter said no problem go and enjoy your hot breakfast. However we had to go through the whole process again the second morning with another waiter, but once again he did not make a big deal about it. Just a tip for the Hotel Cooks / Chefs - lads rashers should be soft and tender not hard and chewy, obviously they had been in a holding cabinet or something. Housekeeping made up our room, replinished our sugar, coffee and milk on our tray but left our dirty cups, i ask why? All considered it is still a nice hotel, in a nice area, but a bit too far out of London for my liking. However the comfy bed and large bath made up for that.

Unable to book there mid-week, we chose the Moran with one eye on reviews here and the words on the hotel's website. I like Chiswick having worked and stayed in the area many years ago; the Moran is easy to find [from Gunnersbury station; District line] and looks good from outside and in reception. Check in process good, we were allocated a room on the 6th floor at the front which reeked of smoke, the whole floor being designated a Smoking area. Reception happily re-allocated a No Smoking room [as we had requested on our booking] but it was at the rear on the first floor and had a full height wall about 5 feet from the window, so absolutely no view, at all. Not even a glimpse of sky. We went out to a concert at the RAH and returned about 11pm to have a drink in the Bar, where the music was deafening [see other reviews] - but the worst thing was as I told my wife I had seen a mouse run across the floor, she accused me of having \"one too many\" - but I was only on my first drink. Anyway, while we watched both of us saw the mouse, or mice, happliy scurrying too and fro across the bar floor. I wonder what cleanliness is like elsewhere in the establishment. Anyway, off to our room. Ring downstairs to ask for the Hospitality Tray to be replenished - \"no problem\" says the Receptionist but NO ACTION 45 mins later when we went to bed. Only to be awoken about 6am by more loud music which we eventually traced to the public seating area just inside the front door of the hotel and clearly heard in Room 129. Now - one of the chores in the morning for men is to shave! And now the great shaver socket hunt begins. I won't bore you with all the details, suffice it to say - there isn't one. I ring down to Reception to ask where the shaver socket is as most males I know expect to find one in a modern hotel room. The Receptionist has to refer to someone else and then replies \"it's in the room\" - I was a little grumpy by this time and asked \"precisely where\" so more reference to someone else brought the reply \"we will bring up an adaptor\". And they did. Now we may have had the only room in the hotel without a view and without a shaver socket - but I suggest you take your own adaptor if you stay at the Moran. Unless you don't shave.

Finally, there were stains on the thick shag carpet in the room. The pillows were hard. And the movies on demand did not work. The worst thing was that the cool-looking bar downstairs created an unbelievable amount of noise. The management allows them to keep their base music pumping until 1am on Friday and Saturday nights.

Remember when you used to go caravanning and your mum used to open it up 'for a good airing'. That is what this place needs. It's in danger of smelling musty through lack of air and you can't open the windows.

The carpet is really unusual - it's like hay, quite long and tufty but nice under bare feet! The hotel is well situated for those not wanting to venture by car too far into London, just off the M4 and easy to find. You can park your car at the hotel and the Gunnersbury tube is a minutes walk down the road. Have to say that I've not used the tube in London for years and it is vastly improved from what I remember. It used to be like going into the bowels of the earth and always smelt like a public toilet with filthy trains, but every train we caught was new and clean as were the stations. Anyway, back to the hotel - room was clean, bright , quiet and spacious with a great double shower and good quality beds and linen. Only slight disappointment (and this is being picky) is that there weren't any complimentary biscuits to go with your cup of tea! Breakfast was also good, plenty of choice with attentive staff, and you could settle down and read your complimentary Irish newspaper (Owner is Irish!) at a leisurely pace.

It is small but very nice, with a pretty big bathroom - we had a bath and a walk in shower. The climate was set to 25C and it was too hot to sleep. There were no windows and the air-conditioining is blowing directly to your face while in bed. That was a big minus for me. We had a walk in closed but with no shelves, so it kind of hard to unpack your staff, but it wasn't a problem for us. We had a safe and a tee making machine.

To me, it is a perfect retreat in London. It is a couple of minutes walk from the nearest Underground station, and a few minutes from where I used to live in London, in Gunnersbury. It is a four star hotel without relaxation facilities though with a fitness room. I had a four night stay in London, with two nights first in the Crowne Plaza, Docklands, and two nights in this Moran Hotel. I much preferred The Chiswick Moran Hotel to The Crowne Plaza Hotel, Docklands. Even though I had one complimentary night at the The Crowne Plaza Docklands, I still paid over \u00a320 more for the two night Crowne Plaza Hotel stay than for the two nights here, booked through ABA hotels (abahotels.com). Although The Crowne Plaza, Docklands has full leisure facilities, I found I would much rather stay at The Chiswick Moran. I fully recommend The Chiswick Moran. TRY ABAHOTELS.COM. I paid \u00a368 per night for a room for one person which had one area with double bed and comfortable seating and a further, separate area with a single bed and desk and chair. This is one hotel, of only a few, I would pay the hotel's usual rate, which I think is \u00a399 online (more otherwise I believe) for a room for one person. It is good value. As expected, there was a hot drinks tray in the room, a stylish one actually, with safety kettle design. The bathroom was lovely with a large, walk in shower (large round 'monsoon' shower head) and separately, a bath. The restaurant is nice, unpretentious, relaxing and a good place to unwind. The bar I must say is one of the nicer places I have experienced in London. THIS BAR IS WORTH TRAVELLING TO if you are not staying at the hotel. It may seem kind of 'retro' in a seventies style but seems, more than that, very modern and of this decade as much as any. Visit to see. There is free Wi-fi Web network access for guests, also free for visitors to the restaurant aand bar. The bar prices are very good. Also 4 to 7 O' Clock afternoons, excluding Sundays, cocktails are only around \u00a33.50 (I can't remember the exact price.) This was refreshing coming from The Crowne Plaza where, away out near furthest South East London, beyond Canary Wharf, cocktails were \u00a38 a time. Room Web network access is by cable and is not free, though you can pay by half hour or hour rather than by day if you like, which is good, and not so common for four star hotels who often charge only a 24 hour rate. Looking at the photos of rooms taken by other guests on Trip Advisor , I think the room I had was best for me, in subtle dark and light greens and white and mauve, and thick, dangle pile carpets. I thought it was the nicest design room I'd had for ages. I really relaxed. (I actually had gotten sick in The Crowne Plaza, then when I needed to go out, I spent all night in a Central London dance club on my second night, though the garish red and brown decor at that hotel had gradually made me ill anyway.) Staying at The Chiswick Moran really was a tonic. It is a lovely area to stay in, though in the immediate vicinity, not offering attractions beyond a shop and take-aways. It is an extra 15 to 20 minutes on the underground to Victoria than if you were staying in Chelsea or Kensington. For me it is very worth this. The hotel is in relatively quiet Gunnersbury which is at the end of Chiswick, and excellently placed for the huge Gunnersbury Park (lovely, really recommended for any time in London). There is a very small nature reserve, The Gunnersbury Triangle also, worth walking through and sitting in, not far from the hotel, entrance by Chiswick Park underground station. What's more, Richmond is a quite short train journey from Gunnersbury station, also Richmond Park. Kingston is a bus ride from there. I happened to have some special views on suburban London with lovely greenery in the back gardens on the road the window looked onto. Shopping, eating and drinking is good in and around Chiswick High Road, one to two stops on the train, or get on a bus from a stop near the hotel, no extra if you have a one day London Travelcard for your underground train journeys. For me, I would very often prefer to go drinking, and eating, in some of the stylish places in Chiswick, than bother trying to find two or three places in the evening in more Central London. And at least one day of any two day stay, I would be very happy to stay in this lovely hotel for refreshment, sustenance, and pleasure. There is further relaxing lobby seating on the first floor, looking down onto the entrance. For excellently priced car rental near the hotel, there is Aim (aimrentacar.com). They offer very nearly the best rates in London, perhaps Easycar aside, and you can pick up from their branch near the hotel at Chiswick Park station, at Gatwick or Heathrow airports, or delivery to any London location (I don't think to Stansted or Luton airports, though you can check).", "Date": "December 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in West London\u201d", "Author": "Polarbjorn", "ReviewID": "UR11227626", "Content": "Due to bad weather I ended up staying an extra night in London.

Pros: - comfortable bed - spacious bathroom Cons: - windows didn't open - view was ok but hard to see through dirty windows - breakfast was standard, but the coffee not good at all and some of the staff quite unfriendly - lighting in bathroom very dim - light hanging over desk that we kept banging our heads on - the internet costs were very expensive (we have just moved to another hotel where they charge 5 pounds for 3 days - at the Chiswick Moran they charge 5 pounds for an hour) -reception staff seemed unable to help with our internet queries as their command of english was limited -shag carpet had quite a few stains on it - mirror on bathroom door looks like someone is in the bathroom if you walk in at night with out turning on lights!! can give quite a fright! A trip to Richmond only 2 stops on the underground, is highly recommended - lots of lovely shops and restaurants and very pleasant walking along the river.", "Date": "September 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Location\u201d", "Author": "JbugBoston", "ReviewID": "UR8659056", "Content": "I was here on business for a week recently and had an opportunity to stay over the weekend. The location of this hotel could not have been better as I was working with a company on Power Road (next to the hotel). It doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside the hotel has a really neat retro style, very clean, comfortable and fairly quiet. You can tell some interior design went into this hotel from the rain showers to the funky lights. The staff is extremely helpful and very nice, and the room is big for a London hotel (especially the ones in town that cost more than this one). The ample breakfast provided with the room is a huge cost saver as well as you have a choice of a full hot breakfast or their continental buffet The location is also good since both the tube (Gunnesbury) is right across the street and the bus stops right in front of the hotel. These buses can take you to Syon House, Kew, and Hampton Court, all are worth a visit and this is the less expensive way of seeing them if you can take short walks after the bus stops. Tube rides to London is great as this is the District line where some of the major attractions are within a short walk like Tower Hill. It's about 25 mins to Victoria station, watch out for weekend tube work as it may mean you'll have to make some different connections but it still gets you there fairly easily. Rides to and from the airport (LHR) are less expensive than if you had to go all the way into town as it is right between LHR and downtown London. Definitely would stay here again.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Forfar, Scotland", "Title": "\u201c1st Class\u201d", "Author": "TheWeeMacs", "ReviewID": "UR8442386", "Content": "Just back from the Chiswick Moran 10th - 13th August. This was a trip to London for my daughter's 18th, and so we had her and her sister and two other young ladies who were friends of the girls. In all we had 1 x double and 2 x twin rooms. The rooms were lovely and spotlessly clean. We had a bed & breakfast deal and so the early morning meal was a nice way to set us up for the rest of the day out and about in London !! (As an aside Wicked was, well, wicked, and Avenue Q was very good too). Back to the hotel, the staff were most friendly and when one of the girls couldn't open her safe the engineer was there within 5 minutes and had the matter resolved. For the evening, drinks not too pricey and room service which we had in the lounge one night was quick and tasty, and not too dear. For people coming from Gunnersbury Tube Station, turn left as you go through the barrier and you are just about 250 yards from the hotel which is on the right side of the road, so you'll have to cross over.
