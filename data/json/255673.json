I noticed that this hotel is getting beat up on Tripadvisor for having old rooms. We also stayed in an unrenovated room and I thought that people have really overlooked the other positive attributes of the hotel and have fixated too much on the age of the room. I really loved our stay there for the following reaons: 1. Room was very large with an expansive view of Hyde Park. One of the best locations in Sydney. Room also had a large sofa with coffee table, which was useful. The sink, microwave and a set of dishes also made it possible to eat in on occasions, thereby helping to save money in a very expensive city. 2. Room had a large bathroom with the biggest bathtub I have ever seen. 3. Location is great as mentioned by many others. Oxford Street is just behind the hotel for quick bites and some shopping. Just about all the major attractions are within walking distance such as Circular Quay, Botanic Gardens, the Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge, Darling Harbour etc. The subway to the airport and elsewhere is just 100meters across the street. 4. The pool and jacuzzi on the rooftop is just fabulous. The views from there were amazing and very few people compete with you for these facilities. 5. The staff were extremely helpful and accomodated all requests, including a late checkout. The only drawback is that the rooms are a little old now but I understand a refurbishment programme is underway.

While the hotel is in a great location for Sydney - across the road from Hyde Park and within walking distance of lots of attractions - the hotel itself could do with a makeover. Wallpaper was falling off walls in the corridors and the lifts were slow and inadequate. One feature that was particularly disappointing for me was the pool area. The area itself has magnificent views out across the city and is an absolute attraction to the hotel in its own right. Unfortunately though there is zero shade provided by the hotel so as a result you can't spend a lot of time enjoying the space and it becomes very crowded later in the afternoon when the sun is less intense. Perhaps it was because it was a weekend and there could have been a lot of local tourists but I found it disappointing as I really wanted to enjoy the view and that was what attracted me to the hotel in the first place. On the flipside, my room was very comfortable. The bed was amazingly comfy and I had a small sitting area with a couch so I could look out over the city. My room also had a kitchenette panel with a microwave and a sink which would be very handy for anyone wanting to self cater. The bathroom was great too - very big with ample bench space.

I was delighted that I had been upgraded to a King Executive room, which has outstanding views of Hyde Park and the city, very large rooms with a cosy sofa and stunning bathrooms. The room have been recently refurbished, so the presentation was immaculate and d\u00c3\u00a9cor is modern and elegant, larger than many other CBD hotel rooms. The roof top pool has amazing views of Hyde Park, the city CBD and off to the East you can see all the way across Sydney Harbour to the Heads. Marriot has one of the few open air roof top pools. Although the pool is not heated, the temperature was beautiful, and was even comfortable to swim in at night. Plenty of room to sunbake, and relax in comfy laying chairs. Good protection from the wind by the large glass balustrade, and you can also take in surrounding views from the pool. Be sure to save some time to soak in the Spa Bath, which is inside but surrounded by beautiful glass panels, so you can still enjoy the vista of CBD lights. I liked that there is 24 hour access to the pool and spa, which suited me as I had a business function to attend to before getting back to the hotel but still could indulge in soaking in the bubbles before bed. Marriot Mini Bar prices are very reasonable compared to other luxury hotels, and one of only a few that provides a complimentary bottle of water. Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location is superb, especially since you are directly opposite the beautiful Hyde Park, with bus and train stations across the road. You are practically on the doorstep of Oxford Street, so this would be an ideal location to stay for Mardi Gras or for trying the Oxford Street Bars, and Crown Street Restaurants. Its an easy walk across the park to the centre of Sydney CBD. Its also close to Surry Hills and a quick trip to Sydney Central Train station. So the Marriot has a great location for business, shopping, sightseeing, wining and dining. The Executive club has expansive views across Sydney Harbour to the east, and city CBD and Hyde Park views. The club is very good value and is priced better than many other CBD hotels. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a large assortment of Complimentary Drinks, hot and cold food & nibbles in the evening. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fresh and enticing Continental Breakfast in the Exec Club, and a charming way to spend you morning, as you can see boats meander across the harbour. Customer service was consistently friendly, and nothing was too much trouble I fully recommend choosing Marriot as a preferred hotel for visiting Sydney and book a few days so you have time to experience the roof top pool & Spa, along with the sights of Sydney. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to try the restaurant, lobby bar, or gym, but am sure to return to Marriot again.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOK, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE ALOT BETTER\u201d", "Author": "Bambini08", "ReviewID": "UR127065577", "Content": "I just stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a city getaway with my husband and young son. We usually star at The Star, but we wanted to try a different city location (plus Star City's pool is closed, and we always stay in hotels with pools) having said that let me start with the pool. The pool absolutely needs to be drained and fixed, its clean but it has cracks and a lot of missing tiles, its on the rooftop which is nice, but its kinda drab up there, the hot tub has a note stuck on it saying \"if button is broken please call #9 on house phone) which says basically the bubbles don't work and they didn't for us, but we didn't bother to call. The location of the hotel is great, overlooks Hyde Park and is close the restaurants, shops, bars ect. Our room had enough space for the 3 of us and the bathroom was large, the room felt clean, but the wardrobe stunk of someones BO which made us not put our clothes in there. Housekeeping was terrible, the hotel was not full, and each day our room was not cleaned till after 2pm, and I had to ask the housekeepers to do it, both times we went up to the pool so they could, but I must say we went out early and were back after lunch and it was very disappointing to come back to an unmade room. The room service food was awful, I will comment on this in another review, highly priced and bad!!! The Foxtel selections on TV were terrible, for international guests who would like overseas news there was no CNN or American Fox news, they had 3 sports channels and about 4 more very unthought about selections. They did have Nickolodean for the kids. Staff were ok, kinda cold, no warmth as you get in American Hotels. Anyway I will return for the location, and to give the hotel another go, but I won't order room service and I would love to see some work done on the pool area.

It was once I walked into the lift that I found it to be very dated and in desperate need of a refurb! Wood panels and mirrors - not the mod con feel. Upon getting out to my \"upgraded\" room floor I walked out to a fresh smelling floor which was better than the earlier lift experience. It was then that I entered the room and had quite a shock. Considering this was a random night in the city getaway from everyone and have some quiet time alone I wanted it to be slightly more than what I got. The room is set up in quite a strange way where the tv doesn't face the couch, nor the bed, but the balcony/terrace door. I chose to turn it towards the bed as the couch was quite dirty in appearance so it wasn't used at all. The terrace which I had was almost double the size of the room itself as well and felt a little daunting as I wax on the corner of the hallway and there was a door that could lead out to my terrace from there. Needless to say, the furnishings are extremely dated, bathroom tiles and set up very old. The corner bath is very big in comparison to others I have seen and reminded me of the large soaking tubs normally found in the US. Sound proofing should be looked at for the hallways as it was fairly loud out there as well. When Mirvac resumes looking after the property and rebrands I can only hope they complete the refurb as it would be a shame to leave the carpet, yellowing cyrtains and blinds, and the decor as it is. Good points though were the food which was available although the night menu could be expanded slightly. The staff who were attentive and made sure everything needed was taken care of as well.

The reason was proximity to the Art Gallery of NSW for the Picasso Exibition and it was the only hotel in Sydney that had availability at a good price. The reservation was made on the hotel website where we found a cheaper price by joining Marriott Rewards before the booking. The hotel is very close to the Museum train station (turn left when exiting) and the free 555 bus that stops adjacent to the train station. World Square Mono rail (be quick!) station is also less than 5 mins away with connections to Darling Harbour. A small convinience shop is around the back of the hotel of Oxford St and a Subway is 2 mins away on Oxford as well. Kings Cross would be 10 mins on foot and St Marys Cathedral and the Cook and Philip Pool are also less than 5 mins walk. We were upgraded to a Park View room (from City View) at check in.The hotel staff very friendly and efficient. We were also able to check in early which always go down well. There are 3 lifts, so not much waiting and you have to swipe the room key to get the lift to move. We were on the 18th floor in , allegedly, and updated room and the decor reflected this. Common areas (hallway etc) were in good condition, no peeling walls or dirty carpets but the lighting was subdued. Room was regular size for 2 doubles with a work desk and chair and 2 lounge chairs and coffee table. Bathroom was large-ish with large triangular bath and full width vanity. Large shaving mirror was a nice touch. Toiletries (soap/shampoo etc) were substandard for a hotel of this rating. The toilet seat was detached from the pan and had been for sometime, so I dont know what the cleaners are up to? The AC worked well and stayed on if you unselected \"eco mode\". The TV had a range of Foxtel stations but was difficult to actually get the TV to change stations and there were no instructions. The beds were OK, only doubles in our case so a bit bit small for 6 footers like us. Linens were very white and crispy. There was no discernable noise from the street, other rooms or the hall and the curtains were heavy black out, my favourite kind.

Plus it's also in dire need of just some general maintenance--rmainly repainting the hallways due to the VERY numerous knicks and dings on the walls--most likely from careless guests and/or carts of both the bellmen and housekeeping. It's in a great location--within easy walking distance to Darling Harbor, Hyde Park, numersous restaurtants, bars and clubs on Oxford Street, the central business district, Circular Quay, botanical gardens and the Sydney Opera House. All of the hotel staff went out of their way to make the stay pleasant. The concierge at the front desk is a great contact for things to see and do both within the city and for day trips out of the city. You have to request nightly turn-down service--it's not automatic; however, if you happen to be in your room when housekeeping arrives, they simply hand you ONE bottle of water and 4 pieces of chocolate and leave without freshening up the bathroom, closing the drapes OR turning down the bed. Breakfast in the concierge lounge is good but VERY VERY basic, although they seem willing to order special requests for you if you ask--although it takes a while to get it sent up from downstairs. Pol and John in the concierge lounge are great--both have worked there for years and it's always a pleasure to see them again. There was also a new employee in the concierge lounge--Christine--who just moved to Australia from Ireland--she's VERY nice, personable, funny as well as professional--I hope she's still there the next time we are in Sydney. The only major complaint I have is the new thermostats for the air conditioners in the rooms--they apparently have some type of motion detector as when you leave your room for awhile, the a.c. unit shuts off and it's amazing to me how hot and stuffy the room is when you return--and unfortunately it seems to take forever for the room to cool back down to a comfortable temperature. I'm very hot natured, so I tend to keep the a.c. turned down very low--but that still didn't help. Plus, just about the time the room gets cool again, I would end up leaving again only to return to a hot room again--very frustrating for a supposed 5-star hotel to use this type of a.c. control in my opinion.

I stay in Marriott hotels very frequently and, in fact, chose to stay in this hotel in Sydney because the booking had to be made quickly, without the time to do much research, and I thought I could depend on Marriott delivering a high-quality hotel experience. In this case, I.was.wrong. This place is shocking because it is so far below the standards that the Marriott brand stands for. The main problem with this hotel was its condition: it is SORE need of a head-to-toe renovation. Let's start with the hallways, which were completely bland (gray, low-pile carpet with no pattern), dark, and had tons of damage to the walls -- dings from suitcases, black streaks, stained carpet, damaged signage. The room was no better: It featured a super-odd design with a oddly stocked kitchenette with dumpy old cabinets with damaged hinges and questionably clean flatware and a bathroom with a triangle-shaped tub which required a step system to enter as a shower (and a shower head placed so far to one side that water spilled out). In the bathroom, the tile was ancient and chipped in many places; years of dirt were in the grout. The shower 'curtain' was one thin piece of plastic -- basically, a liner only -- and the shower head was terrible. The basin was also ancient and the mirror was not clean. The room was no better. While the bed was comfortable, the duvet did not fit the mattress (it was made for a full bed and placed on a king). The headboard was dirty. The couch was dirty and had cushions with visible dents from years of sitting. The furniture in the room was chipped in multiple spots and the carpet showed tons of wear and tear despite being a deep green color. Internet access was spotty and slow. Overall, it was gross. The concierge lounge wasn't much better. It had a decent selection of food in the morning and evening, but equally cruddy decor. It was staffed, but the only thing the staff did was put out new food; there was no interaction with guests, no one offering you a drink, etc. Location was fine, but not great. The park views are lovely, and you have decent access to Oxford St. behind the hotel, but you are a good walk from Circular Quay and enough removed from the core of the CBD that most restaurants, etc. are a few blocks away. Overall, this was a terrible experience -- it was as if this hotel was built and its owner decided upon construction the place wasn't up-to-snuff and just decided to never touch it. It really was like stepping into 1989. It wasn't explained by a cheap room rate, either -- I've paid this much for other hotels in Sydney that offer FAR superior facilities and service. Very, very disappointing -- my advice is to avoid this dump unless the hotel should undergo a substantial (i.e., gut the place and start over) renovation.

Unfortunately what was a pleasant stay at a decent hotel (wouldn't say a 5 star) was somewhat tainted by what I believe to be a problem with the deal included in the special mystery offer. The Wotif deal included \"20% off all food and drink\", and upon paying the bill on checkout was informed that this discount had been applied. I later realised it hadn't, and when I followed up was told it didn't apply to room service or minibar (fair enough - but this should have been disclosed much, much earlier). I was offered a refund of the discount, but had to chase this up at least 4 or 5 times before it eventuated - which became more a matter of irritation at the poor customer service, as the amount itself was minimal. Having got this unpleasant matter out of the way, the hotel was otherwise a fairly good experience. Obviously an excellent location; we got the train from Museum to Circular Quay (very quick, very easy), a very short cab to Belvoir St Theatre, and walked to the hotel from Kings Cross. The room was spotless, some parts looked a little tired, but a lovely view of Hyde Park (request a park view if you can!), and service was good. Beds were very comfy. Valet parking experience was flawless, and the room service food was delicious and well-priced for this kind of hotel. I'd rate it as a decent 4 star with a good location, but it doesn't stand out as a spectacular stay and my experience was slightly overshadowed by the query over the food deal.

The ticket was $16.20AUD (which includes a fee for any trip to/from the airport) and I got off at the Museum exit which was 6 stops away. The whole ride took about 15 minutes. Exit at the Liverpool St exit and you are 1 block from the Marriott. The lobby was nothing special but was clean and they had ice water available to drink, and arriving so early in the morning I had no expectations of getting a room. I was just going to check my bags with the concierge, and go to the office for meetings. Fortunately, as a Marriott Rewards Gold member, they had a room available. I thought the check-in process was pretty quick and painless, except for the annoying Asiana Airlines crew that kept butting in front of me asking for plug convertors and such. Room I was given a room with a King bed (which I requested) on the 19th floor. Initially I was a little disappointed as I was very close to the elevator and I was given an adjoining room. Two things I can't stand. Luckily in my 7 day stay, neither turned out to be an issue. I never heard the elevator and the room next to me was either empty, or the people were quiet. I heard some TV noise the first day, but never heard it again. Overall the room was nice. It was obviously recently upgraded with a flat screen TV, new furniture, and the bathroom was remodeled. It had a giant tub (which I never used except to hang dry my workout clothes) and a nice glass-enclosed walk in shower. It also had a modern toilet and a vessel sink. The only real problem was that the drain stop for the sink was missing the clip that lets you pull it back out, so it was challenging to remove after shaving in the morning. The view was of Hyde Park, Sydney Tower, etc. and it was a very nice view. No complaints at all. The air conditioning worked great, although I could only set it down to 18.5C which ended up being ok. I usually like it colder. It was only a problem around sunset time because the window faces due west and the sun heated up the floor to ceiling windows which transmitted the heat in to the room. Easy to solve by closing the room darkening shades, but it did noticeably warm up the room a degree or two. Restaurants I never ate in the hotel restaurants, but we did have an event at the hotel during the week and the catered food which I assume came from the restaurants, was quite good. I did briefly look at the menu and overall the food seemed expensive, but not more so than typical hotel fare. There are tons of restaurants within easy walking distance, and a few really good ones down Stanley street which is 1 block north I believe. Gym The hotel had a gym, pool, and hot tub on the top floor of the building (23rd floor). I never worked out, but did go up and check it out. Standard set of equipment for a hotel gym. Treadmills, bikes, universal machines, etc. There were no free weights at all, and the gym didn't seem to be air conditioned at all, but otherwise seemed adequate. The pool was small, and the hot tub smaller, but you can't beat a roof top pool for the view! Admittedly I never used the gym because the location of the hotel was so conducive to great runs, I just ran outside all week. About 1.5 miles north is the Sydney Opera House and then it wraps around to the Royal Botanical Gardens. You would be a fool to run in the gym with so many nice routes that close. In bad weather or in a hurry though, the gym would be more than adequate. WiFi I got free WiFi as a MR Gold, but it was pretty slow most of the time. Considering it was free, I have no complaints, but if I had to pay for, I would be pretty upset. That being said, the signal seemed to work everywhere, and I was able to use the same account on multiple devices concurrently (laptop, iPhone, Kindle Fire) without issue. Some properties make you re-authenticate each device and only let you use one at a time, so this was a nice plus. I found out internet is pretty expensive in Australia in general, so this could explain the slower speeds, but it would be nice to have quicker internet for VoIP calls back home, downloading emails, etc. Executive Lounge I had access to the lounge on the 21st floor as a MR Gold, and it was very nice to have. They had a nice breakfast with typical western foods (eggs, sausage) along with a lot of great fruit choices (pineapple, oranges, passionfruit, mango, plums, etc.), and other options including charcuterie, pastries, an automatic pancake maker, toast, juices, etc. They also had a decent espresso machine that ground beans and made drinks to order. I used this quite often throughout my stay and it was accessible 24 hours/day. Additionally in the off peak hours, the lounge is empty so my coworkers and I were able to use it for a few hours for a meeting and we were never interrupted. There is a little couch area if you just want to relax and watch TV. The shame is that the view to the north used to really be great from the lounge, but they built a taller building right next door. You used to be able to see the harbor, the opera house, etc. and now you can see people hanging their laundry. No fault of the Marriott of course. Other observations One thing that was annoying was that I had some mini-bar charges show up on my bill. I don't know exactly what for (they don't give you details) but the front desk said it was for soda and water. It didn't take much to get it removed, and I normally wouldn't think much of it, but my coworkers also had mini-bar charges they shouldn't have had, which leads me to believe it's either a freak coincidence, or the hotel needs to have a serious talk with their housekeeping staff. I would venture to guess this wasn't an accident. The kicker was that I had access to unlimited soda and water in the Executive Lounge 24 hours day, so why would I take it out of the mini-bar anyways? This also wasn't the sophisticated Las Vegas style mini-bar where the fridge knows when you lift something up, it's just an old school refrigerator that the housekeepers count inventory in every day. Another issue I had was my room was never cleaned the first day I was there, although it was cleaned every day after that. I don't know if it's because I asked for it to be cleaned, or if this is standard operating procedure. They knew I was staying a week so maybe the planned to skip days? Not sure. They were also very inconsistent about replacing my towels. One day the bath mat disappeared, the next day they didn't replace the wash cloths. It was very strange. Maybe the 19th floor just needs some new housekeeping staff who don't erroneously charge people for mini-bar items, and who actually clean the rooms. Lastly, they are militant about check-out time and want to charge you $30/hour every hour after noon. I've never encountered that before, and fortunately I didn't have to stay that long, but thought it was worth mentioning. Don't even try to stay past noon unless you want to pay for the privilege. The strange thing is, they didn't even seem to service my room until after 5pm every day, so I'm not sure what the rush is to get you out of there. You clearly wouldn't be slowing down the housekeeping process by staying until 1 or 2pm. Summary Overall, I had a great trip and great stay at this property. I loved the proximity to the harbor, the train station, and the CBD. There is a ton of shopping, restaurants, and cultural things within easy walking distance. I walked to The Rocks, Circular Quay, Darling Harbor, the Opera House, Sydney Harbor Bridge, Sydney Tower, and Royal Botanical Gardens during my week at this property. I would stay here again if I had to, although there were a lot of other properties I would like to try out closer to Circular Quay, including another Marriott, a Four Seasons, etc.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bowen, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood Room.... not the worst\u201d", "Author": "Alcheringasailing", "ReviewID": "UR124223389", "Content": "Went to this hotel for my wife's birthday There were some small faults with the wall paper in the hall way to our room and the furnishings weren't new but good quality It did have a proper king bed not two singles joined together and the room was large with a good view and quiet.

Efficient check-in and the offer of a midday checkout was a great start [even though I couldn't take it up] as was the large room on 16th floor with a view over Hyde Park. The view was absolutely gorgeous at sunset and the city lights after dark very pretty. No traffic noise at all! There were two queen beds, a spacious bathroom, well equipped kitchenette and a small desk area. Unfortunately, neither the desk lamp nor the floor lamp worked; the floor lamp actually had a broken switch (the floor-type switch that you tap with your toe was smashed and broken bits just left there with the lamp still switched on at the wall) which I thought made it quite dangerous. The desk lamp needed a new globe which couldn't be supplied immediately - irritating as I needed to work. Some of the furniture was a bit worn, eg. it was noticeably worn along the edges of the desk and TV stand, but it was generally not new, still of a good serviceable standard and clean. Room service for dinner - there really isn't a great selection of room service meals for a place that has an in-house restaurant. That was a bit of a disappointment as I anticipated I could order from the restaurant menu and have it brought up by room service. I decided on a Marriott combo, which is a hamburger or club sandwich (@ $22) with beer or wine ($7-$10 by the glass for wine) and dessert is thrown in, which made it quite good value. It took two calls and absolutely ages for the \"At your service\" phone to be answered to place my order - this added a good 20 minutes to the process of getting my meal. Once ordered, the meal took about 45 minutes to arrive. In other words, it took more than an hour to get a hamburger and a dessert that only needed to be set up on the plate. Given that you don't generally order food until you are at least peckish and starting to get hungry, it was too long overall. However, the meal was indeed tasty and the dessert was fantastic. Check-out next morning was quite efficient. I would definitely return for another visit.

The level of service and quality of the rooms are more in line with a 2 star motel than what you would expect from a Marriott. The long story: We arrived late (10pm) at the start of our 4 night stay and were placed in a musty motel like room. The carpet smelled and the furnishing & decor looked like they were from the 70's. The room felt & smelled dirty overall. My husband was particularly bothered by the fact that he couldn't use the toilet without holding up the toilet seat because the bathroom floor was slanted and it wouldn't stay up on it's own. We couldn't get on the Internet for a day because they 'exceeded the number of users'. When we called 'at your service', we waited about 30 rings before someone picked up. They explained that technicians were working on the problem so we asked them to call us back as soon as it was fixed. We were never called back that night. In the morning, we called again only to be told that the technicians don't work the same hours as they do in the hotel and won't be in till 8:30-9am. They added that it wasn't the hotels fault, but the providers fault for not allowing them to increase the number of users. We were appalled that they were giving us an excuse and placing the blame elsewhere! In our opinion, for a hotel in a world class city such as Sydney to have that problem is a poor reflection on hotel management. If you happen to be a Marriott Platinum member, don't expect to be treated any different. The front desk never bothered to give us automatic access to the executive lounge, even when we told them we were platinum members at check in. We had to go back downstairs and ask for a new set of card keys. We were so fed up that we finally requested to speak to a manager the next morning, the general manager was not available so we dealt with the 'on duty' manager. He tried to make amends by moving us onto a higher floor but said that they are at capacity and didn't have anymore refurbished rooms. Apparently only about 2 out of the 22 floors or so are refurbished. We ended up with the same motel like room on a higher floor with the same musty carpets. I desperately wanted to switch hotels but with only 3 full days in Sydney and so much to see, we just didn't have the time to deal with it. We loved Sydney but the hotel experience put a huge damper to an otherwise amazing trip. I am hoping to warn others not to make the same mistake as we did.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Launceston, Tasmania", "Title": "\u201cShabby Marriott\u201d", "Author": "Emeste22", "ReviewID": "UR120650479", "Content": "Sydney Marriott is not up to the standard of other Marriott properties and has a very run-down, shabby and neglected appearance.

When one takes the time to meet with and then call the head honcho of the region and then he (David) never follows-up your call it really demonstrates the lack of service you would expect at a name brand like this. One of my travel companions caught Bed-bugs across the whole body during the stay so be aware to check your room as best possible. The bites were across the whole body and even after 2 weeks the bites are still visible with now everyone worrying about scarring. When confronted with this, an email reply was all that was sent. Even after raising this with the operations manager. On top of this the daily food service was downright poor in the main dining room. Getting the bills wrong and charging everybody and then checkout further arguing with us at checkout that we were incorrect, only to finally realize their mistake. Breakfast for our group also was delayed and some never even received their orders after 30 minutes. I was surprised how the buffet area food was pretty much empty and was not replaced during the time I was in the room. When I confronted the breakfast manager about this all I got was a \"sorry\". My room that I was using was also so cold they had to get the engineer to turn on the heat and even then took over 2 hours to correct. The staff were also surprised how long it took. I guess the whole experience was really jaded by the response from the management at the hotel. I will never visit or recommend that location again and am loathe to recommend the other Australian locations due to the poor service provided the head of regional operations.

Check in / out was efficient and friendly with Elizabeth. The room allocated to us was on the 18th floor and had amazing views across Hyde Park and the city skyline - particularly at sunset and with the evening city lights - Sydney sparkled to its best!! We decided to have breakfast at the hotel which was ample, but lacked anything special. Omelets prepared fresh- which was nice. At $34pp, better to find a nice cafe in town or walk to cafes in the parks nearby. Very central location -short walk to shops, Hyde Park and Art Gallery.

When you enter this hotel, yes it was clean, yes it was professional, lobby is nice but it doesnt have that wow factor. By the way my friend had booked this for our sort of hens night out while the boys were on their bucks and it was just me and her considering we are bestfriends. Anyways thats beside the point, now as you enter and head towards the front desk you do notice a massive sign stating that the hotel is due for some major renovation works and some sample photos what it would look like in the future. By the way when I walked in with a luggage I did notice no one came and actually asked if I needed help but than again I did not give any eye contact and just headed to the lobby and waited for my friend.And there thats when I started taking happy snaps of the lobby and 2 minutes later one of the front desk people came over and adjusted the pillows on the couches, guess cause he saw me taking pictures. Check in was fast, which was good, headed to the rooms, views werent that great, room decor was outdated, so was the bathroom, BUT i must say the beds were comfy, not hard as rock and cheap. Good to see they invested in soft luxury beds. We got a room with a massive king bed which was good and yes the room was very clean. The only thing is they didnt have foxtel. Look there was nothing bad, it was just simple and efficient but right now if your looking for a nice luxury place, this isnt the place to go. But after the renovation who knows?

It's also near an access point to the Eastern Distributor if you're driving to North Sydney or beyond.

I disagree with other reviews that call the rooms \"tired\" and in need of a refurbish. I stayed this time on the 19th floor and had no complaints. I was delighted to find that the room had not only a coffeemaker and small fridge, but also a microwave and a toaster. My first task when I arrive is to walk across the park to the nearest convenience store and buy some snacks and bread for a quick in-room breakfast. An alternative is the room service breakfast which is ordered the night before and delivered at the time of your choosing. An egg & bacon sandwich with a cappuccino cost about $20.

It was like a furnace was on in the room. They eventually said ok we can give you a fan. A small little fan that they probably got from a $2 shop. How is this place a 4.5 star hotel?? The location is ok. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a walk to Kings Cross and George Street. Very close to Oxford Street if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you are after. Later on we went out had dinner, got ready and we were out of the hotel by 7pm. Arrived back at the hotel around 3am to find ourselves locked out of our room! Went down to reception to find out what was going on and the rudest receptionist I have ever come across simply said she received complaints that we were making too much noise so they locked us out of our room! Why????? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit funny considering we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even in our room making these \"supposed\" noises when the complaint came through. My friend was at reception for about 30 min trying to get the reception staff to let us back in our room, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to stay anymore; we just wanted to get our stuff and leave! Eventually they let us back in. I have nothing positive to say about this dump! The rooms are old fashioned, nothing like there website. If you want to enjoy your holiday or a night out on the town in Sydney DO NOT stay here. You will be left disappointed. There are far better hotels that are cheaper, clean and staff who will bend over backwards for you.

I enjoyed my stay at the hotel, however would hesitate to recommend as I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that their standard rates are reflective of the quality and service you will receive. Rooms: My room was spacious and well maintained. As some previous posters have pointed out, some of the features are outdated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most outdated in my room was the washroom. It was perfectly functional, just not what you would expect for a hotel asking $400 AUD per night. There was a very small kitchenette as soon as you walked in with two hot plates and a separate sink; a desk, a sofa, and coffee table. The TV was awkwardly placed as the bed and sofa faced each other; the TV was placed to the side. I initially had several problems turning the TV on to the point where I had to call the hotel reception \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even the concierge had problems with the TV! Eventually it worked, but it was not very user friendly. For example, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t switch channels directly by putting the channel number in (you have to use the up/down arrows). You could tell by a faint smell that the sofa was of a certain age \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by no means was the smell unbearable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the fabric wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most comfortable. Sleep Quality: The bed was on the firm side. I had a queen size bed with 3 regular size pillows, and 3 oversize pillows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both mattress and pillows were comfortable. Location: Either fantastic or not so great, depending on what you are in Sydney for. I liked the location as it is practically next to the bars on Oxford Street. However, if the main reason you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Sydney is for tourist stuff, such as the Harbour and Circular Quay, then there are many other hotels that are closer to those. The Sydney Marriott is about a 30-minute walk to the Harbour. There is a bus to Bondi that leaves from literally around the corner from the hotel. Cleanliness: Very clean. Service: Not the best, but not terrible; definitely neither as good nor as consistent as with the other Marriotts I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at. When I arrived at the hotel via taxi, there was no one to help with my suitcase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no one was around in the lobby except at the front desk. Check-in was fast and courteous, and when I was checked-in the agent offered assistance with my bag (I declined). I asked the concierge for assistance several times during my stay for everything from directions, to taxi bookings, to hotel technical help and found them to be friendly and helpful. Check-out was fast (although it was very early and I was the only one); no assistance with my bag was offered at check-out. Value: Standard rates for the days that I stayed started at over $400 AUD; for significantly less, you could stay at the Shangri-La, which if I remember was slightly less than $200AUD. There are many other hotels in Sydney for less. Conclusion: I had a good stay at the Marriott and would recommend it if your main criteria is location close to Oxford Street; otherwise, the hotel is overpriced and not the most convenient for visiting the tourist attractions in central Sydney. The hotel has renovated and is nice in some areas, however the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s d\u00c3\u00a9cor, service, and amenities are not reflective of the price tag. Compared to other Marriotts (Ottawa, Toronto, Bangkok), where staff almost always appear genuinely happy to see you and offer help with pretty much everything, the Sydney Marriott is nowhere near this level. Compared with hotels in other cities, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gotten much better service for much less.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cGreat location average service\u201d", "Author": "ElJohns", "ReviewID": "UR98036778", "Content": "The location is great, closed to all attraction, cafes and restaurants in Sury Hills.

Its something that I now regret and I wish we had stuck with the Intercontinental where we had a great experience previously. On arrival we asked for a room with a bath for our 2 children, we were told we would have to wait for the room so after waiting in the lobby for a short period for the room to become available we were escorted to the room. On entering the room we found a member of staff on the phone, who informed us that the room door was broken and that maintenance would be sent up to fix it. We waited for around 40minutes for maintenance and wanting to go to the Sydney wildlife park before it closed. When maintenance turned up we waited around for another 20minutes whilst he came back and forth to collect tools to fix the door. We were unable to leave the hotel before this as the door had to be left open. Having fixed the door we then set off, made the wildlife park with an hour to spare and had dinner. Returning to the hotel I started to try and run a bath for the kids only to find that the mixer tap wouldn't work. My husband came to help and he couldn't get the taps to work either. We then tried the shower and ended up drenched when the shower head fell off. So we called reception. We were told that maintenance had left for the night but someone would be sent up. In the next 10minutes a member of staff arrived and for around 30minutes they played with the shower head and went back and forth to repair it. We were told it was fixed but when trying to use it the same thing happened. It took another 2 calls and trying to tell the member of staff that the whole shower hose needed to be replaced to get it working....we never were able to use the bath as the mixer tap still didn't work. By now the kids were over tired and fed up waiting for over an hour, as were we who had spent our evening with staff in and out of the room. These were the 2 main incidents that spoiled our stay, but also in general the room was dated and there were smear marks on the cupboards. When we briefly visited the pool in the morning the cleaner was banging his mop bucket and kept looking in whilst my daughter and I were in the sauna. Finally we complained to the manager on leaving and his response was \" I'm sorry to hear that\" then we wrote to the hotel to get the same response and after a couple of letters were told \"next time we come back they will make it up to us\" I can only think that to get that response they must have a lot of complaints...whatever would make them think that we would stay with again when there are far superior hotels in Sydney at the same prices.

The nearest CityRail station is Museum, but travelers with many or heavy suitcases be forewarned, there is no elevator (lift) or escalator (moving stairs) at this one station - there are numerous steps to climb.

The hotel is located right close to Liverpool street and there are numerous restaurants within walking distance. Everything from Subway and Hungry Jacks (Burger King) to many finds in Chinatown. My room (and others on this floor) was equipped with a two-burner electric stove -- odd, I think, for a hotel. There were pots and pans provided; oddly there was no dishsoap, nor a fan to vent fumes. I did not elect to cook my own meals, nor could I smell anyone else doing so. The only drawback against this property that I can mention is that I was continually displeased with the quality and pricing of the breakfast service - a Continental was offered for $26 and a full breakfast for only $8 more - yet could I honestly say that the full was worth the extra money. To get anyone to cook eggs or an omelet was a true game of hide and seek. Refills of coffee were never offered - you had to track down one of two waiters on duty that morning. I did not eat at the restaurant for lunch or supper. There is a four-station business centre right off the lobby; I was warned that I needed to purchase one hour's worth of Internet access time yet neither I nor anyone else that used the PCs were ever asked for codes or log-ins.

I have to say the breakfast in the restaurant was great too because kids under 4 eat free from the buffet (which was awesome) and that's a big help. The location was perfect too because it's right next to the Australia Museum which has a dinosaur exhibit and a kids area for them to play- not mention it's nice to be located across the street from a park when you have kids.

In the end it wasn't possible, and there was no way to play any music in the room, but he did give it a try and also came back a few times to see if there was anything else he could do. We really did not intend to spend much time in the room so did not focus too much on what we received. However on reflection, for the expense there were a few things we thought were lacking. For example there were four of us in the room however they continued to supply us with only two sets of things like robes, towels etc. Also we did not seem to have the bins and kitchen cleaned/replaced each day (had to wash our glasses/ cups etc). The roof top pool did have great views but it was really too cold to swim in (despite that it was December!) so we tried the spa which was not working. We also thought it was rather strange that every time any of us contacted reception by phone or in person, they called us by the name of the person who made the booking - clearly it was possible that that wasn't our name? That was more amusing than a bother, however, did feel rather awkward after a while. In summary, the Marriott was pretty good, but has been scored down due to the relative value (cost versus service).", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cexpensive & only just OK\u201d", "Author": "PrinceAyla", "ReviewID": "UR60823154", "Content": "The hotel was fine but the check-out staff were disorganised.

The rooms are a bit dated but I found that to be the case in many properties in Sydney. Whatever the rooms lacked was more than made up for by the fantastic view we had (request a high room w/ a view of Hyde Park) this side of the hotel has a lovely view of the downtown park below and much of the city's skyline.

Having won a bid for week in Sydney for $79/night on the cusp of the high season was a great find. Location - Centrally located in the CBD. Close to public transit to get you to Bondi, West Sydney, Circular Quay, Airport, etc. The hotel is somewhat adjacent to the Museum stop on the subway (less than 5 minute walk along Hyde Park). We found the location to be convenient as everything was within 10-15 mintues in every direction. Hotel - Decent. The public spaces were fine. Lobby seemed refreshed as did the pool area and gym. The gym was on the top floor with great Hyde Park views, though the A/C didn't seem to work so it made for stuffy workouts. The pool was small, but relatively clean, but could have been a bit warmer. The executive lounge on the 21st floor was a deal! For only $60AUD more per night, our party of 3 had a warm breakfast every day along with evening appetizers and open bar. This saved us a lot of money as food is generally expensive in Sydney especially with the weak US dollar. The entry to the lounge also affords one free internet on the one computer, which was enough for our stay and beat the $20+ the hotel wanted for daily room access. Also, 24 hour access to water and non-alcoholic drinks was a great plus. The food was decent and changed slightly during the evenings, but the same for breakfast. Evening appetizers ranged from a cheese plate, canapes, fruit, chicken strips, oysters on the half shell, shrimp skewers, and even a lite turkey dinner on Thanksgiving for us US folks. Rooms - Decent. These are standard hotel rooms. Being on the 21st floor, we had sweeping views of Hyde Park and the Sydney Tower. Bathroom was large, though only one sink. The tub was very large and a bit awkward, but fit the bill. I wish the room was slightly larger so that there was more seating area. The room was equipped with a mini kitchen (refrigerator and microwave), which helped with keeping juices, snacks and water handy. Cons - Slow elevators and a stench from a broken sewer pipe in the car park beneath the hotel. It took 2 days to remedy, yet the front desk seemed to pass it off as though it was okay. Also, immediately outside the hotel, there is not much to do or see. You will have to get yourself a few blocks in any direction to find some food, though it is close to Chinatown for some inexpensive and yummy eats. I would stay here again, but only at the great rate received through Priceline.

The bed was a little soft for my taste though it was comfortable enough to get a good sleep without any aches and pains. I did appreciate the large bath tub and kitchenette equipped with everything you might need to whip up a quick meal or snack. The in-room heating cooling systems were never the right temperature. We tried adjusting it constantly and also mentioned it to the front desk but nothing changed during our stay. The temperature in the gym was also quite warm so I ended up taking my workout outside which turned out to be cooler. The pool area was nice but the jacuzzi area smelled too strongly of chemicals for me to use it in the confined indoor space.

Our window (overlooking Hyde Park) appeared to not have been cleaned in quite some time. The most ridiculous aspect of this hotel is the lobby internet access (AUD8.50 for 30 minutes!). Clearly they are discouraging usage, which is unfortunate as leisure travellers often need quick access. The \"fitness center\" had no free weights and essentially consisted of cardio equipment. On the plus side, the price was excellent, the room was fairly large and clean, the bathtub was large (the bathroom appeared to have been remodeled), there was no outside noise, the basement had self service laundry for AUD4/wash and AUD4/dry, and the front desk was very helpful with transportation and other items that we asked about.

Upon arrival, the bell staff members quickly gathered my luggage and were friendly. The great first impression given by the bell staff did not extend to the three ladies working the front desk. I attempted to check-in prior to the \"regular\" check-in time, and was told to come back in about two hours so I left to explore the city for a couple hours. Upon return, I was told that were still no rooms available but I could have a seat in the lounge and they would let me know when a room became available. Meanwhile, I noticed the staff providing rooms to others without any comment. When I approached the desk to inquire as to how much longer it would be for my room (as the lobby was empty), I was told possibly another 30 minutes. After mentioning that I preferred the other Marriott since it offered its arrivals lounge when I arrived in the morning from an overseas flight, the woman at the desk then mentioned that I could freshen up in their gym facilities. Had she made this available to me when I initially inquired about checking in early due to flying all night, etc., it would have been great! In addition, there was an issue with housekeeping in which I had stayed in my room until early afternoon. Due to this, I requested my room to be cleaned while I was out (I called and mentioned that I was leaving then), and no one ever cleaned the room that day. When I returned to the room, I just wanted to sleep so I dealt with it the next morning. Some of the staff members are fantastic -- bell staff and the duty manager from Finland, for example. Others are mediocre and fail to provide decent customer service, never mind anticipating guest needs. The internet was 29AUD per day max (I think you could also purchase it for .55AUD per minute if you just needed a couple minutes). I wished the hotel had a wireless connection in my room, but I was able to deal with the wired connection. I used the computer for Skype calls so I don't know how much telephone calls were from the room. Now let's talk about what I liked about my stay. My room overlooked Hyde Park. I paid a premium for this, but it was well worth it. The location was convenient to all kinds of nice cafes, restaurants, grocery/convenience stores and even US chains like Starbuck's (diagonally across the park from the hotel), Subway (left out of the hotel and left at the corner onto Oxford St, Subway is about a block up on the right on Oxford St), etc. The location is also great for visiting the Australian Museum (museum offered free admission on Sundays). I could walk to Sydney Harbor, Chinatown, etc. My room was clean and I did not hear any noise from neighbors. The kitchenette setup (microwave, toaster, teapot, mini-bar fridge) was nice for having breakfast and snacks in my room. The hotel is also within a block or so of the Museum train stop, which is handy for anyone wanting to take the train to the hotel from SYD. The hotel is also a stop for the Airport Connection bus, which costs 12AUD each way (allow about an hour to get to the airport from the hotel). Although there were some staff missteps along the way, I would recommend the hotel for a decent place to stay near Hyde Park. Aside from the ladies at the front desk, staff members were friendly and the hotel was clean (except for the day that they didn't clean my room). Having stayed at both Marriotts in Sydney, I would say the Marriott Sydney Harbour is more customer service oriented and a more polished property. Its location is also better for someone visiting Sydney for the first time due to its proximity to the Harbour. Since I had been to Sydney before, the Sydney Marriott offered a chance to explore neighborhoods like Surry Hills and relax in Hyde Park. It was also a smaller, quieter place than the Marriott Sydney Harbour.

I am a Marriott Gold member and was upgraded to a Park view room (overlooking Hyde Park) and provided access to the Executive Lounge on the 21st floor. We took advantage of the evening cocktail hour (between 5:30 - 7:30pm) almost every night we spent at the hotel and the choices of canapes, snacks and desserts were very good and enough to ruin anyone's dinner. Drink choice is good as well. Breakfast is also served in the lounge between 6:30 - 10:30am, but I never tried it. Otherwise lounge access is 24 hour, should you need to use it at any other time. We arrived two hours before check-in time, and we had to wait about 30 min for our upgraded room to be cleaned, but this was really our choice, as there were other rooms available immediately. Front desk staff were always prompt and courteous, did not come accross any other personnel at the hotel. The rooms are the hotel's weakest side - they are fairly new, but somewhat dull, bathroom - too; since this is a matter of personal preference, you can check out mine or other people's pics, it should give you a pretty good idea to make your own judgement. There is also a little kitchennete area (something like 2m x 1m) with a sink and a few utensils in case you need to use one. Internet is paid (30 AUD! per day) which is another negative for me, considering how many hotels offer this free of charge. Only the hotel lobby and lounge offer wireless internet (at the same price), rooms have LAN access only. The hotel location is excellent and one of its pluses. Its about 20 min walking distance from the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour and about a 15 min walk down to Darling Harbour. The hotel overlooks a very nice (but relatively small) park - Hyde Park, but right next to it is the Sydney Botanical Garden, which is just lovely and stretches all the way to the Opera. The hotel is also close to Chinatown (much smaller and cleaner than NYC's Chinatown) and is pretty much in the middle of Sydney's Business District. The closest stop of Sydney's Train Network is 'Museum' stop, which is in the Northwest corner of Hydepark and the train which stops there can take you anywhere - very well organized punlic transportation system. Transport from the airport can vary from train (about 16AUD per person), 12-14AUD per person (takes about 30min-1hr) and taxi - 30/40AUD (30-45min). My 4 star review should not be considered negative, there was nothing dissappointing about this hotel, rather there isnt much to praise either.

The hotel is directly adjacent to Hyde park which is a very nice park to stroll or sit on a park bench. We felt safe at all hours walking through the park as it is well lit and well traveled by many locals and tourist. The Marriott rooms were in fair condition but really appears to need a upgrade in carpeting and some appearance items.

My wife screamed one night when she saw a huge roach crawling up the drapes. They have a very nice workout center on the top floor with all the latest equipment, jaccuzzi and pool with a nice lookout area overlooking the city. They have coin operated self service laundry machines but cost are equivalent to $3.00 USD which is quite steep for a load of wash or dry. There is only one restaurant which is located on the 1st floor called WIndows of the world which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The hotel tries to upsell the daily breakfast buffet for another $30.00 per day but the buffet is not worth the price and offers not many selections.

This booking gave us great views and access to the Executive Lounge where we were provided with a good buffet breakfast, and pre-dinner drinks and nibbles. I chose the Marriott on the basis of the quiet location and the fact that other Marriott hotels I've stayed at have always had good comfortable beds. The Sydney Marriott did not disappoint on either factor. Located across from Hyde Park, the hotel is away from the noise of the central CBD but with the Museum train station located on the other side of the Park and the monorail only a couple of blocks away it was really easy to access all of the main tourist attractions. The Australia Museum is literally down the road, outside which there is a bus-stop to catch one of Sydney's Explorer \"Hop on, Hop off\" buses. In addition there is an IGA mini-market around the corner on Oxford Street within a couple of minutes walk of the hotel. Our room (2113) was clean, the beds comfortable and the friendly staff did their best to respond to queries and requests promptly. The room had a microwave, crockery, cutlery, a sink and an overstocked minibar fridge (there was no room for any of our own food or drink until we removed some of the contents of the fridge). Although I'd booked for three people the room only had crockery for two but a call to reception rectified this. The room had its own air-conditioning control and the in-room safe was very convenient. However, a couple of other small things did detract from what should have been an excellent experience at the Sydney Marriott. On the day we arrived we were only supplied with two towels. When I asked for an extra towel, as I had booked for three people, I was told that they had run out of towels. We were not supplied with an extra towel for another 24 hours. Given we were paying top dollar for being in Sydney over New Year's, I expected better organisation that this. The guest laundry, located downstairs opposite the carpark, also proved to be less than great. Trying to wash out a couple of beach towels after swimming, my spouse had difficulty with two of the washing machines not working properly and when he finally got a machine to work it took one and a half hours for the wash to complete on the short cycle! Then the first dryer he tried also didn't work. It's really frustrating wasting time like this when you're on holiday. It's definitely time for the hotel to upgrade its laundry. While the breakfast in the Executive Lounge was very nice, the same could not be said for either the room service food nor the hotel's restaurant. A room service pizza was cold and soggy as were my daughter's fish and chips at the restaurant. I ordered a vegetarian lentil curry in the restaurant that said it came with naan bread. When the curry arrived it was tasteless and was supplied with a small hard toasted bread like a pizza base. When I queried the waiter about this not being naan bread he said he would check with the chef. He came back stating that the bakery had sent the wrong order and the chef admitted it wasn't naan bread. But there was no apology nor any offer to reduce the cost of the main course which was quite expensive. I'd definitely stay at the Sydney Marriott again because of the comfort of the room and the location; just won't be eating in the restaurant or doing any laundry there.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cRecently renovated Marriott\u201d", "Author": "amann27", "ReviewID": "UR23620777", "Content": "Pros: + Good location - across from Hyde Park; close proximity to sites but not in a tourist area; close to public transportation + Clean, recently renovated room Cons: - Inexperienced staff (but tried to be helpful) - Limited dining options nearby (except Oxford Street)", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cCentrally located hotel with excellent views\u201d", "Author": "Huuhkaja", "ReviewID": "UR23348769", "Content": "We pretty much enjoyed our stay at Sydney Marriott before our flight back to home.

I also had no problem getting to The Rocks, Sydney Opera House, The bridge and the Ferry Terminals - I think it was about a 20 minute walk. However, you have access to all the buses on Oxford that will take to The Rocks and even the Bondi Beach buses. I didn't end up using any of the trains so I couldn't comment on how convenient those are. As far as service goes, everyone at the front desk, especially the concierge were helpful. I went solo and had a vague idea of the things I wanted to do so I relied heavily on the concierge to help solidify plans. The hotel room is on the smaller side - but not any different than many hotels in major cities. It was modern and the bed was comfortable and if you ask for a high floor, the view is great. It had a small refrigerator, stove top, microwave and dishes that makes eating in or packing lunches convenient. They also have a laundry room in the hotel for $5 AU a load - each for the washer and dryer. The only real negative I has was the cost of the wireless access - 55 cents/minute up to a max of $27 for every 24 hours. But in doing my research, that is not uncommon in Australia. There are some cafes that have access (most charge - like $2-3/hour), but some do not. It seems like most McDonalds had free access. There is also an IGA Supermarket about a 5 minute walk away on Oxford. As well as a Post, and if you brave Oxford Street at night, there are a ton of eateries open late right around the corner. But Darling Harbour is also close enough for a late night dinner. There are also a couple of great eateries down on the corner of Stanley and Crown Streets.

After booking I received an email which stated i could go online and request certain things (smoking, extra towles etc) which we did. We requested a balcony room for smoking and was told we could have that for $15 extra which I went forward and requested by email. I confirmed by phone that they had my request and it was all OK. A day later I received a reply to the email I sent saying they had no balcony rooms available. As I had already confirmed by phone the day before I phoned again to try clarify any confusion. A lady by the name of Melody advised me that the person I had spoke to the day earlier had mistakenly put the booking for a \"Park View\" room which has no balcony which i was not pleased about so she offered me a \"Junior Suite\" upgrade for $50 extra bringing the booking to $259 which I agreed to as a higher level, seperate bedroom and spa sounded worth it.

We stayed in this hotel for 18 nights. I was very pleased with the location of the hotel in the city. We were able to walk all over the city and it seemed very nicely located to all major attractions. However, if you wanted to take the bus there were many lines that stopped only a block away from the hotel. Hotel: The hotel was great and it felt a little better than the typical Marriotts here in the US. This definitely had a smaller hotel feel and that worked to our advantage. We had all the amenities of a chain hotel without feeling lost in an hotel that was so huge we felt ignored. Because we were staying so many nights and booked through marriott's website, the cold buffet breakfast in the restaurant was included. You could upgrade each day to include the hot items if you wished. It was an average cold buffet but I'm not a big morning eater so it was perfect for me to start the day. They also offered a discount on hotel services for those staying an extended period. The room was very nice and there was some chipped paint near the bottom of one wall but I didn't expect perfection. The bathroom was huge and the shower was odd only in that it was so large (triangle shaped). The beds were VERY comfortable and the central air conditioning worked very well. The staff were all very professional and very helpful. When checking in (seeing that we were there for so long) they informed us that if we wanted to have complete use of the mini bar fridge they would be happy to remove all or some of the inventory (without charge) so we could use it to keep our items (soda, water, etc) which worked out great. Housekeeping did a great job every day and we were very pleased with the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and it certainly made our first visit perfect. They have a small workout room, indoor jacuzzi and outdoor pool on the roof that overlooked Hyde park. It was amazing. Location/Bars/Restaurants: This hotel is right at the end of Hyde park at Oxford Street. There are PLENTY of great restaurants on Oxford that you can walk to and it's the place were the (mostly gay) clubs and nightlife was over the weekend. Getting a cab around there was next to impossible late at night because it was SO CROWDED. We were thankful we could walk back from the bars on Oxford. There must have been 20 or so great restaurants along oxford st (Indian, Thai, fast food, etc) and the ones we tried were excellent. Many of them were BYOB so keep that in mind if you are visiting hunter valley or the wine areas and staying at the hotel awhile. Pick up some bottles and enjoy them over dinner!! The real downside was the Internet charges at the hotel. My friend and I wanted to blog our daily adventures for our friends and family to read back in the US. I'm used to paying $10 at an avg hotel in the US to maybe $30-40 at a Four Seasons but this was $90/night but you could buy a week of internet for $150 if I remember correctly. I would verify those rates with the hotel. They might not be completely accurate but they are in the range of what I paid. We paid it anyway...as it wasn't going to stop us from sharing our adventures with eager friends and family back home who would be checking. However, I want to point out that I did check at several other hotels in Sydney and either they didn't have internet at all or they charged about the same rate or more.

Someplace that I have always wanted to go. The first night was spent at the Aaron's Hotel in the Hayward Market area. A very basic hotel, but nice clean and cheap at about $89. The 2nd and 3rd nights were spent at the Sydney Marriott Hotel. Let me be clear, because I was confused at first. There are two Marriotts in Sydney. The Sydney Harbor Marriott Hotel is the most expensive and located within a 5 minute walk from Sydney's popular harbor area. I stayed in the Sydney Marriott Hotel, which is about a 15 minute walk from the other one. It is facing Hyde Park on College St, (I think) and is located in the CBD (Central Business District). The hotel room rates when I checked online were about $200 per night, but honestly, I used 'frequent sleeper' points that I had gathered up over the years. Experience: I was upgraded to an executive type suite (nice) and loved the room. It was very large with lcd type television, the furnishings looked new and modern. The large jacuzzi type tub was great, because I was still recovering from a 14 flight almost 24 hours earlier. The staff was courteous, knew my name immediately and quite helpful in pointing out points of interest. It was a great place to stay for business folks. Now you want to know if I would have paid the $200+ per night for it? Based on the initial price alone on the web, NO! However, now that I've been there, YES, I'd pay for it next time. Sorry, I didn't take any pictures of it. However, I did for the Aaron Hotel review. I'd recommend it for business travelers because of its location and amenities and folks with a couple of kids because of its location across from that really nice Hyde Park.

We were pleasantly greeted, and were thrilled to get an early check-in to our room. The room was very nicely appointed, although as previous reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is older and a little worn. The couch in our room definitely had some threadbare areas. However, our king-sized bed was very comfy! Continuing on the positive note - we had a room overlooking Hyde Park. The hotel is in a beautiful and convenient location. Although it is about a mile from the harbor, we are used to walking, and enjoyed the exercise. This was wonderful for our needs - perhaps others might want to be located right on the waterfront. Public transportation is readily available nearby. We had no problem getting to most of the sights, once we became oriented to the area. Food in the hotel is pricey. Once we got our bearings, we were able to find nice restaurants, although it took a little bit of searching. Sydney is a very walkable city - once you figure it out, it is fine. Just a tip - take the exployer bus on day one (you pay for it and pick it up at circular quay). It is a good value and will give you an excellent feel for the city. On our last day in Sydney, we felt that there was quite a bit of activity and excitement in the hotel. We quickly learned that we were there for the day of gay and lesbian Mardi Gras. Our hotel was located literally at ground zero of the Mardi Gras parade. Prior to this, we could not figure out why we had to pay $310. for that night at the hotel! (our previous nights at the hotel were considerably lower in price!) I do wish that this had been explained to us when making the reservation! Anyway, one could be (a) comfortable in this situation, or (b) uncomfortable in this situation. Since we were there only as visitors from the US ,and there by coincidence, it was a very uneasy situation for us. The hotel did its best to maintain security and limit excessive partying, but a very \"lively\" atmosphere prevailed! Again - avoid this time in Sydney if Mardi Gras is not in your plans!

Our check in and check out were prompt, and staff at reception were very pleasant. We are from country Victoria and seldom visit Sydney.

It has a prime location next to Hyde Park and just around the corner from Oxford Street. George Street is only a short walk away too. I had a room overlooking the park and I loved the view! It was such a beautiful view to wake up to. Watching the sun set at night was also beautiful. I would definately request a park view if possible. The room itself was okay. A ittle dated with scratched desk. My bedside lamp did not work , but may have just been the bulb. The bathroom was spacious enough although lighting was a little subdued and I would have preferred it to be a little brighter for shaving. Unfortunately, the shower was a \"you have to stand in the bathtub \" type which must be problemamatic for people with restricted mobility as you either had to step into the bath which involved a step of at least 10 inches or onto a step at the side of the bath which itself was over 6 inches, and then step over and into the bath itself. Really silly design. The bed was very comfortable indeed with lots of comfy pillows! The TV was the usual \"tv in a box\" type but with lots of channels. Small sofa was nice but looked like it needed either a good clean or reupholstered. Lots of storage space and minisafe. Breakfast was included in my deal and was buffet in style. Over all the food was very average and definately not worth the $31 per person if you did not have it included in your deal. The view from the window was lovely though....directly opposite the park. My only \"negatives\"' about the hotel was in regards to housekeeping. I returned on a saturday evening after a very busy day to find that my room had not been cleaned. I had just bought some hot food to enjoy but instead had to wait over 30 minutes for my room to be cleaned. The staff were apologetic but after a long day it was not the best way to start the evening. Overall, a grreat location and wonderful view from room. Room itself was adequate but dated. Bathroom was large but I would prefer a seperate shower or no bath. Would i stay again?
