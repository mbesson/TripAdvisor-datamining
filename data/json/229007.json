The area that the hotels in is full of bars and restaurants, (just walk down the main street towards the Vatican, lots of shops along it), a very Italian area so you don,t get ripped off all the time, like you do around the tourist spots-avoid eating anywhere near the Spanish steps, we paid double for a very basic meal on the first night here. Trastevere is a great area for bars, restaurants and lovely to walk around at night-it,s about a 40 minute walk down the river from the hotel. The hotel barman, Emanuel is a real character and makes fantastic cocktails. The rooms are pretty basic, we stayed in the annex which was quiet, the cleaners are great and we came back every day to a spotless room with clean towels. Shame about the drain smell from the bathroom but I think that.s a common thing in Rome, just leave the window open if you have one. Beds are very comfortable, I slept better than I have for years but maybe it was because we were averaging 15Ks of walking a day! All in all I would love to come back to Rome and to this hotel.

Once we got our bearings we established it was well situated. Vatican City is about a 25 minute walk. (We are not fast walkers) The metro system is fantastic. The nearest Metro is Lepanto which is about 10 minutes..at 1euro for 75 mins you cant go wrong. Being so close to Lepanto meant we could go to the tourist sites. Having walked to the Vatican on day 1, we got the metro back from Ottaviano which just saved our legs as there is so much to see. Day 2 we again took the Metro down to the Colloseum (using both A & B metro routes - very easy) and all the sights local to that area. Later back on the Metro to Spagna for the Spannish steps which didnt really need long, so we rejoined the Metro with the same ticket back to Lepanto. Day 3, Metro to Barberine, for the walk through to the Trevi fountain, the Pantheon, Piazza Navora over the Ponte Umberto and home to the Hotel, in time to get the mid afternoon taxi back to the Airport. With all this sightseeing the Hotel was a welcome retreat. Afternoon pot of tea in their garden and then a few cocktails in the bar before venturing out to dinner in the evening, was all very pleasant to say the least. We had a superior room which was sizeable and had bathrobes & slippers provided. I'd ordered a bottle of prozzecco to be there on arrival , which also hit the spot and pleased the \"other half\". Breakfasts were adequate, although the hot buffet had seen better days by the time we emerged at about 0900hrs each day. But plenty of everything else. Staff were all very friendly.

After a fairly hectic few weeks travelling through Italy, it was a pleasant change of pace to say here. It is extremely well situated in a very quiet residential street but only a five minute walk from the metro station. The other benefit of staying a little further out of the city centre is that the hotel is extremely spacious. We had a suite on the first floor, which also had the balcony immediately above the entrance. The room was very comfortable. The fixtures, fittings and d\u00e9cor were verging on being a little tired but given then ambience of the hotel (it is very classic and elegant rather than modern) it was absolutely fine. It is only a 20 minute walk to the Vatican in one direction and 20 minutes in the other direction takes you to Borghese park. There are a few great restaurants in the area, full of locals which I think is always a good sign. There is also the best Gelateria in Rome (trust us, we tried a few!) on Via Marcantonio Colonna just around the corner. Breakfast was always lovely and there was a good selection each day. We were a little disappointed that it wasn\u2019t ever served outside in the courtyard (which is lovely) as was suggested on the hotel website but this is about the only thing we could complain about in our whole stay. The reception staff were very efficient. Not the cheeriest people in the world, but were always very helpful so no complaints on that front either.

Common areas in the hotel are in beautiful old style, save for the wide modern room where they serve a good quality buffet for breakfast. We didn\u2019t have special needs, but the staff seemed to be friendly and kind. Our poor rating is referred to the position and general conditions of the room we were given that was not in the main building but in a dependance on the back. To get to the dependance you had to get out through an \u201cemergency\u201d door located in the middle of the lounge bar area, walk through a nice back garden and then open an extra locked gate. The dependance state was very poor compared to the hotel main building (an electric panel was open and cables were coming out of it). The room was on the second floor, with no lift and only narrow stairs. The room itself was quite wide, but absolutely not adequate for a 4 stars hotel (tape on the main lamp, the moquette was in some places detached, the wallpaper had some ripped and stained spots, the heating flow was really noisy, the minibar was broken and the TV had less than 10 channels available\u2026 and moreover the bed was so short I had to sleep across it). The bathroom (nice that it had its own window) was absolutely the worst part: freezing, the only heating spot was not working at all, some of the ceiling panels were misplaced, the basin and tub taps were very old, some floor tiles were broken. Obviously, both the room and the bathroom badly needed a deep restyling. The room quality was well below both the 4 stars standard and the overall hotel quality. The impression was that, given our on line reservation, Italian nationality and short stay (we were there for a work week-end), we were given a \u201cspare room\u201d even if we were charged the full rate.

The hotel itself looks well, the main areas and rooms are elegant, comfortable and clean, Its probably just about worth its 4 star rating. Our main problem with the hotel was that we(wife and I) were on this trip with my parents and it was a present for their wedding anniversary, I made a few requests in advance of the trip, we informed them of the fact it was their anniversary and we would like them to have a nice room. We also hoped they might make a point of highlighting the fact that it was their anniversary. I also emailed about 4 days before we arrived to remind them. We got there and the concierge(tall guy with glasses) on the desk was barely welcoming, now i know that request can only me met if possible so i wasn't too bothered, it just would have been a nice touch. All that aside what was most annoying was when we got to our rooms and they had put my parents in a room with two separated single beds, our booking was for 2 rooms with double beds. I was furious. I went to the desk and asked for a different room, he was most unhelpful and said that they were full but that he would change us in the morning. I went back up and swapped with my parents so they would have the room with the double bed. I went down in the morning to change the room and was met with the same useless concierge, I asked about the room he promised the night before, he simply said there are no other rooms and offered no apology, alternative or concession. For me there is no excuse for this and this is why i would not go back. The rest of the staff were very friendly and helpful. Also it advertises safes and tea and coffee , payTV in the rooms, there were none.

They answered me very quickly and informed that they will be happy to provide us with on of the most beautiful Classic rooms they have, free early check in (which I asked for) and in addition with 2 free cocktails in the hotel bar \u2013 which they really did on arrival. Check in (as well as check out) procedure was very fast and efficient. Regarding hotel location \u2013 it\u2019s almost perfect \u2013 hotel is situated on the Vatican bank of the Rome only 2 minutes by foot from Lepanto metro station (direct line to Termini) and only one stop or 10-15 minutes by foot to Vatican.

We didn't arrive till around 11pm so we decided beforehand to pay the extra euros (hotel taxi costs 60 euros) so we had the comfort of knowing someone would be waiting for us when we arrive, as we are both 20 year old girls, who know little Italian and didnt wish to risk trying to make it from the airport alone! The taximan was waiting at the airport with his air conditioned Mercedes and we got to the hotel in just over half an hour. The receptionist was very welcoming, providing us with maps etc, and we settled into our room, next morning we had breakfast which is very good, lots and lots to choose from, cereals, cooked breakfast, cakes, fruit etc If you do go into the bar, make sure you meet the barman Emmanuel, he makes very good cocktails! The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the Piazza Del Popolo, although the streets around the hotel are very dimly lit, so we decided to not stay out too late, as I previously mentioned we are young girls and so came back around half ten/11 most evenings, but the hotel bar is open till around midnight so we went there after dinner for drinks. The hotel is in a good location for the sites, we walked to the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and the Vatican with no trouble, although on the day we went to the Colosseum we did get the subway to the termini (only 1 euro) and then we walked from there. In terms of seeing the sites, I would definitely recommend prebooking tickets online for the colosseum and the Vatican, as otherwise you will have to queue! Also the rules about the Vatican dress code are very much enforced, we saw many people being turned away, as long as your skirt is below the knee and you have at least a pashmina to cover your shoulders and chest you should be fine. All in all we had a very enjoyable stay, nothing we asked was any trouble (for example we forgot toothpaste and within minutes some was brought up to our room). The room wasnt massive but plenty big enough as a base for our holiday. We had no complaints at all about the hotel. Rome is amazing, you should definitely go! One word of warning though, if you do use the subway, they have ticket machines which you can select English and are therefore very easy to use, but watch out for tramps who stand by the machines and try and help you as they will try and force money out of you, but as long as you are firm and tell them no thank you before they start to help, you should have no problems.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cVery pleased\u201d", "Author": "MiamiViajantes", "ReviewID": "UR74968401", "Content": "Excellent Hotel, located in a residential area away from the noise of the city yet close.

That said, it was not too far from anything - five minutes to the nearest tube station (Lepanto), and from there it was one stop to the Vatican, and only a few stops to the historic centre of Rome. If the tube is not your thing, it's a couple of minutes to the river and a thirty minute walk down quaint streets to the centre. Being away from the throng of tourists has another advantage - as well as being quiet, the eateries which were close to the hotel were more \"Italian\" - the ones we went to had a very local feel and were better quality and more reasonably priced than the central ones geared towards fleecing tourists. The hotel itself was very elegant inside. Thankfully air-conditioned, our room was small but adequate and well appointed and decorated. Classical in style but with a modern bathroom and amenities. The staff were all very friendly and spoke English, and the breakfast was good quality with plenty of choice and variety. If we return to Rome again I wouldn't hesitate in booking the hotel. The price is reasonable and we would rather stay there, a short way from the bustle, than smack bang in the middle of the city centre. One 'tip', and it's not a reflection on the hotel - when returning at night, walk along the main road from the tube station until you have to turn down to the hotel. The roads were a grid system so there are a number of chances to turn onto the road that the hotel is on. However, there didn't seem to be any street lights, and apart from some light from the houses that lined the street, it was very dark and the roads and pavements in Rome aren't always too even.

I paid 5 euros for a tiny glass of Coke that wouldnt even amount to a can of soda. It was 7 euros for a tiny glass of limonchello. 15 euros for brunch.

I had booked the trip to Rome as a 60th birthday surprise for my mum so I was anxious that the hotel and room would be clean and comfortable to 'round' off the whole trip experience. I needn't have worried. Our twin room (417) was very nicely furnished and both it and the bathroom were spotlessly clean. The beds were a little hard but we slept well and you will be so tired out by the walking that it shouldn't bother you! The staff were friendly and discreet and very helpful when asked. The breakfast was plentiful with a wide variety of choice. Hotel Giulio Cesare is based on the Vatican side of the river Tiber and is very well situated for a weekend break, being about a 15 minute stroll to the Vatican and about 20 minutes to the Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain. Although Rome has standardised the taxi fares, this doesn't apply to 'over the river' so instead of the 30 euros we expected to pay, we had to pay 50. If I went again, I think I might try one of the buses that leave every half hour from the airport for about 8 euros and walk across the city or get the metro which stops one street back from the Hotel. Some tips for those going to Rome for the first time: Try to learn a little of the language - don't be self conscious! It will definitely help as, though English is widely spoken, some have just a few phrases and if you know some italian phrases you should be able to muddle through! Buy a Roma Pass - we didn't as we didn't arrive until the Saturday evening and hadn't realised we could until Sunday afternoon. As we had already booked the Vatican for the next day it wasn't worth it...but you can get on and off buses as you like and also get free entrance to the first two museums of your choice (not including Vatican). You will save some money and sore feet in this way! Vatican - If you can, take a packed lunch or something to snack on. You can easily spend a whole day there and there is only one coffee shop (to my knowledge), which only sells water, coffee and icecream and this is half way up the Dome! We booked the official Vatican tour (29 euros), which included a 2 hour tour. Good bits, it was nice to get some of the background on the Sistine Chapel before going in, Bad bits, my mum's headphones packed in within ten minutes of the tour so she had to share my earphones - very hard to stay together in the crowds! Also, you have to go at their pace and can't stop to look at thing which interest you as you want and we felt rushed. If I went again, I would use their audio guide and get the best of both worlds. If you can go up the dome then do, it's hard work but the views are fantastic. By the way, don't buy your water from the vendors outside the square (8 euros for 2 bottles of water and 2 Twix bars! - I know I need to let this go but I couldn't believe it!) Rome is an absolutely wonderful place to visit, with gorgeous things to see wherever you look and very friendly people - my favourite places were the Sistine Chapel, the Colosseum and the Pantheon; my mum's was St Peter's.

Serena was our friend in the lounge each evening for a night cap and was very friendly, rest of staff nice but not overly. Got a snack (nuts, chips or canapes) with all our drink orders, which was nice (the lounge drinks were expensive, but hey we were on vacation!). Hotel is very charming and clean. Arrived in the morning from the US and had no problem checking in early. First room was a little tight (by American standards) and was immediately transferred to a larger room upon request with a better view on the 4th floor. Bathrooms are nice and we did have a tub and a bidet. However, if the hotel is full, hot water was a problem around 8-9am, better to shower early or after breakfast. Breakfast was good and enough to fill you up for a day of walking. Also allows for a lighter lunch which saves some $. Feb was not really a bad time to go to Rome, weather was in the high 50s, which was a relief from Midwest winters, and more comfortable walking for hours and hours each day. Paid just over $170/night and was worth the money. Other info, taxi to/from airport was about 50 euros. Computer with internet access available for free in one of the common areas, great for checking emails and to communicate home w/o the phone cost. Very close to Lepanto metro station. Drawbacks - bed was a little hard, but after days of walking slept just fine. Mentioned the hot water. Opened our window each day upon returning to hotel because the room was so warm. But the fresh air was nice. All in all very nice.", "Date": "March 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "surrey", "Title": "\u201cFantastic weekend break\u201d", "Author": "snowie25", "ReviewID": "UR14094025", "Content": "I have just returned from a weekend break at this lovely hotel.

Very nicely decorated and the bathroom looked brand new. we were both really impressed with the room. The staff at the hotel were very very nice and go out their way to be polite and helpful. We asked thier advice on going for a special meal and at a moments notice the conceirge had us booked into a lovely resturant (Hi Res) and had even drawn directions on a map after we declined a taxi. They were always helpful and polite at the hotel which was really nice. breakfast in the hotel is pretty good - a massive selection and the home made honey is gorgeous! the hotel is perfectly placed just outside the centre but its well served by the metro and although we bought metro passes we were well able to walk everywhere within about 20 - 30mins. it was nice to walk over the bridge and out of the hussle and bussle of town yet still near enough not to be a pain. overall i really enjoyed my break and i will definitely be returning to the eternal city one day - despite the fact food and drink is ridiculously expensive in Rome!!", "Date": "March 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "spercy", "Title": "\u201cA fantastic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "spercy", "ReviewID": "UR13787469", "Content": "We have just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel.

The room reeked of stale tobacco. It was so small, that my partner and I could not pass one another in the narrow space between the end of the bed and the wall and had to climb over the bed to reach the bathroom.We immediately queried with Reception why we had not been allocated a Superior room and were not given a satisfactory explanation. We asked to be moved to another room, only to be told the hotel was fully booked. This situation continued for 4 days where we were fobbed off with 3 different room changes, none of which was a Superior room, and finally in frustration, we contacted British Airways who resolved the issue immediately and we were moved to a Superior room. Without their intervention, the hotel would not have resolved the issue and would happily would have continued to accept the monies without providing the agreed product. So, on the 5th day of our stay, we were finally allocated the room we were supposed to have had. We have stayed in numerous hotels around the world, and none have been so unhelpful and evasive as the Hotel Giulio Cesare.

Also not so far away on the Via Guilio Cesare are some cheaper pizzerias or if you fancy walking good restaurants in the Centro Storico.
