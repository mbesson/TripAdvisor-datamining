The price looked good for a 3 star hotel and the location of the Hotel met our need to stay in the centre of Montreal as a base for our visits. The hotel is in the centre but the surroundings are really horrible. Furthermore it is in a main and very noisy street that makes sleeping almost impossible. The hotel owns a restaurant so at night it may happen that people coming out of the restaurant make a lot of noise. Our room was on the first floor towards this main street. The room was very small, without a wardrobe and a light a part from a lamp on a bedside table. The sheets were filthy with hair and other organic materials (certainly not coming from my girlfriend and myself). The bathroom was dirty too, especially the sink, the towels were dirty too, ripped and with holes. The breakfast was served in a dirty room on dirty tables and dirty dishes, with little choice and bad quality products. We don't understand how this hotel was ranked 3 stars by Montreal tourist office. Very expensive for the service it offers Montreal was very nice but coming back to the hotel in the evening ruined the romantic atmosphere of the city, besides the tiring sleepless nights.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lindenhurst, New York", "Title": "\u201cCentral location, Comfortable Beds\u201d", "Author": "AmyCast", "ReviewID": "UR119867187", "Content": "We were in town for a concert and stayed here for 3 nights.

We had booked online, and the shabby, unloved reception area and disorganised checkin (our room was not ready at 4.30 pm) gave us immediate misgivings. These were allayed when we were shown to our room, which was small but clean, with comfortable furnishings. We settled in, only to find the bathroom sink did not drain. So we were moved to another room, after being shown an alternative that was still not made up (I had terminal sense of humour failure by this stage). We ate in the restaurant -- an Indian buffet, obviously very popular with locals, especially families -- and then headed for bed. It might have been a good night's sleep but for the air con unit, which behaved like a badly-tuned tractor all night ... just as I was dropping off, it would rev back into action. To crown the experience off, breakfast was supposed to be served at 8.30 am -- just enough time to grab some before heading back to the station for our train.

All were supplied but we had to ask for them at the front desk. Also, there were three body lotion bottles, but no shampoo or conditioner. The breakfast was pathetic - a piece of bread that you had to toast, no butter and just jam. A jar of warm orange juice was available, bowls but no cereal or milk. I have no idea how this became a 3 star hotel. The bed was surprising comfortable, considering everything else that was wrong.

If he opened a hotel in Montreal, this would be it. First, let me say that the room that my husband and I stayed in tis past weekend was fine -- on the small side, but clean and relatively well appointed, with good AC and a comfortable bed. No extras, but perfectly adequate and reasonably priced. Since we do a good deal of international travel, we're not expecting an American style suite hotel everywhere we go. We are expecting, though, to be treated as guests, not as an annoyance. It started when we arrived and the gentlemen at the front desk treated us as if we were interrupting his evening. (The same people are running the hotel and a large adjoining restaurant, so their good humor is obviously spread thin -- really thin.) We paid to park on their lot behind the hotel, where we were greeted by an officious young man who -- despite the giant size of the lot, and almost no one parking there -- directed us into a space centimeter by centimeter. He also told us to leave a slip of paper on our dashboard with our room number on it. So it was a quite a surprise when the front desk called our room at about 1 AM to tell us, in the snappiest way possible, to get downstairs right away because we had parked \"incorrectly\" and had blocked in one of their employees. I was sound asleep when they called, but did have the presence of mind to ask what the make and model of the car was. Not mine. When i convinced the ticked off guy that it wasn't my car, he ordered me to go back to sleep. No apologies. No goodnight, sorry I woke you up. So I got up to go to the bathroom and the toilet paper holder fell off the wall. Breakfast is only served until 9, so my husband and I got up extra early so we wouldn't miss it. The owners run an Indian buffet restaurant so we thought it would be a treat. But somehow, in a city of fine bakeries and cafes, the owners had reduced breakfast to a bag of (supermarket?) white bread, a bag of commercial bagels, a box of cereal, a carton of OJ, and some containers of PB and J. They had a toaster and a hot plate with a carafe of coffee. At 9 AM on the dot, they whisked the whole breakfast away, including the coffee (no refills for you!). We went out for the day and came back to find our room made up, but with no soap -- just a sliver left over from our morning showers. In the morning my husband went to the front desk and asked for soap. Turns out they had run out, but did manage to dig up one little bar for us to share by, apparently, cannabalizing another room's supply. (Okay, there were a couple of huge CVS type stores around the corner where they could have gotten soap but I guess that would have cost money.) While my husband took his low-suds shower, I tried to use the WiFi to check my e-mail. Oops -- password needed and a charge for WiFi use! (Quel surprise!) I called down to the front desk for the password and was told that the only guy who knew about the WiFi was really busy and could I call back in 15 minutes? I decided to forget it and take my own low-suds shower. We didn't even bother with the PB-and-J-on-white breakfast. Did we have a great weekend in Montreal despite staying at this hotel? You bet!

Although the room was well-decorated, it was a little bit small for a family of four, but the generous administration added a cot to our room so that we would be more comfortable.
