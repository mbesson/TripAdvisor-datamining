To get to the hotel I took the Airport Express to Hong Kong Station - I was meeting a friend who lives in Hong Kong, so we took a taxi to the hotel (or rather the road it was on, as the taxi driver hadn't heard of it) - this cost about HK$45 including HK$5 for my luggage (this was a Sunday evening so traffic wasn't an issue, might cost more at peak times). The entrance is pretty easy to find although it isn't big - take the lift to the 3rd floor for reception. Check-in was swift and the staff speak very good English. I was given an upgrade to a deluxe room, which was great - still don't quite understand how hotels dish out their upgrades, but it might be because I booked directly via the hotel's website; it was cheaper than every website comparison site I could find and means they don't pay commission. On check-in, they did give me the wrong room key at first - it was obvious though from the fact the room had someone else's stuff in and by the time I'd gone back reception, the staff were already coming to meet me with the correct key. I didn't find this a big deal as it was an honest mistake and I did notice later that the hotel is full of security cameras (in the hallways and lifts) so your belongings are secure. My room was on the 16th floor and was of ample size - other reviewers have complained about the size of the rooms but I can only comment on the one I had, which would be sufficient for two people, even with luggage. Sadly, I wasn't on the Happy Valley side (although you could still see the corner of the race-course as the photo shows) but being high up you still get a good view of the city and can't hear any of the traffic noise below. The room was exactly as it's described - there were tea/coffee making facilities, a fridge (built in to part of the wardrobe, along with a valuables safe), an iPod dock (worth noting though that it didn't charge my iPhone 4, so make sure you still bring your cable), plus an LCD TV, with several English channels, and a DVD player (didn't use the latter, it was by the bed though rather than under the TV). One reviewer had problems finding plug sockets but this wasn't an issue - there was one by the desk and one under the bedside cabinet. The bed was very comfy, probably because the hotel's relatively new. The air con worked very well and has a sleep mode, which cranks the noise down to help you at night while still keeping things cool. Do see what other reviewers have meant about the bathroom - e.g. there's just a clear glass panel enclosing the shower, then the walls between the bathroom and bedroom are glass - although there are now blinds to provide some sort of privacy - given that most of the hotel is double rooms, then this shouldn't be a problem for single travellers or couples. Was plenty of hot water and good water pressure - got 2 new toothbrushes and mini-tubes of toothpaste every day as well as 2 small bottles of water. The rooms were also cleaned to a very high standard and on the day I did see the housekeeper, she was apologetic for disturbing me (it was 10am or so mind!). The wifi was good, had a strong signal and speed was good. Location-wise, it's about a 10-15 minute walk to the MTR (Exit A at Times Square), although it's worth noting that you'll walk for another 10 minutes from Exit A to the actual trains. There are other exits for Causeway Bay station that are a further walk above ground, but get you nearer to the trains. There's a 7/11 (corner shop) just down from the hotel and one across the road too. Just down a bit further is Hennessy Road where you can get one of the trams (well worth the experience). Between the MTR and Hennessy Road is a local market, great for photos and to see some of the local food on offer. Overall, I'd definitely use this hotel again as the facilities are modern whilst available at a reasonable price. The location is also great, as it's slightly away from the bustle of Time Square, but a short walk to get to the MTR and shops.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel to stay\u201d", "Author": "Excelhotel", "ReviewID": "UR131889729", "Content": "Hotel is quite new, the room is quite big by hong kong standard.

The Butterfly is a highrise hotel located in Causeway Bay just a 7 minute walk to Times Square, Happy Valley Racecourse, and the busy shopping areas around Causeway Bay and Wan Chai. The Causeway Bay MTR Station is about a 12 minute walk (from hotel to the train platform). A couple of the tram lines pass directly in front of the hotel and numerous bus lines also stop directly in front of the hotel. The reception lobby is on the third floor of the hotel. Reception staff were welcoming, friendly, and helpful. I reserved a deluxe room and was assigned a room on the 23rd floor with views of Wan Chai and the Happy Valley Racecourse. The room was small but on par with the size of rooms at other HK hotels I've stayed at for around the same room rate. The dark wood furnishings in the room gave a feeling of elegance. The room was oval shaped with large floor to ceiling windows on both sides of the room. It gave me the feeling of being in a fish tank. The building next door was literally less than five feet away (see photo). The exterior of the large windows had a reflective coating so presumably (I hope) people from the next door building could not see inside the room. Plus, there were heavy curtains that could be closed to keep out light and ensure privacy. The room was furnished with a flat screen TV and free broadband Internet access (in the event you bring a laptop) and a small sofa. There was a safe in the closet. The closet provided adequate storage space. Another thoughtful amenity was a plug adaptor which could accomodate plug types from various countries. The bathroom was enclosed by glass walls. The walls facing the bedroom had window shades that could be closed. There were partially opaque glass doors on each side of the bathroom but not opaque enough to provide any measure of privacy for someone using the bathroom. For single travellers this isn't an issue but when traveling with another person the privacy issue might be an \"issue\"! My room only had a shower but it was rather spacious. The stand where the small sink sat upon offered no counter space but the shelves in front of the sink and behind the toilet offered adequate storage space. A variety of bath amenities was provided. The mattress on the bed was not as firm as many mattresses I have slept on in hotels in other Asian countries and was quite comfortable. The linens were clean and crisp. Overall, the room was quite clean. The only exception was the tile in the shower which needed some maintenance as mildew was becoming prevelant. Guests could use for free the two computers (with Internet access) located on the 3rd floor next to reception. I did not use the restaurant at the hotel (first floor) as there were so many other dining and bar options in the immediate area of the hotel. Overall, this is a very nice hotel in a good location with reasonably priced rooms. I plan to stay again at this hotel on future visits to HK. GETTING THERE The easiest option is by hotel shuttle bus. Go to counter B1 just outside of Customs / Immigration to arrange for transportation. The cost is HK$150 (about US$19). The bus will drop you off within about a 1 minute walk to the hotel. Travel time, depending on traffic and the number of other people on the bus who are dropped off before you, is anywhere from 45-90 minutes. Another option is the Airport Express Train which costs HK$110 (about US$14). Take the train to HK Station (about 25 minutes), then a taxi to the hotel (about HK$40-50 depending on traffic). You could take the subway (Blue - Island Line) to the Causeway Bay Station but it is a rather long walk, with luggage, from the platform to the hotel.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience for my stay in hong kong\u201d", "Author": "Chenjq", "ReviewID": "UR125542733", "Content": "This is my first time in hong kong,I choose this hotel because of good location.

It was colder in my room than outside! When complaint to the reception, the solution they provide was to bring a heater and plug it in the room. By the way, there are really few plugs available, so we had to disconnect the audio system and other things in order to plug the 2 heaters they brought. Another thing, in this boutique hotel there's no breakfast included, they don't have room service or anything.

I have just seen another review for this hotel posted on 30th October called \u201cGood and Bad points to this Hotel\u201d and I would say ditto to the comments in there. We also stayed in an '03' room which I gather is the worst configuration in this hotel and exacerbates the issues with the room. In addition to the comments in that review, I would also add a little more: Good points: - Didn't particularly like the location - it's a long walk to the Convention Centre (which was where we needed to be every day). There are very few decent restaurants around and no decent coffee shop or place to have breakfast that's within comfortable walking distance - Free wi fi is provided but it's a pain in the neck in that you don't instantly connect and continually need to enter your room number and a password all the time. But the fact that had free wi fi was a key reason for booking this hotel as I hate hotels that don't have it! Bad - Even though we're happy to eat 'local' for breakfast, the options near the hotel aren't great - It is noisy - noisy in terms of street noise and noisy in the room. I was awake a good part of the night - in fact as explained in the previous review mentioned, I also thought someone was in my room when the person in the room above or next to me used their bathroom for any purpose! -the room is stupidly small - one side of the bed is against a window and the other side has about a half metre between the bed and wall. There is only a metre or so of free space between the end of the bed and the tiny desk. The room was absolutely NOT suitable for two people. - the room was dirty. There were many areas that were dirty - esp in the bathroom. And the tiles in the entrance area (about a metre square) were so filthy that when we look at our feet after coming out of the shower they were black!! Ugggghhh! - Apart from one uncomfortable chair at the tiny desk in the room there was no place to sit so you can't really relax in the room. - You also can't be dropped off outside the hotel as it's a no stopping area so you need to get into and out of cabs a block down the road. This makes it inconvenient when you have luggage, or if it's raining. I think perhaps some of the other room configurations may have been bigger but that doesn't get away from many of the other issues I encountered. I stayed at the Bauhinia Hotel in Central a week earlier for a similar price and that was just a different experience altogether.

So, firstly the good things; 1) The staff are excellent. Really top notch, helpful and friendly. 2) The hotel is well located and a 5 min walk through a cool market to Causeway Bay MTR. 3) It's modern, clean and everything works. Nice furnishings 4) Free wi fi internet throughout the hotel for the duration of your stay. Brilliant. Why 5* hotels make people pay for Wi Fi is beyond me and pretty appalling actually. Bad 1) No restaurant. Not the biggest problem but when i'm in Asia, i do want to have a western breakfast in the morning, especially when in Asia for business. Ending up going to the flying pan most mornings. 2) It's noisy. You are in the city so to be expected, but the noise of traffic on the 8th floor is pretty bad. The higher up you are the better the noise problem will be. 3) My room was located opposite the lift and it bings a couple of times every time it arrives on the floor, which was annoying. Hotel is quite narrow so most rooms might have this problem. 4) The biggest problem was that every time the room next to mine turned on a tap, flushed the loo or had a shower, it felt like they were in my bathroom. It was very loud. 5) No bar or lobby area. After a long day of meetings or at trade show i like to come back to my hotel and sit in a comfy lounge chair, have a beer and review the days work. Can't do that in this hotel. They do have a couple of computers near reception you can use but you sit on stools to use it. Summary Well, it's a nice, modern and clean hotel with fantastic staff. But i wouldn't stay here again. I want to have breakfast in the morning, i want a lobby area with a bar when i get back after a days work and i don't want the noise issues i had.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cNoise pollution is awful\u201d", "Author": "Natabella", "ReviewID": "UR119779849", "Content": "I can't imagine how this hotel can claim to be 5 stars!

Booking a month ahead I got a decent rate of an average of HK$1,350 per night including taxes. Given that I was travelling alone and that the conference schedule was quite full, a convenient bed was my top priority, which is what the Butterfly offers. I had the smallest (\"Superior\") room on the 10th floor; I could see the hills at the back of Hong Kong, framed by some pretty tatty flats. The room consists of a bed, a counter desk with all the required connections, a cupboard, free-use mini-fridge, and a rather tiny toilet and shower booth. There are free slippers in the room, but as the toilet and entrance are both tiled, I did worry about dirty footprints. The stand-alone basin was tiny, but I suppose it keeps the cleaners employed... I could have done with a little more shelf space for even my modest needs - the mirror looked as if it might open up to reveal a triangular cupboard, but I couldn't find out how! There was also no hairdryer in the room. Location was great, 2 7-11s close for forgotten essentials, and Time's Square and other shopping areas 10 minutes walk away. Vegetarians, though, will need to keep eyes straight ahead and hold their breath while walking through the surrounding markets! As others have said, street noise is a problem past about 7am.

The main purpose is for its location which is close to all shopping in Wanchai, Causeway Bay (SOGO shopping etc) and Times Square. There are also great food all around you, but you do need to look for these. The hotel is close to Happy Valley race course so you can visit this for the Wed night races (recommended - only HKD$20 per person and you can pay using your Octopus multi-purpose MRT card). As for the hotel, we originally got allocated a 5th floor room. As I am a light sleeper, I found the room very noisy as you can hear the buses and cars accelerate and brake like you were outside. So thinking about the busy shopping ahead and the 4 weeks of holiday ahead, I asked for a room change. As expected, I wasnt able to change that same night (8pm already!) but they said I can be allocated a room further up the next night. This was provided without fuss and we really appreciated the friendly service desk staff. As for the room up on level 23 (!!) the next day, the only hiccup was that we were allocated a Twin share room when we specifically asked for a double bed arrangement. This was fixed almost immediately after we called. The room service attendant came in and re-arranged the bed attaching them together. Other good things about the hotel - DVD player, modern furnishings, comfortable bed (s bit hard for westerners), free internet access if you have a cable & modern bathroom. There is free internet kiosks on level 6 where the reception is located. Bad things - well.... as per my title... the hotel is located on a restricted traffic zone so not all cars can stop in front. But we were picked up from there on the last day only by brute force as we didnt care. Not many taxi's were willing to stop right in front of the hotel. You need to ask the taxi to drop you off at the South Pacific Hotel where there is room to stop. Then you need to walk 50m down Morrison rd to the small entrance of the hotel.

Only 1 notebook available for guest's use but can get receptionist help to check on their computer if they're not busy. 2 lifts only so wait can be long when one of them is under service.

We were told on arrival that they did not have the room available and that they only had a Superior Twin Room (lower ranking) available. The choice we had was to either take it or not have a hotel at all. They did not offer to give it to us for a lower price, even though it is a cheaper room than what we had paid to stay in. When we got there, the room was very filthy. The carpet was stained and filled with debris. We were greeted with 2 scout boy twin beds. The bathroom floors were filthy like an old gym locker room, to the point where I was only able to bear t aking a shower, by laying a towel on the shower floor to step on! The bathroom not only had the one clear glass door but also had a section that was a sliding wall/door with no lock. Very poor lighting. The free wired internet came with a 3 inch LAN cable that did not allow for you to even pull your laptop any closer to you! The dishonesty in the staff was unremarkable! We complained that the heat was not working. There was only cold wind blowing. The staff that came up avoided very much from telling us that the switch on the wall was really only for a fan/airconditioner and that in fact, there really was no heat! It took for me to finally blatantly state that \"So you mean there is actually no heat?\" that he sheepishly nodded. No wonder it was warmer when I actually turned the entire thing off! I was only adjusting the force of the cold fan! Then we were told that they ran out of portable heaters for the night too! I called down to the service desk to complain that night and demanded to be put back in the class of room I had booked for and they agreed! However, there was no attempt on their part to apologize or deduct the difference in room price. I ended up still paying the price of a deluxe room the night that we slept in a superior twim bed room! I suspect they gave our room out to walk in last minute guests, possibly charging them more, while they sent us to sleep in a lower class room but for the price of the higher class room. Makes me wonder if the staff pocket the difference in money made. That way, they can earn the price of 2 nights worth of deluxe room fee in one night! I am quite angry with this, as we were very tired by the time we came to thsi hotel. We had just finished 2 and half weeks of going from city to city and was really looking forward to the last 3 days in hong kong for our pre-honeymoon, hoping to get some better rest.

The hotel was perfect for us: within our budget, centrally located, and with easy access to nightlife and public transportation. Our room was nice and clean, and plenty big for the two of us (although certainly not spacious, but as city dwellers we're very used to sharing cramped quarters), with a nice bathroom and amenities, including free internet (cable, not wireless). We put out the extra $50/night for a top floor room, and the 180 degree view was AMAZING!! We looked out over the raceway, Causeway Bay, and the mountains. It was very pretty at night! We spent a lot of time walking around the hotel -- Wanchai is about 10 min away, the Causeway Bay MTR is about 5 min. We walked all the way to Soho several times -- maybe 30 minutes? Pretty much anything and everything we wanted was within walking distance. And the nearby MTR and trams made getting everywhere else very easy. With that said, this is not a hotel for travelers who liked to be coddled by hotel staff. There's no hotel restaurant, conceirge, travel desk, etc. Although hotel staff were lovely (and the cleaning staff was very nice to hang around to clean our room even when we didn't leave the room until 2pm!), they pretty much checked us in and left us alone. I'm sure they would have been happy to answer any questions, but otherwise we were on our own. We're very independent travelers, so this was just fine by us (I actually don't like overly attentive hotel staff!), but if you're a timid traveler who needs some handholding then this might not be the best hotel for you.

While the rooms are small I did not feel cramped and had plenty of room for my 2 suitcases. The room has a small desk for my laptop and Internet access with very good speed. While overall I felt the room was clean, more attention is needed to areas not always noticed by housekeeping, such as vacuuming the edge of carpet near walls and dusting the lamps. The location is within a 5 minute walk to Hong Kong's vibrant shopping district and access to the MTR subway is in the Times Square mall, although you need to walk another 10 minutes underground to get to trains. Don't expect a high level of service. The staff was helpful but not the type to pamper you. I am not one to care about pampering, I just want an iron brought to the room in a few minutes, which they did.

Location: While not beside an MTR station, it is a few minutes' walk away from the MTR. I personally walked along Sharp Street West, crossed at the nearest intersection (either to the North or South will do), then found Sharp Streest West and found my way to Times Square. There are other ways to get to the metro and you can easily figure them out. I highly recommend for a cheap but good eats to check out the Bowrington Market Cooked Food Centre down on Wan Chai Road. US$2-3 for breakfast and you're set.. 2. Hotel: Very clean, modern and trendy. Nothing terrible about the service but nothing special either. Upon check-in on the 3rd floor reception, I was told no non-smoking superior rooms were available and my tour company said it didn't specify I wanted a non-smoking room. I never told them I needed a non-smoking room so I'm not sure why they would bring it up in that context. I begrudingly upgraded to a deluxe room for HK$200 extra a night because I was tired and didn't want to argue. Two laptops for free internet in the lobby. 3. Room: My room was 2001 - a deluxe room on the 20th floor very close to the elevator. Very trendy, nice new carpet, small work desk, alarm clock, LCD screen TV, firm but comfortable bed with standard white HK bedding. Huge ceiling to floor windows with a small 2 person couch on one end. Adequate closet space, safe and a handy refrigerator as well. Washrooms only include a shower (with rainfall shower and regular shower head), sink, and toilet. No robes, no sandals - the former being very odd in Asia. Air conditioning very strong. Walls must be poorly insulated because I could hear the doors closing beside me, conversations outside, as well as the sound of people coming in and out of the elevator. You can hear the traffic outside but its nothing unbearable if you've lived in a big city. 4. Service - The last reviewer is correct in that there's very little sense of feeling welcome in this hotel. It is efficient though, the concierge and reception wasn't rude but I get the sense that these small boutique hotels/servied apartments in HK are all like this. I've stayed at the Hotel Benito for example and it was efficient - nothing more and nothing less. No gym either. So you're really just staying for a place to crash. 5. Final thoughts - I have stayed in a range of hotels in Hong Kong from the Langham Place in Mongkok to the Holiday Inn Express right beside Causeway Bay on Russell Street. If I were to stay again in Causeway Bay/Wan Chai, I'd prefer to be at the Holiday Inn Express even if it isn't as modern and trendy, it's a few more steps closer to the action in CWB and I'd pay the extra little bit for being a few hundred metres closer to the actionin the future.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "singapore", "Title": "\u201cNew, clean rooms but lack of human touch\u201d", "Author": "blueariel", "ReviewID": "UR83092377", "Content": "Besides Conrad in HK, i have never experience much customer service when i stayed in hotels in there.

As such, the taxi had to stop about 20-30m away at the South Pacific.Hotel next door. A minor hassle. - Lobby at 3rd floor was clean, pleasant and modern. Staff was efficient and offered to upgrade me to a \"superior\" room. She did highlight that it was equipped with facilities for the handicap. Again, not an issue for me. - Room was generally larger than standard HK hotels to ensure manoeuvrability for the handicap, while layout and amenities were designed to provide ease of reach. Washbasin was however incredibly small and did not come with a mixer for hot and cold water. Can imagine that this will be an issue in winter. - Neatives - aircon control didn't seem to work. It either fluctuated from very cold to warm. Road noise was apparent at night which for a light sleeper meant waking up every once in a while. Walls were also thin and you could hear your neighbout shutting the closet door or turning on the taps. Other than that, the hotel was as expected for a boutique setup. The issue of not being able to flag a cab in front of the hotel may be a concern to visitors with bulky luggages. I did not manage to catch a taxi during peak hours and had to walk to the Times Sq MTR in formal dining attire. The free in-room broadnet internet had worked well on the 1st night but for some reason or other, did not on the 2nd night. - All in all, good for a short stay. Location is a plus.

Good things: The rooms are comfy and bright; the bathroom is well equipped with a lovely powerful shower; the bed is comfortable. The hotel is new - very new - and feels like a nice, boutique, hotel. (Curious about the TV choice? You've got a choice of around seven English channels, including BBC World, and a DVD player too). The location is also actually not bad at all; it's a short walk from Causeway Bay MTR, but not a hideous trek; it's also great from the tram system (which is cheaper and rather more fun) - take a Happy Valley tram and get off when the tram turns off the main drag. It's close to quite a few decent places, including a few Starbucks, a number of nice pubs/bars (Innside Out), a splendid sushi place (Sushi One), a decent restaurant (Brunch Club), and a number of 7-Eleven stores. The location is nothing to worry about. Bad things: well, being here for ten days has meant that the small niggles are a little more obvious than most. - the (wired) internet, while normally speedy, is charged-for. My internet booking promised 'free internet', and they waived the charges, but just to warn you. And it regularly - too regularly, for my liking - interrupts your browsing session to ask you to agree to the terms and conditions again. There seems no rhyme or reason why. - the hotel has about five or six rooms on each floor; as a result, the lifts are constantly in use, and they don't appear to have been programmed very intelligently (both haring down to meet you on the ground floor, for example, when one would do the trick quite well). - the desk in the room is too low, or the chair is too high, to be as comfortable as you'd like; if you've thick thighs (and mine are anything but) then you'll find it difficult to work. - and you'll never have to worry about this, but the rooms have great air conditioning if you want it to cool your room down; however, after a night trying to get the room warmer, I discover that actually, their air conditioning units have no heating element in them. If you travel in January, which is really the only time you'll ever need this, then the temperature of your room might fall to, golly, 19 or 18 celsius. The small niggles aside, this hotel gets top marks for a comfortable room, and a good location. Use the trams, not the taxis, and you'll get the most out of Hong Kong.

We went for the latter option because it would be more convenient as we're carrying a few huge luggage. The room was very clean, love the bathroom! One thing that I resent is that there are only 2 lifts available. So very often we had to wait for lift to go up and down. The bellboys and the receptionists are very friendly. They would kindly provide us with maps/directions whenever we need it. There is no courtesy umbrella. So we had to walk under the rain to the nearest convenient store to purchase a new umbrella. The hotel was convenient located near Times square. However, if you get out from the wrong exit (Causeway Bay MTR). you would have wasted a lot of time trying to look for the hotel! We spent 30 minutes walking on a longer route. So make sure you go out from exit A (times square). Then when you are at the shopping mall, turn to your left and you will see a flyover - walk under the flyover and you will see a market nearby.

My only two real gripes: 1) When we entered the room, it was very clean and tidy. No complaints about that. But on the second day, after the housekeeper came in, the place was not as clean as before. I spotted pieces of paper on the carpet and some in the bathroom... things which I don't even recognise. But the rest of the room was relatively clean. 2) The location of the hotel is fine, about 7-10 min walk away from Causeway Bay MTR. Since I'm used to walking and used to taking the train, I was very comfortable with it. However, on the last day, we met with a slight problem. The bus stop and bus lane in front of the hotel prevented people from taking cabs. We had to lug our cases to the junction to grab a cab.", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brussels", "Title": "\u201cGO FOR IT, EXCELLENT STAFF AND HOTEL, PERFECT PLACE TO STAY\u201d", "Author": "alexfrombrussels", "ReviewID": "UR49603892", "Content": "I took a supperior room for two nights, and I it was great, Great staff very friendly and smily, great location and great room brand new and fancy, take a supp room to have a bit space in the room, normal are a bit small for me.

I took a taxi from Butterfly on Prat with my suitcase. The front staff were incredibly kind and offered to hold my suitcase until my room was ready. The staff were continually great for my entire stay, always greeting me with a smile, giving assistance with directions and one even remembered my name. I stayed in a superior room, which I think was a corner room as there were two huge floor to ceiling windows on either side of the bed. The view wasn't great but I wasn't really there to sit in my room and look outside. The room size was normal to me and larger than I had imagined after reading some of the reviews. The room was very clean although it wouldn't hurt if the housekeepers vacuumed the corners and edges of the carpeting where it meets the wall once in a while. They left two bottles of water every day after cleaning, which I really appreciated after chilling them in the fridge. I found the room to be quite chilly at night and was not able to adjust the temp from my room (apparently the wall knob is only for AC) but I was told a heater could be brought up if necessary. The bathroom was small but clean except for some hair over the shower drain. The window in the bathroom looks into the room but there was a set of blinds over it. You could not see through the bathroom door although there is a fairly thin strip of glass lining it so I guess you could see inside if you were really trying to check someone out on the toilet. When I needed an iron, someone brought up an ironing board and iron, when I had a relaxing night in, I was able to borrow DVDs from the front desk, and when it rained, the doorman gave me an umbrella. This hotel lacks for nothing when you consider price and location. The Causeway Bay MTR station is a short 10-minute walk away, or you can walk to Hennesey Rd and catch a tram, which I highly recommend. Upon check-out I had to pay for a local call I made so next time I will just my local SIM card. I was also told the nearest airport bus stop was about 10 minutes away, which is 10 minutes too long with a heavy suitcase so I grabbed a cab to Hong Kong Station (about 50 HKD) and checked my bags in there before taking the Airport Express out to the airport. Great hotel, I would stay here again as I can't imagine getting the same level of service and newness anywhere else in HK for the same amount of money (booked on agoda).", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cROOMS ARE small.\u201d", "Author": "gleb90210", "ReviewID": "UR49456939", "Content": "Very small rooms (we were in Standard one).

A few days before our trip, we were able to reserve our rooms through Asiatravel.com availing Butterfly on Morrison's 2 paid nights +1 free night promo for the Deluxe Suite. Choosing the hotel was based on 2 factors which were important to us, (1) That the hotel should be situated near the MTR station, and (2) that it within the Island of HongKong preferably in between Causeway Bay and Wanchai where most of the good shops and sights are found. Our criteria were met by Butterfly on Morrison. The location of the hotel is unbeatable. Just 2 blocks up from the Times Square MTR station, gives you plenty of night life and shopping options. Also located right next door is the Happy Valley Racecourse - an extremely green plot of land in the urban jungle that is Hong Kong. You can walk to everywhere, yet it's oddly serene and peaceful for being such a short bit away from party central. If you want to be close to the action, and have a clean, quiet room with service with a genuine friendly attitude, this is for you! If you want a great view from your floor to ceiling window, this one is definitely for you too! No, they dont have a bar or restaurant, but you wont go hungry or thirsty at any time. With the Wanchai market and numerous restaurants just a block away. We arrived at the hotel shortly after 11am. The hotel staff was kind enough to have us leave our luggage in their offices until we were ready to come back to check in after 2pm. The hotel is flat out gorgeous. Meticulous, spotless, tasteful and decadent. You are in for a treat just staying in Hong Kong Island to begin with and not touristy Kowloon or Rowdy Mongkok, but this one is extra special. The minimalist d\u00e9cor and modern furniture is just amazing. After you the front door,on the left of the hallway are 2 elevators, This hotel does not have a ground level lobby, the front desk is situated on the 3rd floor. Upon checking-in, we were given rooms on the 12th floor. Opening the door, you are greeted to a splendid room, Nice high ceilings and elegant moldings everywhere. The view of the Happy Valley from the floor to ceiling windows was just breathtaking. The bed is sitting up against a floor to ceiling panel wall with curving windows on both sides with a working desk. Attached to the wall is a flat screen TV and lamp. On the side of the bathroom is an enormous closet built into the wall. This was spacious, with built in safe and fridge. On the same side as the door to our room, is a glass paneled door leading to the bathroom. Nicely tiled in off-white, this was a very spacious area. Shower (no tub), sink and toilet. Plenty of room for all our bathroom accessories. Exquisitely decorated. The bed was fantastically comfortable and we had no trouble sleeping. The english speaking staff we encountered during our stay were all fabulous and friendly and was always smiling and happy to see us come down each morning on our way out for the day. Free wifi on the 3rd floor as well as free internet in the room through data sockets (but do bring your own plugs), so we stayed connected with our employees back home each morning.

We booked a Deluxe room, which, as we had gathered from the hotel website photos and from previous reviews, should be big enough for a couch. Yes, the room we had, on the 8th floor, had the facilities advertised. However, it was far too small to be a Deluxe room, as there was virtually no room for a couch. We are skeptical about its category also because of the lack of a glass partition between the bathroom and the room proper, not to mention the floor level it was located. This is such a shame as the hotel is full of potential, thanks to its design and location. We must say the experience was tarnished by the room-size.

Rather pessimistic at first since there was no review at all about this hotel due to its recency, however looking at their sister hotel, the Butterfly on Prat's review, which were generally very good, we decided to take the risk. The price itself was very affordable considering Hong Kong's pricey hotel, and for a 4 stars hotel, the price is indeed not bad at all! The hotel is conveniently located on Morrison Hill Road, with easy access to the tram and buses. It is only about 5 minutes walk to the Time Square shopping center with its Causeway Bay MTR station underneath. There are also a lot of local restaurants to go and also there is a market nearby which sells fresh food and fruits. We went crazy buying cheap fruits every night there! The room itself is small,typical of Hong Kong hotel, yet very beautifully decorated, with minimalistic approach, yet colorful which created a cheerful ambience. The bed was very nice, especially compared to our rock hard bed in our Macau hotel. Each room has a 32' LCD TV, a large fridge and the famous see through toilet/shower. The staff is also very polite and helpful with very good English, so you wouldn't have any problem asking for their assistance. The hotel also has two laptops on the reception that is free to use, with free internet (I guess) in the room. However since I didn't bring my own laptop I could not share this experience. The only downside to it was that taxi was not allowed to stop in front of the hotel, so we had to walk about 20 meters to in front of the South Pacific hotel to catch a cab. Quite annoying if you have a lot of luggage like we did :-) All in all, it is a very satisfying stay and will definitely go back there when I'm in Hong Kong", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "quezon city", "Title": "\u201cvery nice, clean and very affordable hotel in city center of hk\u201d", "Author": "babyqc", "ReviewID": "UR47157177", "Content": "hi everyone like to share my review for butterfly on morrison hk. ..my husband and i booked this hotel oct.15-18,2009.

Booked through Asiatravel that had buy 2 nights get 3rd for free making it a very cost effective option. Room is beautiful, contemporary, comfortable (we had a deluxe). Only gripe was with three of us traveling we had taken the option of 1 room for 3 adults but the room was not really big enough. However, it was manageable, harder to manage were the transparent doors to the bathroom. Not the most discrete! Location wise, it doesn't herald any great views and you're not in the thick of it but for the price it is a great option for HK. It has views of Happyvalley racecourse (close enough to see the horses legging it round the track) and a short walk gets you to either the MTR or the tramlines so very straightforward to get anywhere.
