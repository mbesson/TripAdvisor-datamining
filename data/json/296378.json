The room was not so bad. It has just a strange smell. But the bathroom is frightful. There are a lot of funguses in the bathroom. A curtain in the shower was the only water stopping device. When you take shower all the water run right on the floor. There was no bath extractor fan. So all the steam remain in the bathroom. The breakfast is very poor. There are only hard-boiled eggs, baked goods, jams and cheeses. The hotel doesn't accept credit cards. They accept only cash!!! Internet works only in a lobby. The only good thing about this hotel is location. It is very close to main attractions.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cHotel Albion Boutique in Sultanahmet is very OK!\u201d", "Author": "feelena", "ReviewID": "UR120865622", "Content": "Im a regular traveler and at times travel stand by thats why I couldn't reserved for a room right away.Last Nov 5 -9 '11 I was in istanbul.Night before my daughter checked on Hotel Albion and had this hotel of our choice on standby and when I arrived I proceeded there.My 3 1/2 days stay were fine, the people in the reception area ,Oktoy and Candan were so friendly and helpful to give some touristic pointers and places to go.Its just the regular basic but clean and the location of this hotel is great,right at Sultanahmet and walking distances from all the Istanbul world heritages incredible sites.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nizhnii Novgorod", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel support!\u201d", "Author": "AndrewOkunev", "ReviewID": "UR120450642", "Content": "I wrote a letter to the hotel to provide information about services.

The room was basic but had satelite tv and a empty fridge for storing drinks. the bed was good and great for a nights sleep but the bathroom was tiny. Only 2 gripes really, WiFi didnt seem to reach the top floor where i was staying so had to bring laptop down to the lounge area which did have lots of tables and cushions to sit on so that was ok. The other thing is the breakfast, I had it one day and went out other days,there is a very basic range of stuff and a sheet of paper where you can buy cooked items for extra. In summary, you probably wont find a better hotel in such a good location for the price but be prepared to eat out at breakfast time.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cValue Of Money.\u201d", "Author": "bartulon", "ReviewID": "UR117071794", "Content": "This is our third time in Istanbul and this time we wanted to choose a basic hotel.
