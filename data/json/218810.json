Well, I am now on my way home and can say that it was a great stay. We had a room in the historic section of the hotel that had just recently been redone and they have done a great job of making it feel like the classy hotels of the past. The room was not large but had everything we needed with a very comfortable King Size Bed, Refrigerator, 42\" flat screen TV, Coffee Maker and plenty of closet and dresser space for my wife and I to unpack everything. The room and the bathroom was immaculate and we love having a room with a walk-in shower (who bathes at a hotel anyway). The AC worked great and the shutters on the inside of the window were better than most draperies in keeping out the early morning light. Housekeeping was wonderful and attended to any special requests we had. The toilet flush is a little loud but efficient. The lobby is a beautiful opening presentation for the hotel and was a great place to sit and read in the evenings. The courtyard is a wonderful getaway from the Duvall street rush with a number of levels for sitting and relaxing. The pool is small and a little too warm but when you exit it the ever present breeze gave you a refreshing cool down. My only complaint with the courtyard area is there are no light that would allow you to sit out after dark and read or just relax with friends. Maybe some solar powered (there is surely enough sun during the day) light strings in the umbrellas would be easy to implement. Did not eat in the restaurant as there are just too many other neat places to do that. Had a couple of drinks in the bar and the bartender was attentive and friendly. The pool bar is open until 5pm when everyone starts heading for the The Top to see the sunset. This was really the only disappointing part as it gets crowded fast and there is limited seating so why not just go to Mallory Square. As for parking, being a downtown hotel it is not surprising that you have to pay for parking but as a Platinum level member I was pleased to find that it was free. They are presently working on the 2nd floor of the historic section and if the results on the 4th floor are an example they are making bringing this old lady of a hotel back to her glory years.

All of the shops are right there and many restaurants as well. Starbuck's is located on the Lobby floor, right across from the elevator which was a nice convenience.

We didn't have many choices and prices were expensive. We settled for $350 a night at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in KW and didn't expect much after reading the other reviews. That worked out in my favor, because I can be a bit of a snob when it comes to hotels. I want nice rooms, good amenities and the location - most importantly I want good value. Well, the Crowne Plaza didn't disappoint. Nothing in KW is cheap (except getting a hangover after the 2-1 drink specials at HH) so once you get over the sticker shock of paying for the hotel, it's all good. The hotel is located in the middle of Duval street, so Head South and you hit the Atlantic ocean (which is the \"gay\" end of the street as we were told last Night) and if you head North you hit the Gulf side which is where the boat doc is and plentiful amount of bars & restaurants to watch the sunset. The hotel is old, but so charming and has plenty of character. The rooms are average size, ours had a king bed and a coach with flat screen TV. The bathroom is a bit small, just a toilet and one sink, but an oversized shower which was nice. I can't complain about anything in the room, bed was super comfortable. Not sure what some other reviewers weren't happy with it. The only exception I would say might be a problem is if you are having a girl's weekend, it might be a bit of a problem getting ready because you really can't have more than one person doing hair and make-up in the bathroom at the same time and there isn't any other mirror. As some other people mentioned, the pool is small, but I thought is was GREAT! The water was very warm and everybody we met at the pool was super nice. The staff was also very friendly, albeit, we didn't have much interaction with them other than valet our car the first day, checking in and asking the concierge for directions - all of which went very smoothly. I am deducting 1 star because of the value factor in the review.

We went from Orlando, to Miami, to Key West. I am a Gold Member with the Priority Rewards Club. I have stayed at many Crowne Plaza locations before for work and pleasure. Check in is at 4pm, but we arrived a bit early (1:00pm), and it was a Sunday. I did not expect for our rooms to be ready. Parking at this location is valet only ($20/day) and includes unlimited in and out privileges. I did not catch the name of the valet's, but every valet we interacted with were excellent. hat's off to the entire valet staff. They were by far the most competent employees at this property. These gentlemen have a future in Hotel Management if the opportunities ever come up. The valet tagged our bags, and stored them in a locked room so we could walk around Duval Street (This hotel is close to everything!) We went to the front desk, just to check the room status, and were told that the rooms were not ready, but Marta took our cell phone number and said that she would call us when it was ready. We went out, walked around for a few hours, went to several shops, down to the Southernmost Point, and the Southernmost Beach. We got back to the hotel around 3:30pm, and went to the desk again. We were then told that the housekeeping team was about to start cleaning our room. In the mean time, a lot of other people were checking in (lucky them). At about 3:50, our valet noticed that we were still sitting in the lobby, not looking too happy. He then went to the front desk on our behalf, and a room suddenly became available. He helped us with our bags, and we were on our way up to the room. The room is rather small, but that is to be expected in such a historic hotel (Tennessee Williams wrote \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in this building). If you want a bigger room, get a suite. There was a couch, a mini fridge (they usually charge you for this, I believe it is $25/night, however we were not charged because we did not request one. The TV was a flat screen, plenty of channels. The bed was very comfortable, as other travelers have stated, it is a standard Crowne Plaza bed. The bathroom was also small, but again, this is to be expected. While my wife and I were in the room, someone tried to access it via a key card. The key card opened the door, however we had the latch across, so they could only open it an inch. At first, we thought it was housekeeping, we were wrong. It was another family on vacation. They were given our room number and key as well. Talk about awkward. We were just thankful that we were there. Who knows what would have happened if an unscrupulous person was given a key when we were not there. I promptly called to the front desk and informed them that someone else just accessed our room with the key card. Marta at the front desk apologized and stated it would not happen again (I sure hope not)! My wife and I went out for the night, Capt. Tony's, Paradise Pizza, and plenty of shops, and Mallory Square. When we came back, we went up to the room, and our key cards did not work. When they deactivated the other family's keys to our room, they deactivated ours as well. So back down to the lobby we went. Chad at the front desk (appeared to be a manager) took care of the situation, and made up for it in the form of breakfast for 2 at their restaurant. From here on out, our stay was excellent. Note: If you have any type of phobia or fear of elevators, do not stay here. The elevators are small due to the buildings age, and they are very shaky. I found them to be fun, but others might panic. **For the ladies, there is no full length mirror in the room at all, in fact, the only mirror is the one over the sink in the bathroom, and no bathtub. It was a stand up shower only.** The breakfast was wonderful. Thank you to Chad and the entire valet staff for making the stay as good as possible.

I understand that hotels do need to renovate, but normally they tell the guest in advance and give special discounts during the period of remodeling to allow the person to either choose to stay elsewhere and avoid the noise/inconvenience or deal with the noise at a discount. In addition, our room had black mold growing on the bathroom shower around the ceiling and the ventilation fan did not work.

And my room isn't ready....why? After some fumbling, one of the other staff guys came over to handle my registration. He apologized and quickly upgraded us to a king room for my inconvenience. Nice touch..good customer service. As you may have read, the rooms generally are smaller in this older hotel, but I wouldn't call it a tiny room...it was certainly large enough. Obviously, the room has been remodeled, and has what seems to be either a 36 or 42 inch flatscreen tv. Bed was ridiculouosly comfortable. Although near the elevator, quiet. Very little \"island\" noise, but this room didn't face the street. However, the bathrooms have your standard \"industrial\" toilet with the flush bar on the side, instead of a tank style...and are quite noisy. Quite noisy from the room next door! And the bathroom from the room next door afforded a real opportunity to eavesdrop discussions and other bathroom sounds. That's my ONLY frowny face about the room. We were there over a weekend and one of the 2 elevators was out of service most of that weekend. They didn't seem to be able to get it fixed all weekend, but Monday it was fine. These things happen.

How wrong my apprehensions were! We had a GREAT one night stay, December 28-29, 2011! We arrived 4 hours ahead of the 4pm check-in time and I was prepared to store a bag and head out onto Duval Street. To my surprise, the bubbly and efficient front desk clerk told me I had been upgraded (Platinum Priority Club member) to a suite that had been newly renovated and upon checking with housekeeping, the room was already clean and ready for me. It was an awesome new suite on the 6th floor. It even smelled new! The only draw back, which La Concha can do nothing about, is the noise level arising from Duval Street until well after midnight. Even on the 6th floor, it was still enough to wake me multiple times (until 2am when the bars closed). The 42 inch flat screens in the room are great. The newly remodeled bathroom reminded me of a W-Hotel, with the spacious glass and tile huge walk-in shower. The king bed had a pillow top mattress that would have had me asleep instantly if not for the Duval Street noise. One floor up (7th) is the Top bar. You can sip a cocktail and watch the sunset, but you need to secure your spot at least 45 minutes ahead as the place fills up. As the La Concha is in the center of Duval Street, it is a popular spot to catch the sunset. The hotel has a $20 a day parking fee, but if you are a Priority Club member, it is waived. Wifi is free, BUT, a courtesy of the ground level Starbucks. In a 6th floor room, the wifi is non-existent. Had I been here on business or for more than one night, that would have been a problem. My boyfriend liked that the Starbucks was right by the hotel elevators. It opened at 6am. The only darkside of the Starbucks is that early in the morning, homeless were seated inside. The Starbucks provides a key to the hotel guests-only bathroom, where the homeless go to clean up. At 7am, the tables in the Starbucks were either dirty or occupied by homeless. I am sure this is NOT the image a Crown Plaza wants to have. Check out and retrieving my vehicle from valet parking were swift, pleasant and efficient. This was a great stay in every way!

However this year we were very dissapointed. The reservation was made in early January, and at that time we identified ourselves as having \"Platinum\" rewards status. Our only request at that time was to have a refrigerator for medicinal purposes. We called one week prior to our arrival to verify that request. Although we arrived on a slow Sunday evening, there was no Bellman to greet us or to assist with the luggage. When checking in were told the refrigerator was not available, as they were on a \"first come, first serve basis\". When we reminded them we were \"Platinum\" and made this reservation 9 months earlier, we were told that most guest here were Platinum! As a special treat we ordered room service the first night. The steaks were so rare as to be inedible. We attempted to call room service, but no one answered, we called front desk and they were going to have the kitchen call, but no one ever did. In all fairness the meal was \"comped\" next morning, and we received coupons for the on premises restaraunt. When going to the resteraunt we found the coupons were for a breakfast buffet, another dissapointment, lackluster variety served by unenthusiastic staff. I think they would be better off putting a McDonalds in the space. The pool which is truly in a beautiful setting has a bar, but is only staffed at their leisure, and can you believe that during Fantasy Fest (as with every other night) closes at 6 in the evening. We went out early one morning to find 2 young ladies sleeping by the pool, although the doors are normally locked at 11pm (paying guest??)

The lobby was impressive and the staff was all very accomodating - although I wish the woman at the front desk would have directed me to the proper set of elevators because I took the one next to the check-in desk and had to work myself through a maze of corridors (including stairs) to get to my room which was coincidently, directly in front of the other set of elevators located behind Starbucks. Oh, well. So be sure to ask which elevators are the most direct route to your room because the place is rather large and broken up. Had a king room and it wasn't huge but it got the job done. Don't think anybody goes to Key West to sit in their room anyway - especially with the spectacles of Duval Street going on right outside your door. Room was clean and quiet even though it was directly in front of the elevator. Sure, it's an older hotel but I happen to love the history of places like La Concha so I didn't mind that my bathroom wasn't state-of-the-art. Parking was $15/day so not horrible and on the day we departed we were informed we could have left our car there while we walked around even though we'd already checked out so I thought that was very nice. You really can't beat the location of this hotel - it's right in the middle of the action on Duval Street. All in all, the hotel is clean and comfortable. I stayed on a Tuesday night in summer so it was very quiet - not sure what it would be like on a weekend.

I like the retro style decoration, especially in the lobby, one of the more stylish lobby I have seen. Although, personally I prefer a newer hotel. I think because it's a historical building, there are restrictions on what the hotel can do to remodel the building... not 100% sure. But some of the things were definitely the hotel's fault tough. When I get into the room, the first thing I noticed were the glass on the window were crashed in couple of places. One of the cracked glass is in the lower corner and right where my 3-year-old likes to stay and look outside. Now this is pretty bad for a hotel room and dangerous. I was only there for 2 nights so I didn't bother asking for a new room just because of that. Just told my daughter to stay clear of the window and kept the blinds drawn most the time. The toilet flush also finishes with a very loud grinding sound when it tries to stop the water flow, like someone is trying to manually shut a rusty valve. The noise is enought o wake up my dauther in the middle of the night (it requires a loud sound to wake up a sleeping 3-year-old!). Other than the above 2 issues, I don't have too much to complain about the room considering the history of this hotel. Now the good part, the location. It's right in the middle of Duval street where everything happens. All the eatries, bars, etc are within walking distance. It costs money to park everywhere so just leave the car in the hotel and walk around. The hotel does charge $20 a day for parking but you are paying that anyway when you stay there. Also, as a platinum priority club member, I got free parking from the hotel. Being in this location also means it can get noisy during the evening when the party crowds return to their rooms and some of them can be pretty drunk and loud at 1am in the morning. I guess that goes with the location and not everyone minds that kind of thing. For travelers with no child and love to party, this is a great place to stay.

In between these stays I had chosen a resort hotel on the other side of the island and found I needed transportation every time I wanted to hit Duval Street or Mallory Square. At La Concha you just walk out the front door. This trip, even though I am not a smoker, I wanted to stay in one of the balcony rooms that overlook Duval Street. The reception desk explained these are all smoking rooms but that I would not notice a smoke smell and I did not. Not even the slightest indication that a smoker had been in the room. The balcony was wonderful, in the early morning I would start my day off by having coffee and watching Duval come alive. And, in the evening after running around all day it was wonderful to come back to the room and sit on the balcony and watch the activity on the street until the wee hours. Also, once I closed the balcony doors I didn't notice the sounds outside - you could hear the sounds with the doors open but that was the whole reason for having a balcony room. The room itself was spacious and the service excellent. The best part is when you're tired, or want a change of clothes you just zip right back to the hotel. Take a quick shower and you're back out investigating all Key West has to offer. Mallory Square is a short walk down Duval and I found plenty of restaurants close by to my liking. There is also a grocery store about 2 blocks away if you want to pick up some items to snack on in the room. I'm a walker, a lover of old homes and a picture taker and Key West will not disappoint. The view from the light house is fantastic and you can see the island in all directions, also don't miss the Key West cemetery with usual epitaphs on many of the tomb stones.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Location!\u201d", "Author": "travisngarrett", "ReviewID": "UR117278023", "Content": "The rooms are a bit small, but the only time your in your room is to sleep!

He was by far so great!!!! You got to meet him. Now you may be wandering why we named our review, ''total ghost package\". Our room was 251, on aug-2-11. Approx at 9 pm, my gf and I got back from the local duval st dinners and we were just going to rest for 30 minutes and head back for the nightlife. Well my gf at that time decided to take a nap on the far right side of the king side bed, while I was staying up to chat with our balcony neighbors. Before she had slept, she placed her two large locking gold loop earrings with a floss/toothpick thing on this large pillow on the far \"left\" side of the bed, so she would not knock over anything.(she dont move when she sleeps). Now after 30 minutes of letting my gf nap, while I was just hanging out, I DID notice earrings on the far left of her but not on a pillow but on the bed. When I woke her up, she did invorm me or lol yell at me about her missing earring, but we both said that we did not touch the earrings. My gf and I did find one earring on the far left side of the bed on the floor(facing the wall). But the goofy part was the missing 2nd earring...... Now we searched all pillows, blanlets, under the bed, the mattress, the luggage, this missing earring was nowhere to be found!!!! So we went to to frontdesk to ask for a flash light to look under the bed in detail(lol already took the lamp down) . But the flashlight helped nothing. 30 minutes after looking for this 2nd loop earring, my gf steps out to the balcony just to sit down with this surprising yet scared out of her mind look on her face, I proceeded to ask her where she found the loop, but I got no answers except, \"i am really freaked out\". She had told me that when she got up from checking the under bed once more, she proceeded to twist her upper body to her back, and when she turned her eyes down, she noticed that the big loop gold earring that we were searching for, was un fact locked in and shut on her back shorts belt loop. So while she was sleeping, and while I was outside, this spirit decided to play a joke on us, and hide our jewelery and watch us look for it.

If you are looking for a beach to entertain the kids you might want to check out the other side of the island. The beach is still a 15 minute walk from the hotel if you want to check it out anyway.

If you were flying into Miami and renting a car do yourself a favor and rent 2 one ways. once you are on the island you will not need your car pretty much everything is walkable, and worst case take a cab as they will probably be less than the parking. Also FL is the only state I onow of that does not charge extra for one way rentals if rented and returned in the same state. (other states charge up to 10 times the charge if you return to a different location) If I came back to key west I would definitely consider staying here again, although a waterfront hotel would have been nice for the views.

Upon checking in my friends and I were offered an upgraded room (priority reward members). The upgraded room was unavailable so we went to lunch and came back later to check in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which is no big deal. The second we walked into our room we knew something was not right, first of all it was hotter INSIDE the room than it was OUTSIDE on Duval street. The room also had a light bulb in the bathroom that acted like it was about to explode in your face, a broken toilet seat, that in order to use the facilities you had to just remove the lid and sit it on the ground at your feet, and several cracks/holes in the window. It took us 2 phone calls and about an hour and a half to finally get an engineer to our room to deal with the AC issues\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the first one was a no show. So the engineer comes, says its a thermostat issue, puts a new thermostat on the wall, and leaves. At this point we just dealt with the heat, got ready, and left the room for the night thinking we would come back to a cool room. NEGATIVE. Upon returning to the room around midnight that night the room was just as hot as it was when we checked in. Management didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much to say about the issue, we were offered a room switch but it already being so late we decided to just wait till morning. After a sleepless, and sweaty night, the next morning we switched rooms. Management was not sympathetic in the least and AGAIN had very little to say. We decided we would just start our vacation over with a clean slate and pretend the night before never happened; we received a standard room with a pool view at the very end of the hall. The air worked just fine in this room however there was a constant noise that sounded like a FREIGHT TRAIN was going to drive straight through our wall. Never figured out what it was, just decided to deal with it for the remaining 3 days of our trip. FUNNY but NOT so funny story, we met a group of gentlemen who were booked DIRECTLY into our first room at the pool pretty much immediately after we vacated the room. Lets just say they were not happy to learn that they had been put in a room having all these issues. They had yet to spend more than a few minutes in the room having dropped their bags off and going straight to the pool, but did say they noticed the holes in the window and the soon to explode light bulb. Another minor but not so minor issue: Trying to get a hold of housekeeping/front desk/ concierge. I recommend not even bothering trying to call any of those locations and just call the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manager on duty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd anytime you may need something. EVERYTIME we would try to call ANYTHING but the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manager on duty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there would be no answer. The paper-thin walls, and loud noise from Duval Street that everyone else complains about, does not bother me in the least. Having stayed in this hotel before I knew all about that. What bothers me is that we could have saved HUNDREDS of dollars, stayed at the Days Inn, and received the same quality in not only service but also accommodations. Now to end this on the ONLY positive thing there is about this hellhole. The bellman Phil is AMAZING. He was the only employee that showed us any kind of sympathy. One would expect some sort of sympathy/remorse from a manager but no we received ours from the bellman. Not only was he very kind and understanding but he also pointed us in the direction of a few places in Key West that we NEVER would have found on our own.

The next day we were moved by the very accommodating Carmen (believe she was the manager) who was extremely pleasant and helpful. We were excited to go up to the rooftop bar and see the sunset, but upon our arrival we were greeted by a rude bartender who told us there was a wedding going on up there so most of it was off limits. There was still an area to watch the sun set, but after that greeting we left to go down to Mallory Point.

I like the notion of staying at THE classic hotel destination on Duval St. It's neither the cheapest place, nor the fanciest, but I've always enjoyed my stay. I usually visit in the off season during the week, so I don't pay the highest rates. On this trip, I received an unasked for upgrade to a large room on a corner with a balcony overlooking Duval. The room was quite clean with excellent bedding. The furniture, some of which was probably antique, was well maintained but showed some signs of being in a hotel at a vacation destination. The bathroom most clearly reflected the age of this part of the hotel, with a stylish pedestal sink and large tub/shower. More counter space for travel stuff would have been nice. All of the electrical/mechanical aspects of the room -- hot water, a/c, TV, radio -- worked well. The room's numerous windows had great curtains equipped with clips that allowed me to block out virtually all light leakage -- an essential point when sleeping after a late night. I arrived early in the day, well before check-in time. The staff accepted my bags and stored them while I wandered Duval. They called when my room was ready. They were very helpful with taxis, restaurant recommendations, directions, and suggestions for other activities. The sunset view from the roof of the hotel is an essential place to visit when in Key West. Overall, I had a very good experience. Some people are put off by the age of the place (particularly the elevators), but I've always had a clean, quiet room right in the middle of Duval Street, Key West.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "mwalls007", "ReviewID": "UR101806948", "Content": "The hotel lobby is nice.

All the champagne, beer, wine and appetizers for no extra cost. The band was really good and tried to get people on the dance deck. The ghost tour connected to the hotel is a waste. We were pretty hyped about it but when we got there, it was actually very silly. I'm into that sort of thing and have been on multiple ghost tours / hunts and this is definitely just a money maker. Which is hard to believe because Key West has such great history. The shipwreck museum was pretty cool. Bigger than it seemed from the outside. The hotel has a scooter rental tent right in the parking lot and the attendant was really informative. I would recommend EVERYONE rents a scooter for at least one day. It's a great way to get around and is actually quite fun. I wouldn't ride one around town at home but when in Rome... We went to a few restaurants and bars but you should definitely stop in at Bahama Bob's. It's small and not overly crowded but serve great drinks and the bartender was really nice and helpful.

It is right on Duval St. in the heart of everything and is only about 4 blocks from Mallory Square. We got there at 11 AM and thought it wouldn't hurt to ask if they had a room ready for us -- and they did! No problem. The hotel and the room obviously have a lot of guests coming and going, so there are some wear & tear issues. The hallway on the third floor had a TERRIBLE odor (plumbing/sewage?) as we got off the elevator but it was gone by the time we arrived at our room (313). At first glance, everything looked really nice. But upon closer inspection we noticed that the carpet was really old and worn. Flushing the toilet was quite a workout. We had to move the nozzle back & forth, up and down until it would finally decide to flush. The walls were thin (I could hear people \"doing their business\" in the bathroom next door). But these issues were minor considering how convenient the hotel was. There is a Starbucks downstairs right outside the hotel. The pool, while shallow (only a depth of 3 1/2 ft.) was nice and pleasant with a tiki bar. There were, thankfully, very few children, so the noise level was low. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant. The prices were about on par with other, nicer restaurants in the area, so we decided not to have \"hotel food\" for dinner. Also, our room faced the back, overlooking the parking lot, so we did not have to worry about the late-night noise from Duval Street. We slept very soundly because the beds were very comfortable. It was VERY hot outside (typical July in Key West) but the AC worked fine. Some people on this site comlain about the $20 per night parking fee but I didn't mind. On-street parking is extremely difficult to find in Key West. Once you park at the hotel, you have the peace of mind of knowing the car is close by and relatively safe (actually we could see it from our room window). Once you arrive, you won't need to drive anyway, and it's much more convenient than booking a room at one of the El-Cheapo hotels near the beginning of the island. At those \"family hotels\" you are more than 5 miles away and either have to wait for an inconsistent shuttle, or drive. Believe me, once there, you won't want to drive. Traffic is awful. The only problem I experienced was upon checkout. The front desk mistakenly over charged me for the parking. We were only there for one night and they charged us for two. They quickly rectified the situation but I do recommend that upon leaving you physically check out, rather than just leaving, assuming they will just charge your card. If I hadn't caught that mistake, it would have been very difficult to get my $20 (plus tax!) back.

I also enjoy having my morning coffee on the rooftop deck at the pool. Yes, the hotel is noisy. You will hear everything in the rooms next to you. You will hear toilets flushing throughout the night and t.v.'s playing next door. I've stayed here four consecutive years, and have heard construction going on in the morning each time.

Any night you can spend in Key West is a good one, and a free night is even better! At check-in, the clerk graciously offered to let us move into a small room that was already available (we showed up several hours before official check-in time) or let us wait for a larger room. We opted for the smaller, more immediately available room, and it was indeed small. The room itself was not a big problem but the bathroom was tiny, even for us, and we're used to sharing a small bathroom with one sink at home. People who are used to double sinks and a little elbow room should keep this in mind. The room was clean, although the a/c vents in both the bathroom and the bedroom had a slight bit of dripping water and accumulated mildew. It's an old, large hotel in a very hot, humid town, so we decided to cut them some slack on this point. Because it is an older hotel that has been taken over by Crowne Plaza, it has some charm and character along with modern conveniences like a big-screen TV and wifi. Somehow it still skews more toward being a corporate hotel than a piece of old Key West, though. Also, the walls are PAPER THIN so be aware that you'll hear your neighbors chatting, fighting, watching television, flushing the toilet, having sex, etc. - and they will hear you. I guess it says good things about either Key West or the hotel itself that we heard a lot more sex than fighting...a lot more. The rest of the hotel is nice, but just not special. The lobby is lovely, the pool is pretty but VERY small considering the number of guests the hotel can accommodate, and the bar at The Top really lacks character and fun (but does have the best views in town). When we visited, we were told the special was Key West Lemonade, which is....? What? Minute Maid on ice? Nobody ever clarified so we had a beer and moved on. It is located right in the middle of all the bars on Duval St, which is good if you like the Duval Crawl but it can get wearisome to fight through the hucksters and gawkers when you just want to get back to your room at 2am. Duval is also insanely crowded when a cruise ship is docked. If you like the Duval bars and shops this might be a plus; we definitely partied on Duval but I kinda wished we were just a block or two away from all the action so it wouldn't be such a battle to get to and from everyplace. I spent the whole trip trying to figure out why I didn't like the La Concha very much. The staff was helpful and gracious, it was clean and relatively comfortable, the location was convenient....it was just so impersonal.

The pool was also very warm, which is not welcome when the temperatures are over 100 in the shade. It was like bathing in skin soup, so we chose to have a cool shower in our room instead.

With my last trip, however, something has changed. Let me start with the good because this is a good hotel. GOOD--- Location. The hotel is right in the middle of all the action. You dont need a rental car or scooter. You can walk to all the bars / restaurants, Hemminways, Mel Fishers, ect. That is a major plus. Lobby is beautiful and for me it sums up what key west is. Pool USED to be quite nice, but maintenance has slipped. Rooms are nice, not huge but if you upgrade 1 level they are quite spacious and nice. BAD--- It appears that this hotel is showing signs of its age. It was built in 1928, and unfortunately it is starting to look it. The lobby is beautiful, but the pool had several cracked / chipped tiles. The rooms were not the cleanest i have seen. Service--- The worst i have had at this hotel so far. One day i left my room at 7:30am and returned at 6pm to find my room was not cleaned. I called and the front desk said it would be cleaned that evening (it wasnt). The next day as well my room was not cleaned. I was leaving that morning, so I didnt press the issue. Guests--- During my visit there was a large group of douchebag frat boys that were loud, rude, and annoying. They had empty beer cans floating in the pool, and were playing beer pong on an inflatable thing that took up half the pool. There were families with kids and i felt bad because these guys were cussing like sailors and being outright rude to all other guests. There needs to be more control over things like that. It appears this hotel is becoming the \"college weekend out\" hotel. So families are being nudged away. By overall recommendation is NOT to stay here, and I wish i could say the opposite because i have had some great stays in the past.

The buffet breakfast in Jacks just about scrapes a mediocre rating, it was never piping hot and the selection was the same every day. We would have gone elsewhere if it hadn't been prepaid. The staff were all courteous and helpful, but we couldn't help but notice that a majority of them were Eastern European. Nothing at all wrong with that, but we rather felt that the Hemingway and Truman connections to the hotel were somewhat sidelined as a result. The lobby area is lovely, but the space is largely wasted when a decent bar would be a major asset. Strange for a largish hotel that the existing bars were on the roof, by the pool and in the restaurant, which seems to operate separately from the hotel. All in all then, it wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't a great one. Would I recommend anyone to stay there - no, but then again I wouldn't recommend them not to.

Which in principle means that your windows are still shaking at 4am? Lovely !!! That's why you get ear plugs together with CD (how to fall in sleep) on your bed when you arrive. Nick at the reception desk tried to persuade me that you receive ear plugs in all Crown Plazas ( ha, ha) Since I have Platinum Priority Club status and I have stayed at Plazas and Intercontinental hotels around the world I took this statement as an offence. I checked the windows and realised that management tried to fix the noise problem (probably in late 70's) with additional single glassing window frame nailed on the original historic windows. Disastrous combination since one more layer of glassing (no silicon between glassing and frame) is vibrating all night long. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funny that USA conquered the moon in 1969 but in 2009 a double or triple glassing that completely eliminates the outside noise is still a science fiction. I have to admit that at 4am we started to smile since the situation was so terrible. Next morning I went to the reception and negotiations on discounts for \"no sleep\" night + additional free breakfasts for our entire stay started and then we were finally moved to the room on the 6th floor overlooking the pool. That side of the hotel is much closer to the Crown Plaza standard, however that room has some issues as well. Pharaon Ants. So we were moved again. This time to the 4th floor overlooking the pool. So at last everything was OK. Final conclusion: No sleep for +300US$ room. No thanks. Rooms overlooking the Duval Street should be removed from ICHotels reservation system since hotel management failed to protect ICH guest from the outside noise, knowing that Duval street is a chalenging environment for hotels like Crowne Platza should be. This is not accaptable. I would wish that CEO of Key West Floridas Hotels llc operating this Crown Platza would sleep in those noisy rooms for at least a week and pay 300+ USD/ night in order to understand the agony its customers.

No mini bar or fridge (at least in our room).

We typically prefer resort type establishments when visiting a location such as Key West, but for the two nights we were going to be there, the price was right and they had a king non-smoking room available, so we booked it. (Hint: even if the web site shows they are sold out, call direct to book because they often have rooms available still) Our Priority Club membership gave us 25% off the normal $20 per night parking rate. Although the hotel was sold out, we were still able to get a spot in their lot. Once we parked we never moved the car until we left Key West. Check-in was pleasant and efficient, and we got what we had reserved. On taking the elevator to the third floor we were a little dismayed to find our room literally in front of the elevator. We were concerned about noise, although in the long run we were never bothered by it. The room overlooked Duval Street, and one of the few negatives was that not only did the windows not open, but they were so dirty that we could barely see what was going on outside. Although there was a street festival going on, we were never bothered by noise from the outside either. The room was very clean except for the windows as previously mentioned. It was also one of the smallest hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. The entire room including the bathroom was under 175 square feet--think the size of a smaller cabin on a cruise ship. It contained a king bed, two small nightstands, a chair, a drop leaf table--there was no room to open the leafs--an armoire with a TV (not flat screen if you are one of those who this type of thing is important to), and another small table with enough room for a coffee maker and highly overpriced bottle of Evian if you were interested in such. The very small closet contained an iron and board as well as a luggage rack, which could only be opened outside the closet due to size constraints. There is no safe in the room for your valuables. Contrary to the Crowne Plaza web site, the rooms do not contain a mini-fridge, and if you order one to be delivered you will be charged $25 per night. We just brought up the small cooler we had in the car and filled it with ice instead--I'm not sure where they would have possibly fit a minifridge in that room anyhow! The bathroom was stocked with four sets of average hotel towels and decent quality toiletries. The lemon scented soap was a nice touch and seemed to fit the style of the hotel. Be warned, the king size bed only has four full sized pillows of average quality. The blanket was a summer weight style and was triple sheeted. The hotel had a great rooftop bar with the \"Larry and Dora\" duo providing entertainment as we all watched the sun set from a great vantage point. We ate at Jack's Seafood Shack off the lobby our first night, the food was so-so, service was about the same. The best part about this hotel is its convenient location. We easily walked to both ends of Duval Street during our short stay. We found several liquor stores, a small grocery store, a pharmacy, and several different banks with ATM's all within a few blocks. It is no more than five blocks from most of the Key West major points of interest, including the Hemingway House, Sloppy Joe's, Hog's Breath, The Little White House, Mallory Square, etc. If you are inclined, the trolley stops within a block of the hotel, although we found it very convenient to just walk everywhere. We would definitely choose the La Concha again for a short trip, although if we were planning on a stay of more than a couple of nights we would probably opt for one of the local resorts (Pier House, Sunset Key, etc.) for a higher level of amenities and a more spacious guest room. I know some people have complained about street noise in previous reviews, we weren't bothered by it at all--although I can see how some very light sleepers would be. The hotel does provide ear plugs, a sleep mask, a sleep CD, and drap clips to keep the room really dark. The rooms has individually controlled central air--no noisy window A/C units. There is a pool, although we never made it there for a swim. For the price in Key West, it was a good value. Other than the location it was actually pretty basic, and as I mentioned earlier, it was by far one of the smallest rooms I've ever had at a hotel. As long as you don't mind the small room you'll probably find the La Concha to your liking. If you are only looking for a clean room to sleep and shower in, the La Concha will be perfect.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!!!!\u201d", "Author": "simpsonvillegirl", "ReviewID": "UR17704947", "Content": "We were first-time Key West travelers and knew nothing about the island.

This was the best room we've had and we'll be requesting it on our future visits! Each morning we sat outside and enjoyed the rising sun and people watching and each night we enjoyed coming home from a long day/night of eating, drinking, shopping, and sight-seeing and doing the same on the balcony.

The pool was nice - it's small but is very clean and has comfortable chairs to lie in and a nice pool bar with music. The water was cool and refreshing, which was nice since the weather was warm and a bit sticky. We flew into Ft.

We didn't eat at the new Jack's restaurant but we did stop in for a drink before retreating to our room and the bartender was lacking personality to say the least.

First time to key west with my husband (were both mid 20's). We booked this hotel for first 3 nights and then The Inn for the 2nd two. This one puts you exactly in the middle of duval. It's about a mile to one side (Beach) and 3/4 a mile to the other (Mallory Square). We walked both ways on separate days; there are tons of shops and places to eat or drink. If you want to stay right near the water, this place is not for you. It's pool should not even be called a pool. It is on the 4th floor and is very very small. Although there is an outdoor bar and a medium area for laying out and tanning. I think the pool is the biggest drawback. Downstairs is a very nice, yet somewhat casual restaurant, and the lobby is very immaculate/grand. Staff was above average and we were even allowed to check in at 1, when normal check in time is 4. The rooms were very clean, and cleaned daily. You can hear vaccums and tv's if loud between rooms, and room size is smaller (as is the first hotel in the area). However, nice beds with sleep cd's provided. We were on the side facing duval and could clearly hear motorcycles, but not people/music. However, if traveling during a peak time, would imagine unless you're a stay up late person, you would not enjoy facing Duval Street. We ordered room service one time, and were pleasantly suprside by very quick service and great quality foods. I even asked for a sandwich not offered and was provided it without question. Bathrooms again small, but nice quality and clean. Paper delivered daily and top quality coffee stocked. There is a starbucks downstairs and parking is, as quoted, 19 dollars a day. Worst part was the 20 dollars extra (on top of parking) for daily service. Our three night stay was quite expensive and is the only downside of this hotel. There was construction during our stay, but we did not see or hear any of it, as some others have reported. Overall: We would definitely stay again.

I arrived about an hour before official check in time (4pm) and though I hold Priority Club's highest frequent guest status, I was told my room was not ready and was asked to return in an hour. That was fine with us, so my boyfriend and I grabbed a late afternoon snack and returned about 4:30pm. I again waited in the line at the front desk and watched as the woman in front of me was told her room wasn't ready, so she was upgraded to a suite. When it was my turn, I was told my room was not ready and asked to return in another hour or hour and a half! I said this would not be possible as my boyfriend and I had restaurant reservations for 6pm and needed to get ready. I was grudgingly given a room literally the size of a closet!!! There was no desk or work space. The tv was in a cabinet in the corner of the room and from the bed, only the person closest could view it. The tv remote didn't work. We attempted to get ready for our dinner. The power was off. I called the front desk and was told it would be on shortly. No apology offered. About 15 minutes later, the power came on. Then, there was NO water!!! Again, a call to the front desk and no apology offered. I was told the water was back on but \"it will take a while to reach the 5th floor.\" We never got to shower before our dinner reservation. We returned to the hotel 9:30pm, with the wish to finally take a shower. ICE COLD water. Again, a call to the front desk, who explained because the power and water had been off, it would take a while for the water to heat. No apology. We ended up sleeping, never having had a shower. Each time the a/c cycled it woke us up. It sounded like a 747 coming in for a landing. In the morning, I looked for my newspaper that is always included for frequent guest members. Nothing. We check out with an unpleasant front desk clerk at 8:30am. I asked about the newspaper and was told they \"had just arrived.\" He never offered to get me one. All this cost me $169 for a mid-week one night stay. I will NEVER return to this unpleasant hotel.

The hotel has a wonderful decor lobby and pleasant clerks working the front desk. The concierge was quick to give us tips of how to get around the key. This hotel is rated as 4 star and indeed it is... is right on Duval just steps from many stores/ bars / and restaurants... One doesn't need a car to get around.. At most rent a moped or a small golf cart to get you around but everything is within walking distance. Our room was perfect, facing Duval street. We had a king size bed and the decor was very soothing. The bed and linens were phenomenal it felt like if you were sleeping at home. The also offer a cd to relax and soothe you while you sleep.... the room had all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The bathroom was spacious and overall the room was very clean and smelled fresh. The best part is that this is one of the haunted hotels on Key West and we were told that our room was visited by ghost every so often.... If you leave loose change around, you will find that they get rearranged.. well we did just that and up to the minute we went to sleep they had not been touched, however, in the morning it was a different story.. don't know what happened and we guess we never will.... Oh.. also try the Ghost Tour.. is really nice and the stories are funny.... bare in mind there is a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes..... this key caters to Adults.... there is much partying happening every night.. I didn't see anything for children.... While in the Keys visit the Hard Rock Cafe.. a great spot to grab a drink and guess what you are able to take your drinks out and walk to the next bar... We also found a cute little Cuban restaurant by Mallory Square.. try it the food was plentiful and delicious.... By the way... while at the Hotel try the bar on the top floor, the drinks are great and the view is to die for.. the pool at this hotel looks nothing like the website.. this pool is very small, but there is plenty of lounge chairs to take in the sun.. oh and it has a bar tooo...... the beach is rocky so bring your aqua shoes, but the water is clear and very warm..... oh and there is also a parking fee of $18.00 per day..

We were driving through the keys and south Florida and of course, Key West was one of our stops. I wasn't sure I should write a review since we only stayed one night, but I was so impressed that I had to share our experience. We did not have reservations and when we arrived in Key West we first stopped at a Courtyard which was about 2-3 miles from Duval street, which is the where the action is. I thought we would get a good rate there because of the distacne to Duval St. However, they wanted over $200/nt. So we drove on. We went down Duval and decided to try the Crown Plaza. The lobby was very nice and had a historic feel. The front desk was very helpful and within minutes had us booked for the night for a very reasonable rate. The concierge immediatley approached us and welcomed us the the hotel. She then gave us a large list of restaurants/bars that are in the area and how to get there. The hallways to the rooms made is seem like you were in a past time zone. The room itself was just average size, but was very clean and had very nice decor. The hotel and a resaurant/bar attached to it that had some entertainment. We sat in there for a while and it was comfortable. The Location of the hotel is the best part. It is located right on Duval street and in the middle of all the action. All you have to do is walk out of the hotel in any direction and immediatley you are experiencing Key West. There are many, many bars/restaurants located within a couple blocks of the hotel. We decied to eat at a place I believe was called the Raw Bar which was located right on the waterfront. I was fantastic. Especially if you are an Oyster person. Many different kinds of oysters and even an oyster shot if you are up to it. This was only a 10-15min walk from the hotel. We were both very satisfied with the Crown Plaza. I wish we would have stayed another night in Key West.
