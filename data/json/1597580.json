Yes it does not look like a great area on first impressions however this is only first impressions. Its really only an easy 10 minute walk to the beach and many lovely seafood restaurants. Once at the beach its only a short walk to Port Olympic and the lovely marina.We were only staying one night and have been to Barcelona a few times therefore it was nice to be away from the normal touristy areas. The rooms are spacious and similar to Premier Inn in the Uk, ie clean ,basic and modern. There are no amenities in the room ie no fridge, teamaking although you can upgrade to a superior room. The bar area is very small and doubles up as the hub for internet users. The bar staff are very helpful and friendly , they make great Mojitos and have cava and wine by the glass for just a few euros. We ate out at a great seafood restaurant across the main road from McDonalds.The breakfast was continental buffet ,plenty of pastries ,ham,cheese etc.The hotel is a good base for a short stay in Barcelona ,pre/post cruise or short stay.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cNear the beach\u201d", "Author": "GramsBarb", "ReviewID": "UR127862342", "Content": "This hotel is only a couple of blocks from the beach but is in a questionable neighborhood with not much around.

Luckily, there was a large window that opened to allow for cooling down the room. It seems many European hotels do not now include breakfast. This hotel had a breakfast buffet that was 18 euros (about $25 US). They had a special where you could get breakfast for only 9 euros but only if you signed up for your whole stay.

I had my purse stolen within first half in hour in Barcelona - on a train from the airport. A total disaster as you can imagine. I felt sick all of the first night, could not sleep, felt very hot (adrenaline and stress of being a victim of a robbery) so I called the reception at about 3 am asking them politely for some water. I was refused. Bar was closed apparently and that there were vending machines I can get some water from. Now with no money - as all was stolen from me - that was a bit difficult. I have explained and was told that they can't help me and if I am thirsty I should drink a tap water from the bathroom sink!!! Now that is not a 4 star hotel treatment! Furthermore, hotel had been infused in some sort of strange smell... also just next door to the cemetery. And the cost of breakfast - extreme! Euro 15 per person! or a more \"affordable\" Euro 9 if you take it every morning of your stay! Having asked to be given a one day discounted rate whilst we sort ourselves out after the robbery - they refused. We chose to go hungry over paying 30 Euros to gave a pastry and coffee each.

What a pleasure! Built in 2010 with all the amenities that one could hope for: excellent front desk service, modern elevators, FREE wi-fi, a clean fitness center with plenty of towels. The only drawback there was that one of the main pieces of equipment needed some TLC. Our room was fairly spacious (like one would find in the U.S.), and very clean. AC wasn't on because it seems that all of Europe thinks that once the calendar hits a particular day, there's no need for AC. That was OK, though. We always carry our trusty small fan. We chose to purchase their breakfast/dinner package. Again, excellent choice! Breakfast was plentiful; and dinner was a surprising experience from wine to dessert. The hotel is a bit away from the Las Ramblas area, but was OK with us because we had done that so many times. In its place was a view from our window which looked out over the cemetery to the Mediterranean which was only about three blocks away. Each day, my wife and I would walk to the sea and turn onto the walking path which skirted the sea and went for miles.

LOCATION: Firstly the hotel is about a 25 minute cab ride from the airport, secondly it\u2019s located near the seafront in a mainly urban area, which is rather run down, there is nothing in the way of shops, bars or restaurants near by, you'll have to take a taxi into the town for that. (And on the subject of taxi's, I used several over the three days I was in Barcelona, and none of the taxi drivers knew where the hotel was! Thank goodness for sat-nav!) HOTEL The hotel itself is smart, clean and very business like in appearance, however, luxurious it isn\u2019t, and I'll be honest I think the \u20184 stars\u2019 rating is very optimistic. RECEPTION Reception is manned by friendly (mostly) English speaking staff. BUSINESS CENTRE The 'Business Centre' on the ground floor is a let down, two old HP pc's running Vista (and remember, its all in Spanish, including the keyboard layout) does not make a business centre, there are no fax or other facilities, just a some tables and chairs - more of an internet room. WI-FI The hotel does offer free wi-fi throughout, but be prepared to log back in as the system times you out regularly. HOTEL ROOMS The rooms themselves are spread 26 per floor over 7 floors, the views from the top floor of the seafront are very nice, but be aware, the hotel is situated in front of a very large cemetery! I booked a superior room, and it was large, well aired, with a very large and comfortable bed, good (if rather complicated) air-conditioning, but alas no bath, what is it with European hotels, showers are great but really, no bath, come on! And don't expect a mini-bar, or a fridge, or even tea and coffee making facilities, because there aren\u2019t any, which seems rather stingy (for a 4 star hotel) to me. FOOD Food, a very limited menu, repeated each day, so not much in the way of variety there. A bizarre twist on the \u2018room service\u2019 offering, room service that\u2019s only open between 8pm and 11pm, and overpriced, expect to pay twelve euros for a burger and chips. Breakfast was better, if a bit crowded, and only a two hour sitting so no time to dawdle! The usual 'continental' fare here, but perfectly edible. GYM On the lower ground floor is a well equipped gym, free to paying guests. PARKING There are also car parking spacing in a lower parking basement under the hotel for guests bringing cars. There are \u2018on street\u2019 spaces outside the hotel as well. SUMMERY To sum up, located too far from the centre of town and attractions to be a true tourist hotel, but also too far from the business area to appeal to business travellers. To under equipped for those 4 stars so I'm not quite sure what category this hotel falls into, and when I'm back in Barcelona I'll try somewhere else, not because the hotel wasn\u2019t any good, it just wasn\u2019t good enough, with too many annoying little things that add up to a stay that leaves you feeling like you could have had better\u2026", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chania Town, Greece", "Title": "\u201cOasis!\u201d", "Author": "fionapapa", "ReviewID": "UR120987785", "Content": "Although situated a little distance from anything noteworthy, this hotel is easily accessible due to Barcelona's fabulous metro system and buses so we had absolutely no problem getting around.

The room was spacious and the amenities in the bathroom were some of the best I've come across. Towels and linen were changed every day, although this could be limited due to environmental concerns. The breakfast was tasty but not worth the 15 euro it apparently costs (we didn't pay for the breakfast as we had booked a last-minute special deal which was the room and b'fast for under 60% of normal rates). All the breakfast consists of is a variety of pastries, cheeses, cold-cuts, fruit, boiled eggs and fritattas. As mentioned, tasty but could definitely be improved. The hotel staff are also very prompt. When our room safe broke down, they came within 20 minutes (on a Sunday morning) to repair it. The only thing I really didn't like was that their business centre doesn't have a printer. If you want to print out documents, you need to email them to the front desk and they print it out for you.

Surrounded by run down, boarded or vandalised shops and apartments, this hotel sticks out as being in the wrong place. The hotel itself is average.

However, be warned if you don;t like hot hotels, avoid this one. The aircon does not work in the winter months as they switch it off - even though the temperatiure in my room according to the stat was 28 degrees!! \"open the window\" the reception staff suggest - but when you do the noise is bad from the surrounding roads, or the beautiful view of a petrol station. (yes I know the photo's show the sea, but three sides of the hotel look over classic sites - the block of run down apartments to the right, the run down street to the back, and the petrol station to the left) Walls and floors are typically paper thin - you can hear people shower, wash and pee. Not good. Other peoples TVs are clear through walls, people above you can hear tip toeing around... not good. No ironing board either, so instead a paid for, maid ironing service. But you do get wireless in the price. (but don't expect much from it) Breakfast is typical continental fayre, and to be fair everything was very good, even the coffee which is always a problem in hotels.

Usually this takes us about two hours, now it took us four days. With every hotel we looked at in booking.com, tripadvisor etc. something was wrong either the hotel was good but the price was too high or the price was good enough for us but the hotel had some issues like a bad neighbourhood, lousy staff, small rooms, no airco etc. In the end we almost wanted to give up when we found GBB hotel 4 hotel. The hotel is a little from the center but very close to the beach. While we didn't intent to have a beach holiday it did give us access on walking-distance to some very good nicely price seafood restaurants :-). The center of the city is easily accessible by the subway (about five to ten minutes walk) although if you intent to dine out a lot in the center be prepared to make use of taxi as the public transport closes early (between 23.00 and 23.30). The hotel itself is new and has a modern styling. All the staff members were very friendly. Room service is until 22.00 but in case you are very hungry you can walk in five minutes to McDonald\u2019s in case that is of interest to you ;-). The hotel apparently offers a discount on the breakfast if you stay for more than three days. In that case you pay 9 euro per person instead of 14 euro\u2019s. While better value breakfast might be available in some local bars around the hotel we decided to take the breakfast. It is above average hotel food. The restaurant area is ok compared to the size of the hotel but it can be busy between 09.00 and 10.00. It is possible to dine in the hotel. While we didn\u2019t did it (the seafood restaurants at the beach were too good) many guests seemed to enjoy there dinner. The room was extremely clean and all the things you can expect are there except (mostly for British people?) perhaps the lack of tea and coffee making facilities. Also there is no mini-bar (we never use it anyway). There are vending machines for drinks on the 3rd and 7th floor where the drinks are very reasonable priced (1 euro for a bottle of water). If we have to nitpick perhaps two bathrobes should have been in the room for a four star hotel and the selection of tv-channels was not so interesting for us (about 15 channels mostly German, Spanish and some English). We have to mention the bed and pillows separately: they were most comfortable about the best we have experienced in a hotel. Note: it is possible to have a mini-bar, bathrobes, tea and coffee making facilities but the you either have to \u2018upgrade\u2019 your room when you check in or book a superior room in the first place. We had some trouble with the airco and the hotel staff tried to fix it but it was of no use. It remained warm (23-24 degrees) the whole time. Maybe because we visited after summer the airco can only warm the air? (like you sometimes see in other hotels). Note 2: The taxi ride from and to the hotel is about 30 \u2013 40 euro\u2019s. During the day there are plenty of taxi\u2019s outside the hotel so there is no need to make reservations.

It is five minutes walk to the Metro stop of Llacuna, which will take you to the major sightseeing areas within fifteen minutes, and five minutes from the excellent beach that has all the facilities one could wish for. The number 14 bus that stops two minutes from the hotel will take you the scenic route to Las Ramblas and on. The hotel itself is very clean, comfortable and the rooms large enough for a week\u2019s stay. It would appear to be business orientated in view of the emphasised facilities and the lack of actual cupboard space, just the open shelves, which my wife and I do not like. However, that is purely a personal opinion, as we like some privacy for our belongings and protection for clothing that can get dusty. The breakfast is what one would wish, except that the hot food was warm. This was a pity as the tortilla and the bacon would have been excellent. There is free internet access, which is a bonus, and wi-fi throughout the hotel. The staff are very welcoming, polite and helpful, even to printing off our boarding passes for the flight home free of charge. We had a small problem with our shower the first day that was settled within half an hour. We did not eat in the restaurant, but the menu looked very acceptable and not overpriced. What is confusing is the variation in the prices for rooms and breakfast. The room we had was around \u20ac200 a night, yet because we stayed for six days the price was based on three different rates, the average of which was what we paid - around \u20ac66 per night. We could not have calculated that prior to booking and we were very pleasantly surprised, but a little confused. Also the breakfast at the quoted price of \u20ac15 was very high, but if you stay for more than a certain number of nights it drops to \u20ac9, which is good value. Again, we have no complaints whatsoever, but it does show that it is possibly more business-person orientated, although most of the guests were there for only two or three nights with one coach party there for nearly a week. There are some excellent eateries nearby, especially on the seafront. Caf\u00e9s abound if you wish to eat breakfast out of the hotel. If you like fish, it is piscatorial heaven. The best places we found were both Monchos. The first, on the right along the beach from behind the hotel where the a-la-carte covers most tastes - try the freshly fried whitebait - and then there is our favourite, \u2018Vitamins of the Sea\u2019 at Port Olympic, another few minutes along the beach, where a fantastic set meal for around \u20ac13.80 is enormous and even the locals could not do it justice. There is a tapas-type starter and salad that are not just tasters, but large enough individual dishes to almost constitute a whole meal on their own. Then the Paella that would feed the 5000, followed by a thankfully simple, but very tasty Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and a small coffee. On top of all that, a drink was included. The other area to eat, away from the beach, is the Rambla del Poblenou, again just five minutes walk away. Here you can find a good mix of restaurants from the burger-joint to quite pricey restaurants. For a good, cheap and filling meal, around \u20ac8, try the Lebanese \u2018Arwad\u2019.- the basmati rice is delicious.

I could not have been more pleased with my choice and the overall experience! Before selecting a hotel, I read hundreds of reviews and looked for a well priced option with good reviews that would allow two women (my cousin and I) traveling alone to feel safe. I'd literally read reviews from other locations that said they were mugged in the lobby and stuff had been stolen out of their locked safes. Crazy! We found exactly what we were looking for and much more at the GBB Hotel 4! Security & Safety: We felt very safe in the neighborhood and the hotel had a security guard in the late hours. The in room safe was easy to use and while we had a few problems with it, probably 1 of only a few faulty safes in the entire hotel, I was thoroughly impressed with the staffs response! The safes batteries died twice during our 2 day stay and when we were ready to leave and lock up our stuff, the hotel didn't have anymore on hand to replace the batteries. Apparently only 2 people at the hotel had the access or knowledge to fix it or activate the emergency override. I was extremely pleased that they didn't pass out the code to more staff. As an alternative, the hotel staff locked our computer and passports up in the hotel office. On the second occassion, when we needed them to use the emergency override, the manager came to access the safe and brought us a free bottle of wine for our troubles. Service: The staff were excellent! They were incredibly helpful! They organized a rental car for us, brought us wine when we had a problem, gave us directions and offered suggestions. Could not have been more pleased with the staff! Location: Incredibly convenient to the metro and incredibly convenient to the Center City. Literally, a 5 min walk and a 7-10 minute ride to Jaume I just outside the Gothic Quarter. The beach was much closer than we thought, max a 6 minute walk. The Bus Touristic picks up 2 minutes around the corner which was incredibly convenient. And, there's an incredible local restaurant between the hotel and the metro. By far, the best meal we had on our trip! Value: We booked over 1 month out, online through the hotel and got a great deal. I loved the free wifi, which was easy to use. The breakfast was delicious, although the dining area was quite full and I wouldn't pay full price for it. (We didn't pay full price though and never have to wait for a table though.) Recommendations for improvement/cons: The rooms were sparse and a bit smaller than an American is used to. Ours consisted of 2 twin beds, a desk, a side chair, night stands, telephone and a flat screen tv. Very clean and modern, but nothing special and no \"wow\" factor. There wasn't a clock. They really should buy clocks. The safe was on one of the shelves in the closet, again very easy to use but didn't come with directions so I had to ask the front desk. They could easily print out and laminate a directions card. The beds were a tad hard, but probably typical of a Spanish hotel. The pillows weren't as soft/large/nice as I'd like, were I focused on sleeping in. Additionally, there were only 2 bath towels. Being a women with long hair, I like to have a second towel. Then again, we didn't bother to ask for extras. And, the toiletries weren't replaced as we used them. If the soaps gone, I'd like more. However, there were a lot more toiletries than I'd typically expect, e.g. they included a toothbrush. Finally, they charged 5 Euro for the fitness room/spa (sauna) which I thought was rather silly. And, the sauna closed at 9 pm. If they didn't charge for it, they wouldn't need a dedicated staffer to sit there and collect the money, therefore being able to keep it open later. It did look clean though. I recognize that many of these are very nitpicky things, but important to consider depending on the type of vacation you're planning. In conclusion, we had a great time in Barcelona and were incredibly happy that we choose the Hotel GBB 4. While the rooms lacked the \"wow\" factor that one might normally get at a 4 star hotel, I'd strongly recommend this hotel for anyone that didn't intend to spend their vacation in their hotel room!", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel - perfect for a reserved romantic summer break\u201d", "Author": "ajalexjackson", "ReviewID": "UR110375416", "Content": "Never has a hotel compelled me to actually get on the internet and write a review. Without sounding hysterical, it was fabulous! A great find, perfect for a romantic break, in a great location for a quiet break. The hotel itself is smart and modern, with exceptionally clean rooms. The bathroom was spotless, with a modern, spacious shower and very linear basin. The facilities are not plentiful, however, what they have is delivered to the highest standard. The business centre is a nice size, with free internet access and the restaurant and room service were absolutely top quality for the pretty meagre prices charged. A sidenote here, is the quick, late night meal I decided to order after not getting a great meal out in town. I decided on a hamburger with potato wedges and onion rings for a light bite and for 12e didn't expect a huge deal. But 10 minutes later came up what can only be desribed as a gourmet burger, which melted in the mouth. So much so, my partner, who minutes earlier had refused a snack, decided that she would now like one too! I have seen reviews here that have mentioned the staff being rude - I cannot say this is something we encountered. In fact, our experience was quite the opposite. The staff were very friendly, understanding with our lack of linguistic prowess (we both speak no Spanish, at all) and were generally very helpful. In fact, they enhusiastically helped to translate where needed and pointed us in the right direction on a few occasions. In conclusion, I'd recommend this hotel to couples, who like romantic walks down the beach (there are some lovely restaurants and bars, including Inercia Beach Bar, which was very good). It is in a location where you are not in the thick of things, however, with relatively short walk (beach area, Gran Casino, Barceloneta, Diagonal Mar) or approx 7-10e taxi trip (zoo, aquarium, parks, restaurants, la ramblas) it is in a location where things are quite cheap to get to. Also, the Barcelona Bus Turistic passes in the street adjacent to the hotel. So for 30e for two days you can hop on/off 3 mapped routes and see the sites such as the Camp Nou, which is breathtaking for any football fan, the Segunda Famillia etc, so the sites are in reach, and makes this hotel even more attractive for the culture vultures. Already planning to go back next year with friends - as we would love to show off the area, the city and the hotel, which quite frankly for the price, is an absolute steal!

I have only a couple of minor grumbles... the wireless was hit and miss in the room but fine downstairs and the hotel will lend you a cable to plug laptop in. I would expect a 4 star hotel to have tea/coffee facility in the room, its nice sometimes to make a cuppa when you want it. The aircon was a bit temperamental, dont think it was really working, tho we only tried to use it once, it wasn't reported. Value for money!", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGem of a hotel for a great price\u201d", "Author": "Gemzy_Wemzy", "ReviewID": "UR100007602", "Content": "We've just got back from this hotel and have not got a bad thing to say about it really. Having read a few mixed reviews before we went we were not sure about what to expect. All in all it cost use \u00a3120 for two nights, which for a 4* hotel in Barcelona is rather cheap. Check In- Said on the reservation sheet from 3pm onwards. We arrived at about 1:30pm thinking we'd have to hang around a bit. No problems, checked in quickly and painlessly by a very friendly member of staff. Room- Exceptionally clean and well presented. Bathroom in ours was a wet room and was very nice. Very heavy blackout curtain meant that no light got into the room so a good night's sleep (only problem being that the blackness is so thick that if you wake up middle of the night you won't see anything). The TV is nice (only English channels being the news ones) but when you go away you don't go to watch TV. Free Wi-Fi is fantastic. Restaurant/Food- We didn't have breakfast so can't really comment on that aspect. We did, however eat in their for our evening meal on one night. The food was excellent and we were well catered for. It was very quiet so the waiter seemed a bit bored and spent a lot of time with other staff in the kitchen but he seemed more than helpful when asked for something. Cafe in the hotel is a tad overpriced for the quality of the coffee (maybe because we found a gorgeous cheap cafe by Tredeaguer metro station the day before). Location- Really close to Llacuna metro station, literally straight walk up the road. We bought a T-10 metro card for 8.25 euros which covered our transfer from/to airport and all the journeys we wanted on the metro while we were there. If you have to transfer lines it doesn't charge twice, as long as you take the trip within 1 hour and don't leave the metro system. The Renefe train drops you off at Passeg de Gracia and you just transfer to yellow L4 to get to Llacuna station. It really is simple. This is much cheaper than getting a taxi or shuttle bus. The hotel itself is outside of the main centre in the business district and after reading reviews I was led to believe it was too far. On our first day we decided to walk to the beach (a very short walk from the hotel) and walk down the front to Port Olimpic. We then decided to walk a bit further and before we knew it we were at Port Vell and into the main centre. It must have taken us about 20-30 mins to walk from the hotel to Barcelona Catedral which is not that bad if you like walking. For those lazy people among us the metro links to Jaume I station in about 5 minutes. Staff- No complaints, really friendly and willing to do anything for you. In general I loved this hotel and will definately visit again next time I go to Barcelona.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value hotel\u201d", "Author": "JB27UKTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR99707286", "Content": "I booked this hotel after reading mainly positive review on this site, and was not disappointed - it provided a good value base for a long weekend in Barcelona.

The bedrooms are beautiful, decorated with wonderful paintings of barcelona and a very decent bed. We stayed at the 6the floor and had a breathtaking view over the city. We saw the port, montjuic and the sagrada familia. Especially at night with all the lights it was just amazing. The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that their staff is just rude. At check inn we encountered a reception lady who was very unfriendly. When we asked questions about breakfast and early checkout (we needed to catch our plain) we were answered in a very rude way. At the breakfast buffet the twe stafmembers where talking to eachother and did not greet the gast entering the restaurant. We did not get any explanation about where to get coffee. Together with another guest we searched for the coffeemachine and how to use it. After that we spend 15 minutes trying to get some toast. The toastmachine was turned of and we did not get it to work.

It was a surprise christmas present for her. I booked early to receive the Early booking rate and was surprised at finding a hotel with such good value in Barcelona with such good service! We arrived around 11pm due to a delayed flight and the recpetionist greeted us warmly and checked us in, giving us all the information we needed. There are two or three lifts in the hotel to get to the various floors. Rooms are on floors 1 -7, Restaurant is on Floor 1, Reception and Bar on ground. Floor -1 is the gym /sauna/toilets. When we headed up to our room it was modern and bright. It was one fo the \"smaller\" rooms in the hotel but not too small. All modern things in the room - Safe that you pick the code for, 26\" flat screen with 3 or 4 english channels, plenty of spanish, german and french channels too. Bathroom was sparkling - looked like it had just been plumbed in the day before. Maid service came in every day, changed towels twice during our 4 day stay. Free box of disposable shavers / shampoo / tissues was a nice touch also. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom also - one of those \"screwed to the wall\" variety. Was useful to have to lighten the suitcases =]. Very comfortable bed in the room, and lots of cupboard space for hanging clothes and such. The view was good also. (See pictures) In the summer it would be very bright and would provide lovely views of the sea and over all of the city of Barcelona. The restaurant was the only thing that slightly lowered the rating of the hotel. The menu is quite limited and expensive for what it is - although it's still worth a try. We never tried breakfast in the hotel - we just got it out in Barcelona. - The location of the hotel is fantastic for getting to the beach - out the door then a five minute walk to golden sand. (Sadly the walk is past a McDonalds) For getting to the city centre the hotel is 3 blocks (roughly 10 mins) walk from the Llacuna metro station. This takes 10 mins to get to the city centre (Passieg de Gracia). Over the four nights there were a number of different front desk staff on duty and i must have asked each one a different question and all were more than happy to assist me, with maps and information about how to find a place in barcelona, they also kept our suitcases on the last day after checkout as we had a late flight from the airport.

The breakfast compared to the other 4 star hotels we stayed in Europe was quite poor, not much variety and we had to wait for a seat to sit down in their little restaurant. The reason i choose this hotel was its proximity to Port Olympic and the Beach based on reviews from here. It wasn't as close as I thought, the location of a hotel is in a run down industrial area of Barcelona with homeless people living across the road.

Our room was just perfect, nice decor, modern but warm, bright paintings, a view from our window of the sea to the left and the mountains to the right. To my delight there was a bath not just a shower for relaxing in after a long day out, lots of nice complimentary products such as bath foam and even razors and the towels were nice and soft. It was a 10 minute walk maximum to Port Olympic (depending on how far along you choose to walk) where there were lots of bars and restaurants, also some nice beach bars and tapas bars on the promenade leading to Port Olympic. My boyfriend and I enjoy walking and weren't in a rush to get anywhere in particular, we managed to walk the next day from the hotel to the Gothic Quarter, down Las Ramblas and back to Port Olympic. We took a lot in along the way and this suited us, though it is easy to get a Metro from near the hotel or a bus if you prefer. There is the Bus Turistic which we nearly got but then didn't, about 20 euros I think plus you can get a discount if you book at the hotel with vouchers you will find in a stand next to the lifts with lots of tourist information. I would probably recommend this if you think you will use it for a few stops, especially for Park Guell as it is on the far side of the city and once you are there there is a lot of walking to do and it is beautiful with amazing views over the whole city and ocean. I would recommend taking a picnic as you could spend all day there, there is a cafe serving snacks and beers but can get quite busy. If you don't think you will use the Bus Turistic much and don't want to spend 20 euros but want to go to Park Guell, you can get the 92 bus from the centre of town, it is 1 euro 40 each way and recommended for the uphill struggle to get there! We ended up walking back though. The restaurant in the hotel was also very nice to sit in, breakfast was great, nice fresh fruit, yogurt, eggs, breads, preserves, juice, coffee, tortilla, pastries, cheeses and cold meats. The breakfast staff were very pleasant as were the house keeping staff. There is also free internet which is very useful for making ongoing travel arrangements etc. We unfortunately didn't get the chance to use the sauna or steam room but had a look and they did look very appealing! There is a shop 2 minutes away if you are stuck for something like lady's things which I was, or water or a cold drink amongst general groceries. We didn't really use the bar or lounge at the hotel, it was nice but we preferred to go out and about to drink and eat. If we had been staying longer I think we would have used the lounge bar at some point as it was relaxed and we felt welcome. So, in conclusion - I know some reviews have said the hotel was too far from the city - not for us. We liked the fact that we could leave the city behind and in the evening enjoy our own little bit of Barcelona i.e Port Olympic, the beach bars and harbour,then walk 5 minutes to our hotel. Some reviews complained about a graveyard but I didn't even notice one and anyway, graveyards are peaceful so I don't see the problem. I would definitely definitely stay here again. I would highly recommend it to beach goers and I would highly recommend it to non beach goers because it is a lovely hotel with lovely staff and very cumfy beds! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I didn't feel that there was an evening restaurant as such - but then with so many places to eat in Barcelona who cares! Plus, breakfast was great and there is a lounge menu if for any reason you can't go out at night to eat or you just fancy a snack. Also, Park Cituedella is very close and beautiful, we went rowing in the pond with the ducks and terrapins! 6 euros for half an hour and what fun, Barcelona is big and there is a lot to see but you don't have to go far from the hotel to have a great time.", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOnly one word for this hotel - Excellent!!\u201d", "Author": "Aqueous27", "ReviewID": "UR77985309", "Content": "Myself and my Partner stayed at the GBB Hotel 4 for 3 nights (18th - 20th August 2010) and had a fantastic stay.

Also, when i accidentally dropped a glass in the bathroom in the middle of the night, the evening staff were also very courtious. Our stay included breakfast which was completely worth it! I've never seen so many cakes, pastries and fresh bread. Lots of choice, cereals, yoghurt, fresh fruit and fruit juice as well as some 'hot' items like scrambled egg and mini sausages - enough to last until lunch and beyond. The hotel room was beautiful. We had a twin room with a view to the sea. The hotel is very quiet and we were not disturbed at all - got some lovely sleep after all our sight seeing and spending time on the beach.

Next time I would go in Spring or late autumn as too hot for me to walk in high summer!", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel-Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "LovelyPrissana", "ReviewID": "UR75669138", "Content": "My boyfriend and I spent 5 nights in this beautiful hotel.

However, I feel safe even at night and able to walk safely to the nearest station. The hotel faces to the ocean and the graveyard. As the room I stayed was not the ocean view, I couldn\u2019t see the ocean over the graveyard (I thought it would be beautiful), but I could see the Sagrada Familia in the distance from my room. I stayed at a tiny double room, windows are dirty, and I didn\u2019t want to spend a long time in this room. Also, a view from my room was not very beautiful, just an unattractive residential area. I recommend you to request a room (ocean view or the other) when you check-in. Japanese tour groups also stayed at this hotel and I was assigned to the room next to one of the Japanese tour guests. Be careful when you use a bathroom since the bathroom door is a frosted glass and there is a gap around the door. The rich amenities were very helpful. There were varieties of dishes for the breakfast and I was satisfied with it. My favorites were prosciutto and salamis. Finally, as other reviewers also reported, a/c was not controllable. I tried to adjust the setting with reading a manual, but the temperature setting changed back automatically and it was very hot. As the summer approaches, a/c setting should be improved. Also, I was very uncomfortable with the strong perfume smell in my room. I was wondering if they perfume the bed sheets and covers. Since the room has poor ventilation, it would be hard for those who have sensitive nose. This is a brand new hotel, and I hope they will improve their facilities and services in the future.

The location was perfect in a nice quite area with a metro station nearby to access all that Barcelona has to offer. The staff were very friendly and could not have done more to make our stay enjoyable. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we like to explore little cafes for this but we did eat in the restaurant in the evenings and it was of excellent quality and very reasonable. If i was to have one small issue with the hotel it is the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms but that is very minor and i would have no problem whatever in recommending Hotel 4 very highly.

Very modern room and bathroom. Not to mention that it is brand new. The amenities were wonderful. There is a \"spa area\" (sauna and steaming room) that is sooo nice and clean, I loved it ! Great for relaxing after a long day of walk around Barcelona. The staff was nice all the times even with my poor Spanish they never gave up on trying to understand what I needed. The TV has lots of channels. The only negative thing is the location. It is kind of far from everything. You are supposed to leave the subway and walk 3 blocks to get to the hotel, but I took a wrong exit on the subway and got really lost! Nobody knows that street where the hotel is!! It is incredible. So I couldnt go back because people didnt know how to help me! I had to walk 45 minutes to find the hotel again because taxis wont stop for you in the streets of Spain, (you have to call them). So get a good map and memorize the way from hotel to the subway station.

We were on the 6th floor with a sea view. Big room, twin beds pushed together making a very large, comfortable sleeping area. Good sized bathroom, walk-in shower, plenty of hot water and fresh white towels. Breakfast was included which had something for every taste and plenty of it. Staff all very pleasant and helpful. We had dinner in the hotel, three courses each with choice of three, wine, water and coffee for 15euros - excellent! The location is a 10 min walk from Llacuna metro through an industrial area. Not particulary pretty but didn't feel unsafe. They are doing a lot of improvements in the area. Walk from the hotel to the beach is much nicer where you will find many eating places. A stroll along the seafront to La Rambla will take about an hour. My only critisism is that breakfast finishes at 10.30 and right on the button they start to clear everything away, even the morning it was very busy and we had to queue to get a table. Maybe they could be a little more relaxed with the time. We would return to this hotel in a instant, a little out of the centre but easy access to all the attractions.
