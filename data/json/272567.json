The concierge was very friendly as was all the staff behind the desk. They set us up with a private tour of a Murano glass factory as well as a water taxi to the island. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well kept. All the staff were courteous and great to deal with.

On the left of that plaza there is a coffee shop that has good service and continental breakfast fare. We thought we were getting good value for the money. and their milk coffee (Milk with coffee) was outstanding. The boss speaks and understands English. If you go there, tell them Stefan from the hotel papadopo;i sent you. You will get their attention as far as service is concerned. On the same plaza to the right there is a food joint we suggest you do not frequent. They had more than 10 tables open after 9 pm one night. my wife and daughter wanted a drink and sit and read a book outside. We were told: Dinner only! and shoed away by the server. We retreated inside the hotel papadopoli, had a drink there and read our books at the bar. Even though it was cozy and comfortable inside the hotel, we would have rather been outdoors, which the waiter at the food joint wrecked. SO: DON'T GO THERE. Our nicest dining experience during our stay was right after the before mentioned plaza. There is a restaurant not very far down the alley on the left. The food was great, the service superb, and the value was good.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malibu, California", "Title": "\u201cPerfection!!!\u201d", "Author": "califonriagirl", "ReviewID": "UR71385820", "Content": "It was our first trip to italy and we ended up staying an extra night in Venice.
