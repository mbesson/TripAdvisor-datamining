{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wen Tao, means Loud and No Shower I stayed here for 3 nights in November, 2008. I got to the hotel at 1:00 AM and it took 30 minutes to check-in. I pre-paid on a hotel service website, they tell you to bring a print-out of your voucher and invoice, I did that. The desk clerk spoke extremely minimal English, she could not understand I already paid online. Although it was 1:00 AM I had her try to call some of my friends in China to help, but everyone was sleep or busy. Luckily one friend was able to help and after a frustrating 30 minutes, the clerk told me to pay 300 RMB for the night and I could get the problem fixed the next day. I walked into my room about 1:30 AM and within literally 2 minutes the room phone rang, some lady asking if I wanted a foot massage. I just flew 18 hours and struggled to check-in, at 1:30 AM all I wanted was sleep.Cons:1) Room floor and walls were rather dirty. I have been to China several times and walls are usually a little dirty in 3-star type hotels, but here was more dirty than usual for Beijing.2) Twice a night calls for either a foot or back massage, I didn't like the constant telemarketing up-sell attempts, the last night I unplugged the phone.3) Major con - the hotel is connected to a disco / ktv. Every night there the walls vibrated from 10:00 PM (22:00) to 02:00 AM when the disco closed. I basically did not get good sleep until after 2:00 AM. I asked to change rooms to the back of the hotel and they just gave me a room on a higher floor, but still in front. With their limited English, I didn't feel like fighting it and just accepted my fate.4) I could not shower for the two days there, my shower did not work, the hot water pressure was non-existent. Washed out of the sink for two days.5) Minor cons - Only one English TV channel, tv picture in both rooms were not great, no hotel restaurant, not close to any train system, desk staff spoke minimal English at best, far from the airport.6) No room temperature control or A/C, you're forced to what they set.PROS:1) A lot of restaurants close2) Although their English was not great, the desk staff was very nice and tried to be helpful3) I got my 300 RMB returnedI normally stay at another 3-star hotel in Beijing, but picked here, because I thought it was close to a friend. Turns out it was not closer and was frustrated I did not go to my usual choice. If you want a basic, but good 3-star hotel - I suggest staying at Harmony Hotel Beijing in Dong Cheng district. You can read my review of that hotel on here. Harmony is cleaner, 1 block from the subway, 20 min walk to Tienanmen Square, near shopping, a mall, has a small bar  restaurant, room A/C - albeit not strong but it exist, and close to a lot of restaurants, etc.That is it, stay at your own risk, but I suggest avoiding this place.", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR715875046", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "mesomorphicman"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d606541-r22254154-Wen_Tao-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "606541", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
