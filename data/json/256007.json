{"Reviews": [{"Content": "OK for near the Airport - but out of the way otherwise... This is a pretty average hotel. You could be staying at the Airport Marriott in Charlotte, the airport Hyatt in London, or the Silken Puerta de Madrid and notice very little difference. The staff was nice, and rooms were big (more American than European), but as we stayed on the weekend, there was literally no one around. I guess that this hotel is really meant for business travelers who have business at one of the large office buildings around. Do not stay here if you want to be in the center of the tourist areas - but if you are staying one night to catch an early flight (as we did), it was very nice.", "Date": "Jan 6, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR478914178", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "mhphish"}, {"Content": "Excellent Business Hotel This hotel is within walking distance from my company's office in Madrid so it is the automatic choice when business trips require an overnight stay.This is an excellent business hotel. The rooms are very spacious, air conditioned and the bathroom has a wide selection of toiletries available ( even a shoe horn ! ). The bed is large and comfortable. The restaurant is good and in the summer you can sit on the terrace outside. Breakfast is excellentAs other reviewers have mentioned, it is a 10 minute taxi ride from the airport, and to the centre of Madrid by taxi takes anything between 15 -60 minutes depending on what time day you are travelling.", "Date": "Aug 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR435965823", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PennyLaneSussex"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel but problems not resolved This is a nice hotel on the outskirts of Madrid.10 minutes by cab to the airport.City centre is some distance away and requires a bus or taxi.In Madrid traffic the journey into the City can be up to an hour.But time it outside of the peak and the journey is no issue.Very spacious lobby area, nicely decorated with a modern twist.Rooms are also modern and large with nice marble bathrooms with seperate showers. However, some of the decoration is falling appart and they dont seem to want to fix them.Television set was old CRT. Not really in keeping with the modern look of the hotel. Pay TV did not work. Calls to reception did not provide any help. Again they did not seem to care.Request to me moved to another room fell on deaf ears. They just kept saying the hotel was full. They missed out on making some money here.Breakfast room was nice but as usual fairly expensive.but the bar area had assorted pastries and coffees which were quick and cheaper.", "Date": "May 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR875013041", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Slackbladder"}, {"Content": "good value for money Very good hotel, modern, clean, excellent for business, close to airport.

This hotel is a real bargain at 60\u9227?a night. It's clearn, modern, classy and has all the services and amenities that you expect from a four star hotel. The only potential inconvenience is the fact that it's not in the city centre and there's no metro close to it. Its located in a very nice, new area in the northeast corner of this ever-expanding city.There is however a very reliable bus (the 146) which has stop next to the hotel and has you in at the city centre in 20-25 minutes. A taxi ride to or from the city center will run you about 12 euros. So it's a question of choice. For this price you can stay in a hostal or pension in the city center where of course you'll be rolling the dice regarding cleanliness, safety, reliablity, etc. Or, you can stay in a really fantastic, modern hotel in the outskirts of the city and know that you and your belongings are safe and that you're going to be sleeping in clean sheets, using a clean bathroom, watching satelite tv, heat/ac, nice lounge/bar etc...For my most recent trip I chose the latter of these options and I think I made the correct decision. I would certainly stay there again in the future.", "Date": "May 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR792422729", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "jamoss11"}, {"Content": "Modern hotel excellent for business This hotel is quite recent with a modern architecture, glass elevators and a very large hall.

We stayed at the Silken Puerta Madrid on 10 August for 2 nights. We were told the airport shuttle does not run in August. Most of the staff seemed to be temporary for August. The rooms are a decent size and the bathroom is lovely with a separate shower. The hotel is new but the shower door did not close. The nearest metro station is a 20 minute walk away. The breakfast, 6.50\u9227? consisted of ONE cup of coffee, ONE slice of toast, ONE sandwich of EITHER ham, cheese or salmon, ONE glass of orange juice.
