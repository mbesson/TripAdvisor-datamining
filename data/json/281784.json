The front desk staff was friendly enough, but only provided lip service. There is no WiFi in the rooms. REALLY??? It's 2010!!! The rooms are very small for a family of four--the beds are too close together, not enough room for luggage or for hanging clothes. The furniture was scratched and worn, the mattresses were uncomfortable, and the walls were pretty banged up. Now to the really important stuff.....the bathroom floor was dirty and after showering, a horrible smell seemed to come up from the bathtub drain. The towels and wash cloths were thin, small, and felt like sandpaper. The TV set was a 19 inch tube TV that got very poor reception (channels were fuzzy). However, the worst thing was the air conditioner did not work properly. We kept it turned on full blast the first night and at best it only cooled the room to about 78 degrees. The next morning we stopped by the front desk and asked if it could be repaired while we were out for the day and they said it would be taken care of. When we returned that evening, hot and exhausted from a day outdoors, it had not been fixed as promised. We were so tired and it was late so we didn't ask for another room, hoping it would cool off. You can only imagine how hot it was in the room after a couple of people used a hair dryer on their hair! (Oh yeah, when we called the front desk and asked about the poor reception on the TV, all the person had to say was that the maintenance man was off for the day.) As we left on our final day, we stopped by the office to let them know that the air conditioner was not repaired after we made the request and the TV never reception was extremely poor.

During the timeshare presentation, we bought an 8day/7nights one-bedroom cabin package for the price of $995. At the time of purchasing, we were told there is one bed in the bedroom and one sofa bed in the living room so if we want to bring another couple there will be no problem. We had a one-year old with us at the time of the purchasing but nobody had told us there will be a limit on the people that can stay in the cabin. We were expecting another baby and our in-laws were planning to visit us so we planned to take them with us on the vacation. That is the reason we purchased the package otherwise we won\u2019t buy a vacation in the place we already visited. At the same time, another free package was offered to us along with the cabin package. That package clearly states only two adults can stay in the room and two more kids are acceptable with fees of $5 per kid per night. But for the cabin package, there is no such information in the contract. So we assume that will be no limits. A few days ago, I called to arrange the reservation. We were planning to take our in-laws and two kids (a 10-month old and a 2-year old). However, during the phone call, I was told only four people are allowed in the one-bedroom cabin due to fire hazard issue. I told them the original contract did not specify anything anywhere related to how many people are allowed in the cabin. They said it is not in the contract but there is a limit. To me, this seems a fraud selling of a vacation package. When I called the second time, we planned that my husband will take my in-laws and one baby and I and the other baby will not go so that satisfies their 4-people limit. However, I was told that I have to be there for the purpose of the timesharepresentation. My husband alone is not enough for the presentation. There is no point for us to go there without the in-laws. We have been there and have seen everything we need to see. They did offer an option to upgrade to a two-bedroom cabin, but of course we have to pay another $500 to upgrade. We refused to pay any more. As I mentioned to the agent I was speaking to that they are just making things so difficult. She had a man, I suppose he is the manager, on the phone. He was not friendly and told me I can cancel my reservations. I said that then I wanted my money back. He just said it was not refundable. I was just frustrated and I hung up the phone. A few days later, I got a letter stating that if I want to reschedule or cancel the reservation, there will be fees (I don\u2019t remember the exact price right now, but it is not cheap). This means if I want to forfeit $995 I already paid, I have to pay more to get nothing. So far my problem is not solved yet. I would not recommend Grand Crowne Resorts to anybody. If you already planned a vacation, don\u2019t buy anything during the timeshare presentation.

We've done the time share promotion thing before and figured there would be some catches this time too. We were right. First thing is if you really have no intention of buying the time share, let the salesman know up front and never act interested. He will still push hard but it only lasts 90 minutes. The $250 watches turned out to be cheap watches selling new on ebay for $15. The free cruise turned out to cost at least $700 in fees not including the mandatory gratuities which is still not too bad.

It had tennis coursts and an inside pool that reminded me too much of being at the YMCA. But setting that aside, this had to be the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed in for a timeshare. We had the 3 bedroom/4 abthroom unit, which is really 3 condos tied together by a long common hall. I was traveling with my husband, 2 teenage boys and two teenage girls. So each twosome had their own separate bedroom, bath (ours had two full baths ), kitchen, living room, and laundry,. There were balconies with seating off two of the bedrooms. The furnishings were elegant, comfortable, and new. Some furniture stil had tags on them. Two jacuzzi tubs, stocked kitchen, & plenty of towels. A large dining table in the main unit. Six TVs all together. Even though we were on the first floor off of parking, we were actually elevated in back, overlooking woods and golf course, since there were walk down units. I do not think anyone could complain about the accommodations. As usual, in most domestic timeshares, you do not get cleaning while you are there, but can get fresh towels and garbage pick up as needed throughout the week. Location is okay. Check in is 3 miles from the resort in a separate building. A little timeshare tour pressure, when you check in disguised as \"getting your parking pass\" combined with \"I can get you show tickets at a discount\", but easily out of. Not on Branson Strip , but that main road seems to be a mess of things anyway, especially traffic, and I am not too thrilled with Branson anyway. Las Vegas meets the Wisconsin Dells.

The location was terrific: off the main drag but near everything. Check-in was a bit confusing because it is totally seperate from the resort complex.

Our only recommendation is that the furnishings be replaced, sooner rather than later. The coaches and chairs especially are showing signs of wear and dirt stains, followed closely by the carpeting.

Upon check-in, we did get a bit irritated because our room was not ready when promised. We did have to wait about 45 minutes longer to get our room key. They said it was a plumbing issue; not sure if that was just a line or not. But in the end, it was definitely worth the wait. The kids loved the indoor pool as it was still too cool outside to swim outdoors. The chlorine level was definitely too high though. But the pool hours were great; the kids were able to come back after a late show and get some swim time in before bed. As far as the presentation goes, we pretty much knew what to expect. We knew it would be a hard sales pitch; that's why the accomodations were so affordable. Mike, our salesperson, was very professional and did not try to force anything on us at all. We did not feel overly pressured in any way. And yes, we did end up purchasing a small package from them and are looking forward to using our first week soon. The only complaint we had was that once we agreed to the purchase, the process took a while to complete, making us late for another event we had planned. But all in all, it was a great vacation. The location of the resort in reference to all of the attractions was great. We only hope that our future vacations with Grand Crowne will be just as enjoyable.

Well, the first red flag was the phone call AFTER reservations were made AND confirmed to book with them for a presentation! Basically whatever we paid for this trip was too much, in my opinion. We arrived and were SADLY disappointed. First the hours on the welcome center were not accurate and we ended up with a late arrival packet, which was basically an envelope with a coupon book and a tour time listed on the front. First, the lobby and breakfast room were nice, but not even close to the rest of the hotel. Since when is a HUGE hill and outdoor room access an acceptable standard? Since it was so late, we really had no choice. We decided to tough it out for one more night after that. My son is allergic to dust, dust mites, cockroaches and tobacco. We had him on breathing treatments the whole time we were at this hotel, not actually realizing it was the hotel causing the problems (the other hotels we did not have the issue, that is how I know). We suffered through the 2 nights to avoid uprooting the kids. We just made sure we spent as little time as possible in the room...very inconvenient. We tried to use the \"indoor\" pool, but it was VERY cold. Who has an unheated indoor pool anyway? How exactly would it warm up with no sun? The hot tub was so hot, my husband didn't even want to use it. There were no pool towels, we had to use our shower towels. To get more, we had to go to the front desk as no one was available to bring them to the room. So the only amenities the hotel offered were a huge bust and I had VERY disappointed kids. WIFI access was only from the lobby or breakfast room area. Did I mention the spiders or the envelope left in the room for tips? Maybe in Branson that is OK, but in IL it is considered soliciting tips. It is considered rude and discouraged. There was a guy in a golf cart giving people rides up the hill. He also had a tip jar. In the breakfast room ,(well laid out compared to all the other hotels) there was yet ANOTHER tip jar. Breakfast was OK, nothing special, but my boys were OK. The next morning we went to the welcome center to check in and someone booked the wrong date on our tickets...for the previous day. I was listening to my husband on the phone booking these tickets and heard the dates he gave them. They acted as if it was OUR mistake, it was theirs. It was eventually corrected. We do not allow our kids with strangers and kept them with us during the presentation. This is NOT negotiable at any presentation or we walk out-incentives or not. We got our $50 and left after a rather short presentation in the grand scheme of things. As it turns out Grand Crowne actually owns only one property, they own an \"interest\" in other properties and you basically pay a $70 fee to vacation at any resort, even as members. Frankly, what is the point? I can book my own vacation for that!

We had a nice golf course view. The 3 bedroom was huge. 5 bathrooms, 3 kitchens, 3 living rooms, 2 of the bedrooms were masters with whirlpools. The furnishings and carpet were average, nothing fancy. I own at a Marriott and am a little spoiled with their furnishings. But it was clean and had 2 balconies.

There is plenty to make a small meal but we usually cook a big breakfast and we had to double up on bowls and pans. Also, they do not have DVD players and the VCR was an older model without a remote. We did call maintenance and they brought us a new VCR with in minutes, so we could plug in our PS2 and watch our DVDs. The master bathroom was very spacious and the Jacuzzi tub was the biggest we have seen. They do not have hair dryers in the bathrooms. It is not as up to date as some of the newer resorts but it was very clean and the check in staff were very friendly. The building has an elevator right in front and a game room in the basement, which our boys loved. They have trash collectors on each floor which is nice. The boys has fun at the indoor pool, it was clean and close by. The location of this resort is the best, it is right off Gretna with easy access to Green Mt.

After reading the reviews on this site and a couple of Branson sites, I did not have high hopes for this place -- thank goodness. I would have been sorely disappointed if I had. I want to state now that we were there for a family reunion, not for a timeshare spiel, and most of the misery came from Branson itself. We'll not go back. We arrived at the office to check in at 4:40 in the afternoon. The two or three parking spaces \"FOR CHECK-IN ONLY\" were taken, so we parked as out-of-the-way as you can park a Suburban. I sat in the car in with the kids while my husband went inside to check us in. 35 MINUTES LATER he emerged with our room keys and what was supposed to be an information sheet and map about the Surrey Inn. By that time seven more cars had pulled in to check in, and none of the other cars had left. Apparently the front office people were having a staff meeting and could not be disturbed to help their visitors. My husband said that once the staff decided that maybe they should see to their customers, the check in process took about 5 minutes -- the standard amount of time usually required to check into a hotel. We had booked two rooms, one for the kids and one for us, and had told the booking agent that we needed adjoining rooms because our children are way too young (9, 8, and 4) to stay in a single room. When we found our rooms we discovered that not only does Surrey Inn not have any adjoining rooms, they had put us in two rooms separated by a breezeway. So, needless to say, my husband stayed in one room, and I stayed in the other; we split the kids between us. Not the fun vacation we'd envisioned. My four year old son and I headed to our room to settle in. He knelt on the floor to play with his Matchbox cars. I inspected the facilities -- very dark, rather small, a little dusty with a lingering odor of dirty wet socks, but okay. Then my son got up from the floor to use the restroom, and his shins had black specks on them. I thought it was just dirt and moved to brush it off, but upon closer inspection I found that he had two MOUSE pellets from the floor embedded in the skin on his knees. I grew up on a farm; I know what mouse poop looks like. YUCK! I called the front desk four times and no one ever answered the phone. I got my little broom and can of Lysol out of my car, swept as best as I could, and sprayed everything with Lysol. I looked for a hotel directory, but there was absolutely no information regarding the hotel anywhere in the room. We headed to the indoor pool. It was dirty, there were no towels, the jacuzzi was blocked from use, and there was a very loud, hyperactive little boy with a rather large uncovered gaping wound on his side jumping in and out of the pool, along with about thirty other kids. We headed to the central outdoor pool, and it was great. Still no towels, but it was uncrowded and very pleasant. We also swam in the pool by the office, and it was nice, too. The next morning we hit the breakfast buffet. It consisted of apple juice, orange juice, coffee, hot water (for tea or whatever), packets of oatmeal and hot chocolate, a large bowl of apple sauce, bananas, white bread for toast, English muffins, margarine, jelly, cream cheese (no bagels, though), Cheerios, bran flakes, cartons of skim milk, and LOTS of doughnuts. I went to the grocery store and bought \"our\" cereal, and we just took it to breakfast with us the next few mornings, which won many admiring glances and several requests for Fruity Pebbles from the other diners. My son still naps at 2:00 in the afternoon. Guess when the maids come around to make up the rooms....yep -- afternoons. That's kind of strange since check-in is at 1:00 or so. Needless to say, my son did not get a good nap while we were there. Each time the maids came to clean the room, they acted surprised to see us, then shoved clean towels in our hands and left. No beds made, no vacuuming, no garbage emptied. Our family reunion gatherings were held in the Owner's Lounge, a dark, dirty cave located outside the central pool. We brought in our own food and paper plates; the resort let us use their flatware and didn't require us to wash it. We would have been glad to wash it if they'd applied that time to at least vacuuming the room. It was nasty. The tables and counters were sticky, and most of the lightbulbs were out. The floor was so dirty that it turned the toddlers' feet black within minutes. The kids spent most of their time in the gameroom across the sidewalk, which sounds great, but unfortunately, everything in the gameroom is coin operated, so we were constantly scrambling for cash. If it weren't so grossly dirty and poorly staffed, I would give the Surrey Inn an okay recommendation. It's very similar to a $19.95 roadside motel -- absolutely no frills, kind of old and funky. However, the filth is inexcusable, and the staff needs to be changed and trained.

It seems that Surrey has a separate building at a separate location for everything. We first had to check in at the Grand Crowne Welcome Center to verify that we were qualified and we were given our first of 2 sets of tickets for attending the presentation the next day. Then we were sent up the hill to the Surrey Towne Center about a mile away to check in. We actually had to do that three times since we were too early the first time and they just didn\u2019t have the room readiness verified the second time but the third time we waited while the guy radioed the security person to check out that it had been cleaned. We were given our key and directed to our building at Golfview about 2 miles away. We later learned that the only staff permanently on site are the security people. We found our room on the third floor. It was a \u201cC\u201d unit which is basically linear with the living room/kitchen in the front and the bedroom with whirlpool tub in the back. We had two of the smallest bathrooms I have ever seen. One had nothing more than the toilet with the sink outside the bathroom by the master bed. The other small bathroom in the front section behind the kitchen had toilet, sink and a shower unit. The water pressure was so low that very little water came out of the shower so it took a long time to rinse off. I found out during our tour that the \u201cA\u201d unit is even smaller while the \u201cB\u201d unit is the bigger one (more like a Fairfield deluxe that we are more used to) but we had the intermediate \u201cC\u201d sized unit. It really bugs me when people cut corners. Only one of the tables next to the couch had a lamp on it which made it difficult for two people to sit and read. The bed had 2 lights overhead but they were both on one switch with only one level: BRIGHT! The hot tub was very large and I would have to say unique. It didn\u2019t seem to recirculate the water as most hot tubs do but rather bubbled vigorously which seemed to do the trick. The first night we tried it, it seemed to take forever to drain so on the second night I discovered that I had to hold the drain open until the tub was about 3/4 empty before I could release the drain without closing it. But the really unique thing about the tub is that after turning the tub off and draining it and waiting about a half hour while in bed it would mysteriously turn on again and shoot water up in the air which obviously had to be shut off again right away. This happened both nights we used the hot tub so it wasn\u2019t just a fluke. Needless to say this can be a \u201cmood chilling\u201d event (to say the least) and definitely not on my top 10 list of things to do after getting out of a hot tub. (My wife suggested perhaps I needed to read the hot tub manual which was laminated on a card next to the hot tub \u2014 RI...GHT!) Perhaps because it was still under construction but there was very little evidence of landscaping and certainly no flowers. This is in sharp contrast to the Fairfield unit we had stayed at the nights before with flowers planted, plenty of shrubs and lakes, fountains, and streams. Golfview depends on the nearby public golf course for all of your views. These are brand new units. The ones that look done across the parking lot are still being worked on and there are all sorts of heavy equipment vehicles in the area. So, if everything is so new, why does one of the smoke alarms choose to start chirping at 4:00 a.m. and do so about every couple of minutes until we finally get up at 6:00 a.m. because we can\u2019t take it any more? We called maintenance who took care of it while we were out. When we returned to our room later that afternoon, we discovered that neither of our room keys would work any more. The security guard let us in and said he would send maintenance around with a new set of key cards for us. They tried to justify it by saying that their keys are very sensitive to cell phones and such \u2014 bull! ... one, maybe, but not both keys at once since we had kept our keys separate and away from all cell phones, car keys, etc. that we had been warned can disrupt the magnetic strip on the key cards. The time share sales pitch at the Sales Center was rather uneventful after they learned that we already were owners at Fairfield. I had to laugh at one of the \u201ccloser\u201d guys because to object to one of his pitches I mentioned that we were owners at Fairfield. I must have looked like I wasn\u2019t sure I was getting through to him because he looked up and said \u201cI know \u2014 I\u2019m a Fairfield owner too.\u201d We were out of there in less than 90 minutes. But of course the gift is given out at the \u201cGifting Building\u201d which is located back up on Gretna Dr. I was glad that some of the other reviews had tipped me off about the post sales \u201cSurvey.\u201d The guy couldn\u2019t believe that we wouldn\u2019t accept a $40 voucher for completing the survey and he even went so far as to offer $60 when I said \u201cIt\u2019s really a pitch for your Vacation Club isn\u2019t it?\u201d To which he looked surprised and said, \u201cYes.\u201d So if you decide to go for the high pressure Vacation Club sales pitch, at least see if they won\u2019t sweeten the pot a bit. I figure my time is worth more than that. The tour guy had said something about computers in Building 6 in the basement with the workout equipment so after the tour we decided to check it out. There was some workout equipment which even in the slow season was being fully utilized but we found no computer equipment. There was one in a roped off area behind a desk that really didn\u2019t look like they wanted guests to mess with. Other reviews have mentioned the indoor pool with the tennis court above it but we didn\u2019t bother to go there. If I wanted to go somewhere in the Winter to swim, it probably wouldn\u2019t be to Branson. There was a nice looking enclosed playground that the little kids seemed to enjoy. One night of our stay was unseasonably warm during the day getting up to 82 degrees in Winter! Whoever designed the bedroom failed to allow for a door or window to be opened with a screen because there were none. Fortunately there were few bugs this time of year so we just left the French door propped open all night. On another night there was a tornado warning. Unlike our experience a couple of days before at the Fairfield resort, we were never called but had to fend for ourselves. We did read the notice on the door which merely said to take shelter in the bathroom. I now wonder if there isn\u2019t a basement area like Building 6 (ours was 7) that would have been a much better shelter from a possible tornado. Again we were fortunate to avoid the tornado but this time not the golf ball sized hail which pelted the cars in the parking lot. Obviously I have no desire to ever go back to the Grand Crowne Resort or as it is otherwise known as the \u201cSurrey Vacation Resort.\u201d Like Fairfield, there are many \u201cSurreys\u201d but this review is only about the one they call \u201cGolfview.\u201d By the way if you like to golf, Thousand Hills is a public course and you don\u2019t have to stay at the Grand Crowne in order to golf. (We found Branson to be quite nice in the preseason. To read more about that, please read my review of the Fairfield Resort where we stayed for 2 days before moving over to this resort.) Branson has a lot of restaurants but few are exceptional. One of the best is the dining room at the Chateau on the Lake but it is quite expensive. We did get a great ribeye steak sandwitch ar Montana Mike's restaurant. But if you ever go to Branson over Thanksgiving, the ONLY place to go for a fantastic Thanksgiving dinner is The College of the Ozarks.

I thought it would be a wonderful place to take my children. We got a call inviting us to stay, and we paid our money. I would have preferred if they would have just given us money for a hotel and let us pick our own place to stay. If you want someone to spend the money you are asking for your time-shares, at least put them up in a place that does not have black mold on the wall by the door. I was not at all impressed with the hotel room or the staff. The presentation was fine, but when we told them that we were not interested, that is when the attitudes started coming out. The \"manager\" that came to our table did not take \"no\" for an answer and got down right rude with us. We decided to go to the \"Post-Presentation\" they call it. We were going to get our $40 and tell them what we thought. Well, don't buy-in. This so-called \"Post-Presentation\" is just another 60 minute chance to try to sell to you again. There is a survey that you fill out in the beginning and then they talk for over 60 minutes about travel packages. We were told this at the beginning of the session and we told them that we would give them 60 minutes, but nothing over. They were not going to suck up anymore of our time. We were told that we would not be able to leave in the middle of the presentation, the 60 minute mark. They gave us back our deposit and asked us to leave. (You have to put up a $20 deposit to ensure that you will be at their presentation.) The shows were great and we had a blast except for the time spent at the hotel and dealing with the rudeness of the staff. Thank you for your time and I hope this helps you make some decisions.", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cBig disappointment - rude salespeople\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3723120", "Content": "We went on this trip through a sales promo from Grand Crowne Resorts(first one I've followed through on in about 5-7 years). Driving up to this hotel, the first impression is possibly a 4 star hotel until you enter the room - wall paper peeling in the corners, dirty sink & we had to ask for towells the very first day we were there. Their idea of a \"super continental breakfast\" was a joke. If you want a reasonably priced average quality hotel with a great continental breakfast, try the Ramada by the Dixie Stampede. The only good qualities this hotel had were 2 outdoor & 1 indoor pool, a golf cart to shuttle people back & forth, & the people at the front desk were very friendly. The sales promo of course, was right smack in the middle of our first whole day there, so you figure 3 nights, you have 2 whole days, now one day is shot because you're there to fit into their schedule, they're making no effort to work around yours. After sitting through about 70 minutes of mindless rambling as to why this is such a great deal a younger high pressure salesman came & sat down at my table. The \" great deal\" that started at approximately $9,500.00 in the presentation, where they claimed they make minimal profit, immediately fell to about $3,500.00 when they realized I was less than impressed with their \"so called\" carrot. When I didn't immediately write out a check for the bargain they claimed they were giving me, I was no longer their best friend, but the biggest imbecile in the face of the earth. After I rejected the younger salesmans offer, he left the table & an older man came & sat down & really tried to tighten the screws. I told him to send the information home with me & I'd think about it, but I refused to purchase anything that day because that's not how I do business. His reply was \"that wasn't how they did business, because no one ever follows through under those circumstances\". (There's a reason for that) ... He also informed me these \"carrots\" (low quality rooms & tickets to shows & rides no one wants) cost them money & ask that I never reply to another sales promo again. By their own math at the promo & the rates posted on the door to my hotel room, even with the discount rate we paid for the room, they still made money. (assuming of course, that their markups aren't enhanced to make their packages look better) I've stayed at plenty of hotels in my life from holes in the wall, to 5 star. If you want a reasonably priced, average quality hotel to stay at while in Branson, there's plenty available, but this isn't one of them.", "Date": "July 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pine Bluff, AR", "Title": "\u201cBought 1 week with Crown Resorts but Hated Surrey Inn\u201d", "Author": "GoGoGirlNow", "ReviewID": "UR3693606", "Content": "We have attended several time share presentations before, we live in Arkansas and like to visit Branson occasionally, especially with our grandchildren ages 8 and 12 now. This time share package was competitively priced but the accomodations were terrible! We loathed the Surrey Inn because of the following: Breakfast was a joke, few choices and worst of all closed at 9:30 a.m.!! Imagine going on a \"vacation\" with kids and eating by 9:30. Not for us even if we are early risers usually. The room and area was not well kept. Our commode stopped up several times - horrible! When we arrived there was a plunger next to it - we soon found out why. Extremely hilly if you can not walk but with a golf cart service in the early a.m. only. No towels at the pool for 3 days. Nice laundry room adjacent to the pool. The presentation was O.K., we attended an early one. Food was available, we did get a very new salesperson who did not give us a hard sell which was great. But then again we had been to several others. There were several sales people around us really loud and pushy though. The deal \"closer\" came last and offered another deal, good only that day of course. We declined. We were then sent to a third person to receive our tickets. She offered us a 7 day package we took with the intentions of staying at the newest facility on the Golf Course. It is a good location. After having called the Crowne resort lines to schedule, I have been treated very well. We will give an update in the Spring!

I am smart enough to know that most people will take time to write negative comments, but won't take the time to write if a positive experience was had. However, I got a little nervous that I would have a horrible trip if I went. I talked to the PR manager who gave me her name and location in case someone was being rude. The check in was painless, received my food voucher as promised and off to the room we went. The next day my tour was scheduled, and we showed up as scheduled. We had a really nice down to earth gentleman named Fred, and our tour took about the 90 minutes promised. I told him up front that I bought the package several months ago, and I was now not in a position to buy anything since I have bought a new house to close on soon and my current house is unsold. He was understanding and very nice even though he knew the situation. When he was done, another man came to \"finish\" the procedure. He wrote out the price on a piece of paper, and then kind of shoved it at me. I told him that I couldn't do it as I had told Fred. He then said he could get me into a cheaper deal and wrote that out and gave it to me. I again declined which he didn't appreciate and signed off on my paperwork. Then, the third closer guy came and gave me another \"deal\" if I bought \"today\" and I also declined that deal. He was decent, nice and in no way pushy. I then picked up my show tickets as promised and we were on our way. They do have an exit interview, but I made it clear at booking time that due to another obligation I could not attend and I wasn't pushed to do so. The accomodations were better than average, and we were treated very well by all the staff. I would do it again, and it was well worth my 90 minutes.
