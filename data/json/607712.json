The room was spacious enough, bathrooms clean, free wifi and the linen was clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I didn't dine there but they do have a restaurant at the 7th which might come in handy. I couldn't get my TV to start and called the reception at midnight and a tech came right away. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there is club 'Johnny Utah' right next door. It's almost like they share the same entrance.

Thankfully, I am able to test some of my recommendations, as I travel to the city on business or family visits fairly often. Stayed here,as my company recommended it via our travel unit, as its across from Rockefeller Center. Location is ideal. Nice neighborhood..but that's it. There is no valet when arriving in this busy block, so you must drop bags off, then go and park car yourself. Several smoking patrons from the bar next door, was loitering in front of the hotel entrance when arrived, which was sort of not cool. No help offered to us when using self check in. No guide on what the hotel offers or what's available in area, like other hotels do. Elevators very slow. Must use key for entering guest room floor, as many business men are in and out of the tiny lobby to use the business center/restaurant on 7. Standard room was very small, even for NYC standards. Bed was uncomfortable, no view, and bathroom has a sliding glass door that doesn't close. (If you're shy and have a roommate, it's not for you.). HVAC was spotty. TV remote for tiny LCD TV broken which we replaced while there. While it IS clean, there were several stains of splattered mysterious liquids on bathroom walls and door. Wireless access while free (YEA!), was spotty at best. While the floor service people (who bring pillows, replaced remote batteries etc), were kind, we were VERY disappointed over finding a room service charge on our bill upon checkout for something we did NOT order. The night before we left, we stopped at an Italian place on 6th, and ordered two pasta dishes to go, while having a drink at the bar. When we returned to eat in our room with our takeout, (as husband was feeling ill), we found one of the dishes to NOT be what we ordered at all. Immediately called restaurant (PAZZA NOTTE BTW), the hostess apologized and said they would deliver the proper order to our hotel asap. We provided our cell number and room number, so they could call us when they arrived and we would swap the wrong order with the new, correct one. Well, one hour later, a Club Quarters service person knocked on our door, to deliver the new dish. We asked where the restaurant delivery person was and he said that they left. I then gave a cash tip to the service man and offered the dish we were to swap out since would not be eating it and in case the restaurant returned looking for it. He was happy to take it and left. Apparently, the hotel decided to charge OUR bill for this dish, as the deliveryman failed to tell them it was a swap. We also were charge a room service charge for the hotel to bring it to us. We never ASKED for anyone to do this and we never authorized this charge. When we checked out, we had to wait for the hotel to look into this. calling the restaurant, waiting for their answer etc. While we were annoyed, we were patient and respectful understanding that the day clerk was trying to figure it out. Finally the hotel clerk decided to remove it from the bill and let us go on our way saying: \"I'll take it off for now, so you can get out of here, but we'll still have to look into it and get proof from the restaurant that you already had paid for it.\" Seriously? Luckily I have a bill so I can fight this charge if needed, but honestly, it left a very bad taste in our mouth as a departing guest. As a result, we won't return, or recommend this hotel.

Thankfully some were brought along so it wasn't a problem. There is some drawers as well where you can store other things so it's not a huge deal, just be aware. The bathroom was nicely sized and had a walk in shower and nice furnishings. The shower was an average flow but always had hot water so absolutely no complaints from me!

The staff were lovely and always made an effort to say hello/goodbye when you were in the lobby, which was nice. Check in was smooth as well but I wish they wouldn't ask you to use the self check in, they didn't work for one gentleman and I could see him losing his patience. There is free WiFi and cabled connections in the room but the WiFi was terribly slow. It was better on the 7th floor on the terrace but forget about Skyping if you have a smartphone, it's just not fast enough. The cabled connection is much better though, bring an Airport Express and make your own network from it! The location is excellent.

Not that there is anything wrong with the quality, but the room in San Fran was small. So when I booked this, I was expecting the worst. What I got, was surprisingly nice. Checking in was, to be nice, a major challenge. The lobby is exceptionally small, and there is no real \"desk\" but a checkin kiosk. When I was met by the staff to check me in, they tried, but at 2:00 PM (on a Monday afternoon - holiday) the room was not ready. I was asked if I would mind checking back in about twenty minutes...which I did. I did this three more times and was FINALLY able to check into the room at around 3:45. Now, I need to note that I didn't have to wait in the lobby. They checked my bag, and I headed across the street to Rockefeller Plaza and found a nice bench in the shade and got some work done. Not at all a bad way to spend an hour. The room...it was small...I'll not kid you. But it was clean. The furnishings were modern, the bathroom (usually the worst part of any hotel) was spotless, and the bed...well, let's just say I didn't want to get up. While the onsite restaurant and bar is recommended by many, I was not in the mood to get dressed up in business casual attire, so I opted to walk to dinner...some 31 blocks, to one of my favorite restaurants that is frequented by locals called Regional Thai. I'll review that later, but if you want a fun place to watch all sorts of people, this is THE place to go. Anyway, the only real downside I could find to the entire stay was the lack of an ironing board and iron in the room. You had to call for one, which they brought right up, but it is something that I didn't want to dress to receive...but as not to shock the bellman, well, you know. One nice plug that I will the Club Quarters is the free bottles of water. Seems like a small thing, yet to be able to not only get a bottle or two, but also to refill your own bottle from the dispenser...really a nice touch.

Club Quarters isn't really a two-bed style property. It's a business hotel for people who are oftentimes going to be in town for several days. They're generally not positioned as leisure properties and therefore wouldn't generally have two beds.

There is a restaurant and there are enough local restaurants that deliver and of course you're in New York so you can eat anything, anywhere. It felt anonymous.

The rooms are small, modern, and contain just the essentials for a business stay. This is NOT a good hotel for families, but will work for couples. I would stay there again on my next business trip with a corporate discount. Pros - Central location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, 5th Avenue. Really, this hotel is in a super location. - Free Internet in room - Friendly service with check-in and check-out - Relatively quiet during the day (if you are on a high floor) Cons - Bathroom door \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Several reviews mention the bathroom door. The bathroom door slides to shut. It has no lock and the center of the door is frosted glass. I assume the frosted glass is to make the bathroom appear larger, but those sharing a room may feel less privacy. Another problem I had with the door is that it would not stay shut. I would pull it closed and it would slide open on its own. Tip: I found that placing a pen between the door and the wall stopped the door from sliding open. - Bare bedding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The bed only has 1 top / bottom sheet, 1 thin comforter, and two pillows. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect plush bedding in this economy hotel. - Shower, no bathtub \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As other reviews stated, the hotel has a shower, not a bathtub / shower combo in each room. The shower has a tiled bottom, which mine showed signs of mildew (see attached photo). If I stayed again, I would bring flip flops to wear in the shower. The shower does not have a shower door, just a shower curtain. - No closet, just a cabinet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c My room included a cabinet with a rack and drawers. The cabinet was too small for a regular sized suitcase. The room also did not include a suitcase rack. - Maids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The maids can be loud during room cleanup. If you are staying all day in your hotel room, be aware of this. Also, after I dropped 4 towels and 2 washcloths on the floor, I only received 2 towels and 1 washcloth after the room was cleaned. - TV channels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mostly business / news for the business traveler. - Noise from the city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c There can be a lot of noise from the city at night. If you stay here, try to get your room as high up as possible. Tips - You can eat breakfast for under $5 in Rockefeller Center. To get to the eateries, just go to the bottom of Anthropologie OR the building across the street. Where the eateries are located, there is also a drugstore if you forget to bring something on your trip. - When you check-in, ask for a city map. The city map contains some discounts to attractions and is helpful in navigating the city and using the subway. - The hotel can hold your bags for some time after you check-out. This is helpful if you still have some appointments or sightseeing to do before leaving the city. - If you are traveling in winter, please dress accordingly! It can be freezing in the city! Make sure you bring a hat, gloves, scarf, and a warm coat. If you forget these things, you can purchase from a street vendor or within Rockefeller Center.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201csmaller than expected but great location\u201d", "Author": "smacks17", "ReviewID": "UR53458759", "Content": "the room was extremely small.. barely big enough to add a rollaway bed.. so the pics are misleading. we had to ask if the \"lobby\" was in fact a lobby as it didn't even look like a hotel. that being said, the location is great. right across the street from rockefeller plaza and walking distance to everything. the only bad thing is the size of the room for the price.", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nicosia", "Title": "\u201cTHE BEST LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "lenaNicosia", "ReviewID": "UR52832522", "Content": "The hotel is in the heart of Manhattan next to all the main sights and of course the shops.

They would pay for a taxi ride to that hotel, and for a return trip to the Club Quarters Rockefeller Center, where we would have a very nice suite for the next three nights of our stay. I said that we would prefer a different option in the nearby area, as I had an early morning business meeting the next day and had selected this particular Club Quarters because it was only 2 blocks from my meeting. We had arrived in the middle of the UN opening week, traffic was chaotic and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the subway system well enough. The staff members said that they would try to find an nearby alternate. In the meantime, they directed us to a nice all-night deli nearby where we could grab a bite to eat. When we returned, they informed us they had found a room at a nice boutique hotel just five blocks away. Because we had prepaid the reservation, they decided to give us exact cash for payment of our room the next morning. They gave me an envelope stuffed with cash. They also gave us $20 for a taxi ride to the alternate hotel, which we pocketed as it was an easy walk. And they gave us a gift certificate for 2 nights lodging at any Club Quarters in the US. They then concluded with an assurance that we would have a very nice suite when we returned the next day for the last three nights of our stay. We got to the alternate boutique hotel and discovered we were checking into a room with a $450 per night rate. But the Club Quarters staff had given us exactly the right amount in cash to fully payfor the room the next morning. We returned to the Club Quarters at 1 PM the next day. Our suite was ready. It was on the 27th floor, and as promised was a corner suite with a lovely view of St Patrick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cathedral. The room was spacious, nicely appointed, very clean. We appreciated the complimentary bottles of water near the elevator on our floor. There was a computer and printer on the seventh floor available to us on Sunday morning to print out boarding passes. There were a few quirks: a small lobby, a quirky elevator, and a bit of a delay in getting our luggage from storage (on a different floor than the lobby). But all in all, this was a very nice place to stay. And I must commend the management for empowering their desk staff to deal with an overbooking in such an imaginative, though costly, way.

We booked this hotel through ebookers and got a decent price, they are worth checking out. We never had any issues as I have before with Expedia or having to make sure our reservation was sent through from Expedia which was great. I had previously read reviews, there aren't loads of reviews, like there are for other hotels, but all the ones there were seemed to give it a good solid thumbs up. When we arrived we were early and our room was not ready so we handed in our cases and were told to come back in an hour. We headed off to explore for a little while until the room was ready. First thing that struck me was that the location was absolutely brilliant, in the middle of everything, just a short walk from Central Park, Theatre District and are on Rockefeller's doorstep and Radio City's. There were some good places to eat/drink nearby, and a handy bar called Johnny Utah's right next door, which if it takes your fancy, has a roadeo bull you can have a go on! Back at the hotel the room was ready as assured and when we got to the room were pleasantly surprised. I have stayed in NY many times and am used to the shoe box rooms you can pay through the nose for so was very happy with our room which I felt was compact but absolutely fine and very modern and clean. There was a menu in the room which you could order from 24/7 and the hotel have it delivered to you (this was from outside restaurants). We should mention here that there is a diner called Big Daddy's Diner on Lexington downtown which will deliver 24 hours on Fridays and Saturdays, we ate in the Diner and the food was great so can highly recommend it. There is a terrace bar on the 7th floor which is also a small restaurant and whilst we didn't eat there we had a drink. Like all hotel bars it was a tad on the pricey side but we expected that. The menu for breakfast/lunch/dinner looked decent enough and not too bad price wise but there are FAR cheaper options just around the corner. A good diner nearby was Appleby's which if you walk westward on 51st Street across an avenue on the corner there is Eileen's Stardust diner (DO NOT GO HERE - ABSOLUTE CRAP), bust a right at this corner and walk up this avenue and look to your left and you'll see it, good food, good price. There is a fitness room which we didn't really look at but heard people say it was ok, nothing amazing but fine and they will even deliver fitness equipment to your room on request free which I thought was great. We wanted a late check out and for $35 you could have the room til 3pm which suited us great so we did that. Check-in and out was an absolute breeze. I loved this hotel, it was exactly what I needed, I was more than happy with their room service menu which I felt was better than most big hotels and I was absolutely chuffed that we found this place. If you are looking for a very clean, comfortable and modern place to stay and don't mind not having the big hotel facilities like swimming pools, big gyms and big bars and restaurants, and are happy with the relatively small bar/restaurant facilities (the bar was never really busy) and small workout room then you will absolutely feel like you've won the lottery here.

This year the hotel prices were pretty high so we decided to try the Club Quarters using friends of a business associate. We were pleasantly surprised at the location - directly across from the tree in Rockefeller Center and of course half block from all the great shops on 5th Ave. The room (1103) was small - but my daughter and I believe that we have stayed in smaller and as it was only for the one night it was not an issue. The bed was small and I know that I had asked for two beds but when I called the desk I was told that was never a guarantee and they supplied a roll-a-way. Not exactly what I had envisioned but we went with it - no alternative really. The bathroom was small - no bathtub - but what more do you need besides the basic necessities. We did not use, but did go to see the Terrace Club and it is a beautiful place with comfortable chairs around a fireplace, flat screen TV, a beautiful bar and tables on an outdoor enclosed patio for year round dining. We were there on a Sunday and everything closed early - 10 PM - and we were still out shopping so we missed the club. The hotel does have a great deal - they have about 5 restaurants with different foods that deliver for a nominal charge of 2.50. We returned to the hotel at 11 - contacted the deli - ordered food and it was delivered within the 30 minute time frame. This was a definite perk in our book - and really NOT expensive,delivered hot and very good. Also the fitness room was adequate and the free bottled water on the floors is also a great perk.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for everyone, of course: if grandiose spaces and luxe treatment by dedicated staff at every turn are your thing, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy it. But if you like being in a well-designed, safe, clean, quiet, practical, brilliantly-located, and excellently priced hotel, this is the place for you. Note, however, that the hotel requires institutional membership, and I believe it is not open to the general public. However, a large and growing number of companies and other organizations like universities, etc., do have memberships that permit employees to book at any Club Quarters for business or personal stays. The building is unassuming from the street, and your cab driver will not have heard of Club Quarters; look for the small dark awning to identify it, right next to Johnny Utah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant (no relation to CQ). The hotel is just around the corner from the H&M on 5th Avenue and West 51st, nestled between Banco Popular and Bank of America. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a quarter of a block from Rockefeller Plaza, and across from Radio City Music Hall. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no door man, and the lobby and front desk, while attractive, are functional and far short of pompous. The staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c usually two people behind a tiny desk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are well-trained and helpful, check-in was swift and uneventful (the way you want it). There is no concierge, the desk staff does their best with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153getting-there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd instructions and will store luggage, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe they make dinner reservations or book tours and the like. Mine was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclub room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with one comfy double bed, little tables, good reading lamps, a small open wardrobe-like piece of furniture with drawers and shelves, a decent-sized desk with all kinds of computer hookups, a window that opened several inches for fresh air (yay!), and an ergonomic task chair, but no easy chair as some of CQ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Website photos. There simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t room, the footprint is quite small, though well laid-out and just fine for one or two people for a few nights. There is no mini-bar but instead there is a room-service menu of extremely reasonably priced mini-bar type treats (no alcohol though, as I recall) that will be delivered for just $2.50 (which is nothing short of amazing for Manhattan). There are the usual coffee maker and packets of lousy coffee and a tea bag on the desk. Climate control is exceptionally effective, and the thermostat was within reach of the bed. There are no iron/board in the room, but they can be provided on request. TV reception is good, channel choices only fair. There are internet options galore, including three PCs and two B & W laser printers for use for free at the Terrace Restaurant. The bathroom is excellent, with a large walk-in shower (could use some fresh grout), granite counter, and just enough room for one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stuff. Hot water is abundant and comes up right away; the hand-held shower is terrific. Hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, and a couple of nice soaps are provided. I found the hotel to be exceptionally quiet, the only disturbance was the occasional slam of my neighbors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 doors, as the auto-closers are pretty robust. Otherwise, with window closed, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no outside noise, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the arrangement of the rooms on the floors or the particular clientele or what exactly, but I never heard voices through the walls or from the halls. There were some especially endearing features about this Club Quarters: 1. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shelf over the desk with a couple of books, most interestingly, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by Daniel Orkent. I ended up hanging out at RC a lot as the weather was great and especially all of the magnificent period art decorating the buildings really piqued my curiosity, and the trip to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Top of the Rock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was worth every cent of the $20 ticket for a magnificent view of Manhattan all around, and beyond. 2. The room sported one of the nicest hotel clock radios ever. Instructions for setting the alarm were perfectly clear, thank you very much, and there were pre-sets for classical, pop, news, though the radio was fully tunable as well. 3. In the hall on several floors are cold filtered water dispensers and refillable plastic bottles. How fabulous is that?? The 7th floor Terrace Room is open for three meals every day. I only had breakfast there, which includes a choice of continental (fresh fruit and pastries) for $11, or for $15 you can also get eggs and a couple of other hot choices. Both include juice and coffee. The terrace itself is very nice for al fresco dining, with a good view of the spires of St. Patrick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cathedral a half block away. Note, however, that the restaurant is run by a concessionaire, and for some reason they require a special key card to access the 7th floor that expires every midnight. You have to go down to the front desk and request a new card every morning, which is a tad annoying. But above all, the price is absolutely right. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find anything anywhere in mid-town that came within $100 of what I paid for such perfect lodging at Club Quarters.

It's not a lot to ask for, but I've stayed at much \"hipper, cooler\" places here that don't have in-room coffee, desks or even a decent place to hang your clothes.

The rooms are small, the hotel is unassuming. The entrance is just to the left of Johnny Utah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, a popular eatery/bar on 51st Street. Except the flags hanging above the entrance, you might miss this hotel. The lobby is extremely small, as far as most lobbies are concerned. About the size of a guestroom, it is large enough to fit a check-in podium, a loveseat with glass coffee table and an armchair. The rooms are also small, though most rooms in New York City are. Most rooms (if not all) at the Club Quarters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Rockefeller Center feature one (comfortable!) double bed with upgraded linens and warm down comforters. A workspace with complimentary Internet access and computer hookups is provided. A small armoire \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd contains two drawers, about 12 inches of hanging space and a few 12-inch wide shelves (opposite the hanging space). Tiled bathrooms include granite vanities, a magnifying makeup mirror and good lighting. Doors to the bathrooms are frosted glass, and you can hear everything, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sharing a room please keep this in mind. (However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to note that I could not hear neighbors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so walls between rooms must be well-insulated.) The bathroom contained a shower only (with good water pressure), which was separated from the toilet/sink area by raised tile and a tastefully designed shower curtain. Complimentary toiletries included a soap bar, a combo shampoo/conditioner and one other thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe a small bottle of lotion (though I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be certain). Windows slide horizontally to open, though only open about five inches wide. From my room, I could see the ice skating rink and twinkling lights at Rockefeller Center. Though the room is small (maybe 15\u00e2\u20ac\u2122x15\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 total, including the bathroom), the space is used efficiently. The chrome and dark cherrywood finishes give the room a more contemporary feel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely stay here again, especially for the price \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a steal! The location is on 51st Street, sandwiched between 5th and 6th avenues. It is central to Rockefeller Center (just across the street), Fifth Avenue shopping (one-half block away), and St. Patrick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cathedral (one-half block away, gothic architecture, and beautiful). It is also within walking distance of Times Square. TIP 1: Be sure to take advantage of the complimentary, refillable water bottles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c available on floors 18 and 20. TIP 2: If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unfamiliar with New York City, pick up one of the complimentary tourist booklets in the lobby.

A little too helpful, but everyone else was great. The room itself was a marvel of efficiency, with a great bed, business desk with easily accessed plugs and lights, free wifi (even worked with my iPhone) and the bed was glorious. I got exactly what I ordered. Television's a bit sparse on available channels, the coffeemaker was working fine. The bathroom was another model of efficiency - it gave me ideas for my second bath at home. They offer free chilled, filtered water from machines in generic bottles for use in the rooms and to take with you. Excellent. I was on the 26th floor and it was a bit inconvenient to go all the way down to the 2nd floor to get to the only icemaker and vending in the building. The hotel has the menus for a number of local restaurants that will deliver right to your room for far less than I'd have thought - a couple of dollars. Nice touches include a few resource books that look great on the shelf, a coat hook bar, the digital thermostat right next to the bed and more.
