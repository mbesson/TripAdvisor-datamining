TWO Days in a row the restaurant made the SAME MISTAKE on my food order (a club sandwich WITHOUT lettuce or Tomatoes) and BOTH times (room service and in the restaurant) they left it on. After filling out the comment card, the front desk called to find to find out what was wrong (which would have increased this review score, if not for what came next) and said they'd call me back. THEY NEVER DID!!! AN HOUR later, someone came up with a fruit tray that I NEVER ORDERED. I explained to him that the front desk needs to call me about the restaurant AND that the A/C has been broken for 2 days (had already complained about this, but no use there either). An hour later, I call down AGAIN and they never got the message from the fruit tray person. Eventually they sent maintenance up again to look at the A/C, he said that to get it below 25C in the room, you have to set the \"cool to\" temp to 13C (and not the 20C I was aiming for). But it spent my first day in the room set at 13C and it made no difference, the room was still heated instead of cooled. I realize that I'm in a hotel in Mexico, but when a guest is complaining in English, it is not a sign of good customer service to not at least send someone along who speaks English so that the person on staff can communicate with the guest. Combined with the rest of the reasons I REALLY dislike this hotel, I'd not stick around the rest of the week if it weren't right across the street from where I needed to be. :( The local people from work advised me to not go outside after dark, and the hotel staff didn't disagree with that assessment.

One low point is the wodden door between two rooms. You can hear every noise coming out of next door also in the corridoor i heard lots of noises.

We would have done much better to stay further away and spend a bit more on taxis. The hotel is over-priced for what and where it is and definitely NOT for tourists. The only reason you would want to stay there is if doing business in that neck of the woods and if you are, the Holiday Inn down the road which we noticed too late, must surely be a better bet.

It is a cheap ($60 on Priceline), nice, clean and modern hotel located in a relativly central part of Mexico City. There is purified running water, strong showers and late-night room service. If you are looking for a comfortable and clean place to sleep, this will do fine. However, that is where it ends. The service at the hotel is terrible, leaning into the territory of absurd. For example, I called the front desk 6 times over a period of 4 hours asking for an extra pillow, which never came! The next day, when houskeeping took my TV remote control I had to ask - yes, this is true - no less than 10 times for a replacement remote. When I went down to the front desk for the final time he actually pulled a remote out from a drawer and gave it to me. Why he didn't do that hours ago, I have no idea. And my room service debacle isn't even worth mentioning. On the plus side, I did become fluent in Spanish when it comes pillows and remotes! The location of the hotel is ok, but not great. If you are driving it is near the highways and it doesn't take long to get to the airport, even in rush hour. However, it's a very grimy area that shuts down at night so you'll need to order room service in order to eat. Even the subway station is a 15 minute walk. There are many nicer hotels in Mexico City that are similiar in price, with better locations and service.

My room was generally clean although the toilet appeared to have not been thouroughly cleaned. The fixtures were moodern and in good working order. My room was on the first floor facing the street. The traffic was very noisey throughout the night and sound insolation was poor. If noise bothers you do not stay in a room facing the street! I was looking for a safe, clean hotel for one night as I was flying out the next day This hotel met those needs. There was a safe in the room for my camera and I was just able to fit my small laptop in there also. The area was not very convenient to the places that I wanted to see, Reforma and Zona Rosa, although the hotel hailed a cab for me and for about 95 pesos I was taken to Zona Rosa. I could not see that the surrounding area had any restaurants or stores within walking distance, although I did not ask or investigate thouroughly secondary to time restraints. Because of this I ate breakfast in the hotel which was fair, but failry expensive -- 140 pesos for a buffet. I personally would pay a bit more for a hotel in a different area if I were to return.
