He also took our map and gave us a walking guide to the city! We could not have asked for better hosts! As for the hotel, the room was very nice. We had one on the inner courtyard so noise was not an issue at all. We did have trouble initially finding the hotel because it is located on the second floor of a building, and the bus station kind of blocks the sign. That was the only negative, and that wasn't that big of a deal. The location was great we could literally walk to everything, 10 minutes to the Collesium, 20 minutes to St Peters, 15 minutes to the trevi fountain, and if you needed the bus station was right outside of your hotel to go anywhere you wanted to go.

Sort of a slab of granite really. - Cramped but very complete bathroom, including a bidet and shower massage. Rough, scratchy but ample towels. - Armoir thoughtfully full of hangers, and with a small safe. - A massage chair, foot massager and foot bath. Plus, every little amenity, toiletry, etc you can imagine. - Minibar, plus everything (and I mean everything) you need to make breakfast. One of the nicest surprises - all reasonably priced. My total minibar bill after a week was about 20 Euro, and I used it every morning for breakfast, and sometimes for snacks. - Given the size of the rooms, they have to cram every available surface with the snacks, toaster, etc. I was constantly knocking things on to the floor. - Free if somewhat intermittent wifi.

Yes, there's a lot of stairs to negotiate but once you ring the bell, Micherle or Richard will be down in a jiffy to carry your luggage for you, so - that's taken care of. Location wise - you couldn't ask for a better one. We arrived at the Trastevere train station after taking a train off our ship at Civitavecchia (easy peasy, thanks to Tripadvisor reviewers!) and took the no 8 tram just outside the station right to the doorstep of the Pensione! I'm not kidding, it's that convenient, as the tram ends here and you'll be asked to get off! We had room 6 (triple share) and the owners have thought of everything - from providing hand wipes for the touring around humid Rome, to back and foot massage equipment which we laughed at initially, but they came in handy after walking around Rome a whole day! Which hotel gives you a thank you and going away present? Pensione Barrett does! How thoughtful! I had wanted to book a hotel near Roma Termini on my return journey, but decided I liked the friendliness, security (24 hr reception) and location of the Pensione Barrett so returned for a last night before my trip home. And I received another present. They are full of information on how to/where to go, restaurant ideas etc and even sell the Roma Card and other passes.

Its easy to reach with the train from the airport to Trastevere station and then tram no 8 to its final destination. The Pensione is on the third floor without a lift, but when you come in its a world of its own. Every room is lavishly decorated. We had 19 angels, two sculptures, and a painted relief of Michelangelo in our room! We also had a massage chair, a foot massage, an espresso machine, a bread warmer as well as fridge full of breakfast items. There is no breakfast room but you get free, fresh croissants every day and pay a small fee for the other breakfast items. The room is very clean and the bed is good. The management speaks good English and helps you in any way they can. Alberto lent us books about the Secret Rome. The Pensione Barrett is close to the Pantheon, piazza Navone etc. Everything outside your doorstep! We highly recommend this place.

We wanted a reasonably priced and quiet place in the Centro Storico, and Barrett fit the bill perfectly. We were given room 14, which faces an inner courtyard and is therefore very quiet, both day (for the pennichella) and night (for an extended sleep). In addition to the queen bed, the room has also a single bed, which gave us extra space to spread out our things. Though Torre Argentina is a hub of public transportation, we preferred to walk to the great many landmarks that are just minutes away on foot (Piazza Navona, Campo de' Fiori, Pantheon, the Tosca Places, Piazza Venezia, the Campidoglio, Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Isola Tiberina, Trastevere - you name them. The bed and shower were quite comfortable, the room was squeaky clean, and the personnel extremely helpful even without our asking. True, the building has no elevator (this is due to a city ordnance forbidding the construction of elevator shafts in historical buildings such as this one), the decor of the rooms (which we found amusing) may be a bit too kitch for the taste of some. But, at 130 Euros per night, I defy you to find a better place in the Centro in terms of price/quality. We highly recommend it to folks who aren't overly finicky and come here to enjoy the city and use the room just for showering and sleeping.", "Date": "May 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cPensione Barrett, Rome\u201d", "Author": "BFava", "ReviewID": "UR28465284", "Content": "We stayed here for our honeymoon, and we could not have been any happier.

There is an espresso machine and lots of snacks and drinks in the room that are very reasonably priced. This hotel is also in the BEST location ever. It was a ten minute walk to the Colosseum, four blocks away from the Pantheon and has Campo dei Fiori right behind it (best Piazza ever) it is also five minutes away from Trastevere, the best area in Rome.
