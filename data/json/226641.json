It may be dated to some but it goes nice with the Branson country feel. We had no complaints about it. The jacuzzi in the room worked great. The pool was clean as was the hot tub in the pool area. The breakfast was nice, nothing major but it was free and filled us up. My only suggestion is maybe longer curtains because light did seep out underneath.( but with the air conditioner there I understand why they aren't longer. ) And maybe try to update exercise room.

The clerk did come up and ask them to quiet down and still they did not so I called again and finally after the 2nd time they went to their rooms. This happened every night we were there. Also the breakfast was not as good as it had been in the past, the rooms were dirty and outdated. Another time before this last experience we had issues with the air conditioner and the smoke alarm going off at random times. When we contacted the desk about it they blew it off.

There were seven of us and we booked 2 rooms. We booked using hotwire. Bad mistake, You don't get to know which hotel until AFTER you pay. This was my first time using them and will be my last. We only saved $4.00 per night. Had I known where we were staying, I would never have booked. The hotel is pretty clean, but the rooms are very dated. The mattresses were so uncomfortable! You could feel the springs in the mattress and we didn't get the sheets changed all week. The sheets didn't fit the bed and kept \"popping\" off at the corners. The TV is a very old 19\". Breakfast was a complete joke and was the worst ever! The lady taking care of it was so crabby and we never saw her smile even once, at anyone, the entire week. She acted like we were asking for her firstborn child when we simply asked for coffee. She got mad at my grandson because he took the last donut and she had to go get more. The biscuits are FROZEN and you have to microwave them yourself before you put the canned gravy on them. The breakfast menu is the same every single day. On our final day there, we didn't get breakfast. We went down an hour before it was to be over, and there was simply no food, no coffee made, nothing to eat! We left and had to spend another $65.00 for us to eat breakfast, when we had already paid for it. The jaccuzi was broken the entire time we were there. The pool water was cool, but the room where the pool is was like a sauna. You couldn't stay in there without melting. There is no ventilation in the pool area. The outdoor patio just outside the pool was dirty. Not inviting at all. It seems the employees use this space as a \"smoking area\". I will not go back to Cascades or use Hotwire.com. Cascades looks nice from the exterior, but buyer beware. There are too many good hotels in Branson that are the same price or less, and are far nicer.

I knew the moment we walked in the lobby that we were in for some trouble. At the front desk were two employees...a guy and a young woman. The guy smiled and very nicely welcomed us to the hotel, the girl glared and looked away. I figured she might be having a bad day and let it go since the guy was so friendly. We had arrived a little early and just wanted to check if our rooms were ready by any chance...the guy said it was no problem at all and started to check us in when the girl shot him a nasty look and said NO! as rudely as possible. We were slightly taken aback by her behavior, but accepted the no and said we'd come back. We went into Branson, which is a lovely place with a lot to do, and shopped and watched a movie. We returned to the hotel a few hours later and the same two people were at the front desk and now the hotel owner was with them. Once again, the young man was very nice and welcomed us back and the owner said hello very nicely. The young woman just stared at her computer, completely ignoring us. They began checking us in and the entire time the owner, and the young man who turned out to be her son, were extremely friendly and helpful. We got to our rooms which are typical Branson fare...clean and simple, but fine for the reasons you're in town...everything was clean and nice as usual. We decided to go swimming in the hotel pool, which is also nice and clean, and ended up seeing the hotel owner's son there as well...he spoke to us nicely and seemed like a very nice person, just like his mom. We had a nice time swimming, then went to dinner and enjoyed the rest of our stay until check out time the next day. This time we arrive at the front desk and no one but the rude young woman is at the desk. No hello, no good morning, no \"how was your stay?\", NOTHING. She hardly looked up from her computer to acknowledge customers. I said hello, that we were ready to check out and gave her our last names. She stayed silent and \"worked\" on her computer....she then proceeded to accuse us of having not paid. We found this especially insulting since we pre-paid online and she confirmed that the day before. She obviously didn't believe us when we told her this and continued \"working\" on her computer, all the while sighing and treating us like a major inconvenience. She finally admits that we are correct and we ask if there's anything else she needs besides our room keys. She ignores us so we begin to leave when I hear, \"UH!! I can't tell who you people are just from room keys! What room numbers are they?\" This is odd to me since she spent so long on her computer and I assume such info is on the system...but I decided it wasn't worth dealing with such a cold person and once again gave her info she already had. She did not respond, not a single thank you or anything. We left feeling angry, insulted and definitely ready to find a new place to go regularly when visiting Branson, MO. Very sad since this has always been such a great place with nice staff. We have a lot of friends and family members who go to Branson for vacations....none of them will ever stay at this hotel again since our experience. I work at an accounting firm...which is a service based industry...if I treated one of my clients in the regard that this young woman treated us and other customers in the hotel I would not have my job. This employee did not wear a name tag and never introduced herself to us, but I overheard the owner's son call her \"Catelynn\" (spelling?)

The rooms were nice, perhaps a little outdated. But I had stayed a few nights previously in another hotel across the street that was $30 more per night and I found Cascades Inn very comparable. I had excellent maid service. Room was very bright and airy - furniture is light which adds to the brightness of the room (compared to some other hotels I've stayed at where the dark furniture, bedspread and carpet made the room very bleak).

But the people were very friendly and we were taken by the natural beauty of the area. We stopped at a tourist center and when we mentioned we wanted a nice, safe, clean hotel with a swimming pool for the kids, they directed us to the Cascade Inn. We were a little reluctant to rent a place sight unseen, but we were assured it was a very nice hotel, and we took it for one night. What a pleasure it was when we arrived and discovered it was all we were promised and more. AND THE PRICE!!!! Comparable hotel rooms in our part of the country would cost 2 or 3 times what we paid. And the staff was such a joy. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome and made suggestions on things to do and see, and they were never too busy to aswer our questions.

If he had of been younger it could of been bad. We stayed in the Jr Suite, for the four days we were there, a mattress was in the hall. Also if you are thinking about the Suite be advised that there is no air in the room with the sofa bed. We had to freeze to be sure enough air got into the room with our boys. The price for the suite was a reasonable, but had a lot of draw backs.

The king size bed was comfortable and the room quiet, and also dark at night like I like. There was a tiny nite light in the bathroom that was perfect if you needed to get up at night---just enough light--- but not too much light to keep you awake. The Jacuzzi tub was great and the bathroom was large. The inside pool and hot tub were very nice---also not crowded, and open till midnight. My husband enjoyed the exercise room. You had to use your room key to enter the exercise room. The continental breakfast was great! Very clean and stocked well. Fresh doughtuts, bagels, hot and cold cereal, toast, boiled eggs, fruit, coffee, tea, juices, etc. The hostess was very friendly and nice. The front desk clerks were nice too, and helpful with information about the Branson area.
