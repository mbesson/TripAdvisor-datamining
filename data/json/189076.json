It was fabulous and as everything with Disney, there was nothing that was done wrong! I had requested a Savannah view room and was disappointed on check in when we were told it was Pool view. But once I realized, we had a beautiful view of the pool and the Savannah was just beyond the pool and we could see that as well! It was just perfect! Everything very clean, spacious. It was a club level Studio, so we had a continental breakfast daily, snacks all day, wine, beer in the afternoon with more snacks and deserts and wine and Liquors in the evening. This was our first time at a Disney Property and I recommend it highly for so many reasons. The ease of using Disney Transportation and the ease of check in and check out! I was so impressed when we checked our luggage at our home airport and we never saw it until it was delivered to our room! And, when leaving, they printed our boarding passes, took our luggage and again never saw it until we arrived in our home airport. It was all just too easy!!

Like Vegas, the best experience (if that can be said) is close to the action. At Disneyworld, that means staying on the property. Jambo House is not among the great hotels of the world, but it is well done - if vintage. With two grandkids, we took a room overlooking a waterhole. It featured a queen-size bed and bunk beds. It was expensive and rather small. The tub/toilet area is dark and not particularly well vented. The best feature of the room is the little balcony where giraffe's, gazelle, cranes and other exotic animals could be seen at close hand. The kids loved it. While the room is not state-of-the-art, the staff is. As elsewhere in Disneyworld, any cast (i.e. staff) member seems ready to answer your most arcane questions. Disneyworld food is mediocre at best - with rare exception a \"foodie free\" zone. Our best meal was at Jiko restaurant in the hotel. The appetizers and protein with the entree was very well done.

We loved seeing the zebras and giraffes right outside our balcony (mostly early in the morning or in the evening), and there are ostriches, flamingos, okapi, and many other animals to view throughout the resort. The rooms were a bit smaller than we would have liked, but the thrill of being so close to the animals made up for that. We were too busy to really take advantage of everything the resort had to offer, but there are great restaurants, including Boma (loved the buffet dinner!), and a nice shop, fitness area, and pool.

This was our first stay at the Animal Kingdom resort and I think this was our favorite resort so far out of the 5 or 6 places we have stayed at WDW. The villa was amazing. 3 huge bedrooms and 4 full baths, as well as 2 living areas and a full kitchen/dining room. And the Savannah views were the icing on the cake. We spent hours sitting out on our balconies (2 levels of them) watching zebras, giraffes and other animals grazing below us. Had we not already had park tickets, we could have easily just hung out in the room for days. We did spend almost a full day at the pool area. The kids had a total blast. It wasn't as crowded as earlier reviews have indicated, although there didn't seem to be anything stopping non-guests from hanging out there. The front desk staff assured us that only guests could get in, but I'm not sure exactly how that was supposed to work, given that the gates didn't require you to use a card to get in. We did try to bypass the regular bus one morning (they were super packed, since the whole state of TX has the same Spring Break) by grabbing a cab one morning. REALLY BAD IDEA! They don't drop you off in front of the park (Magic Kingdom) - they drop you off at the monorail/ferry center, where you have to wait forever to get on one or the other. Take my advice, just wait for the bus - even if you have to take the next one, you'll still save time and $20. If you are able, highly recommend staying here.

You must keep your shades drawn for privacy because there are cameras facing the balcony and animals. The rooms are very dark.

We were also fortunate to have got a free dining plan for the week for 9 of us from Virgin Holidays. That was a huge saving. The staff were all superb.

That was a shame but we didnt complain because we were lucky to have had the upgrade. We ate at Sanaa restaurant after the wedding and it was a perfect decision. We had a few extras thrown in for us and an african band playing. The food was excellent and certainly better then Boma or Jiko. Jiko was a bitter disappointment. Very expensive and very bland.A rather grumpy waiter too. But having said that, the whole restaurant is brilliant. there are plenty of things for the children to see and do and all the rangers around the animals spend endless hours talking to them.

We wished that he would just give us a key and straighten it out in the morning, but he didn`t. My first impression of the room was not good. I had stayed in the AKL before and expected a similarly beautiful view of the pool area. Our view was of a small hot tub and trees. Also we were given a balcony that was solid wall from floor to rail so that you could not see through the railing, thus significantly blocking light from entering the room. I imagined that our room would be quite dark during the day. However, we were too tired to go back to object and opted to make the best of it for the two days that we were staying at the resort. Other than the view, the room was exactly the other rooms that I have stayed in at the AKL. They are a combination of brown, red and green that is very rich and earthy but a little dark. The space seems a bit cramped for a luxury hotel, but it is adequate to be comfortable enough. There were 2 queen beds, dresser and table with 2 chairs. No sofa and no plush seating. The balcony had 2 metal chairs and a small table. The bathrom was typical of Disney hotels with 2 sinks outside and a small bathroom with toilet and tub. The lobby and other public areas are nothing short of spectacular. The restaurants (Boma and Jiko) were also quite good for evening dining. Boma is an all you can eat buffet which was good value for the money we thought. Mara is the fast food, counter service place that we enjoyed for breakfast. We carried our selection to a small area outside and enjoyed the peaceful tropical ambience very much. It never seemed busy, but we rose late so it might be busier early in the morning.

The attendant knew somehow that it was our anniversary and also had the pronunciation to our name correct (our name, while common sounding, has an unusual spelling). Upon arrival at the gorgeous, African inspired resort we were met by a very friendly lady who showed us to the express check-in line. We were able to get our room early and enjoyed the kids playground and viewing the pink flamingos while we waited. We also enjoyed lunch at the Mara- they have great flatbread pizzas. Our room, while pretty and colourful, was a bit small with the two queen beds. The bathroom area was nice, as was the balcony, but the actual living space was the only disappointment of the whole hotel. Disney's Animal Kingdom lodge was a wonderful hotel. The service was excellent, the hotel is very clean and beautifully maintained and the added elements of having a safari like mini zoo surrounding it was really special. It is neat to see a giraffe as you are walking from your room to the pool through one of the many large windows. The restaurants at Animal Kingdom Lodge - Jambo house are really nice and we walked up to the other part of the resort - Kidani Village for dinner at Saana - and it was the best meal we had the whole time at Disney - dinner while looking at Zebras 20 feet from your table - a magical evening for sure. The pool and gift shop are great as well and kids can watch movies at night beside or in the pool. They have two great hot tubs too to enjoy. Tips - subscribe to the insiders Disney newsletter a few months before you are hoping to book a Disney trip at - www.mousesavers.com - this site sends you insider tips about 1x a month and i learned through one of the newsletters that Disney had a 'free meal plan' promotion. This saved us about $800 in meals and we ate like Kings for the whole time we were there with only paying for a couple of breakfasts. Another tip is to use the disney.com Mom's panel advice - great advice when booking Disney hotels. You can also make dinner reservations for any Disney restaurant on the Disney website - much more convenient than by phone and do this as early as you can to avoid disappointment. Also i recommend taking the Disney bus transport rather than your rental car if you have one. We took our car the first day and it was more of a hassle than the Disney bus system which runs very smoothly. It is not far from this hotel to any of the Disney parks.

This is a mini trip report: some pay-it-forward/pay-it-back for all the good advice we got from this forum prior to going. AKL: The AKL is great: staff are friendly and helpful, the restaurants are good (e.g., Mara) and excellent (e.g., Boma), and our room was very nice. We opted for a pool view (saved $700) and made a special room request (by fax) for an unobstructed view toward the end of the Giraffe trial (not above a restaurant). It was nice to be right next to the pool, which made it easy to zip back and forth between the room and the pool in bathing suits. We had plenty of opportunities to see wildlife too, although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to see the baby Okapi, who was still too shy to venture out of the barn (next time!). We would definitely recommend the AKL: good gift store, story-telling around campfires, great pool and hot tubs, rooms are well appointed, clean, and housekeeping was prompt (though a few more towel animals would have been nice). The themeing is amazingly detailed and very cool, and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind the theme-appropriate lighting at all (which strangely seems to be a common complaint). The Disney transportation system worked very well for us, which may be a reflection of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd time of year we went. Ou8r timing was great: we never waited more than 5 minutes for a bus which took us straight to our destination, the only exception being going from Blizzard beach to downtown for the Cirque (we ended up taking a taxi that time). When we go back to WDW, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to stay at the AKL again if we can get the discounted rate. The AKL is great! Dining: We were on the dining plan (DP), which worked well for us. The DP is a bit tricky if you have a kid who eats like an adult. Daughter has a big and adventurous appetite so we did our best to stay away from restaurants with kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s menus (which are pretty bad, in our view). We thus mostly had buffets for dinner: Boma, Crystal Palace, Biergarten, and Hollywood and Vine. Boma is the best buffet we tried in WDW, in our view, and another good reason to stay at the AKL. We mostly had muffins and fruit for breakfasts, in our room or while waiting for the bus. I liked the dining plan for a few reasons: 1) once paid, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about the cost; 2) it prompts you to book your reservations in advance (something I probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have done without the dining plan); and 3) It seems to be pretty good value if you eat at the buffets (which are, like all else in WDW, expensive). We paid about $65 per day for the plan and a typical day for use was: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Breakfast: used free drink mugs for coffee and such and paid cash for fruit and muffins \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Lunch: Sandwhiches, drinks and deserts (e.g., at MK Downtown Bakery would have cost about $30) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Snack: Ice cream bars (would have cost about $8) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Dinner: buffet at Boma (would have cost about $57) I think we saved about $30 per day on the dining plan, which in itself makes it worth it. For me, the best part about the DP was not worrying about money for food, which is a nice relief from the gratuitous assault on one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wallet everywhere else. Next time we go we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll defiantly have a food order delivered to the resort or make a stop on the way to buy bottled water, juice, snacks and food for breakfasts (and avoid paying $3.5 for a muffin at Mara). Parks: Six days of Woohoo!!!! We did all the parks (in order): Magic Kingdom (MK), Animal Kingdom (AK), Epcot, Blizzard Beach (BB) (Typhoon Lagoon was closed), and Hollywood Studios (HW). We also went to Islands of Adventure for a day. We read the Unofficial Guide to WDW with Kids prior to going, which proved to be immensely helpful. Without the book we would have spent a lot of time in lineups, even though it was supposedly a slow time of year. We followed the book\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice: got to the parks prior to opening, went on the busiest rides first and made clever use of the fastpass. We made our own \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plan of attack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for each park roughly base on guide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153touring plans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which I think saved us a lot of time in the lineups (e.g., get to HW early and head straight to Toy Story Mania, get a Fastpass, ride it right away using the regular line, and then return later and use your fastpass to ride it a second time). When we came back later, the regular lineup was 2 hour long. Yikes! I shudder to think what it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like during the summer months. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy to say we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t line up for any ride or show for more than 20 minutes. When we go again, I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll to go for a little longer, and generally take things a little slower. We did six long and intense days but weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to see even half of it. Next time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to take at least 8 days and use a couple of our days to go to a park for a second day, perhaps a half day, then head back to the resort to laze about. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend as much relaxing time at the resort as we might have.

We have stayed at most of the other resorts and had good experiences. The Contemporary was our favorite up to this visit. Animal Kingdom is the best of the best, for lots of big and small reasons. We recommend this to everyone. It is a secure location with a gated area, and we were greeted by name and our son wished a Happy Birthday as we walked in. A person immediately come over to greet us and brought us a welcome package with the room key. We had paid for a standard room, and called the week before and asked for any comp upgrades available. When we checked in, we were given the room at the very end of the Zebra Trail. Thinking this was a view of the parking lot, we were a little disappointed. It was all we paid for, so all our fault. We were so delighted to find an incredible room on the Savannah, with Ostrichs, Zebras, and other delights right outside the window. Yes, as other reviews have said, the rooms are smallish. Fine for the time we spent in it, and the double vanity was a bonus. The lobby is amazing and there were so many activities there that we could have easily only done the parks 1/2 time and stayed on property the rest of the time. The pool was incredible and staff was out there to play with the kids every hour. We saw no bugs or anything (aside from a huge roach at EPCOT...they are outdoor parks in Florida....) The restaurants at the hotel left much to be desired, but there is a McDonald's at the next exit plus most of the time is spent at the parks. The hotel as a whole is so worth it. We saw all kinds of animals from every overlook. As others have said, it is worth the extra to be on the Savannah, or at least the pool side. We were blessed with our upgrade. It made the trip even more special. The gift shop had everything we could have wanted for snacks or souveniers, and the staff was great. They helped us with last minute dinner plan changes when we went to a different park, then called to make sure we liked the restaurant they recommended. Bell staff was awesome with the luggage, and the entire staff enjoyed the children. Our room was very clean and taken well care of. We did tip very well and asked for an additional towel animal, which we did not get. If this is the worst thing to have happened, it was still a 10 out of a 10. The busses were pretty slow, but we had a rental car. We split our time between the busses and the car. Huge benefit of not having to pay for parking at the parks. We totally recommend the meal plan. So nice to not have to pick up the $100 meal ticket at the nicest restaurants with the best food. The regular plan is the most efficient. 1 full service, 1 self service and 1 snack each day.

What is a once in a lifetime vacation for many families for me has become the consistent weekend getaway. What amazes me most about Disney is its ability to be amazingly fresh and unique. This was the case in my first stay at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge (AKL) this past weekend. A bit more secluded than other resorts on property, the AKL is tucked away adjacent to Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park. The resort is broken out into two sections; Jambo House and Kidani Village. Jambo House is the original center of the resort with Kidani Village recently opening as a home base for Disney Vacation Club members. I was fortunate to have a savannah view room in the Jambo House on the second floor. The Jambo House will serve as the basis for this review. As expected with Disney, the detailed theming is evident from the moment one walks in. The Jambo House appears to be a large \"hut\" with straw roofing and tree bark walls. The lobby was overwhelmingly beautiful with displays of authentic African artistry and lavish theming. The backside of the lobby is a large open window with outstanding view into the savannah. This is where Disney hits it out of the park. Where else can you stay in this region where you can walk outside and see beautiful African animals roaming around this beautiful landscape? Check in service was fantastic as is the norm with Disney. The person checking me in was a new employee with a tag labeled \"earning my ears\" which I thought was cute. Upon receiving my check information I made the long hall to my room (placed in the last section of the building). Yes this could be a long walk so if you would like to avoid don't hesitate to request a room closer to the lobby. One thing I have learned with Disney resorts is that luxury is not the key. While their rooms are not designed as five star rooms, they do offer small touches with theming and distinction that brings out their uniqueness. We had a room overlooking the savanah and were fortunate to see an abundance of animals from the balcony. Again, you won't get this kind of experience outside of Disney. The amenities at AKL were really a standout point. The pool was of really nice size complete with a slide which all the kiddies seemed to enjoy. A hot tub was located adjacent to pool partially secluded under several trees. I have to say on a chilly evening, this was the ticket. The fitness area blew me away with plenty of machines and free weights. I'm not one for working out during a getaway but having the option is always a plus. AKL is home to two popular Disney restaurants; Boma and Jiko. Boma is the buffet-type restaurant open for breakfast and dinner. Boma is more on the casual side but definitely a unique experience. Jiko is the higher grade restaurant with a more intimate atmosphere. If you are feeling really adventurous, hop over to the Kidani Village for Sanaa, an african themed full service restaurant. For those that are looking for quick dining, don't fret as a food court called Mara is available adjacent to the pool area. Here you can grab a quick burger, pizza, or other snacks. There are no bigger perks to staying on Disney property than extra magic hours at the theme parks and free transportation. Although AKL has a relatively remote location within Disney borders, their bus service is one of the better I have experienced. The resort only has two stops (one for Jambo and other for Kidani) and is really not a very long bus ride to the other theme parks. Remember though that wait times are a very variable issue and anything can either prolong or expedite your transportation around the resort. Number of guests, traffic issues, & luck all have impacts on wait times for transportation. AKL is part of Disney's deluxe resort category. Understand that the emphasis here is not on overall luxury but uniqueness of experience. Sometimes because of the pricing we are expecting to be staying in the Waldorf Astoria. Two different experiences!!! Think about this when staying at Disney; what is the driver behind the cost? What you get at a place like AKL is something you won't get elsewhere. It is a family experience that will stick out from other hotel stays and at the end of the day, we all want distinction. Hotel stays will vary based on the necessity of your trip. If you decide to stay in AKL, take some time to enjoy this unique experience. A day off from the parks at this place will really make that expense worth the price.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Overland Park, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cAfrican Themed Luxury\u201d", "Author": "rikrax", "ReviewID": "UR124659387", "Content": "We spent a week at the Animal Kingdom Lodge in February.

There are several wildlife viewing areas on the property, and we did see some exotic animals quite easily. At one of the viewing areas they allow you to borrow some night-vision binoculars in the evening and that's kinda fun to do. Looks just like you see on TV - greenish glow but you can see the animals who prefer darkness. There are two seated restaurants, a fast food type place, a gift shop and sundries store. We have eaten at all three places, and the food is excellent - plentiful and delicious. There are choices for the adventurous (African cuisine) and not-so-adventurous (American style options). Desserts are to die for. At Boma, try the Zebra Domes, their signature dessert. As with many Disney restaurants, the food is rather pricey, but you do get good quality and quantity.

We took advantage to the low season discount offers and stayed Club Level king on the zebra trail with great savannah view. Our room was not immediately ready, but check in was a breeze with excellent service delivered by Cast Member Chris. I was surprised they are not allowed to take tips, but we put in a good word to the manager. Room decor was relaxing, bed was firm, and nightly turndown service came with a charming quote card and chocolates on the pillow. We could not hear hall or inter-room noise unless there was a child tantrum going on. I know there are a lot of complaints about dim lighting, but we did not find it to be an issue. More annoying is that the exhaust fan and lighting are on the same switch making it difficult to hear what else is going on in the room. The H2O toiletries were fantastic and water pressure in the shower was one of the best I have had in a hotel. Club Level food was decent though we only nibbled on fruit for breakfast. Oatmeal, yogurt, pastries, toast, quinoa, sodas, and milk were also available. Great tea and juice selections and the espresso machine was outstanding. You can get South African beer and wine all day on request, and we particularly enjoyed the Tusker Lager. My only criticisms are the lack of protein in the morning (cheese and nuts would have been appreciated) and the water was really awkward to pour out of the large Evian bottles. It is a shame the open lounge overlooks the lobby instead of a Savanna. The Sunrise Safari was the highlight of the trip and we got some amazing shots. It was worth staying Club Level to be able to participate in this experience and our guide Amanda was excellent. The female ostrich with the male coloring started to attack the vehicle which was scary and hilarious! Wanyama Safari was okay and worth doing once, but we should have scheduled it for our first rather than last night. I loved walking the property anytime of day to take in the animals and atmosphere, especially talking to staff. The night vision goggles were pretty cool also. We were the first and last stop on the Magical Express with Pop Century and Caribbean Beach making up the other resorts on the trip. It took an hour and 20 from boarding the bus to arriving at AKL and just about an hour to get to the airport. Bus transportation was efficient to all of the parks and we never waited more than 15 minutes. We usually had at least one person in a wheelchair or ECV, and the drivers seemed to treat them and their companions with care, attention, and efficiency. The day we intended to spend at the pool wound up being a bit ugly, but we had a great time relaxing in the hot tub our last night (should have done this sooner!). It looked like they had a lot of fun poolside activities for the kids as well as an arcade, playground, and nighttime cartoons. We also had massages at the health club which were average, at best. I would opt for Saratoga or Grand Floridian when they finish it up if you want anything more than a relaxing \"me time\" massage. We loved Sanna for lunch and it was a short, enjoyable walk to Kidani from Jambo. Breakfast buffet at Boma was very good with some authentic options. Our experience at Jiko was tasty, but as it was part of the Wanyama safari, it was served as a fixed family style menu. I would like to go back and experience it as a regular dinner because what we sampled was amazing and I want more!

Although you do have to take a bus to get to any parks, the resort makes up for all of that. Our most recent stay at this resort was in January of 2012 for Disney's Marathon weekend. The decor in the Lodge is warm and welcoming. The lobby is vast with huge windows in the back overlooking the savannah. The colors are mostly browns, tans, and oranges - very muted. The lighting isn't very bright in the hallways but fits in with the overall feeling. In the lobby you there is a fireplace and down one level to the right you will find the Victoria Falls Lounge. There is an indoor waterfalls to fit the entire theme of this lounge. Go down one more level and you will find two very popular eating places Jiko (The Cooking Place - a more formal place to enjoy dinner) and Boma (an informal buffet open for breakfast and dinner) You can exit the lobby and go outside to a welcoming firepit complete with rocking chairs and many viewing areas to enjoy the animals out on the savannah. You will usually find a cast member by the animals who knows quite a bit about the animals and their habits. Take the time to talk to one of these staff members. Many of them are from Africa and have some interesting stories to share. Our room was on the Disney Vacation Club Level and we had a studio suite which consisted of one Queen bed and a pull out sofa. Only my husband and myself were on this trip so the room was just the right size. The double sinks have their own section apart from the toilet and bathtub/shower. We also had a small area with a fridge, microwave, and toaster. Our room had a view of the savannah. During the colder times, you will not always see a lot of animals out and about. This is especially true in the early colder mornings. We did not spot one animal any morning of our stay but we were always up pretty early and it was still cold outside by Florida standards. Our room was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. There was a small balcony outside of our room with two chairs where we were able to view some animals during the warmer afternoon hours when they were out and about. By the pool, you will find Mara - a quick service place to eat. There is also a bar by the pool. The excersise room is state-of-the art. Seriously good for a hotel - like a small well stocked gym and kept very clean. Even if you don't have a room with a savannah view, you can still enjoy the animals as there are many public viewing areas along each of the floors for guests to use. Each time we stay in this resort, we feel relaxed and transported to something out-of-the-ordinary.

We originally requested a king bed, savanna view on the 2nd floor. Check-in was fine, however they couldn't get us a king or a 2nd floor room, but said it would be available the next day. First night we were on the 4th floor in a savanna room (directly across Kidani Village's Sanaa restaurant. My wife saw some animals and thought it was great. The next day we were transfered to a Arusha Savanna view on the 2nd floor by Zebra's Trail (king bed)! THIS VIEW WAS AMAZING! My wife loved the animals and the animal keeper saw her out on the balcony and put the lettuce in the trees right by our window so she could have a closer view of the giraffes. Very nice. Rooms are pretty normal hotel rooms, nothing fantasy or 'Disney' about it, but they are clean. The hotel itself is very clean, you won't smell the animals. The lobby in beautiful, however I feel it was missing the 'Disney' touch. Where is Mickey in Safari gear or any character paintings? The only Mickey and Disney items are in the hotel shop. Staff was very friendly, my wife just discovered pin trading and she annoyed everyone there, but they did it with a smile lol. The property is beautiful and you can see the animals on countless places (they have observation decks with binoculars and even night vision goggles at night). Some restaurants also have a view of the Savanna. Boma was great for BREAKFAST as it's a buffet and was responsibly priced. We had the dinner buffet there once, it was pretty good, but nothing to repeat. We had breakfast 5 out of the 7 days at Boma though. Breakfast would be fine for children, but the dinner was lacking in the kid's food department. We tried Sanaa the first night, the food wasn't bad at all, but it's not our thing (very African/Indian type style), so we didn't enjoy it too much. Also it was packed so it took us a while to get served. The menu is decently sized but if your not adventurous in your food, then you might want to pass. They apparently do accommodate children as I saw a few eating a pizza, however if we had kids I don't think we would take them there. It's not too kid friendly. We passed on Jiko because of the menu, as the only thing we would really have wanted was the Filet Mignon which was $43. The Mara is there quick service downstairs, we ate there for lunch a few times and to get snacks. It's easily the best place to eat if you have kids, they have burgers, sandwiches, pizza, milks, cereal, salads, etc. The food was very very good. If you buy the souvenir cup, you can have free refills at the restaurant the entire trip. NOTE: Room Service is only until midnight and the Mara closes at 11:30, during that 30 minute time, the R.S. menu is very limited. Don't bother unless you want a special desert or shrimp, I ordered a burger the first night and then the next night I went to the Mara. Same burger, $7 more if you order through Room Service. SO make the walk if you can. The pool is nice and we went in once, but it was way too cold. The hot tub is nice as well. As for the bus system, we went during a time that wasn't really busy, but the longest ride took maybe 20 minutes? We didn't mind it at all. We used the buses the entire trip. My parents and my two younger sisters (13 and 15) came by to see the room and the animals; the animals were a huge hit! They loved it. We are actually planning on saying at Kidani Village later this year! Overall this is a wonderful property. I liked it, my wife LOVED it. Seeing the animals outside your balcony is very cool, but I prefer the whole Disney experience, which I thought was lacking some in the hotel. IF this is for adults and teenagers, definitely go, if you have small children that won't get a huge kick out of the animals, or will get bored after 25 minutes or so, then go to another Disney property", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, UK", "Title": "\u201cCome for the animals...\u201d", "Author": "shimmydamper", "ReviewID": "UR124245139", "Content": "Checked-in here for a 2 night break following 2 nights at the Wilderness Lodge.

We absolutely loved this resort. To be honest, I wasn't entirely sure when we checked in and found our room was about a 15 minute walk to the main foyer/bus stop, however we were able to have a room change, much closer to the main foyer/bus stop and an easier walk to the swimming pool. The cast members at Animal Kingdom were all wonderful and went out of their way to ensure that your stay was pleasurable. There is a commuter van to take you to the Jambo House (where you will find the fast service meals, and BOMA). We all enjoyed the pool/water park area. We stayed in a deluxe Savanah view studio, they are small, but very clean and well kept. If you decide to opt for a Savanah view, request a \"Sunset Savanah\" view, if you are intent on seeing Giraffe's and Zebra's outside your window. That being said, you really don't need the Savanah view, as there are many spots to sit and watch the animals. This is a HUGE resort and some of the rooms may be as much as 20+ mins from the main lobby/bus stop. Request a room closer to the main lobby if this is a concern. The bus service was fabulous. We never waited more than 5 mins for any bus, any day. Some people say that Animal Kingdom Lodge feels \"secluded\", I didn't feel that way at all.

This is my second review so I will try to keep it a little shorter and you can see my review history if you are interested in the original. Several people marked it as helpful. The resort itself it stunning. The lobby, restaurants, hallways - all breathtaking in their design. The amount of handcarved woodwork is astonishing. It really became much more amazing this time around as we spent more time at the resort and I really had a chance to appreciate it this time around. There are folks that complain about the rooms and say this isn't a 5 start resort, but I beg to differ. I too, travel. This is nothing like a typical 5 star resort like a Ritz or a Penninsula, etc. It doesn't have shiny modern design and finishings. This is a themed resort. A Safari theme - and if you really take the time to look around and appreciate all of it - particularly the architecture, finishes and lush grounds around the pool, you will see why it truly is 5 star. The rooms themselves may not seem 5 star. I mean, some have bunkbeds for heavens sake - but still, they are very nice. My take on this is that EVERY room in Disney is comparable from a value - deluxe. It is the resort itself that makes a room value, mod., deluxe. Advice - If this is your first trip, and money is at all a consideration. Go ahead and stay at a value resort and please don't feel you are missing out. A first visit to Disney is OVERWHELMING. There is so much to see or do, you could never do it all in a week, and you will find yourself leaving early and coming back late every day. We did this even with small children, taking advantage of the family/child centers available at each park to take breaks, change diapers, do feedings, etc. You won't even have a chance to appreciate the resort and depending upon the package and the number of people in your party, a value package could be nearly half the price. This was our third trip and we finally were able to spend more time at the resort and really did appreciate it and use the amenities, making it worth it. Savannah versus Standard. Both times we have stayed here we booked standards and were upgraded to Savannah. I think this has to do with arriving on Tuesdays. Most people arrive on a Saturday. There are likely way more people that book standard than they actually have rooms for. By the time Tuesday arrives I'm guessing those rooms are filled and that is why we have received the upgrade. Yeah for us. Take that information for what it is worth. The Mara - Am I crzazy or has the menu VASTLY improved here? Honestly, we ditched some of our sit down meals on the dining plan and ate here a few times instead. The food is amazing and there is a TON of it as they throw in desert. Don't miss it. Boma is also amazing. LOVED their breakfast AND Dinner. Save money with the dining plan: Yes, it is already paid for (or free, depending on the package you booked), but you will still pay tip - and this adds up. Tip at breakfast is much less than it is for dinner. On several days we used our sit down meal for breakfast which honestly kept us full until mid-late afternoon. Used a snack credit at the park (sometimes) and did a quick service at night back at the hotel or at the park. Something to consider, especially if you don't have advance reservations for sit down dinners which may or may not be hard to get into without them. Back to AKL. We saw lovely animals outside the room every day, it was incredibly clean, the bathroom was tiny but the shower was great. The rooms are nice and beautifully decorated but there isn't much dresser space - 2 drawers and a smaller nightstand drawer, bus service was great (It was January, however), the distance from Magic Kingdom wasn't a bother, the pool is phenomenal as are the grounds surrounding it, they do fun things like art and craft projects for the kids/families during the day, roast marshmallows by the fire pit near the pool, have night vision goggles to view the animals at night - it was fantastic. Again, it IS expensive. If money isn't an issue go and ENJOY! If you are watching your dollars go and enjoy one of their lovely value or moderate resorts, your vacation will be magical.

There was a very spacious bathroom, with the shower and toilet in a separate room from the vanity. Our sons slept in the livingroom on a queen sleeper and sleeper chair. They are both approx 6'3\" and they fit on the sleepers fine. They also said that they were quite comfortable. We had a very nice full size dining table and full kitchen. Since we stayed on the concierge floor, we did not use the kitchen at all. This was our first visit to Disneyworld and now we are spoiled and would not want to stay anyplace else. The concierge floor was wonderful. My husband and I would go get coffee early and bring it back to the room to watch the weather for that day and read the free USA Today that was left outside our room each morning. We would get around, then go have a nice breakfast and head out to one of the parks. All four of us would meet for a nice lunch at a different park each day. That was the only meal we needed to purchase. When we got tired, we would head back to our room for a nap, stopping by the concierge for a few snacks and/or drinks. We would have an early dinner with the appetizers on the concierge floor. My husband and I would grab a plate, they always had bottles of wine, too. Then we would take them to our room and sit on our really nice balcony and watch the animals come by. We had a partial view savannah room, but we saw many different animals each day, there was no complaint. We would then head back to the parks or swim at the hotel. The pool, water slide and hot tub were all great. One night we went out to see the animals on the savannah with night vision googles and they also had a bonfire each night where they would roast marshmallows if you wanted.

I will choose first floor in this area everytime since its close to pool and restaurants. The best thing of staying at Disney is the free transportation to all Disney areas. The pool was awesome. It was big pool with a slide. There is pool bar and 2 jacuzzis. There are plenty of activities for children and adults. Too many to name. 1 for adults and children is night vision goggles at night to view animals on some nights. During the day the giraffes and other animals are easy to see and get real close sometimes. There are also kids activities like face painting and cookie decorating. Overall I love this resort. We almost didn't go that many times to the park since resort has so much. The hallways are quiet and staff is friendly and very helpful.

We had a TV, DVD player, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, hairdryer. Our room had a balcony and you could look out see the animals very close. We saw Zebras and antelope, giraffe, and several other kinds of animals. Our bathroom had a big area with two sinks and counter top, the bathroom itself was very small. I felt claustrophobic when the door was shut. There were two dressers and a place to hang up clothes in the walk way. There was also an iPod dock station and a table and chairs. We ate at Mara and it was OK, just normal quick service meals. We tried to eat at Boma, when we arrived they told us there was no wait time, an hour later we left because we didn't want to wait anymore. We ended up eating outside of Disney World. My daughter took part in some of the activities they have at the hotel we did Medallion rubbing, cookie decorating and then we did some activities at the pool. She LOVED the pool it had a zero entrance, and they had life jackets for the kids. My daughter went down the water slide many times. That night we took part in night vision viewing and the evening parade. Sleeping is a different story, those beds are awful! I had a really hard time sleeping. Pillows aren't worth much either. Check out went great since I opted for easy checkout I didn't have to go to the front desk at all. They emailed my bill to me and I checked it on my phone and made sure it was ok and we left.

The room itself was not impressive; small, rough linens, no sitting space. Everything was clean though (except the phone) which is what I really look for.

I read reviews, blogs, books, and I even got the \"Lines\" app. My husband and I are in our fifties and our daughter and friend are both 20. The AKL was beautiful, we had rooms 3284 (savannah) and 3273 (partial savannah) and one rainy afternoon we came back to the hotel and we saw giraffes, zebras, and several large birds. It's really cool to look outside and see the animals, but outside of that one rainy afternoon, we left in the dark and returned in the dark...so if that's your plan, to be at the parks all day, then I would not be as concerned with the savannah view if it's a splurge for your budget. We all had the dining plan and loved it! We used it at great restaurants, the Boma which was fantastic, just as everyone said it would be, ohana at the polynesian, also fantastic, Teppan Edo, Epcot, good food and fun, and the Brown Derby. Just my husband and i went to the Brown Derby and it requires 2 table service credits per person, so i paid for my cobb salad (which they are famous for) and my husband had the tenderloin with 2 credits. Then we shared our dishes, including their famous grapefruit cake, which i wasn't that impressed with, but it was nice to escape from the hustle and bustle of the crowd, have a glass of wine and a relaxing dinner, then back to Tower of Terror! The Mara at AKL was great for grabbing breakfast, but they don't open until 7:00am so if you rise early you have to settle for in room coffee. It was a little chilly for the pool, but the hot tub was nice, we tried the night vision goggles, but we were so busy, we just didn't get to enjoy all the amenities, and there were many! The AKL is far from all the parks except Animal Kingdom, we did rent a car, but wished we hadn't because the buses were so great we never used the car! One suggestion to families of children in strollers, if it were me I'd stay at the Polynesian because it's really nice and right off the monorail. So you can push the strollers right onto the monorail and off to the parks in minutes as opposed to a longer ride on a crowded bus and dealing with closing the strollers and all...plus you can easily go back to the hotel for lunch and a rest (assuming you spend most of your time at the MK). For teens and couples of all ages AKL is fantastic. The beds are comfy too...I even brought a mattress topper just in case and didn't need it. I also brought a fan for white noise but didn't need that either because they had portable fans. I also thought the AKL was quiet at night and we went to bed at 9:00! One last thing, we flew southwest so we could use the service that checked our bags and gave us our boarding passes right at the AKL so when we got to the airport we went straight to the gate...HOW AWESOME IS THAT??

But it was an anniversary celebration and we decided to go for it. (Note that the regular off season rate for their better \"Arusha View\" was $340 a night; we paid $247.75 total per night.) Booking with the Disney reservations system was seamless. I have to say that the timing for this trip was perfect. Warm days, cool nights, manageable crowds at Animal Kingdom, and a relatively quiet hotel. Off season is good! My first impression of the hotel property completely lived up to expectations. The lobby was breathtakingly beautiful and the grounds were just lovely. Disney certainly knows how to create a dream ... were it not for the tops of nearby Disney hotels peeking over the roofline of the Lodge, you'd swear that you'd been transported to Africa! We were initially given room 2241, which didn't thrill me. It was on the first level and I found it to be a little confining with respect to the view. Go higher if you can; the view will be opened up. Room 3309 was far better ... nice panorama of the Arusha Savanna and the nesting pelicans on the Arusha Rock Overlook. Lots of critters, day and night ... more on that a bit later. Room 3309: Two queen beds. African inspired decor featuring an abundance of thoughtful and attractive details; this was an pleasant hotel room. However, it was definitely on the small side (especially for the inflated price). More than two bodies would be uncomfortably crowded. The bathroom was tiny. If you're already ... uh ... \"sitting down,\" and more than small/average sized, it might be a challenge to close the door! But on the bright side, there's a separate area featuring double sinks and a convevient shelf than runs the entire length of the mirror. More good stuff: Decent \"minibar\" sized fridge. Cuisinart coffee maker with ample supply of individual coffee packs. And much to my surprise, that Arabican coffee was pretty good. Despite the cooler evening temps, I enjoyed sipping on a cuppa while admiring the animals from my \"private balcony seating.\" About the animals ... you'll find an illustrated \"Wildlife Field Guide\" list in your room. Believe me; you'll see most of the animals listed, and it's beyond thrilling. Your critter sightings are guaranteed, because food is stategically placed throughout the savanna as well as close to the rooms. What you won't see is any visible evidence that the zebra or ankole cattle or roan antelope passed directly beneath your balcony. The Disney poop patrol is ever vigilant! Bottom line, perhaps the whole experience is somewhat \"staged,\" but who cares? It still works! Some valuable tips: Chat with the uniformed African Cultural Exchange students that you'll find out on the Arusha Rock Overlook. They know everything about the animals and are happy to educate you about their home countries. After dinner, take a comfy seat by the Arusha Rock Fire Pit. You never know who you'll meet! Talking about hotel dining, give the Boma buffet a miss ... it was really disappointing. Noisy, ridiculously overpriced at $32.99 pp, average quality offerings, and a big zero for ambience. Take the Lodge van over to the adjacent Kidani Village. The Sanaa restaurant was a brilliant dining experience, and much, much better priced! The Mara \"cafeteria-style\" dining option was just fine for breakfast or lunch. I recommend the chicken tikka pita! While you're there, grab a carton of milk (for morning coffee) and a muffin or croissant as well. That way, you can enjoy a relaxed \"fuel up\" in the morning, while you're getting ready for the theme parks. Not to mention ... more time to admire the animals. So, bottom line, is a stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge worth the inflated price? For us, for this special occasion, I'd have to say yes.

The pool area is nice, nothing extraordinary, but movie night at the pool is great if you have kids or you're just a kid at heart. Still, it's a large pool and the view of the Lodge from the Pool (especially at night) is outstanding. The food - Amazing! My wife and I have done Jiko and Boma, loved both. We tried the little cafe (Mara) and didn't care much for it, but that was sort of expected. Rooms - Well themed without being \"cartoonish.\" Our last stay (this was our 3rd) was with a pool view and it was amazingly quiet. The small balcony was nice and the room was clean and comfortable. We stay in Studios and they offer plenty of space. The Service - Always top-shelf!!! Like I said, this was my 3rd stay at AKL and the staff have always been very friendly and helpful. Not one complaint yet. The location - If you don't realize that you're quite a distance from the other resorts/parks, this may be an issue. Due to the distance (except from AK), you may end up waiting a bit for a bus and the ride is a bit longer. Our longest wait was about 30-40 minutes, but later that evening they fixed the problem by having a staffer on hand to make certain that extra buses were made available. Usual wait time for a bus was about 10-15 minutes max. The Resort - From the inside it is very similar to the grandure of the Wilderness Lodge. The lobby is very open and nearly everything is larger than life. The Savannah opens up through the large glass wall at the end of the lobby. This is great place to send the kids during check-in and it's worth a few minutes every day to just walk out and see the animals. If you like being close to the action, Jambo house is your best best. Jiko and Boma are both house in Jambo house and this is the classic lodge/resort. The other building was built for DVC and doesn't offer the restaurant choices or the same feel.

We rented scooters (ECV) which I would highly recommend for $20 a day (they are $60 in the parks) from Buena Vista Rentals, especially to get to the lobby for morning coffee. That was the only downside to this property. We were across the savanna from the lobby and its quite a hike.

We were in the 1bd suite with a king bed and the furnishings were beautiful. The sleeper sofa and chair was very easy to pull out and put back. Kidani is smaller then Jambo but the bus picks up and drops off at Kidani first and if you drive or rent a car, Kidani has way better parking.

We had a Savanna view, overlooking the Uzima Savanna. It was absolutely incredible. To be honest, I was skeptical at first on whether we'd even see decent animals, but within a few minutes of walking into our room, we went out on the balcony and saw giraffes, zebras, African cranes, wildebeests and numerous other animals! Throughout our entire stay, there was ALWAYS some type of creature viewable from our balcony. It was absolutely stunning and fascinating! We also really enjoyed that you could go out on Arusha Rock, outside the main lobby, and speak to one of the cast members out there who were happy to provide you with information on the animals, and answer any questions you may have about them. As always at Disney, the customer service was superb. I have always found that no matter where you are at Disney, the cast members are extremely friendly, helpful and professional. This was no exception. The main lobby is simply stunning. It's quite cavernous and when you first walk in your jaw drops just from the sheer size of it. There's plenty of seating, including some by the fire pit where one day we saw some people warming their feet! LOL! The gift shop, off of the main lobby, is excellent, and I bought quite a few items in there. Our room was very nicely appointed, the beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was spacious (two sinks, yay!) and nice. No complaints there. The bus service worked very well for us. The stop was right off of the main lobby. We went during Christmas so we expected it to be busy, but we never had to wait more than 5 or so minutes for a bus and only once did we have to stand during the bus ride. We never moved our car for the entire weekend. We went to two of the restaurants: The Mara, where we ate breakfast every day and lunch one day, and Boma, the buffet. The Mara is nothing special: it's a quick service restaurant where you can get a quick bite. The breakfast was simple but perfect for us. They had eggs, bacon, waffles, the usual. The lunch was a bit questionable. The hamburger we ate one day wasn't very appetizing, but honestly, that day we were so tired that we didn't have the energy to venture out for something else. As for Boma, it was delicious! I am a BIG buffet fan, and this was nice. There were some African themed dishes, but nothing too strange and of course there were items like salad and macaroni and cheese for the less adventurous eaters. ;) We also had a drink up at the Victoria Falls lounge, which was lovely. A word on the prices: obviously, in that this is Disney, everything is overpriced. I think you have to recognize that going in. It's not going to be cheap, they hike up the prices for everything. I think you just have to realize that and deal with it as best you can. It's the price you pay (literally!) for staying on Disney property. It is what it is. The only real complaints I had are very minor and definitely could be overlooked. First, the distance between the lobby and our room was incredible. It was a long walk to the elevator, and then another long walk from the elevator to our room. It's simply how the hotel is designed (obviously because of the savannas), but it did get to be a bit inconvenient at times, especially once when we were in a hurry and I forgot something upstairs. It's not a quick trip up to the room, LOL! All of that said, I would NOT want a room close to the lobby because the lobby was very noisy. I also wouldn't want a room by the pool for the same reason. The savanna view is really the only way to go, in my opinion. My other issue was the noise. It was a bit noisy at times, and sometimes in our room we could hear banging and bumping around in the ceiling. It did not, however, happen all the time nor did it prevent us from sleeping, so again, easily overlooked. All in all, I LOVED this hotel.

From lobby you are able to walk out to animal viewing area. my favorite feature was the indoor fire pit where you could find guests curled up at all times of the day. also enjoyed Victoria falls Lounge, nice bar area easily accessed from lobby area. i thought counter service restaurant Mara, was the best one we have experienced. there were healthy food choices (chicken pita, salads) and lines moved fast. we were on Disney dining plan and had more than enough food and choices. Addressing other reviewers concerns about Lodge being out ot the way, we did not find this to be a problem. Bus service to parks was prompt and never took more than 25 min to get to destination.

We were taken back by the hospitality of the cast members, ambiance of the decor in Africa style and admired the African collection of art and artifacts. As an educator and teacher of African History and those living in the Diaspora, I was educated and felt so empowered experiencing my homeland and the Motherland, Africa. The children were amazed and enthralled with our Standard view of the Savannah and appreciated completing the animal checklist and fact sheet. The hotel, hallways, and overall decor was breathtaking. The cast members dressed in African attire and may who were from the continent of Africa added to the overall experience of being immersed in Africa. The furniture in the lobby and on the savannah view was amazing. Having a refridgerator was a plus. We loved the balcony and our view ofthe animals. The housekeeping staff were very accomodating. We were hoping that more Disney characters would be visible during our stay. The crafts for the children and African education sessions were great. We loved the arcade and fitness center. The pool was great with the games.

The African drumming and the time that was taken to teach the children the art was awesome. We ate breakfast there twice and dinner twice. We ate at the Mara, my only complaint that the breakfast meal portions (waffles) with the meals werevery small andyou were given only one. Itas a bit pricy forsmall meals. At the BOMA, My only reservation, is that the prices were not posted until the day before we left and the prices are extremely high.

As soon as you walk in the lobby you are taken away from the hustle of the parks to a much more relaxed and comforting place. At Christmas the 5 story tree centers the lobby and takes center stage with a nearby brook, indoor firepit, and 3 tiered restaurant overlook. Walk outside during the day and you are greated by a variety of safari animals or at night by a large cozy campfire. The kid's playground is set in a quiet corner near the pool and hot tub and filled with fun things for the younger set.

Want something extra special -- book the concierge level where the cast members go above and beyond to make your vacation perfect and the on going food options keep you satisfied and happy.

Its great to escape from all the hustly of the parks and the longest bus ride is Magic Kingdom at only about 20 - 25 minutes.

Lobby, Amenities, and Staff: The lobby is gorgeous. Very impressive. The staff at check-in were friendly and helpful. The amenities were wonderful. At various times of the day you can see zebras, giraffes, and other African wildlife as if you were on the savannah. So cool! The pool and pool bar were very nice. And we enjoyed the firepit in the evenings. It looked like the daily programs for children were pretty cool. I wished we had time to take advantage of the safari. Room: Our room was located on the third floor in the Ostrich Wing. It was pretty far from the lobby (prior to arrival we stayed at a small b&b so our views reflect this drastic change), and the room was small. Almost shockingly small. Now we have both stayed at Disney properties before- ranging from value to deluxe- so we were surprised to find the Animal Kingdom Lodge rooms to be the same size as say Pop Century (our room at Coronado Springs appeared to be larger). If we had been a family of four we would have no where to store clothing or luggage. There were only two drawers and a small closet. The bathroom was on par with any other Disney property bathroom. I don't know why I assumed since this was deluxe that the linens, towels, or bath products would be upgraded from Moderate or Value. Clearly it is because we stayed at a B&B prior to arriving at the AKL. Also, I was told that the rooms should be more soundproof than Value, but we heard children cry and whine through the walls. The only thing we truely liked about the room was the balcony. We overlooked a savannah and saw giraffes, zebras, and other wildlife. Food: The dining options at the AKL are phenomenal. Simply the best dining out there. Jiko was our best dinner in Disney ever. And Boma was the best breakfast. Even the counter service was pretty good. We ordered room service breakfast twice. It was delicious and they was surprsingly quick to deliver. And what's better is we were able to eat and overlook the savannah. Overall: I don't know if we would stay here again.

We got to our room, and had no room keys in the packet... The rooms hadn't changed at all since we were their in 2006- even the same polyester bedding.lol. But all in all they were still in good condition. The outside viewing area also looked a little run down. They need to add more greenery. It was nice because everyday at 4pm they added leaves to the trees, so the giraffs would wonder over and eat. Kids loved that. We heard the new sister property the Kidani Village is nice because they have mini kitchen and they are brand new. The pool at the Jambo houes (main lodge where we stayed) was pretty nice still, a bit cold. The little kid pool is sad and run down. We did go over the sister property pool at The Kidani Village one day and had a blast. They offer a van every 5 minutes at the bell station. It isn't advertised, but worked great. The pool was so kid friendly with a special area for the little ones. The staff was great about organizing fun things for kids aged 5-10 with music and games. I even had 20 minutes to read my book. The resturant at the hotel at the lodge was so expensive but the food was really good. The buffet was worth it. I just wish they had a side menu for kids. My four year old just wanted something small like noodles and veggies, but you have to pay the $25 for little ones as well. My son was sick in the room, and they kindly brought us soup for free to take back with us. The food at Kidani's resturant was so good too. It was not buffet, and the choices were unique, but we really enjoyed it. They did a special dessert for my daughter which was sweet. Nice wait staff. The food in the cafeteria was well priced for what you got. We shared an entree and the kids did too, and it was plenty. They had a nice selection of wine for $15 (shocked me) so we took a bottle up to the room. The refillable cups are nice so you don't have to keep paying for kids drinks, you can use them all week at both properties. All and all it was a great trip. We left there for a Disney Cruise (which was beyond cool) and that was all very organized by the hotel in terms of luggage, etc. The lobby was just beautiful for Christmas, and because of the time of year, not too crowded anywhere we went. Lastly, the buses. for the most part it was pretty slick. It is a drive to most parks from this property (20 plus minutes). Animal kingdom is the closest obviously. One day we waited 1 hour for the Magic Kingdom bus, and people were so angry. For those of us that didn't throw a fit, they handed out fast pass rides to use later in the day.

Walking through the lobby brings you to an outdorr area where campfires are held each night. You are now standing in what seems to be the edge of a safari. We saw zebras, giraffes, and several types of antelopes. On each floor there are also night vision glasses that allow you to watch the animals as they settle down for the night. The rooms are designed and decorated in an African theme and the bed is large and comfy. We had a studio room which was quite large and had a small patio overlooking the pool. If there was any negative at all it was that the room was quite far from the elevator. This complex is quite large and walking around it can take some time. As usual, the Disney cast members were friendly helpful and always smiling. Be forewarned that if you have a member of your party who likes to have the occasional evening cigar, you have only one place to go: beyond the pool, around the corner and near the maintenance area.

Apologies! But as a new DVC member I thought it only right that I (eventually!) write a review! Check in: after a warm \"welcome home\" at the entrance (always makes me smile!) whilst staff were playing the bongos (!), check in was smooth, professional and quick. We waited no more than a minute or so. The lobby is incredible. It's vast, detailled and the sight of the atrium is inspiring. It really does feel like you have just walked into another world and this feeling doesn't leave you until your last day. Some reviewers have complained that the hotel is not lit well enough. Well, it's not supposed to be! The lighting is to resemble natural lighting. The fire pit (in and outside) and lanterns make for a beautiful atmosphere and I wouldn't want it any other way. This is a part of what gives you the contrast between the other resort hotels. If you are looking for light and airy, try the Grand Floridian or the Beach Club. Both are also beautiful, they just schieve it in a different way. Room: We had a 2 bedroom suite on the 4th floor overlooking the main savannah and first impressions were overwhelming. The main door leads into the kitchen area (with all the mod cons...you will want for nothing), and then the lounge area. Either side are the bedrooms and bathrooms (the whirlpool tub comes with the master bedroom...make sure you beg that one before the family get their paws on it!). A balcony stretches the length of the appartment; that means you have plenty of room outside to watch the animals while having a glass of wine :) Bliss. Obviously the \"villas\" are a part of my DVC points, but anyone can choose to stay in these. It is a real treat being able to make scrambled eggs in the morning for the family to all eat together before hitting the parks; no queues for breakfast, no need to move far, and good value for money. Bearing in mind we stayed for 17 nights in total (we are from the UK, wanted our money's worth!!), the added luxury of cooking the odd breakfast or dinner was much appreciated. I can't recommend these \"villa\" rooms enough. They have such a family, homely feel about them. Some reviewers mentioned that they could smel the animals which made their experience a poor one. I never experienced this and if I had, I would have thought \"well, it's called Animal Kingdom Lodge and I opted for a view of the animals\"! What a ridiculous comment for someone to make. The restaurants: Boma, the buffet restaurant, is fantastic. There is more choice than you will ever want or need, although you can't help but try to get around every station! You MUST have a breakfast here and a dinner. Book ahead! Jiko is out of this world, with prices reflecting this, but well worth the experience. The kenyan coffee rubbed short ribs was sublime, the flatbreads delicious and the wine list longer than queues for Soarin'. Don't miss it. Again, book ahead! Room service uses part of the Jiko menu so is also great. Nice for a night in. My only comment is that some of the other resorts offer a pizza service...now, for a longer stay, it would have been nice to have this option, but it's a very minor point! The self serve resturant is also fine for chicken, burgers, flatbreads etc and you can take this back to your room if you wish. If you are staying for some time, I recommend getting a Disney re-fill mug. Transport: some people have complained that AKL is far from everywhere and a real inconvenience. Not true. It's closer to Animal Kingdom and Blizzard Beach than the other resort hotels (5 mins bus ride using the Disney transportation system). To reach Magic Kingdom will take 20 minutes and this is the furthest of the parks from AKL. I don't think this is excessive do you?? And considering you don't have to worry about parking by using the buses (regular, well air conditioned, clean, more than acceptable), even better. People staying in the Magic Kingdom resorts have the same issue when they want to get to Animal Kingdom or Blizzard Beach....swings and roundabouts and no need to complain! Pool: lovely, large, clean, with a slide and a poolisde bar. Jacuzzi tubs are scattered amongst the trees (you might need to explore a little to find these!) and you have direct access to another of the savannahs. There are more than enough loungers for everyone. We tend to use the pool area on our last day and use the well appointed shower rooms to freshen up / change before leaving in the afternoon. All in all, I really can't imagine how anyone could not be impressed by the resort. Sometimes certain things happen, admittedly, but nothing is too much trouble for staff at this resort. I am always amazed by how many reviewers complain about details which are pointed out on the Disney website or on trip advisor...do your homework and you aren't going to be disappointed. If you choose to stay at AKL, I hope you enjoy it as much as I always do! Can't wait until August to go \"home\" again.

As such, I find negative reviews to be more helpful. This review, however, is not a \"negative\" review. I am going to give a practical and helpful review to people staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. I am going to break it down into various sections for easier comprehension. This was my 50th trip to Disney World, and I have now stayed at all but 2 Disney Hotels, so I think I have a good basis of comparison. The Staff The staff at the AKL was courteous and friendly, as you would expect with a Disney hotel. Occasionally we ran into a less-than-chipper employee, but sometimes people have bad days. The Restaurants There are 3 restaurants at the AKL plus 1 quick service restaurant. The restaurants are overpriced and weird. Boma is a buffet with normal American buffet food, but is very expensive. The other 2 restaurants have African food. It was weird. I'm sure if you're into ethnic food, you'd love these restaurants. I do not. The Animals All else aside, the ONLY reason to stay at the AKL is the novelty of looking out the window and seeing animals. I've read some reviews that said they didn't see any animals. This is B.S. The animals are everywhere. If you walk into the hotel and look out the back window you will see dozens of various animals. Zebras, Wildebeest, Giraffes, etc. If you are worried about seeing enough animals to justify the costs, don't. You will see them. The Room Most of the negative reviews I have read on here complain about the room. Let me set it straight right now. IT IS A HOTEL ROOM! You get either a bed and a pull out couch, or 2 beds. There's a TV, a bathroom, and a closet. I don't know what people expect. It looks just like every other hotel room you have ever stayed in. If you are in your room for more than 2 waking hours per day while in Disney World you are wasting your money anyways. It's just a plain, ordinary hotel room. You sleep shower and change there. That's it. We had a savannah view. Again, I've read several reviews that said people couldn't see any animals from their room. Again, wrong. There were dozens outside our room at all hours of the day, especially at night when we got back from the parks. And if you think that maybe I just had a good room, you are wrong. There are windows in the hallways, every 40 feet or so, on both sides of the hallway, so you can see pretty much the whole savannah. There were always animals outside. If you are paying the small fortune for the room with the savannah view, rest easy, you will see animals. The Pools There are 2 pools. One at the Jambo House and one at the Kidani Village. No matter which house you stay at you get access to both pools. the Kidani Village pool is cooler to look at. The Jambo House pool is boring looking. Just a pool and a slide. But, the bar was nicer at the Jambo House. Both pools are nice. The Transportation As I said at the beginning of this review, I have been to Disney World now 50 times. So, take what I am about to say to heart: There is only 1 real reason to stay at a Disney hotel, and that is their transportation system. Orlando has no shortage of hotels, and there are plenty very close to Disney World. Most just as nice, all a lot cheaper. But, Disney does a phenomenal job making it very difficult for people not staying at their hotels to get to their parks, in order to encourage people to stay at Disney hotels. AKL is far away from the Magic Kingdom, EPCOT Hollywood Studios and Downtown Disney. 20-30 minutes on the bus. It is close to the Animal Kingdom Park (obviously). It takes a long time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a big deal if you are like me who went on this past trip with 2 adults. We can deal with the long bus ride at the end of the night. But if you have small children, watch out. The busses at the end of the night are crowded (I'll get to that next) and seats are hard to come by. You will be stuck holding your kids the whole bus ride as they sleep in your arms, for the entire 20-30 minute bus ride. I have also read a lot of complaints saying that the buses don't run very often. I did not find this to be true. The buses were a little slower than most other hotel's buses (5 minutes or so on the whole) which does not sound like much, and really it's not. But, the AKL is CROWDED. As it is a very crowded hotel, the lines for the buses at the parks fill up fast. Since the bus lines fill up so fast, it makes every bus very crowded. At the end of the night you will generally have to wait for 2 or 3 buses (depending on the time of year and how crowded the park is). If you have little kids, waiting all that time, and having to stand the whole ride back is not fun. Overall Overall, the AKL is a great hotel. But it's not without its drawbacks. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far away and VERY EXPENSIVE. The only reason people book this hotel is the novelty of seeing the animals. Let me tell you, that novelty wears off quickly. My honest assessment is that the AKL is not worth it. So, why would I say the AKL is a \"great hotel\" and then say it is not worth it? It's simple. This isn't a beach resort, where you stay at the hotel the whole trip. This is Disney World. When you go to Disney World you go for the parks. AKL is not convenient for visiting the parks, except Animal Kingdom. For the kind of money it costs to stay at the AKL you can stay at the Contemporary, Yacht and Beach Club, Wilderness Lodge, Boardwalk, etc. If you want to see the animals, take the safari tour at Animal Kingdom Park, or just go out to the AKL and eat at one of the restraints one night.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "Traveller0984", "ReviewID": "UR122116170", "Content": "This hotel really is fab, my husband & I stayed here for 5 nights and the staff were excellent, the rooms were really comfortable, it has an excellent pool, buffet restaurant and a convenient shuttle service to all the parks, waterparks and downtown Disney.

Given that it's only a few hours from where we live, it's always been a great family-friendly option for a weekend away. In the past, however, we've always stuck with moderate or off-property hotels. This time was different. I saw an on-line ad for Disney's fall hotel sale and promptly called the Disney Reservations Center. The agent was able to secure a room at the AKL for roughly the same price as POFQ. I booked the hotel and couldn't be any happier. Reception: I was so appreciative to be greeted by helpful valets and concierge staff at the entrance to Jambo House. I was happy to have the car off my hands and someone on-hand to give me a quick overview of the property and lead me straight to check-in. My check-in agent was exceedingly professional and courteous and took care of all of my reservation needs promptly. He was even able to accomodate my request for a room near transportation. After a smooth check-in, we took a five-minute walk to our room which was in a really great location- just a flight above the lobby. Room: The room was thoughtfully appointed. I appreciated the attention to detail; however, I quickly noted that the hotel room and appointments were fairly standard. The hotel room did seem a bit small (even for three people) so I was concerned about luggage storage. The closet helped a bit, but the space underneath the sinks was a life-saver. The fridge was as expected- a life-saver :) We also had a standard-sized table which was handy, but it was a little tight with even two people sitting at it. I know that the resort offers room service, but to be honest, I don't know that it would be very comfortable to have a meal in the room. There just wasn't enough space. Property Details/Thoughts The quick-service cafe was pleasant. I liked that the resort arranged to have a staff member to take guests orders, submit a ticket to the cooks, and provide us with beepers. This courtesy made dining all the nicer. All in all we enjoyed our meals here. The food is standard resort-fare; it is American with an African touch. Breakfast was fairly typical. I found the portions to be huge so I ordered a little less than I thought three people would want. That was a good call. Because we were at the parks so much, we did not get to enjoy many of the perks of the property, but I did make some observations: I regret that we did not keep our reservations at the sit-down restaurants. They, like the property, were gorgeous. Also, the gym was very modern and well-maintained. If I could have, I would have brought my exercise clothes. The pool area is very attractive and there is plentiful seating. Do be advised that the recreation facilities are spread out. It was easy to get turned around while on the property. Other Observations: This would be a great hotel for a family who is coming to the resort for several days and who wants to stay at a resort that allows them diversion for when they wish to take a day off from the parks. I say that because there are many, many activities for resort guests to participate in- the schedule comes with your welcome packet. Like I said earlier, the dining and recreation facilities are nice. The arcade is well-maintained and is monitored by security in the evening. Children came with their parents as late as 9:30 or 10pm. They seemed to have a good time while there. Finally, I know there is wildlife viewing.

I can definitely see where if you wanted to go back to the hotel for a nap midday and then return to the parks that it would be difficult if you plan on using the shuttles because it did take about 30-45 minutes to get from there to any of the parks, so you are looking at an hour round trip minimum to leave and come back.

It is the best Disney hotel I have stayed at. I must admit I have always wanted to stay here as I love giraffes and whilst visiting in December we ate at Jiko and I fell even deeper in love with the place. We booked a standard view room and I can't fib I was hoping that as it was our anniversary they would upgrade us to a savannah view room based on other reviews I had read. They didn't upgrade us and we had a standard view room on the giraffe trail overlooking the entrance - but hey we can't complain we didn't pay for a savannah view room and lots do! Do I regret not booking a Savannah view? Actually no I don't we were only there for a week so we didn't spend that much time in our room. There are plenty of viewing spots around the hotel and whenever we used them there was never anyone else there anyway - though it was low season. I actually think that even if we had been in a room with a view of the savannah we would have spent more time in the viewing areas as this is not a zoo so the animals roam freely and if there were no animals out we could and did just move to another viewing area. The main viewing areas accessed from around the pool and lobby are lovely and marked on the resort map. There are however lots of viewing balconys along the corridors to the rooms which are not marked. Our room was very close to the lobby about three doors from the stairs or lifts and neither side of this trail has savannah views so we wouldn't have known about this had we not been exploring the hotel. These non-marked viewing areas were almost better but please if you use these be quiet and don't disturb the other guests. The night vision viewing is great and free and will only take about 5 mins from your evening ask about it when you check in. We did notice on our second night that our balcony was above the smoking area which isn't very nice when you are a non smoker but as we were only there a week and had unpacked I didn't raise it so I can't complain about it. We didn't use our balcony for anything other than drying swimsuits (which didn't smell of smoke) but just mentioning it as it may be worth checking if this would bother you. Though there must only be a couple of rooms affected by this. Our room was beautifully appointed with 2 queen beds ,fridge & coffeemaker. The beds and pillows were comfortable and we slept very well though wherever we have stayed at WDW we have slept well as you are on the go all day!!! Shower was powerful, water always hot, room always immaculate, coffee always topped up (though they give you packs with sugar, sweetener, serviettes and stirrers so to avoid waste we just took sachets of sweetner from the food court). I have read reviews that say the rooms are small and dark I strongly disagree. Yes the furniture is a dark colour and the walls aren't white washed so the rooms will be darker if you are used to white washed walls, mirrors and glass everywhere but the rooms feel cosy and luxurious (not minimalistic luxury). This is a hotel room if you want space then book DVC appartments. We have stayed in Pop Century(value) and Port Orleans French Quarter (moderate) and you can see a slight difference in the decor and furnishings as you increase the grade. I have enjoyed all of the places we have stayed at in WDW but I have stayed at them for different reasons. Animal Kingdom Lodge was perfect for just the two of us to spend time together and we got a great deal with a free dining plan. Though it isn't just for couples there were a whole host of things on for kids and you could quite easily stay here for a week with kids and keep them entertained without the need to step foot in the parks. The pool was lovely though quite warm which was great for a quick dip in the evenings, not sure if it would have been great for cooling down on really hot days though. Although if we did visit the pool in the day nowhere seemed to be a particular sun trap so not sure it's ideal for people who just want to lie in the sun. It looks so inviting particularly in the evening when it is lit up. We ate at all 3 dining locations. Jiko the signature restaurant is amazing you could forget you were at Disney it is probably the quietest romantic restaurant there and the food is delicious. We ate a Boma for breakfast, great selection and a perfect place for breakfast on our last day as most days we just had cereal it would have been too much food every other day! The food court Mara is ideal too try the african stew mmmm. We also ate at Saana at Kidani village the food was nice but the view of the Savannah whilst eating was what made the experience great. The buses were great we never waited more than 10 mins for one and the journeys werent that long. The longest journey was Magic Kingdom which varied from 15-20 mins. We were on holiday it was nice to not have to think about driving and if you are impatient and don't like waiting this isn't really the holiday for you because you will queue for pretty much everything - although not very mong in September. Chill out, relax and enjoy your surroundings and secure those memories for ever. The shop by the lobby is great lots of disney souveniers and essentials like milk bread cereals etc. If you can try to spend a part of each day exploring the things the hotel has to offer whether that is getting a glass of wine and sitting by the fire inside or reading a book in the beautiful lobby. It is these things you won't get in value or moderate resorts. Ths staff is great. Service on the whole, even by disney standards, is exceptional (the lady who checked us in was a bit grumpy but once we started chatting to her she lightened up), I would stay here again in heartbeat, yes it is expensive but it is beautiful. If you don't stay here at least visit. We got a great deal for our week and we have decided we would like to visit as many of the properties as we can so are staying at Old Key West in 2012 but I will definately go back and visit Animla Kingdom Lodge because it has a serenity and excitement that other places dont.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winter Park, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery nice would stay again, It can be for children and adults\u201d", "Author": "Hailey G", "ReviewID": "UR120772347", "Content": "I am 18 and have loved Disney for as long as I can remember. I live in florida and only about an hour away from Disney but stay at the hotels anyway because they are fun and its a great way to get away from it all. I have read reviews about the Animal Kingdom Lodge and I have a few things to say about them, I have stayed here a number of times, Yes the lobby area is a little dark, BUT you must resize this is part of the vibe and decoration of the place along with the dark wood floors, and if you are going to complain about this, then you are spending way to much time in the lobby and should get to a park or a pool. Another thing, They offer rooms with bunk beds so the children and adults do not have to stay in the same bed, I have seen these rooms and they are the same size as all of the other rooms, so they basically squeeze the bunk bed in there which dose not leave much space BUT, If you are going to complain about that you are spending way to much time in the rooms, they are there to sleep and maybe relax after the parks, not spend your entire vacation, or if you want to I recommend upgrading to a villa. (I have not yet stayed in a villa but will be this Christmas). If your kids want french fries or basic American food the restaurant are not for you, These restaurant are made to be authentic African food. so do not expect that, On the other hand they have a quick service station that does serve that kind of food along with other things for the adults. When it comes to the walk depending on where you are the walk will vary. In the Kidani Village the walk to the MAIN lobby can be far but it has a lobby of its own. it is smaller because there are less rooms in the Kidani Village. they have to fit as many rooms in the hotel as possible so a long walk for some is needed. Animals....They can not be controlled to the point where you will see them outside your room every time you look out. They roam, so if you are exspecting to see them every time you look outside then look someplace else. Some things I loved about it is the lot os so big you can explore it for hours and not get bored. there are tons of things to do and see and you get get to other parks and resort easy.

This was our first trip to DisneyWorld and what a way to get it started. The hotel staff was extremely accommodating when we arrived early. We had driven 9 hours through the night after a long day of work, and were greeted at the Animal Kindom Lodge (AKL) gates with a warm \"welcome home.\" The kids were still asleep and didn't know where we were going. They just knew it was vacation. When we woke them up (ages 5&6) and were walking towards the lodge, all I could hear were wispers of how cool the place was. Eventually we let them in on the secret, and they went bonkers (although i suspect they knew something was going on when they peered out the lobby windows and saw giraffe wandering around). The rooms at AKL were very clean and the staff did everything to keep it that way including plenty of towels and soaps. It felt good after being at the parks all day to hit the room and have everything you need to get showered and do it all over again. The concierge crew was knowledgable and could really dig deep to make sure our stay was as fun as possible. We managed to secure some wonderful last minute reservations to character dining events thanks to them. As for the food ... The establishments at the lodge were top notch. We stayed for a week and ate 1-2 meals at the hotel each day. The quick service breakfast option was perfect to accommodate our whirlwind schedule, and the restaurants were nothing short of amazing. We ate at all of them but went to Sanaa twice just to enjoy the great African inspired food and watch the animals roam the savannah. (not too many people can say they have done that!). So Rooms, check, Service, check, Restaurants, check ... Now let's talk about what differentiates AKL from just another nice hotel which is their onsite amenities. I'll put it this way ... One afternoon/evening we played in the pool, participated in poolside games hosted by AKL, did the waterside, got cleaned up, ate dinner while watching the giraffe and zebra, finished up and jumped in the hot tub, roasted marshmallows by an AKL organized \"campfire\", jumped back in the hot tub, and then curled up on the patio chairs to watch a disney movie by the pool. Are you kidding me? You can't do that anywhere else. One night we were even offered night vision goggles by the friendly staff so we could view the animals in darkness. Too cool! Granted we didn't try to keep up that pace everyday since we wanted to experience the whole network, but it was available if we wanted too. Hands down it has to be one of the best places to stay in the area. With the frequency of the bus schedule, movement within Disney was pretty simple, or they even give you a parking pass so you can bypass any wait (which was typically less than 10-15 minutes) and drive yourself. Anyways ... the next time we stay we'll probably shorten our days at the parks so we can enjoy more of what the lodge has to offer. Make no mistake about it, your stay at the AKL will not disappoint.

Ok there are a few ransom African touches here and there, with the bathroom seeming to get most of the attention. Other than that a big let down for the exorbitant price. The rest of the lodge is a mixture of bad restaurants that obviously have to cater to the masses and some nice touches scattered about. The animals roaming about are the main draw, the staff are excellent. But if your there for the theme parks than the room doesn't really matter.

They fixed the problem by giving us an upgrade. Our disappointment grew when we entered the room. It was small and did not appear to be at all from a luxury resort. The beds were uncomfortable and the bedding was extremely cheap! We were expecting a nice duvet and sheets, but no such luck! The sheets were awfully rough, same as the towels in the bathroom. The coffee pot in the room was dirty and even after we washed it made terrible tasting coffee. On the last night of our trip we purchased a four dollar package of grapes that smelled like fertilizer or some sort of chemical ! I had never experienced such a thing.

CONCIERGE LEVEL - If you can pay the extra bit for this or use extra points it is WELL WORTH it. You feel very special and looked after like royalty ! The drinks, snacks and service is great all day and it is lovely just sitting in the lounge chatting, watching TV, playing the Wii etc. ROOM - Our party stayed in a 2 bedroomed villa and 3 studios. All of them were immaculately clean and very spacious. It was really good having a full kitchen and laundry area in the 2 bedroomed villa. If you stay try and book a savannah view so that you wake up watching the animals, it's amazing. STAFF - The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. All of them seemed to want you to have the best vacation you could have. There is one front desk manager called Casey Strong who is one of the best managers I have ever come accross as a guest. PROBLEMS - Of course we had some small issues. we were there for 2 weeks. They are not worth mentioning on here as all were dealt with immediately by Disney and rectified more than adequately. Don't sit on any problem, no matter how small. Tell a cast member and they will sort it out for you quicly and efficiently. FOOD - The quick service restaurant food is good quality, however a little expensive. The service on an evening is pretty poor. It took us up to 50 minutes to receive a meal once we had stood for 10 minutes in the line to order it. Saana is out of this world. Go to Kidani Village and try it.

I went with my boyfriend, and as a young couple, this place was perfect. The first thing that must be said is this is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed at. The lobby, common areas, and restaurants are all breathtakingly gorgeous. I have stayed in Disney several times at all stages of my life, and this hotel was by far the best in Disney. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll admit when we went to our room (Savannah view, worth every penny), I was a bit disappointed with our view; we seemed to be stuck in a corner. But with a quick phone call, within minutes our luggage was picked up and we were move to probably the best room in the resort (Disney hospitality is the best). There were animals outside our balcony at every minute of the day. We had a hopper past so we spent most of our days at the parks, but from our one day that was spent completely at the resort there was always things to do and see such as activities by the pool, s \u00e2\u20ac\u2122mores by the outdoor fire pit, and movies in the dark by the pool. While it was a bit pricey the afternoon safari through the grounds and dinner at Jiko was amazing. The tour was great and the guide took her time and answered all our questions. We got up close and personal with all the animals. And the dinner at Jiko was AMAZING, you got to taste everything on the menu, it was just course after course after course of delicious food! Being a Disney resort, transportation around Disney was a breeze. No need to rent a car. However, Animal Kingdom Lodge seems to be a bit more removed from some parks, so make sure you leave enough time to get to the parks, some are a good half hour bus ride away. Check out was a breeze. We had a late flight out so we checked out and went to store our bags, but we were quickly informed that you can check in to your flight and check your bags right at the hotel! No need for ANY hassle at the airport, this was fantastic. We checked all our bags so when hopped the bus to the airport the only thing we had to worry about was our carry on.

I stayed with my wife and 3 year old on an Arusha View room. The lobby of the hotel is really nice, spacious and promises a good experience. That ends when you go to check in. There was nothing wrong with my reservation, but it took the receptionist a good 30 minutes to enter our names in the system and hand us the room keys with a bunch of pamphlets explaining what to expect. We book the package through Expedia and had also the park hopper vouchers which were explained that needed to be handed over at the desk so we can get our park tickets. The receptionist told us after checking with his supervisor that the concierge desk will assist us. So here we go to another line waiting for another 20 minutes even though only two of the three concierges were actually providing service and the third one was staring at some wall behind our backs. Long story short, the concierge explained to us that they do not issue tickets for the parks as they cannot access the system if the tickets were booked through Expedia but we have to go to one of the customer service offices at any park entrance and get the tickets. We did go at one of the office in Downtown Disney and were asked why were we bothered to come all the way here instead of getting the tickets at the concierge desk, I changed subject and moved on. Now let's move to the room...Once we opened it we got stung by a smell comparable only to a pile of mulch. I went immediately outside to complain but returned right back as the room next door opened the door and had the same scent coming out, I guess there was no point requesting to exchange rooms. After 30-45 minutes in the room, you just get used to it to the smell. The balcony view was nice and the little one enjoyed watching zebras and giraffes roaming the grass. That night we went to dine at Boma and were told to wait since we had no reservations, even though the restaurant was half empty and had a row of waiters in line greeting the occasional guest. The food at Boma was good, the buffet has a lot of choices but nothing exceptional, which is OK since they cater mostly to folks that are on dining plans. We did not a have a dining plan as we did not want to limit our choices. Two days in the row we saw cockroaches in the hallway which was not something you expect from a deluxe or high end hotel, especially if you are shelling 300+ USD per night. The bedding was going well with the room, you get a king size bed that has about 6-7 small pillows in a row that look like Swedish meatballs you eat at IKEA - very uncomfortable. The bed sheets were very thin and looked well past their prime time, same thing needs to be said about the towels. The bathroom was spacious and well maintained. We did not try any other restaurant other than the Mara for to go breakfast. The cleaning ladies were very helpful and they were the only four star service that I experienced. The parks had a lot more choices of good food especially Epcot but that will be another review.

First of all, people considering the AKL should distinguish between rating the hotel 5 stars because their vacation experience was great and rating a hotel for what it actually is (amenities, space, comfort, cleanliness, value, etc.). It is very easy to get carried away by the magic of disneyworld and forget that the room you paid a ton of money for is little better than a motel. It's true that when you first enter the AKL you are immersed in the splendor of the lobby and overwhelmed by seeing the animals on the savannah from the viewing decks. It makes you so excited that you initially overlook how ridiculously small and cramped your room is because you head straight for the balcony to checkout the premium savannah view you paid for. You're so excited you tell yourself that soon there will be a giraffe off your balcony and antelope drinking from the pond by your room--even though all you can see are pelicans and can barely make out a zebra well over 100 yards away. But reality quickly sets in. The sticker on your sliding glass door that says \"don't feed the animals\" is unnecessary because you couldn't dump your garbage off your balcony remotely close enough to an animal to notice even if you wanted to. There's NO room to move around in the room and with the bunkbed you feel like you are sleeping in a glorified tent. The bathroom is tiny--the kind of tiny where if you are sitting on the throne the bathroom door can't budge. the fixtures are old and the towels are the same as those found in a holiday inn express--a couple of ours had holes and stains. The carpet is old, the bed is uncomfortable, and the sheets are like sandpaper. Look, it's Disney so I'm not expecting silk or Egyptian cotton, but I expect something better than motel sheets. In my opinion, anyone who thinks the actual hotel accommodations are 4 or 5 stars is either objectively biased by \"Disney magic\" or has never stayed at a true 4 or 5 star resort. No 4 or 5 star resort should ever have a motel quality room period. The savannah view was 100% disappointing. The kids looked out at all times of the day hoping to see animals and were not impressed. By the second day, they stopped caring and really we ended up paying for a view we didn't really enjoy. Temper your expectations of the savannah view if you stay here. You will get FAR better views at the animal kingdom park itself! Save your money and go on the Kilimanjaro safari and animal trails in the theme park. Having said that, the good points of the hotel include a beautiful lobby, lots of little activities for the kids around the resort, easy access to excellent restaurants, and friendly Disney hotel workers. We had a rental car the entire time which we loved because we never had to wait around for the Disney buses and parking is free at all the theme parks. The drive to the theme parks really isn't bad at all. Disneyworld itself absolutely is a fun, magical place and a must-do if you have kids, but skip the AKL--especially if staying in a NICE room is important to you.

Also, at Kidani, the one bedroom suite is a little more spacious with a second bathroom and the Master bath has both a walk-in shower and a separate jacuzzi tub. In Jambo House you have one jacuzzi tub/shower combo. However, it is nicew having the large gift shop, fast serve restaurant, Boma and Jiko right downstairs. So there are trade offs between the two. Staff at both resorts are very friendly and service is impeccable. The resort was clean and it is a fabulous experience to stay in this resort...so much to see and do!!!", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201c7301 the room above the arcade\u201d", "Author": "GaryGriswold", "ReviewID": "UR120095881", "Content": "They gave us the room above the arcade.

We asked the reception for a little chair so that she would at least be able to wash her hands and brush her teeth by herself but all we got was a high chair.

This was our third time at the Lodge, and second time staying Club Level. When we arrived at Animal Kingdom Lodge, the Security Guard took my ID, gave me my parking pass, and Welcomed me Home. That felt nice, it was the first I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d heard it in almost 3 years. He even radioed ahead to let the attendants know that a Club Level guest was arriving. We pulled under the porte-cochere, hopped out of the car, and everyone just stood around looking at us. We started getting all of our luggage out, still, everyone stood looking at us. As we started hauling everything in, someone finally approached us, asked if we were the Brandeaus, and offered to escort us to the Lounge for check-in. Not once were we offered Bell Service, nor any help with our luggage. Once at the Lounge, check-in was a bit of an ordeal. The girl couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out how to assign us a room since none were ready (which was understandable, since we were there almost 3 hours before check-in), and once they did figure it all out, they told us we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to take our luggage back downstairs to check it with Bell Service. Internally, I almost exploded. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay over $400/night to continuously cart my luggage around. Luckily, before the last few things were finalized (and after I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d wandered over to grab some lemonade and a cookie from the food area, yum yum, free food), she corrected herself and offered to have Bell Service come pick up our luggage. We were told we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get a text when our room was ready. We got the text a few hours later, so off to our room. Two Queens instead of the King I had requested, but we were expecting that. AKL really needs more Club Level King Rooms. The one thing I was not expecting was the lack of Welcome/Birthday Package for Rin that has always been given to us for a special occasion (it has a small gift, note and, in this case, Birthday Pin). Strike... um... 3, I think. We got our luggage, unpacked, and I went back up to the Lounge to get scissors and ask about the package for Rin. It turns out they were behind on delivering them, and by the time I got back to the room, she had received it. Yay! They now give a replica Baobob Tree and AKL Pen. I should mention too that Carmen (the woman that I was dealing with at this point, I think I referred to her as Carmella on a 'live' post) was amazing, and made up for any previous issues. She even gave me three roses out of their flower arrangement to give to Rin as a birthday gift. The only problem with Carmen is that she wasn't there the whole time. Fast forward a few days, and I needed a suit pressed. Housekeeping was amazingly attentive, prices were good, and I had my suit back before the end of the day. After all of the stuff happening on day 1, the rest of our stay was uneventful. Most of the staff I dealt with in the Lounge were really good, Housekeeping kept our room neat and tidy throughout the stay, and as always, the views and general feel of the Lodge was amazing. If I had never stayed here before, or if I had never dealt with the Club Level staff before, I probably would have rated this a 4, or likely 5. However, the issues with the Club Level staff on the first day were enough to bring it down to a 3 for this trip (I sound like a bit of a snob, I know...).", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWow - giraffes and zebras!\u201d", "Author": "NHYankees", "ReviewID": "UR120064593", "Content": "We spent two nights in a DVC 1 bedroom villa at Jambo house.

After being on hold for over 25 min (which i did not really mind b/c i know they had to check room arrangements) they happily told me that it was not problem they were able to switch some things around so we were able to be in the same room the whole time.

Well, after 2 nights i go up to exchange keys and she says do you have your luggage for me to store? I say no I was told twice we would not have to move......well we did and they were going to move us to another room with a queen bed and bunk beds, i said you're crazy if you think i am going to pack up and move to another small crappy room with bunk beds (me, my boyfriend, and a 3 year old).....so we ended up having to move rooms anyway but at least we got 2 queen beds.

For this much money, there should be more storage and more space. The bathroom area was nice plenty of light. The bathtub/toilet area ok that was where it seemed too dark. 4 of us could not fit on the balcony to be seated, which we were bummed about. We had bought stuff for our breakfast in the am but only seating for 2. The table inside was right in the walkway to the balcony. In the am getting bags packed, eating, putting sunscreen, shoes etc we were always bumping into each other. For this price...not acceptable. The grounds were amazing. We walked all over the whole place including over to Kidani one day. Animals are amazing. I would do Kidani next time for more space though I don't know what the price is. Maybe a split stay here to enjoy the animals on a weekend and then move to more spacious accomodations for the latter part of a trip. The CM that were at the look-out spots were so friendly.

One tip, have the photographer take a picture of you with YOUR camera too, as they are glad to do so and they tooks some really great shots with ours. Lastly, we did splurge and did one of those in-room decoration packages. Yes, it was pricey but my kids were BLOWN AWAY. We did the Mickey / Minnie Halloween package through Disney Floral (you'll get e-mails) and they came in while we were out on the second day and decorated the WHOLE room with lights, cob webs, stuffed animals, candy. It was honestly amazing and the girls were so excited that Mickie and Minnie \"stopped by\" which is how they make it look. Well done. Yes, pricey, but so memorable and lots of \"top shelf\" stuff to take home...mongrammed blankets, light-up trick-or-treat lanterns, A huge Mickie & Minnie...awesome.

We never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a bus to arrive and it was a quick ride to any of the parks. We used the Disney website to book our flight, stay, and tickets all together. There was a problem with the way they booked our airfare which resulted in me being on the phone with the airline for about an hour the night before we left.

There was Disney magic everywhere during our trip, but I will keep this review focused on the AKL. We had just booked a standard view to save money, and at check-in, the sweet staff member helping us gave us a free upgrade to a savannah view as a little anniversary gift. What a wonderful surprise! Our room was at the end of one of the hallways - it was a ways away from the lobby, but it wasn't a bad thing at all. We enjoyed walking past all the different viewpoints of the savannahs and going out on the various porches to sit in the rocking chairs and watch the animals. We loved our savannah view and were impressed by how much sound the door to our balcony kept out. Everyday our room was tidied up and on our last day, we had an anniversary surprise including AK chocolates waiting for us. Pretty special! During our stay, we ate at Sanaa, the Mara, and had a drink at Victoria Falls. Sanaa has a really cool atmosphere, but get there early if you want a window seat! We had reservations and would've had to wait an additional hour to be seated by the window. The food was very different than what we normally eat, but it was still a really neat experience. We really enjoyed the different breads and dips. The Mara was small and we just had one of the main breakfast entrees. My husband enjoyed his, but I didn't care for mine. It wasn't that the food was bad though, it just wasn't to my taste. The only food-related thing that wasn't good were our drinks at Victoria Falls. I couldn't even finish mine it tasted so bad, and it was just a mojito. On the bright side, though, that mojito was the worst part of our stay, which isn't a lot to complain about. The staff was consistently pleasant and helpful, our room was great, the lodge itself and the grounds it's on are beautiful, and the bus rides to each of the other parks really weren't that bad if you plan for them.

This is high-end Disney somewhat campy luxury, not world class luxury. We reserved a room overlooking the animals with concierge (club level) service and we also purchased a deluxe dining plan. We were placed in a room an easy walk from the elevator but away from the lobby noise and with a great view and I imagine it was due to our club level standing as the maid more or less said it was a club level room. Had we known how small the room was, I think we would have arranged for a one or two bedroom suite instead, as it felt quite cramped for a family of 4, especially since our youngest slept in a pack-n-play. Much fuss is made about the animals and they are fun to look at once in awhile from the room, though there aren't generally very many of them out and about and they are quite far away so it's not like a giraffe is about to come sniffing up to your balcony or anything. On the whole, I'm not sure the view was worth the additional price tag and this hotel is really far away from Magic Kingdom and Downtown Disney, so depending on your plans, you might be better off at a hotel closer to MK. The concierge service was fantastic. We were greated as we got off the bus and taken to the club lounge where we had a drink/snack while we completed check-in. Our bags arrived to the room straight from the airport 6 hours after us (it was pouring rain and supposedly the service is usually only about 3 hours). We never had to wait to speak to a concierge or stand in line (whereas the people in the lobby below seemed to always be in a line for concierge or check-in/out. We also made several light meals out of the food and drinks available in the lounge. The pool was fun for our small children - it's a very large pool so even with huge crowds you can find a nook to enjoy yourself. There was a lot of poolside entertainment for kids in the afternoons. I'm not sure this is the ideal spot for honeymooners - the hotel is definitely oriented toward family experiences and there's not \"adult only\" area of the pool, even the jacuzzis are fair game for everyone and it's pretty noisy and wild everywhere. There's no lounge chair service - if you want a drink you have to go get it. Rooms were really small feeling because of large furniture. I personally didn't like all the loud colors and heavy wooden furniture. There are only 2 drawers for storing clothes and one shelf in the closet plus hanging space. That would be fine for 2 people but it was a stretch for a family of 4 on an 8 night stay. Bathrooms were nothing special, a generic hotel feel I guess. Hotel linens were kind of cheap and the mattress was a little squeaky and a little firm for my husband and I's taste. The AC cannot be completely turned off and the blowing drove us crazy at night. On all levels, service at the hotel was really friendly, helpful and full of little surprises for the kids which made the stay more pleasant than a typical hotel. Mousekeeping in particular did a great job of living little treats for the kids and the room felt clean. The restaurants: there is a fast food, a breakfast and dinner buffet, a high-end reservation only location plus the club lounge if you pay for that upgrade. All were decent but the menu is the same everyday in all of them and we were really sick of the food by the end. The do try to have some African themed items on the menus but it all sort of starts to taste the same by about day 3. I thought the quality was decent (nothing special and it definitely feels fairly mass produced but not bad either), but the variety was lacking. I am quite certain it feels this way in all the Disney hotels so if it's going to bother you, you better not pick a Disney resort. Lastly, the Disney bus transportation to the parks from the hotel runs smoothly - you usually have a 5-10 minute wait and then the ride itself which almost always involves one stop somewhere else mid-trip. Buses were typically crowded coming home but not only moderately full on the way out. Still, I think it's better than having to drive a car (especially on the way home at night when you're tired) and pay for parking. We found Downtown Disney the most aggravating place to get back from followed by Magic Kingdom. Epcot, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom are much closer. Overall, it was a good stay though I'm pretty sure we would try somewhere else before going back to this particular hotel the next time we go to Orlando.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bardstown, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cNice but Waaay too Pricey\u201d", "Author": "KentuckyTwinTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR119406236", "Content": "We stayed in the Jamba House, total of 10 people (6 adults and 4 kids) split between a double room and a two room suite.

The entrance itself and lobby of the Lodge were breathtaking and beautiful. Although the floors are dark in color along with the furniture, the lobby was still bright and beautifully decorated. I do not believe we were expecting it to be so busy in late September. The lobby and sitting areas were always swarmed with people, screaming kids, and the restaurant areas looked as if they were giving something away for free--they were packed with people. The food court type of eatting area near the pool was packed from sun up to sun down. Swimming pool area was beautiful and clean but very congested ALL DAY. AKL could definitely benefit from a quiet pool for those who just want to relax after a long Disney day. Our room, although smaller than a normal Disney deluxe resort, was very clean and overlooked the savannah with lots of animals. Some type of scent was being piped in to the room but if you opened the balcony door, it smelled like a zoo. The bus system needs work especially during the morning. Although a bus did show up every 15-20 minutes, the lines waiting (8am) were so long that they really needed to bring two buses instead of just one. It's no fun to stand so early in the morning. We threw in the towel by day 2 and opted to drive our SUV to the parks since parking was free. At least we knew we could get a seat.

We were lucky to see lots of animals every day that we were there from morning until night - it really was a special experience that you can't get anywhere else. We watched a few animals fighting & the zebras rolling in the dirt, heard the birds calling, watched the gentle giraffes feeding right by our balcony. Magical. The pool was clean and beautiful. Every afternoon the pool attendants hosted a pool party for the kids which my 5 & 8 yr old really enjoyed. They also showed movies by the pool in the evenings and had campfires & marshmallows too :) We ate at Boma twice - breakfast & dinner and enjoyed both buffets. We also picked up breakfasts at The Mara as well as a late night snack - those zebra domes really are as good as I've heard (and you can get them with a snack credit if you're using the dining plan as we were.) The shopping in the Zawadi Marketplace was nice too - we picked up a few gifts and things on our way out. We also used the hotel's kid's club for childcare one evening. It's Simba's Cubhouse right in the hotel and it included dinner for the kids. $11/hr each child and they had a blast (coloring, arts & crafts, games, video games & they watched a Disney movie) and we had a few hours of quiet - worth every penny :) FYI-I had called to make a reservation the week before we arrived. Afterwards we wished we had used it for another evening so that we could head back to Epcot to enjoy the evening during the wine & food festival. Shuttle buses to the parks ran very often (we never waited more than 5 min! - maybe we were just lucky?) and we made it to each park for opening each morning, which was the best time to get there - no lines at all! The only line I experienced was the one waiting to check my bags in the lobby on our departure day. That was slow moving, but it was a Sunday and a lot of people were headed out that day, so I would recommend making sure you allow time for that. The hotel stowed our carry-on luggage for the day until our flight in the evening, which was very convenient. Also, they allowed us a later checkout which was nice. To prep I read 2 books with good tips in them: One was the Unofficial Guide to DisneyWorld with Kids & the other was Mousejunkies. I know it's an expensive vacation, but we were there the last week of September and the rates were a little better and there were no lines, which made it a really enjoyable experience.

The room was nice, though the sinks were constantly plugged and water was slow to drain. Gross! The beds creaked every time we moved, so we didn't get very good sleep. The views were very pretty, and it was nice to grab a glass of wine at the Club Level and relax on our balcony at night. But...the time it takes to get to/from anywhere was horrible. We were explained that we are on the complete opposite end of Magic Kingdom, as Disney World spans over two counties. So just get ready to WAIT a very long time to get to places. If you miss the bus the runs every 20min, you have to wait 20 more minutes. Then it's a 20min bus ride to MK. If you are going to Chef Mickeys, or 1900 Fare, or other places where you also have to catch the monorail, factor that in, too. It can take up to an hour to get anywhere. Which was just too much for us after 2 days...it was almost an hour wasted each way. One evening it took 90 minutes to return home!! The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful. It really help set the relaxed tone of the trip. But because we traveled with a 4yr old, an afternoon break was needed. So we would waste another 20-40min each way to go back and relax. If heading to Hollywood Studios or Epcot, the ride was a quick 10min, but still could wait up to 20min for the bus. We stayed in the Club Level, which we enjoyed...it was great to get a cup of coffee, a simple breakfast, and read the newspaper before we headed out.

All without having to take out the charge card again. :) We will be staying much closer next time, somewhere on the monorail line. For the same price, it's more important for us to gain the extra hours of fun family time, than to spend it waiting and riding on a bus.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "glenboig", "Title": "\u201cWonderful family holiday\u201d", "Author": "kharmon67", "ReviewID": "UR119135074", "Content": "We have recently returned from a 2 week stay at Jambo House in the Animal Kingdom with my wife and 3 year old son and we had a wonderful time. After a couple of days my was referring to it as home! The hotel itself was excellent, I have read some reviews complaining about the walk but in any hotel of this size you are either going to have a bit of a walk to your room or be waiting on elevators so didn't really find it an issue. Room was a good size for a family of 3 but I think it would be very cramped if going with a family of 4 or more with older children. There was not a lot of storage space for clothes either, most of my clothes were put on top of the unit where the tv was. Every morning we woke up to find giraffes, zebras etc at our balcony because that is were they got fed in the morning, my son absolutely loved this every morning. The pool area was good, I was actually surprised how busy it was. The only thing that slightly ruined it was the lifeguards (4 of them) who were over zealous to say the least. I was not allowed to put my son on my shoulders when in the pool and was told off for drinking my coffee to near the pool. The food in the hotel was good, we were on the DDP which was worth at least $140 per day for us. We used the Mara most days for breakfast which had a good selection of pastries, cereals, fruit etc. Buy one of their coffee cups when you get their and you'll get free tea/ coffee/ juice every day. We had lunch as well there a few times which was good. Don't bother with Boma its either a waste of a table service credit or expensive, $60 for cereal, toast, coffee etc. However it was very nice for dinner I am not usually a big fan of buffets but this was one of the best I have eaten at. The transportation to the parks was really good. Regular buses to take you to all the parks in less than 20mins. The only issues I had were when people in the motorized scooters went to the front of the queue with their whole family, then took up half the bus. No issue at all with disabled people getting priority but the number of people who went onto the bus on these scooters then got up and out of the scooter to take up another seat was quite frustating. The other thing was when on a busy bus home from a park, I had a few occasions where I had to stand with my son who was tired and wanting to sleep, while grown adults sat there watching you struggle. A general lack of manners. Overall the holiday was amazing and I would recommend this hotel especially those staying with staying with young kids, my son loved seeing the animals every day. I would also recommend getting the Dining Plan as it was great value but make sure you book tables a few days in advance or go for dinner early if you want a table. Also if you plan on doing Character Dining book this at the start, as we never got to do this because I left it till the start of the second week to book it and there was no space left.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNot worth your money!!!\u201d", "Author": "dhtrip", "ReviewID": "UR119099277", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel because we read great reviews.

We had utilized the online check-in service, so when we arrived (using Disney's Magical Express) at 10:30 a.m., less than 5 minutes later we were on our way down the Zebra Trail to our Savannah view room. Needless to say check-in was a breeze and we didn't have to wait at all even though we were hours ahead of the 3 p.m. Check-in time. Our room itself was on the farthest end of the Zebra Trail hallway and even though I've read other reviews of people complaining how \"far you HAVE to walk\" it literally only took us 3 minutes to walk from our room to the front of the lobby, and then another 2 minutes to get to the buses. I've been in grocery stores that are harder to navigate. It's really not a far walk at all. One tip to make it even less of a walk is to cut through the giftshop instead of going all the way to the lobby. Our room was a standard sized hotel room, nothing fancy except for the balcony overlooking the Savannah. This was a great feature and made it nice to sit out there after a long day in the parks to just relax and watch the animals. We didn't really use the pool at all as it was all that warm, I think the hottest it got was 84 degrees. We did walk the property though, and the pool area looked great. There were two hot tubs situated on either side of the pool, but were packed with families most of the time due to the cooler weather. We were on the dining plan, so we had made reservations to Jiko. The place is gorgeous and the service was excellent. They started us off with moist towels to wipe our hands with, then proceeds with a six course meal that was of great quality. Everything tasted great. I highly recommend this fine-dining experience. We also ate at Mara, which is the quick service location. We had both breakfast and dinner here which is the same food served at similar locations throughout the parks. The bus system was great as usual. This was our third stay on Disney property and we've never had a bad experience with the buses. Although oct 1st was the 40th anniversary of the Magic Kingdom, so those buses were very difficult to come by, so we just went to a different park figuring the Magic Kingdom would be to crowded to deal with anyway. That night there was also a marathon going on, so many buses took longer than expected due to roads being closed, but the resort had informed us of this prior with a note that was left by room service. As far as the time the buses take to get to the parks, Magic Kingdom is the farthest taking a mere 20 minutes from the resort to the bus stop. Epcot is about 15 minutes away, Hollywood Studios 10 minutes or less, and Animal Kingdom clocked in under 5 minutes. One tip when choosing which parks to go to, DON'T pick the parks that have either early or evening extra magic hours. Everyone picks those parks, making them extremely crowded. If you choose 1 of the other two parks, you will find it to be much more relaxed and pleasant. We did this, and every park we visited (with the exception of Epcot during the Food and Wine Festival) was tactically empty. 10 minute waits on the majority of rides except for Toy Story Mania, which we just got fast passes for. All in all, it's an excellent place to stay, friendly staff, top-notch room service, etc. Having stayed at other Disney Properties, however, this is the same service you get anywhere from Disney. The only difference here is that all the rooms are in one building instead of several buildings, the decor is breathtaking, and the view of the savannah is unmatched. If these things are important to you, then you may find great value in the price. For us, however, it's literally half the price to stay at a value resort and have nearly the same experience saving us over $2000. Even if you don't stay here though, get reservations for Jiko!", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northallerton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c3 Day Wedding Stay\u201d", "Author": "Will_Carbutt", "ReviewID": "UR119068772", "Content": "First off I'll set the scene I had two seperate bookings for this hotel covering 3 days. The first day I was staying with my parents and the 2nd & 3rd I was staying with my wife. During this time period we were going to be having the wedding and an early morning photo shoot at MK. I'm going to split the review into 4 parts Staff, Room, Facilities and Dining. Staff From the minute we stepped out of the car the staff were courteous and helpful. We used the valet parking service ($12) and a Bell person took our bags taking great care with our wedding outfits. The staff at the front desk quickly changed my stay from two different rooms to one once I'd explained the situation. Throughout the stay I found the staff nothing but helpful even succeeding in finding me a bottle opener at 3 am. I found the fact that a lot of the staff were actually from Africa very fitting and that they were happy to talk to you about their home land added to the atmosphere in the hotel. Room I had booked a Standard View room and as such expected a parking lot or pool view room, however I was pleasantly surprised to find that we'd been upgraded to a savannah room. On entering the room I was pleasantly surprised to find things like towels on my bed in the Mickey ears shape and the flannel had been shaped into a mouse. The batchroom was practicle, the beds were comfy (if a little high) and the room itself was adequate. I wasn't bothered by the room size as I always think if you're spending enough time in the room that you feel its too small you're spending too much time in it. The room was very clean and was cleaned every day. The view from the balcony was amazing and we saw lots of animals every day we were there. Facilities Over all AKL is well stocked with a nice pool complex lots of savannah viewing areas, to be honest the whole hotel is a viewing area, and a whole host of things to do. Things like the Night Vision goggle viewing of the animals and fire pit story telling really added to the whole experience. I used the spa pools every morning and they were particularly effective at calming my pre Wedding nerves. My only complaint in this area is that the pool never seemed to warm up. In terms of distance from the parks it really depends on which park. We went to MK a few times on the bus and it took approx 15 mins, the buses were meant to be every 20 mins but it was more like every 15 mins and they were quite happy to wait if they saw you walking down. Dining We ate at both Boma and Mara during our stay and found both to be excellent. Mara was a great place to grab something quick to eat and the refillable mugs were well worth the money. Boma was an amazing experience, eating randomly named stuff that you have no idea what it is always seems like an adventure and the food was cooked to perfection. Summary I had quite a few extra requests while I stayed at AKL and they were all met, the staff were friendly and helpful at all hours and made my newly wed wife feel amazing when she arrived. We saw plenty of animals and used most of the facilities.

We knew when we booked it that AKL was remote, but I had no idea it would take 26-30 minutes (drive time, not including the stop at Kidani) to go the couple miles to Magic Kingdom. Getting to Epcot and Hollywood Studios was slightly shorter, but still significant. Also, we found numerous times that we were waiting to go from the park to the hotel and we waited much longer than 20 minutes for a bus. We'd often see 2 or 3 buses for Caribbean Beach before we'd see a single bus for AKL. Even though AKL is a Deluxe resort and should have adequate buses running, we found AKL buses to be VERY scarce.

Also, we went Club Level, which was also totally worth it. Not much extra a night if you're already going for one of the savannah view rooms, and you get access to a 'secret snack floor' with food and drinks available pretty much all day (includes beer and wine and even spirits at night). We found this to be great as you're often on the run all the time with fitting things in at Disney and it was great to just go grab a coke or some pretzels. The 5-7 cheese and crackers, and appetisers from one of the restaurants were a highlight - great if you're heading out for a late-night sesh at one of the parks (because you get extra hours when staying at a Disney Resort). Also the staff are super helpful on the club level floor and will get/tell you anything you need. The lobby is really impressive and spacious, but this hotel is big, and some rooms would have been a fair walk from the entrance - however these rooms generally have the best views so that's the trade-off. The pool looked nice, spent a couple of hours out there. Looked like there were a lot of activities going on for kids to keep them entertained. We had a meal at the fancy restaurant (name escapes me), and it was amazing, couldn't fault it. Fairly pricey but food was that good it was worth it! The only negative I would say it that there is no wireless internet available which we thought was strange since it's common to have it at most hotels of this standard. We could walk to the sister resort (about 10-15 mins walk) and use theirs but they still wanted to charge us about $20 a day for it.

This was our second visit having stayed here in November 2010. We love this hotel. When we drove through the gates it actually felt like we had never been away. All the staff that we met were very friendly and chatted away to us and made a fuss of our 3 year old daughter. Last time we stayed in a Pool View room, where we could hardly see the pool. This time round we opted for a standard room and were allocated one on the Zebra Trail (2572). Our view this time was much better and we often woke to giraffes, zebras or antelope outside our window. The room was ok, but we didn't go to Disney to spend a lot of time in the room. Our only minor issue we had was that the queen beds were quite high up and could not be moved, and we were concerned that our daughter (who is a restless sleeper) would fall out. Each night we packed the space between the bed and the wall with our suitcases to prevent her falling out of bed and injuring herself. We ate at Mara few time and the food was reasonable, although I think you would get bored of the limited choices quite quickly. We ate at Jiko one night and although the food was good we were very disappointed with the service. Our reservation was for 7.55pm. We were finally seated at 8.25. We did not order starters and our main course was on the table at 9.25. It's very difficult to keep a hungry three year old occupied for an hour and a half. There was no explanation or apologies from the waiting staff for this delay. A few of the reviews mention the transportation time to and from the parks. We did not think that they were too bad, however I did end up standing with the stroller on many of the journeys. We had two issues with the transportation. The first relates to the motorised scooters who swanned to the front of the queue, up onto the bus and then the \"driver\" got off the scooter and walked to another seat closely followed by their family. This often took up about a quarter of the bus, thus limiting the seating for those legitmately in the queue. The second issue relates to the rudeness of some guests onboard the buses. In many instances, on the busy bus, there would be adults holding onto young tired / sleeping children who were forced to stand for the journey, whilst able bodied visitors occupied seats. A common courtesy would be allow those with young chilldren to sit, but often this never happened. I gave up my seat on most journeys to allow other mothers / fathers with young children to sit down. I believe I was in the minority.

We had club level at Jambo House. The resort has a dark appearance to it, our room was small with dark furniture and this was just depressing :( Breakfast was repetitive, boring and not tempting enough for us to make it before 1030 am each day. Cereal, bagels (not very good ones), muffins/chocolate pastry and oatmeal. They didn't change it up. Somedays we waited until 11am for quick service lunch. However, the appetizers around 5ish, were delicious! I will say that the Concierge staff (servers) were really accommodating. Ok, I'm basing this review on our first stay last year at Beach Club, Club Level. The resort was bright, colorful and the rooms were large. I'm a shellfish lover and the Cape May clam bake was awesome! And, ahhhh..... the Beach Club sand bottom swimming pool!!! Should I say more? And then there's the pool bar!!! Ok, I need to stop reminiscing. Next paragraph... This time we wanted give Animal Kingdom Lodge a try especially since it was about $600+ cheaper than Beach Club. We now realize you get what you pay for. We did have the Savannah View at Animal Kingdom...very nice!!! We saw giraffes, zebras, wilder beasts, antelope, cattle and different types of birds. On days when we had down time was somewhat depressing because we didn't want to hang out in our small, dark room. During the day it was too hot to sit outside and the animals were nowhere in sight (cause it was too hot)! The resort wasn't big enough to explore and the pool was just OK. However, the water slide in Kidani village was awesome! Prepare yourself for hundreds of annoying flying bugs to attack you there while you're lounging!!!! You're better off at Jambo pool (less bugs). No bugs at the Beach Club pool and the resort is close to Epcot, the boardwalk, Hollywood Studios and other attractions. I will say that Simba's Cub House at Animal Kingdom Lodge was wonderful for our 5 year old. She spent a few hours there and loved it!!!

We had a pool view room and were on the dining plan. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Upon arriving (via car), we drive up to the huge reception area and were greeted by the valet and bell service. This was a bit hectic as the second we step out of the car, they immediately separated me and my husband by having him stay with the car while they unloaded and sent me and my son inside to check-in. I was wanting to wait until the luggage was unloaded so my husband could watch my son while i checked in. Rather, my son was running in between my feet while I stood to check-in at the reception desk. They pretty much pushed me inside the doors and I felt as though I didnt really have a choice to wait for my husband. That was the start of the trip. By the time we caught up with each other, and were actually in our room, both me and my husband were pretty stressed out. He mentioned the valet and bell service worker he encountered was extremely rude to him, even though he tipped him well. This wasn't the only rude cast member we encountered during the week. We had a few others, but chalked it up to maybe they were having a bad day? So, we started off a little overwhelmed. But, the actual lodge itself, decorations and theme, were quite impressive. In fact, walking into the lobby was breathtaking. Had we not encountered the stressful arrival that we did, I porbably would have had a little bit more time to take it all in. Our room was great! We had two queen beds and a pool view. We thought the size was perfect for our family of 3. We had plenty of drawer and closet space to put all of our belongings. The beds were comfortable as well. Air conditioning worked great. We were able to view animals at all the animal overlooks and saw animals almost every time we went to view them. One negative about the resort we had would be the proximity our room was to the daily pool party. Yes we had a pool view room, but every day from 1pm-4pm, there is a pool party going on---- a loud pool party. Our room must have been right next to a speaker because when we were trying to get in an afternoon nap, our beds were vibrating to the beat of the music. It was that loud! With a preschooler, it was tough to get him down for a good nap without him waking up every now and then due to the loud music. We use a sound machine while we sleep and had it up pretty loud, but didn't help drown out the music or noise. The pool area was fabulous, though! Although, if you don't grab a chair by 10am, it might be hard to find multiple chairs next to each other. We just wanted two chairs and had a hard time finding two side-by-side by 11am. We saw several families saving 5-7 chairs at a time with the white hotel towels and never return to their chairs for hours (2+) at a time. Saving chairs is fine if you are going to use them between going from the pool to the chairs, but please be courteous and actually USE the chairs. If not, please remove your towels so other families can have some place to actually sit besides the concrete. Thank you. Our experience in Disney World was awesome!! We had such an amazing time! We were able to visit every park and enjoyed them all in different ways. The travel books say that September is one of the best times to go as far as crowds go, but we encountered a lot of crowds each day at every park. My touring app would give parks a 2.5 or 3 on the crowd level and I found that to be a bit off as the walkways in some of the parks were very hard to maneuver through with the loads of people squished into them. Ride wait times weren't as bad, though, with waits anywhere from 15-25 minutes except for Toy Story which was up to an hour. We were able to make rope drop EVERY DAY of our trip and rode all of our \"must-do's\" within the first two hours of park opening, but by the afternoon it was packed, so we headed back to the hotel for a nap. I would highly recommend making at least one day of rope drop. Well worth your time!! We just made sure to be back in the room by our son's normal bedtime, if not before and didn't find it hard to get up that early. Another negative about the hotel, in particular: It is about a 20-25 minute, sometimes 30 minute, drive to Magic Kingdom on the bus or by car. If this is the park you will spend most of your time, spend the extra money for one of the monorail resorts. Although we loved the hotel and the area that it was in as well as the proximity to the Animal Kingdom Park, we spent several days at MK and felt a lot of our time was spent traveling back and forth--difficult to do when you have an exhausted preschooler. Hotel Restaurants---FABULOUS!! We ate at Boma twice for dinner and twice for breakfast and thought it was awesome! We were on the dining plan. We ate a Mara twice and thought it as well as a great quick service spot. Didn't eat at Jiko; maybe next time. However, our favorite restaurant the entire trip was hands down, Ohana! Make reservations for this place well in advance! You will be glad that you woke up at 6am 180 days before your trip---TRUST ME! Other than those few negatives: proximity to MK, the pool party noise in the pool view room, and the chaotic check-in with the rude bell service worker, our stay was great!! We would highly recommend this resort. TIP: either splurge on the savanna view room or save your money and get a view of the parking lot-- especially if you have a small child who needs a nap.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAmazing breakfasts\u201d", "Author": "LastMinuteLulu", "ReviewID": "UR118852002", "Content": "Stayed in an Arusha view room with two double beds. Size was fairly standard. We didn't find it overly small and it was more than adequate for 3 nights for 2 adults and 1 child. Room was bright enough and not at all dark as some reviews suggested. Room was on same floor as and just to right of reception so a little noisy with lots of people heading back and forth but nothing too disturbing - would recommend further along the same corridor. We found being on the lower floor good for seeing the animals. Dawn and dusk are definitely the best times to spot them. Disney's magical express was an absolute boon when arriving fairly late in the evening. I booked this direct on the website and we were on their transport lists when we arrived despite the 42 days notice the website suggested and no email confirmation. Bought park tickets at reception, but would have been cheaper from the UK. If you do buy from reception, I'd recommend not buying the park hopper unless you are certain you will use it - you can pay the top up on the day if you decide to park-hop. Public areas of hotel are stunning - huge double height central atrium with a fire, beautiful carvings and disney on TV for the kids. Great bus services to and from the parks makes life very easy. We ate breakfast in Boma every morning (about $60 / day + tips for the 3 us). You need to book! It was fantastic, they roasted ham, tomatoes and asparagus over a wood fire and the flavour was to die for! There were huge bows of fresh pineapple, strawberries and other fruit as well as the usual buffet selection of almost everything you can think of. We never tried the nicer restaurants for dinner at the end of a long day in the parks and instead opted for the quick service Mara restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised with this, serving tasty simple food like roast chicken with couscous and african stew and you could still get a bottle of wine with dinner (albeit with disposal plastic glasses).

If you've read some negative reviews and are 2nd guessing whether or not to book this resort for your stay please at least give it a chance for yourself, then at least you will have experienced it for yourself. We had a Savannah view and the children (3 year old and 2 year old) loved waking up to find Giraffes, zebras or other wildlife grazing right outside our room. The 2 queen beds were more than sufficient for us and trust me if my kids with their small legs didn't mind the walk to our room at the back of the kudu trail then it's really not that far. This includes having either been enjoying the pool or the parks and then coming back \"home\" to the room. The room was clean on arrival and well serviced throughout our stay. Didn't get the \"magic\" touches everyday like the towel animals but could not have cared less, we were there for a good time and clean room and that's what we got. One thing I will say is that we booked early and were able to save 35% on our room price. If we weren't able to save this much we probably would have stayed elsewhere but for the amount we saved it was well worth it. We didn't feel the need for the dining plan as we weren't eating breakfast, lunch and dinner on property but if we were we probably would have looked into purchasing the dining plan as it did seem to represent great value for money. Now, lots of reviews have complained about paper thin walls when this really isn't the case. The room next door to ours had very young children that would often enter the room screaming hysterically but we honestly could not hear them once they were in their room and their door was closed as well as ours. This was reassuring for us too as our children would sometimes throw tantrums but our neighbours swore they could not hear a peep. The only time we could hear noise from outside our room was when we were standing near the door or when we were on the balcony and other guests had decided to enjoy the savannah too. So as long as you sleep in your bed you should have no problems! Can't say much about the dining options on property as we didn't use them at all save for the quick service restaurant \"mara\". It was more than sufficient if you're not a fussy eater which I am (but then again I don't mind eating the same thing everyday provided it's cooked correctly). The only negatives for me on this trip were the number of people bringing their mugs from previous stays and refilling at the drink station just about every time I was going to refill the souvenir mugs for the family (great timing!) and the number of overwight people using scooters. Wouldn't suprize me if they were the ones complaining about the length of the \"walk\" back to the rooms. Honestly, don't expect a super duper fancy 5 star hotel and you won't be disappointed. I carry the attitude of expect the worst but hope for the best and haven't been disappointed yet! And also, the staff at Disney can't be held responsible for the weather, they may be able to perform \"magic\" in other areas but thankfully not here. When we arrived, there was one family that had the audacity to complain about Fantasmic being cancelled due to the weather, i.e. storm, and then made \"recommendations\" that it should become an indoor show to avoid future cancellations. I've seen Fantasmic and it's fantastic the way it is. I'll admit we got lucky as a storm rolled in just after the conclusion of our show but that's the way the cookie crumbles. I've rambled on enough so I'll close by saying that while the resort is closest to the animal kingdom and blizzard beach but relatively far away from the other parks, we never waited more than 10 mins for a bus and the longest bus ride we had was 25 mins to Hollywood studios because a scooter had to be loaded. Room was clean and the resort is lovely enough to experience at least once. If you have small children that love animals, the memories of them seeing the animals up close are priceless!!!", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cSo much fun for all.\u201d", "Author": "shareair", "ReviewID": "UR118716730", "Content": "We stayed for 9 days at the Kadani villa with family and friends and we all had a great time. We used our Disney vacation club points and got a two bedroom savanah view. Unfortunately we were so busy that we only enjoyed the animals from our balcony a few times. There are large windows everywhere in the hotel so as you walk pass the lobbey, you see different animals outside eating and just hanging. There are view points that you can go to enjoy the views so may not be worth to have a savanah view. The hotel is amazingly decorated and so clean. The staff were all friendly and everyone was either greeting you or helping you. Kadani is the smaller and quieter side compared to Jambo house. That place is nice too but what a zoo. Jambo house is nicely located with all the restaurants, bigger gift shop, and bigger pool. The hotel shuttle transfers guests from the two villages every 5 minutes so not a big deal to us. It is not far to walk but with two little kids and hot humidity heat, the van ride is nicer. The disney express buses stop by Kadani first to pick up passengers but drops off at Jambo house first. So we always had a seat on the bus taking the ride from kadani but not so if you wait to get on the bus from Jambo house. The pool at Kadani has a nice water park for kids. The main pool has two slides (one small one and one big one). The larger pool at Jambo is very nice with a fun medium sized slide that even my two year old can enjoy. The pool games were great for kids and adults and we can even win prizes. The rooms were very nice and the master's has a king size bed and a larger bathroom with whirlpool jets in the tub. The large shower is nice also. The single chair in living room folds out a twin size bed and the sofa converts to queen size bed. There is also a third full bathroom in Kadani villas but not at Jambo. The rooms are clean and plenty of amenities. We ordered groceries beforehand and they delivered the day we got there and put all the stuff away for us which tells you the level of service disney promotes. We went to every park and waterpark also. We used the disney buses for all our transfers and they are 90% of the time prompt. Once again, certain times it is so crowded on the bus that it is literally a sardine can. The restaurants are excellent. We went to Sanaa and Boma both very unique and tasty foods. Did not go to jinko b/c so expensive. Mara provides all kinds of snacks and quick meals and we never have trouble getting tables. We bought a disney mug that has unlimited refills on soda and coffee for $15. My husband drinks alot of soda so it is worth for us although you can not refill it at any of the parks and waterparks. Only at the resorts. Everyone knows about the disney parks so I'm not going to go over them. Waterparks are the best I've ever seen. So much fun for all ages. Downtown disney is full of life especially at night. You can't go wrong visiting there at night. There are a ton of people, musics, performers, shops, and excellent restaurants, how can you go wrong? Make sure everyone is well hydrated and strollers are a must for those with kids (even if they are in grade school). It is a huge place and lots of walking back and forth required. Alot of rides for little ones but 40inch seems to be the requirement for more thrilled rides. Just mix the rides with the shows so you can find rest and air conditioning in b/w the lines and the heat. It rained everyday we were there but unlike 4 years ago, the rain poured hard and lasted sometimes hours instead of minutes. We used ponchos but it rained so hard that the streets were flooded in minutes so umbrella seemed like a better idea.

We were upgraded to a Savannah view room from a pool view room, which was a very nice surprise. We had a 2 queens room (we requested a king) but no kings were available. There have never been kings available on any of our stays, so if this is something you really want I would plan on it being unavailable here. The common areas of this hotel are just breathtaking--so scenic and comfortable, with amazing details everywhere. The common areas here deserve top marks by any standard. They set a wonderful mood and the hotel feels like a retreat (albeit a very large one). It does tend to be darker everywhere, which is part of the mood and pleasant in my opinion, but if you want a very bright hotel, this isn't it. Once in the room, the hotel does not impress so much. While the room looks nice, it is VERY small. There is hardly any room between the 2 queens and the walls, and only a small space in between the beds. On the end where the TV armoire is, there is just enough room to open the drawers. There is also 2 chairs at a table, and they are just wedged in there, giving one chair enough room for an adult (hitting the wall in the back), but the other is so close to the table it is really only a kid-sized space. Everything is a very tight fit, with very little room for suitcases. It is darker in there as well, but we didn't mind that. (If the shower room was a little brighter that would be better though, I'll bet it's only a 25w bulb in there). We found the beds to be in need of replacement. Mine was collapsing in the middle on the edge and somewhat squeaky, and the other one was profoundly squeaky. My back was not happy in the morning. For being in a quiet part of the hotel, there were many noises to wake you up. The main problem stemming from the very thin walls. I heard the snoring person next door, them brushing their teeth, flushing the toilet, tv, and talking. They seemed like pretty quiet folks, but the walls were just so thin. Much more so than other hotels, and also just the (as expected) hallway traffic noise. The toilet flush is really loud and would wake people up in our own room as well. If you get unlucky and get neighbors while are moderately noisy--don't expect any sleep while they are up! Housekeeping seemed to consist of a quick wipe down of the sink, empty the trash cans, and make up the beds. The only change the sheets on your fifth day, unless you request it. We had a towel animal the first day, but not after, even with tips. The Savannah view on the Zebra trails was pleasant--there were a variety of animals at different times of the day (no zebras that we saw though, how funny). It is not a very long walk/elevator ride on this trail to the lobby, pool, or food court, it is a very convenient spot if you are hoping to minimize what could be lots of walking at this hotel. The food court is nice in our opinion, but not a ton of hot meal selection. The cheeseburger and zebra domes was the only things we got more than once, so would be the most recommended. Lots of grab and go and fruit-bowl kinds of options, including a gluten and dairy free brownie and soy regular and chocolate milk boxes. The staff is helpful and very good with making a meal to meet allergies. This is a great food court if someone has food restrictions and needs a helpful chef who will make something to meet dietary restrictions. This hotel always had longer times on the bus due to its location, but direct service sort of made up for that. Now this bus makes 2 stops though, at Jambo House and Kidani village, and it really does increase the time and the probability you will stand on the bus ride. I am not sure if we will stay here again due to the room size and noisiness, and the increased travel time on the buses, but the common areas and allergen-friendly food court do tip the scales in this hotel's favor.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cOk property, the rooms needs some TLC\u201d", "Author": "bajanative", "ReviewID": "UR118621371", "Content": "Staying at a Disney World Resort was a childhood dream that never materialized until September 2011.

First off, I would advise that you do opt for a savannah view room to maximize the enjoyment of your stay. We initially booked a pool view room. When we arrived, the room was on the ground floor, really close to the pool. There are activities going on at the pool throughout the day and we did hear some noise. Since we have a little one who naps in the afternoon, we requested a room change. The second time around the room was not only noisy, but also had a strong musty smell. Feeling kid of disappointed, I went down to the reception and requested yet another change. The staff member apologized and, after a talk with the management, upgraded us to a Arusha view room (these are supposed to have the best savannah view). The room smelled clean and was very comfortable and quiet. We finally felt truly \"at home\", just like we remember it from last year. We had a nice view of the animals throughout the day. The kids were excited about the bunk bed and kept themselves entertained climbing up and down. There are a few Disney channels on tv that play family appropriate shows. The rooms are quite small, but we found them adequate for our needs. If you are traveling with a small child you might want to know that there is a pack-n-play in every room that can be used. The toilet does have a strong flush, but I have to say that the doors are doing a good job at dampening noise, and we really didn't hear much noise from our neighbors next door. The room was very quiet at all times. The bathroom was ok. It's on the small size (toilet and tub/shower combo), like some reviewers mentioned, but that didn't bother us. The vanity area with two sinks opens up to the \"corridor\" right by the entrance and is a good size. We are a family on a budget, so we decided to splurge on this hotel instead of going to the parks, and opted for activities around the hotel and swimming in the pool at the lodge and the nearby Kidani village (great pool and splash zone that seemed less crowded than the pool at the AKL). For our young children this was enough excitement and helped us adults really relax and unwind. We did go to Downtown Disney one morning and had the kids play at the Lego store, ride the carousel and visit the Disney store for some shopping. There are numerous activities offered for kids and adults at the Lodge (Jambo House. We did the \"bead\" activities this year. At the end of each session, the participants receive beads that form a nice memento from the stay. I found the activities to be fun and educational, and the kids loved them. (One of them involved preparing treats for the animals and later watching the animals enjoy them - big hit with the kiddos). The hotel seems very busy, but we still had no problems with finding relaxing spots that offered a tranquil atmosphere. My favorite is the Sunset Lounge right off the lobby. We love the BOMA restaurant for breakfast and dinner (food is very good). I really think that it's one of the better buffets at Disney. The hosts and waiters are friendly and don't fail to deliver. We dined at the Fort Wilderness restaurant on the night of my daughter's birthday, and nobody ever acknowledged the fact despite me mentioning it several times to the staff at the time of reservation and at the restaurant itself. The following night at BOMA, I mentioned it briefly to the hostess as we were being seated. At the end of our meal, our server brought out a cupcake with a candle and we got to sing Happy Birthday for my daughter. It made our night. The MARA was just another quick serve place and after eating breakfast there, I would prefer BOMA over MARA every day. The price difference was not that significant compared to the quality of food at BOMA. Overall, our stay this year was another great experience. We were able to really relax and get away from our daily routine.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cLoved it, likely wouldn't go back.\u201d", "Author": "nyc2some", "ReviewID": "UR118375581", "Content": "We stayed for four nights starting Sept 14th.

We upgraded to a Savanna room before going. On arrival, we were checked in very quickly by a young lady, whom to be honest I wasn't overly impressed with. After checking we had actually got our savanna room, she said yes, but not on the main savanna. There was a fair bit of discussion around this as we had paid a lot of money for our holiday and I was expecting a good savanna room. She explained that in January 2011, Disney had increased their prices for savanna rooms and as the hotel was fully booked, she couldn't change our room - we all felt she was 'snidy' when telling us this. She also told us we would see some rare birds (oh whooppee!!). But.... our room had a lovely outlook and we were greeted daily by giraffes, ankole cattle and 'rare birds'.....we were right at the end of the corridor, a good few minutes walk, but the benefit was, we didn't have any passing traffic, so noise was at a minimum. We were at the hotel for 14 nights - definitely not enough storage areas for 2 adults and 1 child - all we had was the wardrobe space and two drawers. It would be really good if Disney can think about their customers when allocating the rooms. We ate at Boma for breakfast once and dinner several times - all really good - but do check your receipts. I had to query once or twice when they tried to charge us an adult price for a childs seat! Beds were made daily, but not sure cleaning was really thorough as the sinks were left with coffee stains. Towels were changed and when I couldn't get the iron to work, this was changed immediately - good on you housekeeping services!!!! Pool area was clean - and when the unthoughful people did leave the towels on the floor or draped in the greenery, these were tidied fairly promptly. Mara could do with changing their menus a bit more often - quality of the food we ate was good, but theres only so many times one can face chicken breast nuggets!!!! Most staff were friendly - not all ...... should we expect more??? I personally felt it was because we are English as I did notice a 'friendlier' greeting to the americans in the hotel - personal opinion - maybe others havent experienced this. We all had a lovely holiday and would go back if the price was lower. Totally overpriced for a deluxe hotel when staying 14 nights. Although we budgeted for everything and knew exactly how much it was going to cost us, the rooms should be much bigger and more comfy. We have stayed at the Boardwalk before and the rooms offer much more space. Buses were frequent, just had one experience of having to wait 25 minutes.

This Resort is one of the newest, cleanest and best resorts within Disney World Florida and is the main hotel for the Animal Kingdom Theme Park (some 5 Min's around the corner by bus / coach). Granted, this hotel is one of the more expensive hotels, however, if you have the money I would go as far to say it will be worth every penny or cent that you pay extra. From the moment we pulled up we were impressed. The main lobby is breath taking as you walk through the main doors. Reception and Concierge are located on the left and you are welcomed almost immediately by a hotel representative. The main lobby is impressive and has an almost black glass style floor which is immaculate. The back entrance of the hotel is served by a huge glass feature which looks out onto a Savannah full of exotic African Animals. There are other viewing area's and platforms located throughout the hotel. We were lucky enough to be allocated a Savannah view room situated immediately next the the Public Sunset Savannah viewing area. The kids were absolutely blown away the moment they opened up the patio doors and were met by a beautiful Giraffe underneath our balcony. This was the moment I realised the extra money was worth paying for the hotel, although we did not pay extra for a Savannah view room lucky enough. In my opinion, Disney will do as much as they can to please and accommodate you so if your not happy with your room, simply ask to change. There are only a handful of rooms with restricted views of bushes and trees surrounding the pool. Some may not mind this as the amount of time you will spend in your room i guess will be minimal. Outside at the rear of the hotel is a campfire area where you can meet and greet some of the Animal handlers and wardens. You can venture around a small viewing walkway surrounded by wooden fence to separate you from the beautiful Animals such as Zebra, Pelicans, Gazelle etc on the Savannah. I would advise to wear mosquito repellent at night times. There are a number of activities put on for children and adults to get involved with like bongo drumming and learning more about the Animals etc. I must admit, we did not really take part too much. The lobby also has a comfortable seating area and a large TV which plays all of the Disney favourite cartoons day and night. There are 3 main hotel restaurants in Jambo house and another in the Kidani Village (Sister hotel adjacent to Jambo). The quick service snack style restaurant is the Maya. This will serve most of your needs and there is a shop and a soda drink fountain for unlimited refills. I would advise paying $14 for a resort mug, as you will be able to fill it up as often as you like, ideal for when your around the pool. The sit down buffet style restaurant is Boma. Not perfect for picky children as it has an African flavour to many dishes but the adults should give it a try. This is the perfect place for breakfast in my opinion though. The third restaurant is the more expensive of the two sit down table service restaurants, and is called Jika. This is worth a visit but a reservation is advisory particularly if you wish to eat later at night. There is a dress code but it is not too strict. Beautiful food and worth the money. There is a fantastic shop within the complex called The Marketplace. This has some basic essentials you might need, but to be honest, who wants to self cater when your in a place like this. The Marketplace is also a pick up point for all of your delivered shopping that you might have bought earlier the day before. Yep, Disney send any shopping you buy, straight to your resort hotel free of charge the next day. This is very handy, providing your not leaving the following day. The Marketplace sells wonderful artifacts and Disney related merchandise and in my opinion was only bettered by the Little Christmas shop in Magic Kingdom and the World of Disney mega store in Downtown. The Uzima pool is fantastic and has a slide for kids. It is served by 4 lifeguards at any one time and provide children's life jackets so Mum's / Mom's and Dad's can relax safe in the knowledge the kids can play in the water without dramas. There is activities during the day around the pool. My son particularly liked the musical statues game. If it rains, games move inside where the Wii comes out to entertain. The pool is open till very late and is flood lit. There is a pool bar also where cocktails and alcohol is available as you would expect, but for soft drinks I would just use the Mara. The Hotel is served by an excellent, complimentary bus / coach transport service which will take you to all of the other Disney World Theme and Water Parks. From these drop off points you are able to transfer to any other resort very easily and everywhere is clearly signed at these bus stops. The Animal Kingdom Lodge residents are restricted to the bus service only but this is not a problem as you will have to wait only a maximum of 20 Min's to get anywhere. Transfers to all of the theme parks, water parks and Disney Downtown are quick and comfortable although they can be crowded at times. The biggest test was after the Magic Kingdom fireworks show, when thousands leave the park at the same time. Where the queues for the Ferry boat and Monorail are lengthy and time consuming, the buses are frequent and we did not wait at all. We even had the benefit of having kind bus wardens on hand to give the kids presents whilst they waited whenever we had to wait at other parks. This helped to make the bus system a pleasant experience for us. The hotel also has a gym and outside jacuzzi. All in all this hotel is clean, comfortable and an absolutely brilliant experience. Whenever you are asked where your staying, and you reply with the Animal Kingdom lodge, people are always impressed.

From the Magical Express to our arrival at AKL, the service was impeccable. When we got off the bus we were greeted by a bell hop who took our bags and then another gentleman waving hello with a big mouse hand. He made friendly conversation with us as he escort us to the check in counter where he introduced us to the cast member who would check us in. Check in was fast and effiecent. We had two connecting standard view rooms (my 4 kids stayed in one room, my husband and I in the other) but woke up to see the giraffes and other animals every morning. I don't think it is worth paying the extra money for a savannah view because there are several viewing areas throughout the hotel, plus like I mentioned above, I saw them from my standard view room. The lobby is stunning with gorgeous mahongy floors you could eat off of. They also had a large TV in the lobby that all the kids in the hotel would gather around to see classic Disney cartoons. We ate at Boma's and Mara's and were satisfied with both. I really appreciate that Boma took us two hours ahead of our reservation. We could only get a 8:05pm reservation online but arrived around 6pm famished from spending all day at the Animal Kingdom. They took us right away. Nice!! The pool was lovely and I really liked the fitness center's steam room. They provide fresh towels at both areas which was great. The only downside is the resort's distance from the Magic Kingdom which can take up to 25 minutes to get to depending on traffic. But the water parks, Hollywood Studios and the Animal Kingdom are 10 minutes away tops. But I would stay here again in a heart beat because waking up to giraffes is an exotic experience that you don't typically get at home. Lastly, I loved the airline check-in that is set up in the lobby. Give them your bags and pick them up at your destination. What a convenience!!! I think it was only for domestic flights though.

The last time was just this July 2011 and what a great stay. It is a wonderful hotel with a cool theme. The grand lobby, halls, restaurants and rooms have a great African detailed theme design. It is so exciting to wake up in the morning and pull back the drapes to see some wild animals hanging out in front of your balcony. I think this would be fun for all ages--I know us adults loved it. We have had great luck paying for just a \"standard view\" but being placed on the edge of the savanna to see the animals as they go to hang out under trees or to be feed by the cast members. If you want a quiet room, I would suggest not taking a \"pool\" view as the pool is very nice and is also very lively. I think the rooms are well appointed. The bathroom is small and a little dark with only one light source but not a problem. With a DVC room we had a small \"kitchenette\" area which was very nice to store snacks and cold drinks. Here are some general tips to make your Disney trip the best it can be: 1. Get up early and get to the parks. You can do so much in the first hour before other guests arrive. 2. Use the Fast Pass system. As soon as your first Fast Pass time starts make sure to send someone in the group to get another one. 3. Before you go plan your days in advance (which parks on which days) and make reservations in advance for sit down meals at each resort. This can save you a lot of time and give you a nice break. People get crabby when they get hungry. 4. Take a break in the middle of the day. If you are hopping then go to a different park at night. You will get more out of the park early in the day and late at night. 5. Book a character meal (like Tusker House @ AK or Crystal Palace @ MK) you'll get a great meal plus wonderful photo memories with up close interactions with the characters. I have seen many kids and adults light up when we go to these places and then again when they share the stories with family and friends after getting home.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cThis is our new favorite hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Katie W", "ReviewID": "UR117824210", "Content": "I love this hotel!

(seperate reviews for each, 2 on property, one off with a rental car.) This was week one. Note: We spent a full \"rest day\" at each resort hotel resort in between 2-day park visits. We also had family members join up with us (could only come for the last week) On property definately the better option in saving the parking, gas and transportaion(rental) fees. However, the off property condo (3 bdrm, 4 bath) was a HUGE savings as the group grew and we needed all the extra space. (Disney properties arn't equiped for parties of 5 or larger, except for 3 specific resorts and the price is not worth what you get.) Okay, the AK lodge. Gift shop, transportation reception all good, all fast, all friendly and efficient. The interior is stunning, so well done, comforting and amazing at the same time. The Savanna and outdoor view of animals charming. The music and drums playing all the time was great, and then really annoying, and then we got used to it. Pleased that you can't hear it in the room unless you open the balcony door. We had a Savanna view and opened the door...alot. About the view, look, we came from the West coast and to us it was worth the upgrade. Other reviews complained about the expectations of seeing the animals not being met. Sometimes the animals were there, sometimes not, to us... no big deal, we knew we would catch them another time, and we did) The food is delicious and we ate at every place they have; bar, buffet, cafe, fine dining, concierge lounge, but be prepared for unique flavors. Warning! If you or your children are not into heavily spiced food (not necessarily hot, just a LOT of different and unusual spices), do not stay here, you will not be happy with the food. Instead, stay where the food fits you and come over for a visit, you can resort hop on the free transportation and experience everything the AK has to offer (excluding the rooms) and sample some of the adventureous food, no kidding, there is little else. My son is 10, into all kinds of exotic food, prefers gourmet, but grew tired of the flavors offered after day 2, and did not care at all for the \"kid food\" very bland and average (and pricey by my standards)... he was however always pleased with the free apps offered upstairs (concierge) so he went there. The rooms are small, yes small, every site I read warned me of that so I was not surprised. They are well themed though and we stayed in the concierge upgrade so we spent most of our \"hotel time\" in the upper level lounge, and the regular ammenities; pool and restaurants. Note; we did not stay on the concierge level ($$$) but instead stayed on a lower level and paid the concierge \"upgrade\"($) worth every penny to us as there was free offerings all the time, (breakfast/snacks/appetizers/desserts) including beverages to-go and my favorite...drum roll please... unlimited cappuccino (all day) and evening wine! There are a TON of kids/family activities here, the list changes but includes safari, stories, hide n seek, movies, games, bird watching, art, etc.. a ton more. You get a list of what is available when you check in. Some you sign up for some you just show up for. The Lodge is close to the Animal Kingdom Park and that's it, so prepare accordingly if you are going elsewhere, (not recommended) there will be a stop to the transfer station and extended travel time! Overall I recommend this hotel for it's uniqueness (design, food, merchandise, savanna) and service. Rooms always cleaned, chocolates on pillows, towel animals and delicious food. I do recommend a stay here at least once, it is worth it for 2 nights, 3 days (tops) and visit the AK park, the two are well themed and tied in together so well you'll feel as though you were far far away. I will not stay here again, but will visit it.

Boma resturant is a nice place to dine for breakfast/evening dinner but the food is the same and you need to use your 'Disney Dinner Plan' and plan your meals on line before you go as you won't get in at peak periods otherwise.

Take a taxi or a car drive to the 'Premier Outlet Centre' for the cheaper prices you will have a fun there goods are discounted ones at knock down prices and there is a 'Disney outlet store' on site.

There were enough signs along I-4 to direct us to the proper exit and the exit itself was away from the major traffic points in Orlando. In terms of other aspects of location especially relative to the Disney World theme parks, then I can't really say. But other reviews have stated that this resort is further out from the majority of other Disney places. CHECK-IN (2 rating) There was a Disney employee who guided guests to appropriate check-in agents. It reminded me of an airport experience. However, the actual check-in process (i.e., counting from when an agent pulls up your information) was too long especially when we had reservations already. I'm estimating about a 20 minute time frame. At other hotels, this took no more than 5 minutes. PARKING (5 rating) There were ample parking within walking distance from the main lobby. A big plus was also the 30 minute parking near the lobby for guests. This was especially helpful during check-in and the initial unloading of our things. Note that although parking stated 30 minutes, I had the car parked for about an hour without getting any fuss from anyone. ACTIVITIES (5 rating) The animals were definitely the big draw. You have lots of opportunities to view the animals. However, this may mean that you have to walk through various viewing places to see the popular ones (e.g., giraffe and zebras). If you had enough of the animals, then ask the staff for an up-to-date activity calendar that tells you on-going events throughout the week. Even for their off-peak periods Disney had a lot of stuff to offer. Most of their activities centered around the themed of AKL. There were authentic African representatives (i.e., Disney employees from Africa) who talked about various things from animals in the continent and other cultural stuff. It was also good to see authentic African art scattered all over the place. It was kind of like a museum experience. For a short stay, the AKL fulfilled our activities needs. STROLLER FRIENDLY (4 rating) The majority of AKL was navigable with a stroller. The only area that didn't have easy stroller access was the outlook view on Arusha rock (in the main lobby). I only saw stairs leading down. But for the majority of the place, they had ramps. Also, the elevators had ample room for the stroller even with 4 other passengers in them. The rooms, however, were pretty tight, so you may have to close (i.e., minimize) your stroller. ROOM (3 rating) We had the Arusha savannah view room. It came with 2 queen beds, a refrigerator, iron, hair dryer, flat screen TV, a small table with 2 chairs in the inside, and a private balcony with a plastic table and 2 chairs. Aside from the decor and the private balcony, the room was comparable to a 3 star hotel such as a Holiday Inn. I wasn't particularly pleased with the wooden bed frames. The borders of the bed frame stuck out slightly and I banged my knees twice on it. The first time was so hard that I still felt my knees sore a couple days after. Also, the biggest disappointment was that the majority of the times, the view from the balcony consisted of just grass and trees. There were birds here and there, but the \"big item\" animals where in other areas. The animals only came when the staff replenished the food supply in the savannah. The other times the animals went to the other savannahs. Another thing to note is that the rooms have the tendency to be dark. Actually, the entire AKL setting is a bit dark. This means that the majority of the lighting used are traditional light bulbs with a soft glow (i.e., somewhat dim). You do have the option of making the room bright by turning on additional lights, but you'll have to flip at least 4 light switches to do so. Also, if you like to read while in the toilet, then the bathroom light is somewhat dim. I was still able to read, but it was slightly annoying to read if you have a magazine with a dark background. Also note that there is only partial separation between your balcony and your neighbor's. If you actually bend down, you will see your neighbor's feet. If you have intimate conversations, then you might want to take it inside. As for the beds, I didn't have any complaints. They were decent and firm. However, I've had softer beds in other hotel chains. Plus, you only get 3 or so pillows per bed. For a pillow hugger, this amount may not be enough. TELEVISION (1 rating) I usually only watch the television before dozing off to sleep. But from the channel selection that I've seen, the available channels were ho-hum. They mostly consisted of Disney-owned channels (e.g., ABC and ESPN), a lot of Disney resort specific infomercials, and some foreign news channels. I didn't see HBO or any other movie channels as offered by other hotel chains. INTERNET (3 rating) Any charge involving Internet access automatically gets a 3 rating from me. Since our stay was short, I didn't end up using the Internet. Thus, I can't speak for other aspects of it such as connection speed and accessibility (i.e., wireless option). FOOD (4 rating) I encountered 3 areas where you can get your food: Boma, Jiko, and Mara. Boma is a buffet style restaurant and their selection was decent. Jiko is a casual dining place and there selection was also decent. Both these joints had pretty good service. Our waiters were very professional and made sure we had everything that we needed. They were especially accommodating with our newborn in her stroller. They made sure that they seated us in areas where we can navigate the stroller easily and not block any of the other customers. Also, even without reservations, we got accommodated into these places easily. We went to Jiko at 8:30 PM and we got seated about 15 minutes later. We did not succeed in making reservations to Boma, so we just showed up at 5:00PM and were seated instantly. As for Mara, this place is like a fast food joint. The food and selection was decent, but the wait and service was ho-hum. It took us 20 minutes to get an order of flat bread. This was around 3:30PM and the place was not busy. The staff just decided to put off heating the flat bread even though it was in front of them. POOL (4 rating) The pool was nice. The water was certainly refreshing (i.e., slightly cooler than the temperature) especially in the Florida heat. There were multiple lifeguards, so it is certainly re-assuring especially for kids. The pool times were also decent. We saw people swimming as late as 10 PM. My only complaint was that the deepest part was only about 4 feet. My preference would have been a water depth enough to cover up to my neck. JACUZZI (3 rating) This was always filled with people every time we wanted to try it. There were also kids jumping in and out, so I'm not quite sure that's the type of Jacuzzi experience that I want.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greensboro, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cLoved it- Except the quick serve food\u201d", "Author": "PinkL0ver", "ReviewID": "UR117331306", "Content": "We booked a trip here for the beginning of August to only stay 2 nights before the beach.

We are expert travellers to Disney World and have previously stayed at the All Star Movies, Music and Port Orleans FQ and this was by far the best hotel we've stayed at in the world!! We chose this hotel because we got a good deal from our travel agents and also because we could make use of the free dining plan offer (which is excellent and well worth your money). We went with high expectations for this hotel as it is a deluxe and as soon as we arrived every expectation was met to well more than our satisfaction. I can not praise this hotel enough, everything about it is just wonderful. The attention to detail can not be faulted and the staff always did their best to make your stay even more comfortable. The maids were so lovely and always had a smile for you when you passed them. The rooms are of an excellent standard. We booked a standard view room but were pleasently surprised when we arrived to see they had given us a savannah view for nothing, and what a view!! We saw almost every single animal just from our balcony. The animals are so well cared for and happy. You always see someone in there feeding them or cleaning the area and the animal keepers are always happy to stop and talk to you about the animals. The rooms themselves are large but I think it depends where your room is and what type. Ours was plenty big enough. They are very well cleaned and we had clean towels every day. All rooms have a fridge and coffie maker and the maids give you a nice variety of coffies and tea every day. Every week day morning you also get a newspaper delivered to your door which I thought was a nice touch. The pool was fantastic and beautifully clean. There are plenty of sunbeds but if you want the best ones in the best location you need to get up early to save them. From about 13:00 they have a lot of activities and games for kids around the pool so it get's a little busier then. The food was great at AKL. We ate at Boma for breakfast a few times and that was really good. They had a lot of American food's but also some African foods which were really nice. Dinner is also great. Service is great but, with any Disney table service or buffet meal, just be careful what you are signing when you get your bill. We noticed that they would give you a few reciets to sign but one of them is for a gratuity bill so watch out. If you're tipping it's best to just not sign this and say \"I'll leave a tip in cash with the bill\". It is like this in any Disney table serve/buffet restaurant. The Mara (the quick serve restaurant at AKL) was quite small and busy but the service was always fast. However, there wasn't a huge variety of food like there is in other resorts such as the All Stars. I think that's because it's a deluxe resort and so they want to encourage you to eat at their expensive restaurants. However, there was enough variety for us as they had things like burgers, fries, flatbreads (their version of pizza) and chicken dinners. Their desserts were also very nice. Most of the times you eat in the parks anyway so it dosn't matter that they don't have a vast array of dishes. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful. We could have spent the whole two weeks there. Everything is so well maintained and detailed. It really is like being in Africa. You forget you're in Florida. The only negative criticism I have is to do with transportation and that is that the park buses to and from AKL Jambo house are shared with guests staying at AKL Kidani Village which is a vacation club resort next door. At first this is no bother but when you're tired and hot and just want to get back to your room it is a little annoying that the buses go to Kidani village first, prolonging your journey. The only bus that goes to Jambo House first is the Typhoon Lagoon and Downtown Disney bus. However, I suppose Disney are trying to save money by doing this and we noticed that people staying at other deluxe resorts like Grand Floridean also had to share their bus with other deluxe hotels. Apart from that our experience at AKL Jambo House was fantastc and out of this world. We didn't want to come home and are saving up to try and go again some time. Now we have stayed at AKL we can never go back to a value or moderate resort in Disney as they just will not be able to compare to the amazing experience we have just had.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cPublic Spaces Roar!

But, the rooms are standard, three star accommodations with terrible mattresses, uncomfortable furniture and disappointing, tiny dark bathrooms. The beddding is overly crisp, low end and the pillows hard and unwelcoming. It's not that the rooms don't look nice, it's that they aren't comfortable and feel on the cheap. If you do plan to stay here, make sure you get a savanah view of the animals--and be patient, they roam at their own will and pace. If you can't get, or can't afford a view of the animals -- stay someplace else! There are better choices on property closer to the action. So, should you stay here? If you love animals, embrace the African theme and want a hotel room with a view you can't get anyplace else in the US, then this might be the place for you.

I would say on average it takes 15-20 minutes to get to EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and Magic Kingdom. There are several places to dine at the resort and they vary greatly in price, which is nice in my opinion. There are a fair mix of families and couples that stay at this resort.

It was my sons 6th birthday trip and he loves animals so that was the prime reason for booking this Lodge. It was the best decision! Disney never do anything by half and this place was no exception. All of the theme parks were just a short (free) bus trip away yet when we returned to our room at night, we felt like we were a million miles from anywhere. The rooms were comfortable and had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. We opted for a pool view room and our location was great. We were right near the lifts that took us down to the pool, laundry and restaurants. The lobby was a short stroll away and it was about a 5minute walk to the bus stop. The pool was great and my son loved the waterslide. The food at the buffet restaurant, Boma, was awesome. I had not planned to dine there much due to all the other options throughout the Disney World Resort but after eating there once, I cancelled some of our other reservations and went back to Boma. We didn't see too much of the animals, but it was our fault - we were always so busy spending all day in the theme parks. We spend one leisurely afteroon wandering the hotel grounds and we were not disappointed. I had read some other reviews that said that the downside to staying at the AKL was that it was so far away from everything. I found this a bonus as we did not have to share our bus with other resorts. We travelled to another resort for dinner one night and we were on the bus forever as it stopped at lots of resorts along the way. We caught a taxi back to AKL because I wasn't keen on the multiple stops on the way back. The buses at AKL ran frequently and on time. I think the longest trip was 20mins. The hotel staff were helpful and courteous. Our housekeeping lady was fantastic. She even asked me how I would like her to make our beds up after noticing that I preferred to pull the quilt down. She always had a smile on her face! The laundry facilities were really good and while I was on wash duty, my husband and son enjoyed the nearby games room.

Unique! But with a value for money problem. Here is a quick summary with a few points below: * Many cool things about hotel common spaces in terms of integrating animals and elements of Africa (see below for description). * Great 3-4 ft pool with kids' water slide. And hot tubs. 5 year old LOVED it. * Good food with unique and tasty African spices. Typicall packed--reserve early. * Challenge: like all Disney \"Luxury\" Resorts, the value for money on the actual room is not good: smallish rooms, cotton/poly sheets, and mediocre amenities. After being out in the bright sun all day, it was nice to return to the cool, dark spacious lobby with soaring ceilings, real African artifacts, and a huge window view out to the Savanna as well. The lobby always had a wonderful smell of some kind of sweet burning wood and interesting African music playing at a low volume. Not an overload of Disney decor at this resort--subtle. Another cool touch was that, on a platform by the Savanna just outside the lobby, guides from various African countries were available to speak with you about any of the animals or discuss their country and traditions. Unique for any hotel in the US and certainly in Disney. The Food in both restaurants was good (and sometimes great) in that most dishes used very well-researched flavorings and spices from Africa. BUT, because this hotel is at least 15-20 minutes away from any other resort by bus (only option)--the 2 restaurants are always booked to capacity. Absolutely RESERVE RESTAURANTS IN ADVANCE. Still, the snack bar is not bad at all and usually has 1-2 OF the aforementioned dishes with tasty spices available (i.e., you're not stuck to pizza and hotdogs). In summary, you can tell ALOT of thought went into the development of this particular resort. It's wonderful and unique! But do not expect much luxury in terms of bedding, room size/layout, decor, or amenities. These are below the grade of a typical big city Hilton or Marriott, even though room rates at Animal Kingdom Lodge (at $450-730) could easily score you a stay in a beautiful room at the Ritz-Carlton facing Central Park in NYC.

We opted to stay at a studio with a Savannah View which was a good choice for a small family. The room had its own refrigerator and microwave. The Balcony had a great view of the animals that wandered in for its feeding time. We were on the fifth floor so we had a great view of the animals and also of the great lobby to which it is known for. I will let my photos speak for itself. All of the animal photos were from the lobby and from our room's balcony. Among those seen are Ankole Cattle, Bontebok, Eland, Zebra, Greater Kudu, Impala, Okapi, Red River Hog, Nyala, Reticulated Giraffe, Roan Antelope, Sable Antelope, Thompson's Gazelle, Waterbuck, White-Bearded Wildebeest, Abyssinian Ground Hornbill, Blue Crane, East African Crowned Crane, Greater Flamingo, Marabou Stork, Ostrich, Pink-Backed Pelican, Spur Winged Geese, Guinea Fowl and Ruppel's Griffon Vulture (listed in the pamphlet)! The lobby had chandeliers which I noticed were made out of Shields and Spears if one looks at it closely. We also had a chance to visit the newer Kidani Village to look at more animals (like the Ostrich) and at the hotel itself. There are free shuttles to and from the Jambo House and the Kidani Village. Our Room like the lobby is African inspired right down to the Bed Covers, Cabinets and night lamps. The Bathroom was kept neat and tidy. Our room had a double sink which we loved. My family loved to lounge around at the Balcony every morning and evening for breakfast and dinner while viewing the animals. We had internet connection (Free for Disney Vacation Club Members). Everyone knows food and water in Disney is expensive..Here are some tips. Either you can avail of the Disney Meal Plan or one can go and grocery shopping outside of disney (dont forget a case of water for your trips to the park). There are also TV Dinners, drinks including African wine selections and sundries are available at the Gift Shop. The Uzima Pool has a zero entry type of pool which is good for the kids. My daughter loved it as it we can stay in it for as long as we like (She swims very well). We never ate at the Jika (fine Dining) But we met up with friends and we did eat at the BOMA which is an african inspired Buffet. I must say BOMA earned a lot of praises from our friends who are true blue foodies - their palates are raving about the flavors!! For those guests with budget in mind. Eat at Mara's which is cheaper and a fast food - take out kind of restaurant. They also offer a $14 disney mug which is refillable(soda and coffee) at anytime of one's stay at the hotel and some parts of the parks and other hotels too. Worth mentioning is the pool and the hot tubs (there are two). The pool has a bar available. The Gym and Spa has good machines on it and worth using although one gets more than enough exercise as one goes to the Parks everyday. Also worth and recommend mentioning is the Magical Express and the airline check in available at the lobby for departing guests. We use the magical express for our airport transfers. Our luggage we checked into Orlando from our departing airport was picked up by the Magical Express and brought to our room directly. We never picked it up at Orlando International. AND When we checked out.... we also checked in our luggage and picked up our Boarding Passes at the counter near the Check in counter of the Hotel. How convenient is that? From this hotel - I was able to print out our Boarding Passes early thereby earning us good seats at our airline carrier.

Disney is expensive, so getting it right the first time is a must. Originally, we booked tickets via a popular online travel agent but learned that they were selling us a room only guaranteed for two rather than three. So we dumped the reservation and tried again direct with Disney. Disney was not more intelligent. Disney initially tried to charge us extra for our third adult, even though the room comes with a queen and two bunks. Snafus aside, the main building is beautiful. Each restaurant was tasty. Gift shop had nice buys. And of course, rising real early (crack of dawn) to watch the animals wandering out on their treks to wear food is waiting was worth all the trouble. But I wouldn't do it again. A few more bits of information: our room was clearly occupied by kids eating in bed before us and not cleaned by housekeeping; waits were too long for a Disney bus for transportation between theme parks and AKL; the principal reason for coming is to see the animals up close outside your balcony, but that experience is largely an early morning treat (and not so close); the pool area was large with plenty of interest, but it's really just for kids because there isn't a spot to relax without them running about you, including the hot tub; and the bottomless cup beverage service for a mere 8 oz at a time, is in a remote cafeteria that is convenient for the pool but not the rooms or even lobby. My review may seem negative, but I really want to stress that it was fun to do ... once. Advice given to me about choosing one side or the other to see the animals turned out to be good but not deal-breakers. Their advice: Zebra Trail for Arusha view. My advice: get an inexpensive room anywhere where you are facing the animals, and come morning they'll be there outside your balcony.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cKidani Village-OK\u201d", "Author": "KVP2315", "ReviewID": "UR116704424", "Content": "We had a Grand Gathering family vacation here.

There are no quick service restaurants in Kidani so it was a hike to go to Jambo. Kidani is much quieter and cleaner than Jambo. The Kidani pool slide is nicer.

My kids (7 &3) loved it and could not believe there were real animals outside our room. I took advantage of a nice discount Disney was offering and got a 2nd floor Arusha Savannah room - it overlooked the middle area where I saw giraffes, zebras, herons, wildebeasts, antelopes, some sort of cows and other various birds. I have been to Disney 5 times in the last 10 years and usually stay at a value or moderate Disney resort. I normally would never have stayed at a deluxe Disney resort since I think that the normal rate of $400+ is too much, so here is a review of pros and cons for this place. PROS: -The hotel was clean, the staff were friendly, the African/animal theme was awesome and very well done. -The food had the normal Disney stuff but also some African themed items which were all good. -Great view of the animals every day. If you are going to stay here, pay the extra money for a good view - there were rooms where the view could have been the maintenance shed or the animal pen. EXTRA MAGIC - the cleaning staff made some towel animals in our room a few days of our stay. -There were kid activities all over including coloring in the lobby, some African board game, a giant blow-up TV by the pool at night time playing a movie, storytelling and marshmallow roasts over a fire. -Animal feeding time seemed to be daily around 5 or 6pm and all the animals came right into view and it was awesome. NEUTRAL -Considering I don't have money to burn, the resort was geared to the rich. A valet service was offered for $12/day, otherwise you are parking far away from the entrance. Also because the parking is so far, you practically need to use the baggage service. -The restaurants were excellent, but the sit-down ones were very pricey. The regular counter restaurant was also excellent, but there were clearly not enough tables which herds you into the more expensive places. -The hotel is dark, particularly in the hallways. It goes with the African hut theme and also the eco-bulbs are used everywhere in their environment theme. I did not mind this at all. -Animal Kingdom Lodge is on the edge of the Disney property and was a decent drive to all theme parks except of course Animal Kingdom. CONS: -One swimming pool - I like the other resorts where there are several pools besides the giant main one, so you can have some peace and quiet. -Parking was too far - may not be bad if you have money to burn for valet. -The room was small! I could not believe it, but I guess because we had a balcony to view the animals, the room was about 5 feet smaller than a moderate resort room. It felt a little cramped. We also did not have enough drawer space to unpack all our clothes. Not a huge deal, but considering that the rate is $400+ a night, I would have expected better. So there it is. A great place overall, but in some cases I would have expected a bit more out of a deluxe resort. My family and I had a great time and we recommend it to anyone. We may go back there one day, but I personally would not pay the non-discounted rates for this place and would rather save that money for a resort with a monorail running through it.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome!\u201d", "Author": "runab0ut", "ReviewID": "UR116617206", "Content": "We stayed on the 4th floor with a balcony overlooking some of the animals.

Our stay was from July 29-August 3 2011 and stayed in the Jambo House with an Arusha Savannah view room. All I can say is WOW. Everything about this hotel is amazing. When we first enter the enormous lobby we were amazed by all the decorations and atmosphere. There is so much to explore in this hotel. Check in was quick and painless. The cast member congratulated us on our wedding and informed us about everything there was at the hotel. He even gave us special pins to wear for our occasion. He took his time to answer all of our questions and wasn't rushing us at all. When we got to our room, we immediately went to the balcony to see if there were any animal. I am happy to report that there were giraffes, zebras, and ankole (Kinda like cows with huge horns). The only reason why I knew the name was because you get a guide with all the animals you can see during your visit. On other days we also saw gazelle, hogs, pelicans, cranes, and many others. There are also these little lizards that are just everywhere it seemed. Not just at the AKL either. I guess these are native to that area in general? I will admit that the animals are not out during all parts of the day. They do go into hiding when it gets really hot but I have seen them during different times. Just don't be disappointed if you don't see anything for a few hours. I knew this going into it so I was not disappointed in the least. I am overall very happy with the amount of time I was able to see the animals. Some even came right under our balcony and we got a really close look. I brought a pair of binoculars which came in handy for the ones that were far away. We had a room for handicap people which was fine. The shower was larger than one the rooms the brides maids were in who also stayed at the AKL. The room was always very clean. We would leave for 30 minutes to eat something at Mara and when we came back, the beds were made and we had fresh towels. The fridge was large enough to store some bottles of water and sodas. It is about the same size of a refrigerator you would store in a college dorm room and is hidden inside a stand by the dresser/TV cabinet. My only complaint about the room was the bed. It just seemed like the should use higher quality beds there but they were still comfortable enough for me. Make sure to look for the hidden Mickeys in the shower curtain and the bed comforter. We loved the fact that there are lots of areas where you can just sit and relax with friends while having a few drinks. There are several indoors and outdoors. Most of the seats for these \"relax\" areas are wooden rocking chairs which I thought were very comfortable. We mostly ate breakfast at the Mara quick serve place but we did go to Boma once for breakfast. We liked it but honestly you can get most of the stuff at Mara for a lot cheaper. Everyone says the dinner is the best but we were always at the parks during this time so we never got a chance to experience it. We also didn't get a chance to eat at Jiko. The bar area which is called Victoria Falls is right above Boma and the bar tender was great. My only real complaint was the wait at the concierge desk. It took an obsurd about of time just to get through this line. Even being the third person in line took 20 minutes. They only have two people working the desk at a time. This isn't a complaint towards the cast members who were working the concierge desk because they were super helpful to each and every guest who needed help. They just needed to have an additional person or two working the desk if there are people in line since usually people have a lot of questions or time consuming questions. My advice is do research before going to Disney World so you don't have any questions that need to be answered by the concierge in the hotel. We drove and have season passes (come with the wedding package) and we didn't use the buses so I can't comment on that. Driving to the parks didn't take long at all. You are obviously next to the Animal Kingdom and the other parks were within a 15 minute drive of the hotel. Not bad at all in my opinion. The last night we were there, they placed a few chocolates on the bed. One is a large one that has the AKL logo on it. It was neat and delicious. Overall I loved this hotel and would definitely come back. We got a reduce rate since we have annual passes and paid around 1200 for 5 nights. That is about 240 a night and I thought it was a good value for that price. Some tips I could offer is to stay on the 3rd or 4th floor if you get a savannah view. It just made viewing the animals better than the lower floors. Also, bring your own set of binoculars if you have them.

This was our first trip to Disney. Basically one should give some time to explore the hotel if staying here as we spent breakfasts on our balcony (in July!) watching the various animals feeding. Most exciting for us were the giraffes and zebras. I will admit that after staying here the Kilimanjaro safari ride, although great, probably lost some luster given that we could see many of the same animals from our hotel room. At this location, there are activities scheduled during the day which would have been nice to participate in if we had enough time. The pool looked very inviting, but we were unable to take advantage of due to some very strong afternoon thunderstorms that closed the pools down for the two days of our stay. A few specific notes: we were delayed 4 hours on our arrival and got in late. We used Disney Magical Express, but didn't get our bags delivered to our room that first night. The hotel staff was very good about getting us toiletries and diapers free of charge when we asked. We also got a credit, which was nice considering that we changed plans for the next day waiting for our luggage. Given that this is Disney, though, the credit would not go very far in terms of replacing a lost bag. Hopefully that is already obvious. For restaurants onsite, we were not on a meal plan. We intended to eat at Boma but decided that the quick service Mara was perfectly fine for us and saved probably about $80 by doing so, especially given that we weren't hungry when our reservation was scheduled. BTW, just because you have a reservation via Disney's website doesn't mean that you will be seated immediately - another reason why Mara was appreciated by us for our kids that had to eat NOW. One nice things about the rooms is that they are pretty quiet. We really couldn't hear the people around us. The hotel must have thick walls. We also didn't have a car, so we used the buses. We only traveled to the Animal Kingdom park from this hotel. Since that is the closest destination from this accommodation, one thing we didn't consider were the bus time waits. The buses run frequently, but there was at least one time where we had to wait for the next bus due to the number of people waiting to return to the hotel. One last observation - it was very much appreciated by myself and my wife that the Disney cast members (staff) are very friendly in greeting you and not in a fake way. At the Animal Kingdom, it was pretty apparent that the staff there take this seriously.

Let me just say that, this resort is still magical! The property itself is huge, with plenty of activity for those who are unwinding after a day in the parks. The lobby is wonderful to walk though and sit in, with daily activities provided for the guests. Zawadi, the obligatory gift shop, provides some non-standard souvenirs for vacation goers and easy pick up for purchases from the park. Check-in to our Arusha View room was smooth, with a quick luggage delivery to our room. The room itself, a bunk bed set up, was very clean and had a wonderful view of the savannah. We were able to see antelope, giraffe, zebra, and various types of birds during our stay. I do wish that Disney would provide free WiFi in their guest rooms though, since its a standard in many cheaper hotels these days. Unfortunately, we did not have much of an opportunity to sample any of the more upscale restaurants on the property. However, if you want a decent value, I suggest going to the Mara for a quick bite to eat. Its easily accessible to the pool. ((Hint: If staying for a week, invest in one those 14 dollar travel mugs that are offered. Its well worth it for the stay.) The pool was very clean and there was plenty to do for both parents and kids. Daily activities like water basketball and a mini water slide were available for the young one's and the pool side bar the hot tub are there for the parents. If you're a person who enjoys getting a bit of exercise each day, don't worry, the Lodge has you covered! The fitness room alongside the pool is very clean and has a variety of machines to use. Whether you want to work on cardio or weight training, there is something for the exercise buff to do. However, due to the security lock being in disuse, you will need to hand your room key over to the attendant. Not a big deal though. Finally, as with any other Disney resort, take advantage of the buses! The bus station is just a short walk from the front entrance of Jambo House and the drivers tend to stay on schedule fairly well.

It was by far the worst Disney trip I have taken and my family goes every year! Let me first start by saying, the lobby at Jumbo house and the animals were gorgeous!!! Aside from that, everything else was terrible and sub-par quality. The pool bar closes at 8 pm so you can forget having a drink by the pool after being in the parks all day. (Carribean Beach's pool bar is open until at least 1am....not that we are alcoholics, but it IS vacation!) Mara, the counter service restaurant, has TERRIBLE food that they try to pass off as \"african\" when really, it is just pillsbury dough with some cheese tossed on for a \"flat bread.\" It was all very greasy. And the fact that the lamps at this eatery are PHALLICALLY shaped was not lost on my teens!! SHAME on you Disney!!! The pool was dirty and the hot tub too secluded to feel safe after 9 pm. The lounge actually spiked my drink with habanero pepper (to which I am allergic) without asking and I was sick for 2 days. The Disney Vacation Club was so heavily promoted at this property that my teens (who have never cared about that sort of thing) wanted to know why we didn't have the \"special\" rooms like some of the other guest to which I finally had to explain what suckers those other guest were because they had purchased a time share! So, if you want to have your children think that the 500+/night you are shelling out is peanuts....by all means, stay at this hotel and eat the cheap, greasy food without a drink at the pool, dirty rooms, and non existant customer service...Don't say you were never warned!

There were other anmals we couldn't identify, but at checkin we were given a list with pictures so that we could identify the animals from our room. It was SO cool. There was also an overlook at the hotel with a guide that would tell you about the animals if you asked. They even had nightvision goggles! The buses to the parks were available right at the hotel. We did really hit up the pool as it rained for our whole trip. On my husband's birthday, he was given a pin that said it was his birthday & I got an \"I'm celebrating\" pin. All day staff everywhere wished my husband a happy birthday. It was really nice. Some rides even moved us up in the line because of the birthday pins! We only ate at one restaurant in the hotel ( I don't remember the name, but it was right next to the pool.)

I would have my coffee in the morning and just marvel over the beautiful lobby. Everything was immaculate. That was the best part of the trip. I didn't find fault with the bus service. When going to Disney, you have to expect to wait. I didn't feel that the hotel was that far like other people mentioned. I was a little disenchanted with check in. We arrived around 11:00 and were told that they'd put a rush on our room. We waited about 3 1/2 hours for the room to be ready. I understand we were early but don't tell us that there was a rush when clearly there wasn't. The room, while very clean, was very small. There was only 2 drawers which did not accommodate a family of 4. I had to leave my clothing in the suitcase for the duration of the trip. For an expensive hotel, I found the room to be borderline motel-ish. We also did not get housekeeping one day and on another my 15 year old son called the front desk for housekeeping. The Mara was okay. There wasn't much of a variety especially for breakfast. The smells coming from the Boma for the breakfast buffet were very enticing but it was too pricey to spend over $100 for a breakfast. We did eat in the Boma for dinner. That was so-so...also pricey. We were on the Disney plan and I highly recommend doing that. The gym was okay too. Clean. What I found very weird was that they had the smoking section right in front of the gym! So after a good workout, I was rewarded with a big inhale of smoke upon leaving the gym!! Another disappointment is just a Disney thing...the prices for drinks were out of control!! I don't drink a lot but on vacation I do like to have a cocktail or two. My husband and I spent $40 in 10 minutes having a couple of drinks!!! That's kind of insane. But I know that's a \"rip people off on vacation thing\"! This was my 4th trip to Disney. I didn't hate Animal Kingdom but I didn't love it.

Upon arrival is was pouring buckets! They helped us empty the car and took our items up to our room for us which worked out great. We even got them to help us when we checked out. We had a one bedroom Condo.. In the living room there is a pull out couch and a chair, this Condo has just one bathroom. The 'bowl' is in a separate room but its still in the bathroom. Which means someone cant use the 'bowl' if there is someone in the shower. I would have thought that a 1 bedroom suite would have had two bathrooms - as a two bedroom has 3 bathrooms. There is a full kitchen which works great for keep costs down and having meals in the room instead of outside at the parks. And a separate bedroom with a queen bed, which is not a master bedroom. There is a washer and dryer which helps too. The bathroom has a double sink and a jacuzzi tub and its a little difficult to get into because it is pretty high, so one may have to sit on the side and throw your leg over. The bedroom and Living room has their own TVs and access to the outside deck. We had a pool view but you really couldn't tell since there are these rather large trees blocking the view of the pool. There is internet access, Free for DVC members but a fee for everyone else. We are amazed a how the sliding glass doors keep the sounds out of the rooms! At night they have been having a movie at the pool side and its pretty loud with the doors open but once they are closed its pretty quiet! You cant even hear anyone walking down the halls. I am impressed with that. The Jambo house itself its rather large. The buildings have 5 floors and a few 'wings', there is a large store at the main level and a lot of activities daily. Parking is a little far of a walk in Jambo house, when we were in Kidani Village the parking was below the building so its just an elevator ride down. This parking area is across the main entrance and down a little ways and no coverage from the sun. As DVC members they offer a towel exchange once every 3 days and a clean every 4 days. Without the DVC membership it would cost a lot more. It happens the week we stayed we never got a 'full clean' just a towel exchange. Kinda strange. We happened to have some dirty dishes and spoke with the front desk, they changed the dishes immediately for us. Of course everything is decked out in Animal Motif.

Our room was cleaned up every day and coffee was refilled daily. We bought the Disney refillable cup which was $15, but worth it because you can refill it for free any time during your stay. Saves buying expensive drinks. Not much food selection at the Mara which is where we ate a couple of times. Did not eat at the buffet, too expensive as we did not have the dining plan. we liked this resort because it wasn't too big and everything was in close walking distance. Not too far to the bus stop and the gift shop, which was very nice. Buses ran pretty good, not more than 15 or 20 minute wait, sometimes even less.

But the best thing about the hotel was the view from the balcony. A bit of African safari, right here in Florida. The hotel is so great, you almost don't want to leave to go to the parks. My only complaint is the cost. Like all of Disney, the cost just keeps rising, and the rooms are getting priced out of affordabilty for most people. The rooms have gone up in price since we stayed there, so I do not know if we will be back anytime soon. Also, if staying there, do not fall for the line that the bellhops tell you about the animals being best viewed in the middle of the night. We fell for it the first night and all got up at 1:00 am to see them, only to discover that the animals are put up at night, so no animals. Score one for the help, and zero for the tourists.

The Mara was a good QS the menus was mostly the same as you would find elsewhere. The pool is probably one of the best in Disney and easily accessible from most of the resort. As far as the buses we never has to wait very long for a bus and the ride times were 20mins to EPCOT area and 30-35 for MK. Return trips are always longer as all park buses stop at Kidani Village first (try to plan accordingly when choosing your seat.)

There was a water issue in our room which caused the rug to become wet and resulted in a somewhat musty smell. When management was informed, they sent maintenance to the room with a dehumidifier . Management never addressed the issue that some of our luggage and clothes were drenched and the fact that the room still had the smell of a musty basement. At the prices they charge, I was not happy with the situtation and do not feel management did enough to rectify the situation. 2. On a nightly basis, a movie is shown at the pool which is very crowded with many children . During this time, a father and son felt is was appropriate to have a long toss football catch in the pool. The distance of this catch probably was the distance of 30-40% of the width of the pool. On several occasions, one of the recipients would miss there intended target and the ball would hit someone or splash someone. I witnessed 2 small children get hit. If the child was hit in the face, a broken nose would have resulted. After the ball almost hit my young daughter while she was watching the movie, I confronted the participants.

We stayed in a moderate last year and it was as good as this one at half the price! I think it is more about \"name\" than anything else. Parks were super close because we would drive oursleves.

Back to the hotel... well, the showers at pools bathrooms were even better than those in the rooms! Loved them! lol Beds were comfortable, but I must admit that I had to call room service to switch both blankets (the one between sheets & comforter) because it had hair. Not one hair, many hairs! The room also had a strong cleaning chemical smell. I didn't ask to be switched because my 6yr old was already asleep and it would've been an ordeal for us.

From the decor to the staff to the restaruants to the rooms - everything was just great, clean, and polished. We also very much appreciated the fridge in our room as keeping drinks cool are a must for us. While staying here we also did the Wanyama Safari that is only available to guests staying at the Lodge (will write a review on that later), and we really enjoyed that opportunity. We also thoroughly enjoyed our room (with a pool view) and we took advantage of the chance to watch the animals during the night with night vision binoculars. Our decision to get a room w/ a pool view was simply based on affordability. We kind of looked at it like a cruise ship - you can pay the extra to get a balcony; however with all of the rocking chairs and venues available around the property, why spend the money on the room with a view of the savannah if you're not in there often enough to enjoy it? I know some people have complaints about the time it takes to get from AKL to the parks (w/ the exception of AK of course), but we really didn't have an issue. True, there was one morning that MK opened up and the attendant stationed by the bus stop didn't really keep up with getting buses there with the amount of people showing up. But overall no issues. The restaurants (even Mara) are wonderful, and we ate at all of them. True, most of them can be pricey - but that's one of the things about going to Disney! You get to try all sorts of things you would never get to try at home. One more thing - we love the towel animals you normally get from Mousekeeping. We only received one when we arrived.

The hotel was lovely - the decor was fantastically themed, and everything else was as you'd expect from a hotel with this rating. The stay wasn't totally trouble free, however! About a week before we travelled, I rang the hotel to check that my request for a room with bunk beds, which I'd made with Virgin, had been noted. It hadn't, so the very helpful lady in Customer Relations I spoke to assured me that we would have a family room with bunk beds. On arrival, we were taken to a beautifully appointed room with a fantastic savannah view (which we'd booked) with - you're guessed it - two queen size beds! One complaining telephone call and about hour later, we were moved to another equally lovely room, WITH bunk beds! Result! The restaurants were excellent. Boma was fantastic - there was something even for the fussiest eater, though for dinner I'd recommend making a reservation. The breakfast buffet there was brilliant - try the jungle juice, it was delicious. Even the fast food restaurant, the Mara, was a step up from other fast food restaurants in Disney hotels. They've adopted the system that operates in many of the theme park restaurants - you order your food, and receive a buzzy machine that vibrates and makes a noise when your order is ready. It's much a better system because your food is hot when it arrives, and some people aren't eating whilst others are waiting for theirs. Not sure if that system is operating on all the other Disney hotels - if it isn't, it should be! The view of the animals (whether from the rooms or from the viewing areas) is a bonus, and my husband and I would have been more than pleased to sit with a glass of wine and just watch them wandering past the balcony, but our girls, of course, had other ideas! We had a lovely stay, and we were genuinely sad to leave at the end of the two weeks.

The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Uzima Springs Pool Bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was nice my eldest daughter tried a different cocktail every night but I think it closed a bit too early but never mind the Mara stayed open later!. There is a gymnasium which once we found we managed to avoid during our entire stay! You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend money on a holiday to go to a gym. The swimming pool was very welcoming after a hard sweltering day in the parks, there were three (sometimes four) life guards on duty so I felt happy my daughter was safe even if I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see her. There is a towel station where you can collect clean towels (no more taking them from the room to the pool) and child floatation vests. The pool is very popular especially later in the evening but as it gets cooler at about 10pm the spa pool is much warmer\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 met many great people especially the day before we flew back.

It was wonderful that there was so much to keep everyone entertained at the hotel. The Parks are wonderful as always but it was nice to have a hotel were we could just relax. They have activities that the kids can enjoy and not have to get to all of the parks. We took advantage of the pottery painting activity and the kids loved it. Several nights, my wife and I, sat on their patios and watched the animals walking around. Also for the big kid in you several of us went to the Arcade rooms which were loaded with top end games, so even in the rain we were entertained. We went to all of the dining facilities there and around disney, as part of the dining plan, but the quick service spot, the Mara, had everything we needed in the morning or afternoon and we found ourselves there often. What a great place to stay and it may be the only Disney Hotel I go back to, if I can get in, great for people who like animals and the theme.

Only cautions: (1) be careful when you are getting off the bus that you are at the Lodge and not at the Villas because the stops are not announced and it is a bit of a pain to get back to the Lodge once you get off (they stop at the Villas before the Lodge) and (2) in the evening it's a bit tough to find things one might need, i.e. medicine, so I suppose the best thing is to bring everything you might possibly need if you're not planning on renting a car and we were not, (3) the Tusker House character breakfast is in the AK Park not at the Lodge :(", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cWe Love Animal Kingdom Lodge\u201d", "Author": "cara1024", "ReviewID": "UR115005619", "Content": "My family and I stayed here from March 3rd to March 9th this year. It was our second visit to this beautiful resort and we loved as much as the first time. We arrived at the hotel at 11 am and having done on line check in our room was ready with an upgrade to a Savannah View! It is a large hotel but no where near as bad as what some folks are writing here. Our room was at the end of Kudu Trail (room 4394) and it's nowhere near a half mile from the lobby. As a runner I am a pretty good judge of distance in quarter mile increments and it would be a stretch to say it was even that far. The rooms here are not huge but that's true of all Disney Resorts for the most part. They are comfortable and clean though. Mousekeeping does a great job, we left them a tip every morning. The pool at AKL is great too with a small water slide and a good sized hot tub set back out of the way of the crowds. It was a bit chilly when we were there but the pools are heated so we did get to swim a little. We ate at The Mara (counter service) a handful of times and enjoyed it. We didn't go to Boma this time but have been there twice in the past and as far as buffets go it's good. They have a dessert called Zebra Domes (which you can also get at the Mara) that are so delicious. The bar, Victoria Falls, is gorgeous and a great place to have a drink in the evening. We had no problems with buses the week we were there. The resort does feel out of the way but the longest ride is to the Magic Kingdom and it takes 18 minutes (I timed it twice) so it's not as remote as it seems. And talk about convenient to Animal Kingdom! That's about a 3 minute ride! I wish they would build a walkway like the one between the Epcot resorts, Hollywood Studios and Epcot itself. Maybe one day.

We stayed in a 1 bedroom villa. There were five of us and we fit comfortably. It had one bathroom. We reserved a standard view room and actually had a view of the animals. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if all of the Jambo villas have animal view. I think we saw 8 different species at one time. Our favorite animals were the giraffes. When we first got there it seemed like a long walk to the room but we got used to it and actually enjoyed the different views of the animals on the way to and from the lobby. Jambo Villas have a large pool. I think the pool is open all of the time but there are at least three lifeguards on duty between 10 AM and 10 PM. The lifeguards not on duty played with the children with several activities (water basketball, water guns, etc.) at certain times of the day. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the pool is over 5 feet deep and it has a slide. Good: Very clean 1 bedroom was enough room for 5 people. We paid for standard view and had a view of the animals. Jambo Villas have a large zero-depth entry pool. Very nice staff. Unless it is very crowded you can see your child while they are in the pool if you are sitting in the chairs along the edge. The king size bed was comfortable. Bad: The pullout beds were a little harder than I expected. The heated pool was a little too warm. One time the lifeguard posting for the day indicated the water was 86 F. The Jacuzzi tub doubled as a shower which made the sides high. High sides can be harder to get in and out of for an elderly person. Tips: Use the pre-arrival online check in. Many times your room will be ready when you arrive even if it is earlier than check in time. If you plan to use the pool ask the staff for the quickest route. We would have gone through the lobby every time not realizing a set of elevators close by would get us to the pool quicker had the bellman not told us. Check the schedule for events for children in the lobby. My child participated in a little parade where each child was given drum and they played and marched around the lobby with a staff member from Africa.

There is something about flying all day and then driving up, being greeted with \"Welcome Home!\" from the staff, and then stepping foot in the grandeur lobby listening to African Music and smelling spices from the restaurant below. I know that the AKL is a bit off from the rest of Disney parks, but really it's not that long of a drive. The longest drive we had was 15 minutes to Downtown Disney on the bus-- everything else is about 10 minutes or less. I have stayed in studio, 1 & 2 bedroom rooms here, and each one is unique and has full services to offer guests, including views of the animals and savannah from the balconies. It's incredibly refreshing to wake up with a cup of coffee in the mornings and see giraffes running around outside your room before you prepare to spend the day at the parks. These kinds of experiences are what Disney magic is all about. If you have a 1 - 2 bedroom villa and have your own rental car, there is a handy Winn-Dixie about 10 minutes away, as well as a Publix about the same distance in a different direction where you can fill up your kitchen with groceries. I'd advise against Disney's grocery stores because a) the selection is quite minimal and b) it's incredibly overpriced. My family and I ate breakfasts and dinners back in the room and it made the food on the trip much more affordable. The rooms are spacious and incredibly clean-- you would never know it's a nearly 10 year old hotel! All of the staff members are friendly; the Victoria Falls bar is beautiful and the pool is open 24 hours which was a blast in the evenings when it wasn't so crowded. I have never ate at Boma, Jiko or Sanaa, because in my mind they are too overpriced for what you get. However, for those who have splurged, I've heard that it's delicious. You can't go wrong if you can afford to eat at those restaurants. :) My husband's and my favorite thing to do was to walk out into the middle of the savannah at sunset, have a glass of wine, relax in the rocking chairs and watch the animals play at nightfall-- zebras, giraffes, okapis, ostriches, etc. It was incredibly magical and we felt so lucky to have shared those experiences.

Having never been to Disney before, I was very excited. Here is the breakdown: Lobby : Awesome! Breathtaking welcome. Plenty of seating for when you are waiting for others, TV's built into the furniture - which you wouldn't notice right away. Big open space, high high ceiling, intricate detail... good start. Rooms: We stayed in one of the Vacation Club suites which held all 12 of us comfortably. With 3 bedrooms, four bathrooms, a full swanky kitchen equipped with all the necessities. It also boasted 3 large balconies (which you could only use for a few minutes at a time because of the giant wasps who have made their home there as well) There was a pool table and an impressive solid wood dining table that comfortably sat everyone at once. Food: Meh. Really that sums it up. On our first night we all tried something different I had the double chicken dinner (counter service at The Mara). It was really just edible. Pool: Beautiful! Good Size. You never felt like there wasn't room. While it could take a minute to find a lounge chair - you will find one. There's a bar right beside the pool - so if you want to hang out, watch the game, catch a drink.. you can. The drinks however are - i guess what you'd expect from Disney - EXPENSIVE. For a whopping $10 i got a pina colada - which i can not guarantee even had alcohol in it. Extras: I don't have any children but other aspects of the Resort that I checked out were the Simba's Room (looked like a play room for kids - daycare maybe?) Arcade, and at the pool a nice big slide (which I did try a few times!) Customer Service: Ok now for the part the really disappointed me... Customer Service. I come from a customer service centric business to begin with... so my standards are already up there. Then you think Disney... Customer Service Leaders in the industry. Rumor had it - you couldn't find a miserable employee.... Well to set the record straight... I found them. At the Jambo House, Animal Kingdom Lodge. Quick Summary: It begins with our very first stop - check in. We waited in line.... and waited... and waited... while other people all around us(in other lines ie Consierge) were serviced and we were ignored. Hmmm. interesting I thought. We physically moved our selves and luggage to another line (not designated to check in) so we could get some service. Consierge. Multilple frustrations with these folks. First... very short... and unfriendly. The funny thing is every time you go up to the counter they say \"Welcome Home\" have you ever heard the expression \"it's not what you say it's how you say it\" ? Their tone , coupled with their board expression said \"i'm saying this because I have to\". Anyway - to keep this short I had to visit these folks four times because I kept getting the runaround. I've never been told \"We can't do that\" or \"who told you that\" or \"if that's what tickets told you go see them\". No ownership and certainly no desire to actually help. We wanted to make dinner reservations at a restaurant in epcot where you could see the fireworks... we were given Bistro De Paris (great food) but absolutely NO view of the fireworks. We had to leave our dinners and the restaurant to go see the fireworks and then return. This would be ok... if the expectation wasn't already set for \"the best seat in the house\".

The lobby was beautiful and full of ambiance. The restaurant was very good (didn't try the buffet) but pricey. The casual poolside restaurant was great for breakfast. The line for the buffet was ridiculous - so we skipped it. The night time movie poolside was fun - though tough to really see the screen.

The bathroom was miniscule. My youngest complained about the bed quality, something she's never done, happily sleeping on pull out couches at other hotels.

The concierge level also gave us access to the concierge who would plan our stay for us before we arrived. This service was excellent and I cannot speak highly enough of the concierge service. Check in was not the smoothest, whilst the cast member was very friendly she could not find our reservation for quite some time and did not tell us we needed to prepay the entire bill on arrival.

Finally on the third occasion it was fixed. We also got a recorded voicemail message on a couple of nights telling us that we were checking out tomorrow morning and that we could use express check out. This was always met with a 'sorry it is just a mistake' response from reception when we called them to say we were not checking out, but it was just annoying little things like this that made our holiday less relaxing.

The Loddy is huge and it just feels very comfortable. I arrived at 1pm and I'm able to check in right away. I loved this hotel very much because this hotel is very speical. It is surrounded by trees and there's a lot of animals to see from your hotel room. The animals mostly come out at night because of the hot weather. The only problem is the room might be a little smaller than other hotels, but I only have two people so it really doesnt bother me much. The bus also takes longer to travel to magic kingdom and epcot (20 minutes), because they're pretty far away from each other. However, travelling to animal kingdom only takes you about 10 minutes.

The travelling isnt that bad because it has its own bus, so you dont have to share the bus with other resorts. My girlfriend did found a roach in the bathroom though, I think that it somehow crawled from the animal side into our room. I just flushed it into the toliet so it wasnt such a big deal. I personally think that it is a great hotel. I like the theme, the staff and the environment. But I'm sure not everybody like what I like. If an extra travelling time or a smaller room is going to be a huge issue for you, you might not like this hotel as much as i do.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cProbably would not so it again\u201d", "Author": "travelingmomofone", "ReviewID": "UR113695474", "Content": "Just got back last night from a week at AKL Jambo house. 3 years ago we went and stayed at Pop Century and think I liked it better.

We used the Online Check in system ten days before our arrival and it made our check in process extremely easy. It took us five minutes max to check in at the resort when we arrived. The only issue we had was with our room type. We had called the resort several months prior to our trip to request a king bed, this request was shown on our online reservation confirmation too. When we got to our room we had two queen beds instead. We called the front desk but there were no king rooms available \u00e2\u20ac\u201c definitely frustrating since we had requested this so far in advance. We had a savanna view room which was well worth the extra money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c being able to see giraffes and other animals from your window is amazing! Everyone seems to ask if the resort smells like animals...it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t! They have a fire pit in the lobby so it smells like this African incense. The hotel is very large so be prepared to walk a ways to get to your room. The hotel itself is very clean and the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is awesome. We spent our down time at the pool; there are always plenty of chairs no matter what time you get there. Its open 24/7 so take advantage of a relaxing night swim! There is a pool bar with the best fruity drinks; my fave was the pina colaVa. There are also two hot tubs which were nice. The restaurants are all very good (We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try Jiko but it looked good) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the breakfast buffet at Boma was really good too. It had a good mix of traditional breakfast food and African styled food as well. We ordered room service and it was great every time. We took the bus over to Kidani Village to eat at Sanaa. This restaurant was AMAZING \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was our favorite of the whole trip, definitely go here if you can! The only complaint I have about this resort is the buses!!! AKL is pretty far away from everything (except Animal Kingdom Park) and the bus rides take a long time. We expected the bus rides to take a while but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to wait so long for a bus to even show up at the bus stop! Some nights we waited at least thirty minutes for the bus and by that time not everyone could fit on the bus because it was full (We took a taxi at this point) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c If we were to stay at AKL again we would definitely rent a car and save ourselves time and aggravation. Parking is free at all Disney Parks and the Resort for guests staying on Disney property. Renting a car is easy enough, Alamo picks you up and drops you off at your resort. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the bus situation deter you from staying at AKL \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We loved the resort!

Don't stay here if you are planning on spending the entire day/evening at the theme parks, and are only going to come here to sleep. If you do that, you might as well stay off-property, or stay at a cheaper Disney resort, or at least a better-located Disney one. However, if you decide to spend some time at the AKL, you will be rewarded with more of an immersion experience. Beyond viewing the animals (which are nifty and all), the AKL provides you with the opportunity to talk with people from Africa, which you can do during organized activities. We participated in 3 of them - face painting, animal tracking and cookie decorating. We also chatted with the animal expert at the Kidani overlook and at the Arusha overlook. There are also beautiful African artifacts, displayed in museum-quality cases throughout the resort. The dining options onsite - Boma, Sanaa and Jiko - are all interesting and beautifully decorated. We had breakfast at Boma twice, and one dinner at each Sanaa and Jiko. None of them disappointed, and Sanaa and Jiko were two of the best restaurants we have ever experienced at WDW. The pools at AKL and at its sister resort Kidani were OK. Kidani had a nice water splash area for little kids, but the pool itself seemed small. The pool area at AKL had plenty of shade. Somehow, the pools paled in comparison with the rest of the inetersting people and things to do at this resort. We booked a bunk bed Savannah room. The room seemed small - the bunk beds could have been placed next to the wall, but they were about a foot or two from the wall and very close to the Queen-size bed. I would have liked a little bit more space between us and the kids. :-) We were able to see many different animals from our balcony, but we did spend a lot of time looking for them. We get up early and spent a good portion of time during 3 afternoons out in the balcony. If you don't spend a lot of time on the balcony, you will not see many animals. They come by, graze a bit and move on. Also, we did not see the giraffes until our 4th day. If we would have stayed only 3 days we would have completely missed them. I would also have been dissappointed if I expected to sit in my balcony one morning with my coffee and see zebras, giraffes, etc. The animals do come, but you may need to sit out there for a bit and they don't all come by every day. One comment that I read here, which is absolutely true is that, perhaps due to the sheer number of balconies and their proximity (remember, the rooms are not very wide), you will hear your neighbors out on the balcony. You will hear little kids, toddler-talking toys (think Leapfrog), people on cell phones, etc. If I would have expected an experience of just me and the savannah, I would have been disappointed. But this is Disney, and there are a lot of people everywhere, all the time, and this is no different. Just make sure your expectations are correctly set, and you will love it. All in all, despite the small rooms and the \"balcony-chatter\", the AKL seemed very special. It is unique, it has interesting activities throughout the day (you will get a list of activities in your check-in packet), the resort itself is gorgeous with many unique details, and the restaurant options are nothing short of fantastic.

It was a great experience for our first-ever trip to WDW (2 parents and 1 teen). However, it wasn't without its faults. None were severe, but we'll likely stay somewhere else next time, for variety's sake, and to save money. Service was very fine. We appreciated the attentiveness and professionalism. However, I'm not sure our check-in cast member understood the dining plan very well, because she couldn't explain it to us very clearly. I'd appreciate having a better knowledge of it, overall - not just a AKL issue, clearly. The pool was clean and large. I'd prefer a little more \"deep end\" in it, but that's hardly a reason to complain. I did notice gravelly silt on the bottom of one of the hot tubs - we had to do a search-mission to find it. We had \"coupons\" for the arcade but had no idea how to redeem them. I was underwhelmed by the Savannah View room. It's OK though, because it was a free upgrade from a Pool View room, due to their ENTIRE Disney customer system being down when we arrived at 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday. They couldn't check us in, so we had temporary tickets all day and had to pay for food \"manually\" (and get it reimbursed later). Disney took care of us, but there was some extra effort and frustration involved. The buses took FOREVER to get to AKL. I suppose this is due to its location. My advice: if you see a bus at AKL that's headed for your desired park, do whatever you have to do to catch it. It could be 30-40 minutes before you see another one. Run, flag it down, whistle, whatever. This goes for return trips to AKL from the parks, too. Some friends built up Boma as the best place to eat in all of WDW. We saved it for our last evening at WDW, and all three of us were severely underwhelmed. I've had better hotel buffets in resorts in 3rd world countries. As much as we paid for WDW and their dining plan, I truly had higher expectations. The service was delightful. Our less-than-satisfaction was strictly from the food. We're taking this up with our friends, btw. I wish AKL, or WDW in general, did more for first-timers. We'll certainly go back, because the WDW experience is one-of-a-kind. However, we'll be better armed and educated. MAKE DINNER RESERVATIONS 2 MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF YOUR ARRIVAL. The other item I'll mention has nothing to do with AKL and refers more to a factor of WDW overall. You will run into some of the rudest, most inconsiderate people in the world who are guests of WDW. They'll run their strollers over you and into you, and they won't care. They'll push to get ahead of you in line, and they won't look back. More than the heat, more than the miles of walking each day, more than the waiting for buses, and more than the frustrations with not knowing some key details about WDW (as first-timers), the rude guests were my biggest complaint. I don't suppose there's anything WDW can do about it. The presence of these folks wasn't a huge surprise.

Our check-in was okay, although we were told that they weren't sure if our room was quite ready which wasn't what we wanted to hear after 20 hours of traveling. It got sorted and we went off to our room. We noticed that we had been placed quite a long way from the rest of our party, and as I had made both the bookings myself, I was a bit confused as to why this happened. The room was beautiful, but the view wasn't great at all. We could see the car park from our balcony. I didn't pay for a savannah-view room but had expected a more \"natural\" view than the one we had. So I called the other people in the party who informed me that they could see gazelle from their balcony. I was more than a little upset about this. I'm a Disney veteran and have visited at least 15 times, whereas it was the first visit for other members in the party. I couldn't understand why they had been given a superior room when I had made both bookings myself. I went downstairs to see if there was another room available closer to the rest of our party but they weren't able to accommodate us until the following evening. That was fine by us, so long as we couldn't see & hear the carpark, great. Once we had moved, I was much happier! Fantastic views of zebras, giraffes, guineafowl, cranes and gazelle (see photos). The beds in the rooms are so comfortable - guaranteed to have a great sleep after a busy day at the parks. The mini-fridge comes in handy too. We had the Disney Dining plan for our stay which was great! We didn't eat in the hotel much because I had already prebooked character dining experiences at theme parks & other resorts. We ate one meal in the Mara restaurant which is a quick service style place and also where you refill your resort mugs. There's always plenty of activities going on at the hotel both for adults and children. There's a children's club available and lots of activities going on around the pool everyday. One of my favourite activities was at the Uzima outlook at nighttime where you can use night vision goggles to see the animals on the savannah! The pool area is lovely but I wish there were more shaded areas to sit as these get taken up very early on in the day. The gift shop at the hotel is wonderful!! Lots of African-themed products along with Disney merchandise.

While it was great to stay on Disney property, I wasn't sure if it was worth what we'd paid that time around.

We had a bunk bed pool view room and it couldn't have been better. I decided to pass on the savannah view based on some of the reviews, plus we knew we could see animals if we really wanted to. Having them in view from our room wasn't a priority. The location turned out to be absolutely perfect. Took less than 2 minutes to get to the pool and outside to the bus waiting area. We discovered that if you just hopped down 5 quick steps in the stairwell, there was a door that led right out to that area. We rarely used the elevator to get anywhere. The room itself was very tastefully decorated, clean, and larger than what I was expecting. The only minor complaints I have are that the bed squeaked every time you moved. With me being a light sleeper, that made for not quite peaceful sleep. Also, every morning at around 6 am, I was awoken by, and could clearly hear the toilets flushing from adjacent rooms. Also, the a/c didn't seem to cool the room enough at night. But I was thrilled that it had a ceiling fan! I've always had trouble sleeping in hotel rooms because I'm so used to sleeping with one. The wait for the buses was tolerable, but why does it seem that no matter what park you're going to, that stop is the only one with a crowd??? The buses did get crowded and was standing room only at times. Ok, a little OT rant here, but chivalry appears to be dead, at least at Disney. I thought it was pathetic that there were women and children standing, meanwhile several able-bodied, seemingly healthy men sat in their seats and watched them hanging onto the rails, stumbling and trying to keep their balance during the ride. You may not want to give up your seat, but it's polite to at least offer. My husband gave up his seat each time to a woman, especially if she was holding a small child. I was actually bummed to check out 3 nights into our trip. Our other hotel was fine, but I missed the ambience of the AKL. The only sour note of our experience here would be that when we checked in, we were told that we'd been upgraded to a savannah view. While I understand, this may be considered an upgrade, I didn't like it at all. I specifically reserved a pool view because I like a pool view. Turns out they were short on pool view rooms and tried to stick us in a sunset savannah view room, which was a downgrade in my opinion. That room was not what I wanted. It looked like a view of dirt and was quite a walk from everything. I went back and told them that I really just wanted the room I'd reserved. We had to wait at the desk for 30 minutes while she went in the back to get us into a pool view room. Not a great way to start the vacation, but we got over it.

We had stayed at this resort once before when it first opened and really enjoyed it. This time, we were going for the gusto with a club level, savannah view room and reservations for the Sunrise Safari. Arrival: We arrived around 9:00 p.m. and noticed that we weren't greeted by a cast member immediately and checked in privately which is the practice at the Grand Floridian when one stays club level. Later on we were told that this is only available for guests arriving until mid-afternoon. We waited on line to get our keys and a lot of confusion ensued. The cast member who helped us was very sweet and full of energy, but not so clear on our needs. She was very excited to make DH a birthday button with his name on it. Then, she gave us our room keys and then told us we would have to get new gold keys in the club lounge. The club lounge closed at 9:30, so we had to get our keys the next morning. I had ordered a special birthday hat delivered to the room through the itinerary planning office, but when I asked about it, no one had heard of it, although there had been lengthy email exchange prior to our visit to confirm that the hat would be there and I had authorized charges on my credit card. Luckily, the charge had not gone through and I wound up buying a different, better hat for my husband in the gift shop. Public spaces: The lobby of the AKL is truly breathtaking. The designers put a great deal of care into respecting the African design influence without making it kitschy. There is so much to look at and so many interesting African artifacts that it is like a museum. The use of dark woods and colorful prints is lovely and, although the lobby is similar in structure to the Wilderness Lodge, it seems to have much more light. There are also interesting touches such as a bridge to cross in the lobby. Keep an eye out for hidden Mickeys! Once you leave the lobby, there are multiple animal viewing spots inside and outside, such as Arusha Rock Overlook. The landscaping is beautiful and evokes a sense of the jungle without seeming untamed.We love the pool area with its zero entry area and fun water slide. The whole area around the pool has a terrifically relaxing atmosphere. It wasn't at all crowded during our visit. Guest rooms: The room was really fun with dark woods and brightly colored, African print bedspreads. It would be nice if Disney resorts would enter the 21st century and add some duvets and comforters, but the bedspreads are usually part of the theming. We had a good view of the savannah from our balcony, but it seemed not to have as many animals as we remembered. The room was a good size, though perhaps not as large as the rooms at the Grand Floridian or the Polynesian. Because we were celebrating a 50th birthday, we received gifts and a birthday cake. Because we had cancelled our August anniversary trip when I broke my foot, the AKL staff had also left us anniversary gifts and anniversary buttons to wear in the parks. Club Lounge: The club lounge is on a different floor from the club level rooms. It offers a breakfast that is slightly more than continental, yet not generous enough to be called full, snacks such as hummus around lunch time, and appetizers before dinner. We didn't really make use of the club services so much, except for tasks like printing out our boarding passes. Also, you have to be a club level guest to take the Sunrise Safari tour, so all safari participants congregated in the club lounge in the very early morning before taking the tour. Sunrise Safari: The Sunrise Safari at the Animal Kingdom Theme Park is only available to club level guests and it is not inexpensive, but it is really worth it. DH loves photography and the photos he was able to take with the new camera he received for his birthday were excellent. After the safari, you have a very good buffet breakfast at Pizza-fari in the Animal Kingdom Park. Restaurants: We had dinner at Boma and Jiko and loved both. Boma is a buffet with a fair number of interesting African dishes and enough American cuisine to satisfy the non-adventurous eater. The service was very friendly and we had more than enough food to choose from. The roasted pork dish was very tasty and I would definitely recommend sampling the sweet potato pancakes. Leave room for the Zebra Domes at the dessert station. DH's birthday dinner was at Jiko and it was absolutely perfect. Our server was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The menu selection was great---sort of nouveau African cuisine. Definitely try the \"Taste of Africa\" appetizer. I had the shrimp curry with Durban curry sauce, DH had the short ribs and our son had the Filet Mignon. Our server brought a great chocolate mousse birthday cake for dessert. The atmosphere in Jiko is upscale and beautiful, but still very relaxed. We would definitely return to both restaurants. As for the counter service restaurant, Mara, we bought lunch there one day and it was very good and the salad greens were fresh. Convenience: I've read many reviews that complain about the distance to the Disney parks from AKL. Granted, it is not on the monorail and it is true that the bus rides can be long-ish. We rented a car. The one day we did take the bus back from the parks, we found that it took a long time and that the bus stopped at Kidani Village (Disney Vacation Club) before the lodge itself which tacked on a few more minutes. I would definitely recommend renting a car if you choose the AKL. Overall, the AKL is a wonderful property with great on-site dining options and many intriguing cultural touches. Let's not forget that you can sit on your balcony and watch zebras and giraffes which makes it a very special place indeed. We would definitely return to this resort.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding and Impeccable Service for Disney Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "tlcj02", "ReviewID": "UR111169631", "Content": "My husband and I enjoyed a weeklong honeymoon at Disney and we stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge (Jambo House). I would highly reccomend this resort to anyone and everyone! This was the best vacation we have ever taken, and we've traveled quite extensively -- staying everywhere from marriotts/holiday inns, to the drake, and even the ritz. I was apprehensive at first, as I was worried about the number of children staying here, but we actually saw a lot of couples staying here during our visit.

Even if a cast member looked busy they took the time to help us anyway. - Pool and 2 hot-tubs were always clean and open 24 hours - One hot tub was slightly secluded, so you don't have to be around kids 24/7 - Efficient housekeeping staff who left us cute Mickey Mouse towel creations - Small room refrigerator for our leftover deserts -Plethora of dining options on-site and at nearby parks/hotels - Free bus transportation to all of the parks - Balcony views of all the animals -- they have night vision goggles you can use in the evenings too -It's a non-smoking hotel -- there are only a few areas where the smokers can go -- which is a plus for me! -On-site gift shop with lots of souvenirs to choose from, as well as snacks... and did I mention beer and wine? :) What we liked least: - Further away from the Magic Kingdom then we would have liked (about 20 or 25 min bus ride), so we didn't take as many breaks during the day as we originally planned. - Limited late night dining options -Room bathrooms are small, so one person has to get ready at a time -- not a huge issue for 2 people, but could be improved. - No spa Overall, the upbeat attitude of everyone working at the resort really shined through and AKL's customer service really made our honeymoon trip magical.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Harbor, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLike Kidani Better, But AKL Good Too\u201d", "Author": "palmharbormichelle", "ReviewID": "UR111026512", "Content": "DVC member for 10 years. Had stayed at Kidani but this was first time at the Lodge. Stayed at both places in a studio. This trip we spent 2 nights in a Deluxe Studio w/Savannah View; spent the 3rd night in a Value Studio w/Pool View. The Deluxe was near the elevator on the 5th fl and the view of the animals was great. There seems to be a bigger rotation or more animals at the Lodge. At Kidani we saw the same animals from our balcony all day every day; at the Lodge the animals changed throughout the day. There was no noise problem being near the elevator. Both Lodge studios had a queen bed, pull-out sofa, and flat screen TV. Bathrooms were the same in both. The only real difference was the size of the closet/armoire, and there was a small desk in the Value instead of the round table that was in the Deluxe. Pool view was noisy on the balcony, but no pool noise could be heard inside. The lobby was much bigger at the Lodge, as well as the gift shop. There are more scheduled family activities at the Lodge than at Kidani. There are a lot more choices for dining here also. Food was fine the one time we ate quick-service poolside. The parking lot can be a hike to the lobby at the Lodge; Kidani has a covered parking garage with elevator. The pool at the Lodge is larger, but the slide is the same at both places. The Deluxe Studios at Kidani are bigger than at the Lodge, so if you need more room stay at Kidani. My largest complaint is that there was no hot water in our room on the second morning, and I have never had that happen at Disney. Otherwise we liked the Lodge, but would pick Kidani. Kidani has easier parking, a more laid-back feeling, and you don't have to walk through the lobby every time you want to go to your room. The Lodge has more of a hotel/resort feeling. If you are a DVC member and don't care about the Savannah View, go with the Value Studio if there are only 2 people.

We spent our full two week vacation in a low end room. The first week was a little disappointing as our view was only of the car park however for the second week i asked to upgrade which wasn't possible but they moved us to a room overlooking the savannah any way!!! This room was brilliant sitting down with a beer watching the animals in the evening was brilliant! So in summary below General Hotel: had a really lovely feel and much more like a hotel than the previous hotels we stayed in. There was always something to look at and seeing animals everywhere was brilliant. The general music and look was just really rice and very African. Rooms: a little but that is to be expected in disney hotels! Our fridge in our first room rattled a little. Beware some rooms are quite a walk to reception Transportation: Hotel is a little further out than most but we never found anywhere too far to go and found it a good location for nipping off sight to Walmart etc Food: the real highlight for us is Jiko, it is an incredible place to eat with fantastic tasting food that is really out of the ordinary. We ate twice here on our last trip and twice this trip but always wish we'd gone more!! Two DDP credits are a bargain! The quick service restaurant was excellent too with a much more inventive menu than most. Flat breads were excellent (posh pizzas!) Pool: lovely pool for adults only as well as children and is very much a place to relax or entertain the kids. The jacuzzis are a welcome addition!

We were lucky enough to stay in this beautiful resort!!! Have never seen a resort like it. Waking up to animals outside your balcony every morning was unbeatable! On top of that we only paid for a standard room but were lucky enough to have a room with a view of the animals. We spent a lot of time in our room because our little guy went for a nap in the afternoon and was in bed no later then 8. The room itself was a good size. We previously stayed at the polynesian and I personally think the room size is not much different except for the bathroom. Having the double sinks at the AKL was a very nice bonus!!! Also having the balcony was so nice. The beds were very comfortable! My mother in law had bunk beds in her room which is really cool if you have children and a nice bonus! The restaurants were good. Having Bomas only a few minutes away was nice because it is a buffet. If you are on the dinning plan it is so worth booking buffet meals! Mara was nice for a quick meal or snack and drink. The best thing you could do if you are staying at a disney resort is purchase some sort of dinning plan. I personally like the Deluxe plan but the regular one is pretty good too. The only problem I ran into was that I had to take our little guy out of his stroller when boarding the buses. The bus rides aren't that long but with a one year old I found it pretty difficult. The only way to get away from that would be to stay on the monorail and that can get pricey. Other then the stroller thing though we waited no longer then 10 mins for a bus and it took maybe 15- 20 mins to get to magic kingdom. Overall this resort is perfect!!!

But, I've never had a problem with over crowding or finding a lounge chair. I've stayed in this resort about 5 times. It makes up for it though with the wildlife. Food - YUM! While many people rave over the AYCE buffet, I wasn't too impressed. Though, that's probably because I ate at Boma first. Boma is one of the best restaurants on Disney and has the largest African wine selection outside of Africa. Rooms - pretty average Disney rooms. The bathrooms and balconies are very nice (especially if you have a Savannah view) but they are not as elegant as some of the other Deluxe resorts. Housekeeping is wonderful though. The rooms are always clean and comfortable and they often leave a towel-animal in your room. Value - as the cheapest deluxe resort, it is a wonderful value.

We live locally now, but wanted to do the Disney experience. When we vacationed at Disney previously, we've stayed at the Polynesian, Grand Floridian and Wilderness Lodge, and although Animal Kingdom Lodge is considered as a Disney \"Deluxe\" hotel, I personally would not consider it deluxe. Animal Kingdom Lodge is set up sort of like the number 3, with the rooms inside the 3 facing the savannah, the rooms on the outside of the 3 facing either parking area, or grassy areas. We were booked club level, so we automatically got a savannah view, with our room facing pelicans and at times giraffes. (see photos) The rooms were rather dark, however, the hotel's theme is Africa, nicknamed the Dark Continent, so it makes sense. Compared with the Polynesian and Grand Floridian, the rooms were smaller. A word of warning --- if you have mobility issues, ask for a room close to lobby, because of the way the hotel is set up you might have a hike to the lobby. My main beef was that although we were staying club level, our room was on the 4th floor, while the club lounge was on the 6th fl --- and the nearest elevator to our room did not go to the 6th fl, we had to traipse through the lobby to get from one set of elevators to another --- (note to Disney --- this is not a NY skyscraper or a large Las Vegas hotel, why make the elevators on one side of the building that don't go all the way up?) We didn't eat at the restaurants, just the first day ate at the quick service, The Mara. It was okay, but what annoyed me is that when we would return to the hotel for a quick snack at night, it closed at 11pm. At the Poly and GF, the quick service was available 24 hours a day. This is what I mean about not being up to deluxe standards. Another reason I say this, is that transportation is strictly via bus. At every other \"Deluxe\" resort, you have either the monorail or boat service. Animal Kingdom Lodge doesn't offer anything special as far as transportation. Housekeeping service was very good, with one exception. I left a tip for the housekeeper one morning and when we came back to the room around 12:30 that afternoon, the room was not cleaned, but the tip was gone. I reported this incident, not because I wanted the housekeeper in trouble because I know they clean rooms until at least 4pm, but my concern was that someone was in my room, who should or should not have been there. The housekeeping manager was more concerned that the maid didn't do her job --- which was not my reason for calling. I didn't want a third party taking the tip meant for the housekeeper. From now on, I will make it a point to personally hand the housekeeper her tip. Turndown service was excellent, and nice to return to the room after midnight, with the bed turned down and chocolates on the pillow. As far as the concierge lounge, every cast member we met were extremely friendly and helpful. The food offerings were great for breakfast, but nothing special for any other service. I'm a picky eater, so that weighs into my opinion, but at least at the Grand Floridian, I always found something that suited my palate. My recommendation would be that if you plan on spending a lot of time in your room to watch the animals, this hotel might be for you. However, since the AKL is located the furthest away from any Disney park except for the Animal Kingdom, you do have the longest bus ride, although I must say that we never waited to long for a bus.

Lots of spaces to see animals even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a Savannah view room, towels available at the pool free of charge, lots of lifeguards, nice slide, lots of chairs, several hot tubs, a wading pool, playground. The pool doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get deeper than about 4.5ft. Your room card is also your park ticket, on property \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credit card\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and meal plan voucher. Card was blanked several times for room entry and had to keep going back to reception. It worked great at the parks and for meals. If you buy items at the parks, they will deliver to your hotel. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to drag purchases through the park. Laundry self service near the pool. Meal Plan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We had a snack, a Quick Serve and a Table Serve each day for each person. A snack can be a muffin, a whole fruit, a smoothie, ice cream bar. A quick serve can be sandwiches, wrap, pizza, with a dessert and non-alcoholic drink. For kids, example, cheese pizza, milk, grapes and jello. You can buy mugs at the resort. They are good for unlimited hot and cold beverages at the resorts only. They are about $15 each. We used them to our full advantage, free coffee at the fountain instead of using a snack credit. Allears.net has the menus for the restaurants. Seem quite current with what we had. We ate at Mara, Boma, Tusker, Askershus, Cape May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all very good. Tips are not included. Parks get crowded even now. Some lines are quite fast, some not so much. Use fastpass when you can. As a resort guest you get to go a little earlier and stay a little later beyond opening and closing hours. Use the maps, plan your route. Kids get tired, not a lot of shaded seating. Strollers available for rental. Overall - a good time. Next time I'll rent a house and car though to see more of the surrounding area.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed, expensive, old fashion - Not Wireless\u201d", "Author": "miamiloover", "ReviewID": "UR109025657", "Content": "We paid 400 usd for a room with view (we onl saw a zebra and 2 antilopes) which was very smelly because all the rooms have ooold carpet.

The Savannah was nice to look at but the balconies overlooking it are very small. The hotel itself is incredibly busy all the time. At times, the lobby feels like the thoroughfare of a train station. There was no opportunity to sit and enjoy the main atrium because there was so much noise and activity. The pool area was utterly mobbed with families, certainly no place to go for any form of relaxation. We ate in the buffet restaurant, Boma, and hated it..... the food was average, very over priced and there was zero ambiance in the restaurant.

Admittedly my opinion of the AKL may not have been quite so negative had we not just stayed at what was, in my opinion, the best Disney hotel there is. The animal kingdom lodge just paled in comparison to the Beach Club and that was staying in a supposedly impressive Savannah view room too but more on that later. For starters it's the darkest, gloomiest place ever. Now I realise that this is part of the whole African theme they've got going on but the dim lighting combined with all the dark wood is somewhat depressing. It's as if the whole hotel is lit with 20 watt light bulbs. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the guest rooms where the mirror on the back of the bathroom door was worse than useless because of the poor lighting and all the shadows. The room had lights of course but they weren't dimmable like the ones in Beach Club and neither was there a vanity mirror in the bathroom area as there had been at Beach Club which would perhaps have helped when trying to apply makeup in the shadows on the bathroom area! Other negatives on the room in comparison to the Beach Club were: -Only sheet and blanket on the bed where the Beach Club also had duvets -Only one (small) pillow on the bed instead of the two plush ones at Beach Club -The room was much smaller than the Beach Club -Complete lack of storage - a wardrobe with 5 hangers and a total of 2 drawers - that was it! The Beach Club had a wardrobe, a 5 drawer dresser plus 5 additional drawers on the TV unit. -Nowhere near as many toiletries, not even any shower gel or bubble bath -No shelf in the bath area for your products - the Beach Club had two - Only one central bedside table at the AKL, the Beach Club had them at the other side of the bed too - As mentioned previously, the bedside lights didn't dim like at the Beach Club, this was essential if you wanted to read when sharing the room with a small child - Clock radio didn't light up so couldn't see the time during the night In my opinion, our worst mistake (aside from splitting our stay and leaving the Beach Club in the first place) was paying extra for a Savannah View room. You may not realise but the animals are actually 'packed away' each night so you don't get to see much of them when you're actually in your room - early in the morning and later in the evening. This combined with the fact that apparently there is a good and not-so-good side of the savannah meant that we were lucky if we saw a giraffe and we never saw a zebra from our side. Don't waste your money on a savannah view - just visit the general lookout areas of the hotel if you want to see the animals. The concierge were worse than useless, the queues were constantly long so bring a pillow if you intend to stop by their desk for help or info. On one occasion we waited 20 minutes (at the FRONT of the queue) for one of the 3 concierge assistants to be free to help us make a dining reservation. In that time we could have got to the restaurant and made a reservation in person! As I said, it may well be that my opinion was skewed by having stayed in the beautiful, light and airy Beach Club (I've reviewed that hotel separately) directly before moving to the Animal Kingdom Lodge but I urge you to think carefully before staying here. Your money is much better spent elsewhere in my opinion but if you do stay here my tips would be stay in a standard room and bring some torches and a lit mirror!", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coconut Creek, FL", "Title": "\u201cDon't pay extra for savannah room\u201d", "Author": "Listen2U", "ReviewID": "UR108534187", "Content": "We loved the overall effect of the property; quite appealing African decor.

Depending where your room is you could be walking a good 10 minutes from lobby to your room due to the way it is laid out. We were lucky as we were only about a 3min walk. The rooms are really basic for the money - however obviously the big sell is the view you get from the Savannah suites. There were giraffes outside our room each night from about 6pm - 6am. There were also a couple other animals which I didn't know what they were. Other rooms could see zebras etc but you can see all the savannahs as you walk from your room to the lobby so you will see all the different animals. The rooms are very basic for the amount of money you are paying but you are paying for Disney and having the major advantage of transportation! There are 3 different places to eat, one fast food style which was ok for a quick breakfast, the main restaurant which did a fab big buffet which we had a great breakfast at and their up market restaurant Jiko which we didn't have time to visit but looked really good. There is a big gift shop where you can get snacks etc too which was good. The swimming pool is really nice, not too many kids either when we were there so you could just chill out and have a bit more room to swim. The bus service was really good as it doesn't share buses with any other hotels so you always get a seat on the bus and we never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus to or from here. It is a bit far from all the parks except AK which you struggle to even spend a full day at so it does take a while to get anywhere. Overall we really liked the hotel but to be honest on night 3 the view of giraffes had started to wear off. It's totally over priced for staying there anything over 4 or 5 days.

I never stayed here and was skeptical to stay at an AK hotel (I am not very fond of animals), but my boyfriend really wanted to. We received the 40% off room price, so that was even more of an incentive since Deluxe Resorts are just gorgeous. We arrived there at 10-ish AM and were greeted with \"Welcome Home!\" which was such a great touch and a nice way to start the visit! The entire hotel was BEAUTIFUL - I didn't even feel like I was in Florida - it felt like I was truly in Africa. So gorgeous and there were people playing live music - it was just beautiful. The lobby is HUGE, by the way. We proceeded to check-in where a nice woman told us our room was not yet ready (expected, since it was so early). I asked her if we could have a free upgrade to savanna view since we only had a standard view. She asked us if we would settle for a savanna view w/ 2 queen beds, but we were set on our king size bed, so we passed, but I was happy to see they were going to give us a free upgrade! (Paying for a savanna view isn't completely worth it - there weren't THAT many animals, but when there were, it was nice to see.) She told us she would text me when our room was ready so we headed to the pool, which was SO NICE! It's basically empty this time of year at Disney so it was nice and quiet to relax. The zero-depth entry pool was so cool and different and definitely a great place to tan or to watch your little ones splash around. The bar near the pool was also great and everyone was very friendly. We decided to eat at The Mara (quick service) because we were starving. I don't usually expect much from quick service places, but this is Disney, so it was fantastic! Great burgers and fries and you can even buy beer which I didn't think you could do. Only about an hour later did I receive a text that our room was ready and we headed right to it! What a great room - so much better than in the pictures. African-inspired decor EVERYWHERE. The bathrooms were very small, but all you really have to do is shower and use the toilet, since the two sinks are outside the bathroom, so not many complaints there. The ONLY con I would give AKL is that besides the fact it takes about 20 minutes to get to every park (besides AK), the bus stops at Kidani Village first to pick up and first to drop off (except the Downtown Disney bus). Our first night, we were coming back from EPCOT very late at night and it was raining. The bus stopped at AKL and we got off. Little did we realize we were not at Jambo House. Instead of waiting for another bus (could take 20 minutes), we walked the 10 minutes to Jambo House. This was annoying because no one made an announcement where we were and several other guests got off accidentally, as well. Yet, the next night, there was an announcement as to where we were. In this aspect, Disney should get their stuff together and notify us where we are. People are paying a lot to stay here and an announcement isn't THAT hard. I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat!

The placement of sofas and chairs in little groupings was also very nicely done. The Jiko restaurant has wonderful food and great ambiance.

The room price we paid for a savannah view room in April was almost $500 including tax etc. This time, we saw animals from the room, but from a distance. Last time it seemed as if they had a truck with food that left food which of course attracted the animals to the areas adjacent to savannah view rooms and to the promontory located at the rear of the hotel accessible from the lobby. This time, it seemed the animals may or not graze in view. Many times they were off in the distance.

We stayed in a DVC room on my wife's cousins' points. Therein lay the problem. Upon arrival we tried to switch to either the Boardwalk or the Beach Club. The cast member at the desk made a big deal of this, telling other cast members and anyone else in close proximity that we didn't want to stay at their hotel. We didn't appreciate this. She made a call to the Boardwalk and said, yes, they had numerous rooms available but upon learning that we were staying on someone else's points, she ended the call and informed us that only the owner could make the switch. My wife called her cousin who called DVC but was told the rooms available were for cash only. Even if we wanted to pay cash for the upgrade we couldn't do it. We asked if there were any upgrades available at the AK. Once again, not your points, no upgrades. We ended up on the fifth floor as far from the lobby as was humanly possible. As if all the walking we did in the parks wasn't enough, we really needed a half mile walk to our room. To top things off, when the bellman brought our bags up, he informed us that the hotel was at 60% occupancy. This was probably our 20th stay at Disney, always at deluxe resorts and they couldn't find a way to accommodate us? While the resort is very nice, there is nothing Disneyesque about it. Oh yeah, there were some animals outside. If you're into watching animals stand about and not do much, this is the place for you. We wouldn't stay here again if the room was free.

If this has been a dream of yours for a long time here's your chance, right in the middle of Central Florida at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge. And let's face it, even if it hasn't been a dream of yours, your kids (and you) will love it anyway ;) This hotel is decked with African art and sculptures and the lobby is huge. Take some time to look around, a lot of interesting things to see here. Animal Kingdom Lodge features, as any hotel, rooms in different categories. Needless to say, the ones with the savanna view are among the more expensive ones. Our room was a pool view room; it still gave us a very nice view of the hotel property and was quiet. There's no chance of any Giraffes coming up to your balcony here though but even if you do not have a savannah view room, there are plenty of opportunities at this Disney resort hotel to see the animals ;) The rooms are spacious with a nice big bath, LG flat screen television, radio alarm with iPod dock, coffee machine, one or two comfy beds and much, much more. The pool is big and it is heated and depending on the time of the year you're staying at AKL you'll have plenty of room to swim laps or play games in the water. There are Jacuzzis located near the main pool area as well. All of it is situated next to one of the savannas, so if you get bored in the water or just wanna get out of the pool for a bit it only takes a few steps to see some of the animals. All of this is only a few walking minutes and an elevator ride away from most rooms :). One of the best times to see the animals, especially the giraffes, is during feeding time. Make sure to ask a cast member about it! There are wildlife experts on the hotel property as well. Take the chance and talk to one, never know what interesting facts you'll learn about all the different, exotic animals. Just remember, it will take you a while to walk around this hotel and see them all ;). This hotel features three full service restaurants, one quick service restaurant and two lounges. The three full service restaurants serve African food, the two lounges and the quick service restaurant American style food and drinks. So while you're here why not check out the African restaurants and try something you can't get every day. You might be surprised about how many different, tasty dishes there are for you to choose from :) Animal Kingdom Lodge, as the name suggests, is located right next to Animal Kingdom Park. You can't walk straight over though; you'll have to take the bus just like to any of the other Disney parks. The buses run every 20 minutes or more often, depending on the time of the day and the season and they'll bring you to your destination quick and easy. Magic Kingdom is the farthest park from AKL (about 8 miles) and it'll take you about 15 to 20 minutes to get there by bus.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "south carolina", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "elwoodSouthCarolina", "ReviewID": "UR103938691", "Content": "We stayed for 2 nights the last week of March.

Loved the decor, the beds and amenities. Kids adored the pool. It was not so remote - we were able to return to the room every afternoon for a swim / nap. Bus service to the parks was easy and didn't take too long (but it was \"spring break\" season, when the buses presumably run more frequently). The animals made regular showings -- afternoon is a good time to see them, which works well with an afternoon nap itinerary. The Boma buffet had good offerings for all palates, even for a self-confessed \"foodie\". Make reservations well in advance (like at least a month). It would have been a dream stay had our room not been \"liberated\" of our digital SLR camera that my husband had brought along for his business trip to Gainesville after the vacation. The safe is not large enough to fit 2 laptops and the big camera.

We wanted to stay in Disney for my trip as I am a massive Disney franchise fan and when looking in to all of the hotels, Animal Kingdom Lodge had to be the one for me (I am a serious animal lover). We were in the Jambo House part of the hotel and we didn't have time explore Kidani. So this review is based solely on Jambo House. The staff throughout the hotel were all very polite and helpful, all areas (including grounds) were beautifully kept and very clean. The interior of the hotel was quite dark, but you get used to it after a while! The room was spacious, the bathroom and separate sink area were brilliant and decorated with amazing wallpaper that you just cant help looking at!! I also loved the netting on the windows, there are many characters from The Lion King on them (my favourite film) so I loved this little touch! :-) The balconies are very small, but 2 chairs and a table fitted, so you can sit out there and admire the animals and scenary! I am a very fussy eater, but loved the Mara self-service restaurant, which had plenty of choice for fussy eaters like me, though the menu doesn't change so if you eat there a lot you might get a bit bored! I liked Boma too, which is a massive buffet with plenty of choice (I don't think anyone would struggle in there!!) but I found it did get quite rammed and noisey even though we were there out of season, time it right and you wont find this too much of an issue though! The 'posh' restaurant is called Jiko. It is very nice and great quailty, but if you are a fussy eater you might seriously struggle as there wasn't a huge choice (I had to have steak as I wouldn't eat anything else) but this is just me, my partner is more in to 'posh nosh' and he fancied almost everything on the menu. The puddings both looked and tasted amazing, so it made up for the lack of choice I had. The bar was quite small but very nice. I don't drink alcohol, but they still had plenty of options for me the night we went in there. The hotel shop is very good, I wandered around it many times and spent lots of money in there (as you would expect being at Disney) they had food/drink in there as well as souveniers, so it was quite handy on a few occasions when we just wanted a quick snack on the way down to the WDW buses. The bus rank is fairly close to the front of the hotel and all spaces are signposted so you know which bus will stop where (very handy) as I did notice some hotels didn't have quite so many spaces and it wasnt quite so obvious. My boyfriend is a smoker and there are only 2 smoking areas at the hotel and they are quite a way away from the rooms, but we appreciate that they want to keep smoke/butts away from children and animals as much as possible, so although the walk was sometimes quite a drag for him, we understood why. There wasn't wifi in the rooms, but there is a PC behind reception which you can use for 15 minutes, just ask at reception and they will let you in! I loved having the animals outside of my bedroom window (the whole reason I booked this hotel!). I could see something everytime I looked out and by the end of the fortnight I had spotted all of the animals on the sheet they provide you in the room. We took part in the night vision animal viewing but we were unlucky and didn't really see very much at all. The hotel do offer a safari around the grounds but this was a lot of money because it includes a meal at Jiko (So a rip-off if you are on the Dining Plan!) and we didn't have the option to do the safari without the meal, so we didn't do this, but the Kilamanjaro Safari at Animal Kingdom Park is free, great fun and we saw loads of animals so I wasn't too disapointed to miss the hotel one out! We were so busy during the day that we didn't use any other hotel facilities, but it all looked to be in great condition, well looked after and many people of all ages were using them. We didn't have children with us, but there seemed to be plenty of activities for them to do on the notice board down by Jiko and Boma, but I don't think ANYONE could get bored at Disney World anyway! :-)", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the price\u201d", "Author": "halo_zandria", "ReviewID": "UR101818587", "Content": "The lodge is very nice, Boma restaurant is excellent, and the pool is very kid friendly.

This review applies to both stays. The property is absolutely gorgeous. Both times we had a savanna view room, in different areas of the property. We had no kids in our group, but we absolutely loved having the savanna view. The animals are typically up early, so by the time you get up there will already be a giraffe or something right outside your window. Great way to start a morning at Disney. Like others have said, the rooms are average size, to small. But they were clean, and of course the look of the room was in the style of the resort. As we were 3 adults, of course it would've been nice to have a slightly larger room, but since it was clean and since weren't in our room very often, we could overlook it. The walk-up restaurant, the Mara, is your typical Disney style one. Grab and go breakfast items (some hot), then burgers, etc for lunch and dinner. Definitely buy one of the mugs for $12 or so -- free refills at the resort, but not in the parks. While I didn't eat at the nicer restaurant on the property, Jiko, the other members of my party did and they said it was fantastic. We didn't use the pools, but we enjoyed walking around and checking everything out. The pools looked nice. As for the bus ride and wait times -- this definitely depends on what time of year you're there. As I said we were there in 2 different Octobers, and both times the ride and wait times weren't bad. Some times we'd be the only ones on the bus, after waiting only a few minutes. Then the next time we'd have to wait 15 minutes, only to see an already-full bus arrive. More often than not, it wouldn't be bad. I'm sure it's worse in more peak times. Those in our group were on slightly different flight schedules, so we were put on different buses.

AKL is a great looking hotel. The service is exceptional, just like any other Disney property.The room is not much larger than moderate or value disney hotel rooms. Two sinks in vanity area, but no door seperating it from bedroom , as in the Coronado. Shower\\toilet area is not well lit at all. We had a view of the parking lot, which we could have had at any other hotel. Also, must pay extra for internet. For more than $ 300 a night, you would think they would not charge extra for internet. Beds were comfortable, pillows were very small. We could lower thermostat to desired temperature, unlike in the value or moderate hotels. I guess if you pay more for the room, you don't have to conserve energy. All in all, the room was nice, the atmosphere made up for any short comings. Two big negatives. The food court and the bus service. The AKL food court had less choices than the value hotel food courts. Definitely not as good as the Coronado's. The bus service was by far the worse of any Disney hotel that we have stayed. Waits were long and buses were always packed. Bus to animal kingdom took forever and was crowded. Would have been much quicker to drive ourselves. AKL is a beautiful hotel, but you can save a lot of money by staying at a value resort and viewing animals at Animal Kingdom.

It was fabulous!! I never wrote a review before but felt like I should because of all the negative reviews I read before we left. The rooms were a nice size not huge but not little. Some people wrote there was no place to put their luggage the beds were high enough off the floor to store them under the beds or under the sinks. The rooms were very clean so I felt good about putting them on the floor. We paid for a standard room at the Jambo house but got a great view of all the animals. There was a feeder for the giraffes right out from our balcony!! I also read that people thought the bus rides took forever or got off at the wrong stop. The Magic Kingdom was the futherest park but it only took about 20 minutes to get there to me that's not that big of a deal. Now for getting off at the wrong stop then they just were not listening. The driver will annouce which stop it is there are only 2. Either you are in Jambo house or at the Kidani Village. 90% of the time they went to the villas first. So all you have to do is pay attention. The last day we were there we went over to the Kidani Village to check it out, we found washer and dryers there which would have been good to know since we have a 3 year old who loved the ice cream at the parks.So needless to say we ran out of shirts for her. You don't have to pay for them just the laundry detergent.

We arrived on a Tuesday and left Friday. This was our first time staying in a Deluxe Resort, having stayed at Pop Century and Coronado Springs on Previous trips. I have to say that overall the hotel was amazing! We had not planned to stay in a Savannah View Room but, thanks to our request for a birthday button, were upgraded at check-in. Our view was of the Sunset Savannah and we saw animals all hours of the day and night. Watching the animals was fascinating, we were on the 2nd floor which turned out to be the perfect level, and it was very difficult for us to leave the balcony. When staying here in the future, a Savannah View Room will be a must! We ate breakfast a Bomo every morning of our stay and very much enjoyed the experience. And, blessed by excellent weather, we were able to spend two afternoons at the pool! A tip: there are lounge chairs on the backside of the pool, behind the cabana, that face the Savannah\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6layout here, the view is much better. You can lay by a pool and watch sunbathers anywhere, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never sunbathed with a giraffe before! Everyone at the resort was friendly and accommodating, be sure to take time to chat with the Savannah Guides, they are full of info about the animals on the Savannahs and their homelands. I have to share that although the overall experience was wonderful there was one big negative, the bus service. The bus service was the worst I had ever experienced and this was at least my 10th stay at a Disney Resort in the past 5 years. We waited 40 minutes on the first morning that we were there for a bus to the Animal Kingdom. By the end of our trip we had resorted to catching a cab to and from the parks, which seems very unnecessary to me as I have used Disney transportation often in the past without any issues of long wait times. My husband, a business owner with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get it done right and get on out of my way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attitude was particularly bothered.

We did not eat in the resort restaurant but rather at the food place by the pool. It had great variety and did not disappoint for any meal. The pool was very fun. We came back mid day a couple times and the boys loved playing in the pool. We also would swim at night until we couldn't keep our eyes open.

The computer system went down moments before our turn at the desk. Without the computer, the Front Desk was basically helpless. Not enough people to do it manually. They could not check room availability, issue room keys or even check our reservations. Nada. After 30 minutes of no service, a back office person came by and explained it was a problem with an indefinite down time. After an hour of this, the desk clerk took our phone number and told us to go have dinner and bring the receipt. So, off to dinner. After walking around for a while (too early to eat initially), we went over to the Boma buffet. Since we did not have a reservation, we settled down for what we thought would be a long wait as people with reservations surged ahead of us. Well, about ten minutes after we got there the dinner reservation system went down and they had to write down names and times on a note pad. We had told them we did not have a reservation, but with the system down, and working off of note pads, they just took whoever was there. We got in within a few minutes. $95 worth of dinner later we left and sure enough they paid for it. They also gave us two attractions \"Priority Passes\" to go to the head of the line at one ride at a park, but we did not need them. No big crowds in February. Note: the buffet has a lot of different food types that are fun to try but may not be something you want every day. We had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgraded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to a pool view, but the room was near an inside corner and the pool was barely visible way off to the right through some trees. Not close to the grand view I saw in the web site photo gallery. Oddly enough I am certain they had rooms available with much better views - the place was not crowded at all, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why they felt compelled to put us there. I guess they reserve those great view rooms for those who complain, or pay full price. We did neither. I was not in the mood to complain. After being roomless for three and a half hours, we just wanted to find a place to park ourselves. The room was fine. We also availed ourselves of the Bell service. For a few dollars in tips, it saves a lot of hassle. Turns out there was an unintended benefit to our corner room. We were only a few hallway steps away from a gorgeous overlook that gave us a great view of the Savannah area. The space was large, with several comfortable rocking chairs. Much more comfortable than the cramped confines of a balcony room with those small metal chairs. Next time, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a standard view and just walk to a savannah overlook when we want to see the animals. That was really nice. Giraffes, Thompson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gazelle's and many other interesting animals wandered around just yards away from the overlook. Jinko was an excellent, pricey restaurant. We ate there the second night. Yet, again, we found ourselves treated in a minimalist way. We were ushered to a table right next to the service area used by the waiters. Seemed odd to put us there when there were many better located unused tables set elsewhere. I guess you have to speak up aggressively to get better service, but for what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re spending on the dinner and for what they advertise in service, that should not be necessary. At that level of service, you should not be expected to request special treatment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it should be taken for granted. Access to the parks was all by Bus. Not a big issue except take care on the return. The bus says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Animal Kingdom Lodge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but it makes an extra stop at another Animal Kingdom Lodge before it gets to the main Hotel lodge. After a long tired day, we were only half listening to the canned voice so when we got to the familiar stop, we just got off and only after the bus left did we realize our error. The two places look very similar, particularly at night, but they are very different. You do not stop there on the way out. Took an extra 20 minutes to get to our place. Oh well. Overall, we will return to AKL. It was really nice and grew on us as we stayed. Lots of little corners and alcoves to discover and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hang out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in and relax in relative seclusion and peace. Service was very kind though not always the best, and they try hard to make it a positive experience. They were clearly distraught about the computer issues they were having, but that is something we will all have to get used to everywhere we go. It is not unique to Disney, and when they work, computer systems are fabulous, but when they fail, there is little to no backup. Having been visiting Disney parks off and on for decades (I live one hour away) I notice changes on occasion. One new Customer Service technique I noticed they have gotten down really well is conversation. When you find you have to spend time with one of their employees, say waiting on a ticket, or a bus, or just hanging out, they will strike up friendly conversations with you about what you are enjoying and plan to do, and about things they like to do and suggest ideas to augment your own experience. Every employee I ran into encouraged a friendly chat.

The reason I didn't give this hotel 5 stars is the beds weren't very comfortable (we had 2 queens and my husband and I ended up sleeping in separate beds). A downside as well was how far this hotel is from a lot of attractions at AKL.

Our flight out of Chicago got us to the hotel shortly before noon, and we had previously used the on-line check-in service. When our reserved room was not yet ready, we were offered an alternate which was ready. The alternate was a handicapped accessible room and because it was on the same level as the lobby and only four rooms away from the lobby it worked out fine. We had a view over the Sunset Savanna, and were able to view giraffe, zebra, eland, ostrich, and various other fauna, mostly in the late afternoon or early evening. The facilities in the room were much the same as I remembered from our earlier stay, and the service, etc. was generally up to Disney standards. We had breakfast and dinner in the Boma restaurant which was great. The Mara quick-service restaurant was fine for breakfast on the other days. Other meals were taken either at the theme parks, at Downtown Disney, or at the other hotels. Because we always rent a car at the airport, access to the major theme parks was not problem. We did not take any of the Disney buses, having learned our lesson about commuting times in the past. My only real complaint was the lack of wifi in the hotel. Recent trips around the US and throughout Europe, we were almost always able to check email, etc., via my laptop which is always with me. At AKL, I had to rely on my phone for receiving emails, but i have found it much more difficult to respond on a smart phone (my fingers are too big for the keyboard, and I'm too old to be able to use only my thumbs like my grand kids do). I mean, come on this is the 21st century. So, our stay was comfortable, but we have always enjoyed the WDW hotels.

The restaurants were good, although it would have been nice to have a little more variety. We ate a couple days at the Mara, which is essentially a grill that has burgers, etc. We also ate at Jiko our first night; the food was fantastic (try the spare ribs!) and our waiter was fantastic!

We drove from Miami FL. We found the hotel to be nice. The hotel grounds where very clean and extrelmely well kept. It has a beautiful lobby and surrounding area. Initially we got a standard room facing the pool. When we got to the room it was clean and fresh. What we didn't like was that the balcony, it had a 5 foot wall that really gave the room a small feeling, so we decided to upgrade to the savanna view. When we walked in to the new room we were a bit surprided that it was the exact same type of room but with a new view. This time the balcony was open and had a nice view. With that said though, by the end of our stay of 3 days and 2 nights we only saw animals once, on the very first day. In our opinion it really isn't worth the extra cost to get the savanna view. We felt like the hotel was a beat cheap about certain things, for example not including internet with the room. That was an additional cost of $9.95 per 24 hours. For the money we spent in that hotel it should be included IMO. To top it off it wasn't even wireless. You're stuck sitting at the desk connected by cable to use it. One thing I enjoy at the end of my busy day at the parks is to sit back and enjoy a good movie or maybe watch one of my favorite TV shows. Well that's not possible there, as the hotel only has basic cable, so channels like TBS, USA, TNT etc... are not available. Again, for the price of the room it seams a bit cheap. The food was great. The hotel has 3 restaurants on site. One is the typical fancy restaurant, the second is a upscale buffet and the third is a pool side type restaurant. We had dinner and breakfast at the buffet and the food was superb. Really good quality, variety and service. We had one meal at the pool restaurant and that food was just as good. For this great service you will pay though. The buffet breakfast was $20.00 per person and the dinner was $38.00 per. a bit pricey but good though. On night 2 we had room service, again, good food but expensive. A burger cost us $15.00, and this was on the low end. They had other food but prices went up from there to $30.00 for a steak. Ultimately, it was a nice experience but we felt it was lacking a bit, it was missing something. In our opinion the savanna should have had more animals for starters. You should be able to see them just about any time. Again it's not much of a savanna if in 3 days I only see animals once for about 2 hours. What did I just pay for?????

On a previous trip to Orlando we stayed at the Marriott Village. We stayed on property since we were only there for a quick weekend and knew the destinations we wanted to hit for the kids. Not being hard core Disney people, the entire operation is a bit overwhelming - from the mass transit, to the retail sales, to the theme parks. The kids had a ball. Animal Kingdom Lodge was beautiful - well maintained, clean, beautiful pool and grounds. We had no trouble with our stay in the hotel and made it quickly via Disney bus transit to all our destinations. Our major issue with this trip was the Magical Express transporation to/from the airport. If you travel a lot, I would highly recommend your own airport transportation as this was enough to drive me crazy. It took us 2.5 hours upon landing to get to our room. We had to be on the bus back to the airport 3 hours ahead of flight time. It was neither magical nor express in my opinion. Many activities at Disney feel like cattle car types of events - mass crowds moving one direction and then to another. While not our style, the kids did enjoy themselves. Questionable value for this facility comes from the price tag associated with the hotel and the benefits received. We stayed in a similar type of room (queen bed, bunk beds) in the Marriott Village for about $125 less per night and had just as good of accomodation and service.

We had a standard view room as it was cheaper and we knew we wouldn't be in the room long enough anyways to worry about whether we had a good view or not. If you do not have a view of the animals you can easily walk around the hotel where there are viewing areas where you can see the animals up close and personal. There are also knowledgeable guides who will tell you about their native land of Africa and about the animals as well. Back to our room, our beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of pillows for the 3 of us. There was an extra blanket in the closet so that was nice when the nights got cold. Having 3 women in one room, we were very happy that the sink area (and 2 sinks at that) was separate from the shower area. That made it nice when we were all getting ready at the same time in the mornings. We did not take much advantage of the food at AKL. We ate breakfast a few times in the quick service area and it was very substantial and good. We found all three of us could get by on one full adult breakfast everyday therefore not using up 3 counter service meals at one time. There was a coffee pot in the room so there was no reason to waste your beverage allotment on a cup of coffee. (Just a little tip I realized after the first day so thought I would pass it on) All in all this was an amazing hotel and if and when I returned to DisneyWorld I would most certainly stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201cOverall a very good hotel, but some improvements noted.\u201d", "Author": "busterjosh", "ReviewID": "UR93275254", "Content": "As I write this review, I am sitting in my room at Disneys AKL. I am a frequent traveler and return visitor to Disney. Last year we stayed at Port Orleans French Quarter which was AWESOME in every way. This year we decided to upgrade to Deluxe at AKL. Overall, this is an amazing property. The lobby is grand and impressive. There are many animal viewing areas and an overall african theme everywhere. The pool is immense and there are plenty of activities to entertain the children. However, the quick service restaurant is badly in need of an upgraded menu. Currently there are 2 salads, 2 pizzas and hamburgers on the menu. We were desperate for protein after the second day and took the bus to Port Orleans French Quarter to get a decent meal. I don't think you would have trouble if you have the standard dining plan. However, if you opyt for quick servcie this is not the resort for you. Another thing to keep in mind is that a trip to magic kingdom is approx 45 mins and downtown disney is at least 30 mins due to the location of the hotel.

Our room had a balcony overlooking the savannah and there were giraffe, impala, zebra, waterbuck, kudu, ostrich and more grazing just below us.

The staff in general (with the notable exception of Oscar in Jiko restaurant) were poorly trained, off hand and surly and not what we expected from Disney.

The lodge and the grounds were stunning. Paid for a Standard View, but were placed in room in 2547 which, if you look at a map, isn't technically a savannah, but let me say that I am certain we saw more animals than anyone else. We regularly had giraffe, zebra, wildabeast, and several other animals on a regular basis. Some standard views indeed have no view, but honestly - it's worth booking a standard as many people seem to get upgrades or animal views anyway. If you don't get the upgrade, there are numerous viewing areas to see the animals. I honestly don't feel that paying for anything other than a standard view is worth it. We stayed in one of the furthest rooms from the lobby. The walk was 3-3/12 minutes max, depending on how tired I was. I mention this because people have complained about the long walk. 3.5 minutes after walking MILES all day at Disney? Really? Come on people. The hotel was immaculate, as was our room. Each day our room was as clean, neat and tidy as the day we arrived. We did leave a $5 tip every morning, but I'm sure the room would have been cleaned just the same. So long as we're talking about tipping housekeeping - please do it. Those people work HARD and make so little. It was a $35 added expense to our overall trip that I feel was totally worth it. You tip a bellman who wheels your luggage to your room with ease, why not the person on their hands and knees cleaning your toilet, vacuuming your floors and doing the backbreaking work of making bed after bed after bed all day. Just a thought. For $5 a day you can really make someone's day who really deserves it. Anyway...my only complaint was drawer space. There were exactly 2 drawers in the room, in the armoire that housed the TV. I used one for me, and one for my daughter. The hubby lived out of the suitcase all week. Honestly, there wasn't really room for another dresser so yeah, the rooms are a little small...but nothing that should deter you from staying here. Just keep this in mind if you are staying a week or more and have 4 people in the room. Could be a bit crowded with space for your things. BOMA - Yum! This is the on-site buffet restaurant. We loved it, as did my parents who were also there. Definitely not African food, but perhaps African Inspired. Amazing soups, salad bar, hummus bar and desert bar. Great side dishes. I don't eat meat, but the meat eaters at the table seem really pleased with what was offered. Expensive, so - as I'd recommend to anyone - I don't know if it is worth the money if you are not on the dining plan. Speaking of which, it is a GREAT value so long as you are really into sit down dining on vacation. If you are happy with quick service burgers and sandwiches all week, you may be better off without. Anyway, do the math before you commit. JIKO - We didn't eat here as it was 2 dinner credits with our dining plan, but it has a wonderful reputation. If we didn't have a small child with us who simply wouldn't have appreciated the food for the price, we would have eaten there anyway. The staff was great...but I wouldn't call them \"magical.\" I could see the frustration on the guys face at registration when I asked several times how a 3 person 8 day upgrade to park hopper could be over $250 when in my head it was nearly $100 less. When he finally sighed and pulled out his calculator he saw that I was right and quickly corrected it. But it's Disney, man...try not to look like your guest is being a pain in the a$$. On the other hand, I saw some really rude people in line and so I can see where they can get fried in the course of a day. Whatever. Yep, it is further from the Magic Kingdom than any place else. About a 10-15 minute bus ride from the resort. We may consider staying at the Contemporary or Polynesian the next time if the cost is on par with Animal Kingdom - but if it is much more expensive as it was at our time of booking, it isn't worth it in my opinion. The pool is gorgeous, great for little ones as you can walk in and gradually get deeper. At night, just past the pool on the side of the building, you can use night vision goggles to watch the animals. This happens around 9pm. Super.

On arrival, we stored our bags as it was early morning, fresh off of a Disney Cruise. When we returned, after a long day at Animal Kingdom, all the rooms were under my name (we had a group of 16, with four rooms), all of the baggage was delivered to my room which was a wonderful suite at the end of one of the hallway branches in Jambo House. I was a the desk giving the credit card information and getting the keys. (First glich was that I had spent over a half an hour on line during the Disney Cruise \"checking in\"....costing me computer time on the ship...this was supposed to allow me to just pick up my keys on arrival.....but not so....even tho I told the man at the front desk, he had to take my card and do EACH room individually which took some time to do the ...not to mention he money that I had wasted with computer time on the ship). So back to the baggage......I arrived at our room to find the bellman leaving and 16 plus bags both inside and OUTSIDE of our room. I caught the bellman and asked him if he could just take the bags of my daughter's family to their room as I now had the room number....she has four children, some young, who could not handle their bags. I was truly flabbergasted as the porter continued on his way and said that it was just down the hall (a LONG hall) and around the corner. He might have been tired out from all the bags but I have never seen such a thing. He left his rubber stopper in the door to hold the door open!! My husband wanted to tip him but did not even have a chance as the porter was so flustered (we ALWAYS tip and could not believe his hurry). So those were the first two \"strikes\" in our book......We DID love the hotel......we saw so much wildlife out of our window and it was a perfect place to end our two week vacation. We had no problem with the buses......just depends on your luck, I think.....one day it right there and the next we had to wait a little while....no problem for us. We were on concierge floor and found this to be just perfect as our big group could all eat breakfast before we headed out to the park. The concierge food is on the sixth floor and we were on the fourth floor....it is tricky to get up there and we would have appreciated someone telling us that it took a special elevator, but we figured it out eventually. We also ate at Boma and it was very wonderful.....the most delicious buffet ever......so many unusual things, but they were all very inviting and tasty. We had a long standing reservation for our group of 16 but were given a pager on our arrival at the restaurant....we did have to wait at least a half an hour....could add that to the negative column but I understand with a group that large, it is not always easy. Another strange cast member happening was that on both nights loud knocks brought us to our doors to find maids who offered to turn down our beds at anywhere from 8 to 9:30 p.m.!!.....long after some little ones in our party were asleep. The night before we left I went to the check out desk to see about printing our boarding passes and finding out more about checking our baggage on though to our home as was advertised by the Magical Express bus service to the airport. The lady told me to come back the next day, early in the morning, to avoid the crowds later, which we did. I had signed up for a premiere baggage option with United Airlines which allowed me to check 16 bags for free, which was a great savings for this trip. I bought all of the enrollment paperwork with me to make sure I would have no problems.....the program was all attached to my mileage plus number. The lady at the airline desk, Denise, was very brusk and even tho I showed her my paperwork she said she could NOT check my bags. She told me my only option was to go and do my own check in on their computer which is \"Hidden\" behind the front desk area.....guests can use it but you have to be let in through locked doors. She said I would have to take all the bags with me on the bus. Since I had 16 people to check in for the flight, this took some time.......during my time in the computer room, and there was NO one else waiting.....a cast member came by to tell me that there is a 15 minute time limit on the computer.....hummm...let me see, I guess that was strike 4, however I would l iike to give Denise several strikes!! I finally finished the airport check in and printing of boarding passes when my husband and a very NICE man, named Ron, a cast member who had witnessed the whole thing, came to get me and told me that they WOULD now check our baggage as they had checked on my premier baggage membership and had found that I was telling the truth:) This is what they should have done in the first place. So happily, with the help of Ron and another nice employee, Wilberto, who had taken me to the computer room...and was very sympathetic, we DID finally check our baggage all the way through, they took the bags from us, a great help....and the Magical Express was indeed magical! Denise seemed to try to \"make nice\" when they were taking our bags......putting all the bags receipts on a paper for me and telling me that I should write everyones name on the tags so I would know who they belonged to if one went missing ??? this while they were loading the bags on a cart......didn't make sense to me as if one was missing, I would have been able to tell by seeing which ones arrived safely ...but oh well.......she asked me if I had printed my boarding passes and when I said yes, she dramatically ripped the ones that she was in the process of printing in half and mumbled something about wasting her time:) I did feel I had to make mention of all these mishaps from the staff......but hope that you will give it a try it you are dreaming of going here, because it is a very special hotel........with a few glitches......I am glad we had the experience of staying there, when all is said and done!

Didn't really like the room at Jambo House, they were deep but had no width if that makes sense, kind of made me feel closed in.

However being in Disney there are tons of places to eat and if you have a car it's no big deal. Now the good stuff. This hotel itself is pretty cool. Even if you don't stay there go check it out. When you come through the front door it's like stepping into another world. You eyes kind of go wide and your mouth opens a little bit. The safari's and walking trails are great for the kids.

We were there in August and it was 100 degrees, everyone was at the pool and we still had no trouble finding spots and never felt crowded in the water. There is a small pool bar with a really friendly wait staff as well. If you have small kids, there is another pool with a childrens play area at Kidani Village. The pool is small but the kids playing there seemed to be enjoying themselves with water cannons and stuff like that. I noticed a lot of activities going on for kids. They have a camp fire and night vision goggle tours at night and also have guides along the walking trails.

The dates we selected were great because it was not crowded, we were able to visit all the parks an ride all the atractions, the longest wait time for an atraction was 1.5 hour and we used fast pass on this so we only waited in line about 15 min. We notified the hotel that it was our aniversary so they gave us a pin for us to wear in our stay and the staff all around the complex would congratulate us, it was a really nice feeling. The hotel is very pretty, of course is a themed hotel and its all africa all around, the walk to the room is ok, it is not soooo big that you have to walk your feet off to get to the room, it is very accesible. We did not tried the restaurants because we were in the parks all evenings, but we use to wake up late and get to the parks at noon, and the sleep in morning hours was great, it is not noisy and its peacefull. Room was a little bit small, but is comfortable, and the bathroom is veery preetty, and you receive all kind of details around the room like towel art. The pool was pretty and good sized.

It was our 2nd stay and we were the lowest level concierge room. This meant we had a standard room (which is great!) with a view of a savanna AND access to all of the concierge services - which is what we wanted. Because we stayed at this level and at this resort we had access to a number of extra experiences (at an extra cost). They were all amazing opportunities to get closer too and learn a lot more about the animals at the lodge and at the park. We did the dinner safari at the lodge (requires staying at the lodge); we did the sunrise safari at the park (requires staying at the lodge at concierge level) and the backstage tour of the safari ride at the park (requires concierge level at any resort). The Animal Kingdom Lodge is a beautiful resort and the proximity to the animals is a huge bonus. We find it to be quieter for some reason. There are still kids here (it is Disney) - but it was calmer than the monorail resorts (GF, Poly, Contemporary). The decor is beautiful. Our rooms were always clean, we had a new towel animal every day, the restaurants are great - Jiko is amazing. If you don't drive yourself (and I recommend Disney transportation) you will take a bus to the parks. While this resort is the furthest away from most parks - the buses only stop at the Villas (first) and the hotel (Jambo House) - the two areas that make up this property. So you quickly get to the parks. One person we met at a lunch was staying at the Contemporary and while it was great for getting to Magic Kingdom & Epcot - her bus stopped at FOUR more resorts before it got to Hollywood Studios - it took a long time and was cramped. Except for coming back at park closing - we never had a super crowded bus at all. If you stay here build time into your trip to enjoy the resort.

Typically, we find ourselves traveling to Orlando once every year or two and have always enjoyed our stay within the Walt Disney World property. So we were excited about staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge Jambo House (the hotel, not the time shares at Kidani Village), one of the few luxury resorts we have never stayed in. First, the positives. The hotel overall is beautifully done. Dark wood tones, native art adorning many of the areas throughout the hotel create a perfect impression of Africa. We were enthralled with the animals outside most of the public viewing areas. In most regards, Disney World more than delivered on its marketing promises for general viewing. We also can't say enough about how incredible the food is throughout the hotel. Boma, the buffet is probably the most inventive and appealing buffets we have ever tried. The fine dining restaurant, Jiko, is perhaps the best of any of Disney\"s restaurants. It was an absolutely PERFECT meal. We went back a second night. The down side....and there are many negative areas. First, the rooms. We booked a savannah view and quickly found out that represents a BROAD category. The first room we were assigned was overlooking a muddy 40 yard area enclosed with a chain link fence....more construction zone than savannah. If you do not have a room facing the inner circle, the viewing is very limited and rather poor. Typically smaller than most of the luxury resort rooms, the rooms are also very very very poorly lit. Two inadaqute sconces plus one floor lamp are the only lighting in the room. It was impossible to read at night. The bathroom sink and counter are open to the main room and feels more Days Inn and less luxury resort. The overall feeling is cramped and claustrophobic. We actually tried to book another hotel within Disney and unfortunately, all were already booked. We would have left the hotel if we had a choice. Lastly, when things go well at Disney, great, but if not......there is very little the staff are empowered to change or correct. Even small issues presented a challenge for the front desk. It wasn't that they didnt try, it was more they didn't know how or weren't empowered to create a solution. We can only say that after two days, we were desperate to change hotels and sorry we had ever booked the Animal Kingdom Lodge. I can only offer that rather than stay at the Lodge, take an afternoon, go over and see the lobby and perhaps have a meal and go back to one of the other resorts.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to Stay at Disney\u201d", "Author": "dec49", "ReviewID": "UR89948129", "Content": "We loved Animal Kingdom Lodge-Jambo House. It was busy, but did not seem crowded. There were plenty of places to sit and relax inside and out. The huge lobby had several small groups of comfortable chairs and couches, a large gas fire pit, large windows overlooking the savannah, and an exceptional gift shop. Outside were pathways to animal viewing areas, and rocking chairs around another fire pit. The quick service dining, the Mara, the arcade, the fitness center, and the beautiful pool were accessible outside on the lower level. The restaurants (Boma is recommended highly) and the lounge were also on the lower level (stairs or elevator). We did not have any long waits for the busses. In fact it seemed as if other resort lines were much longer. Make sure you get off at the Jambo House exit, not the Village exit. Rooms were nice, nothing really \"luxurious\" and clean. We did not request the savannah view, but saw many animals along the outside overlooks. Cast members were available to answer any questions. We were close to the lobby on the fourth floor. Had the weather been warmer, we would have used the outdoor patio viewing area just down the hallway. The only slight complaint we had the entire stay was the long wait we encountered checking out our luggage at the bell desk. We had requested the service before we left home--it was very convenient, but there was a long line the morning of our departure. Just remember your luggage may not arrive at the hotel when you do, so it you don't want to wait for it (they will deliver it directly to your room), bring what you need in a carry-on, check it at the bell desk, and head off for the park. By the time we had finished lunch, our luggage had already arrived. We used the online check-in service, told them our arrival would be noon, and when we checked in the room was ready.

During that trip, we went to AKL to have dinner at Boma (delicious!). My husband and I decided then that for our next Disney trip we would stay at AKL. We just got back yesterday, and we loved Animal Kingdom Lodge. My top tips are as follows: 1. Spring for a room with a savanna view. We had giraffes, zebras, pelicans, big horned cattle and more right outside our balcony. My husband and I really enjoyed watching the animals every morning. 2. Get the dining plan, make your reservations early, and don't forget to eat at Boma for breakfast, dinner, or both. It is LOVELY to have all of your meals prepaid and not to worry about how much you're spending. 3. Get the Park Hopper tickets - we'd go to one park during the day for rides and another in the evening for dinner and the parade/fireworks. It was wonderful to come back to Animal Kingdom Lodge in the late afternoon to clean up and gear up for dinner. We'd hang out on the balcony, watch the animals, and never feel like we were wasting valuable Disney time by taking a break in our room. 4. Wake up early and get to the parks about 20-30 minutes before they open. Know which rides are on your Must Do list. Send someone from your group to get Fast Passes for one ride, then go wait in line for a different ride. Use fast passes for the big rides, and you will be able to ride everything. We are planning on a Disney Trip every four years, and we will definitely stay at Animal Kingdom Lodge again.

Breathtaking lobby decor. Plenty of access to animal viewing without getting a room facing the Savannah (animal ranges). We even viewed animals using night vision equipment provided as a complementary experience at the Lodge with a naturalist assisting (9-9:30pm). Quality African furnishings in the room (refrig was included, no microwave) and just spacious enough considering we were at the parks most of the time. Queen sized beds vs. doubles found at moderate Disney resorts. We were a bit worried that the bus trips to the rest of Disney's properties would be lengthy but they were not (though we visited purposefully during low season). It was 5 min to Animal Kingdom, 15 min to Epcot and Hollywood Studies, 18 min to Magic Kingdom. We waited 10-15 min for buses and were never left to wait for another bus. Lines for buses seemed longer for other resorts than for this lodge. The pool was large enough but the slide seems to be more for the 6 and under crowd, not exactly thrilling. We used Simba's cubhouse for childcare one night. Our daughter cried when she had to leave because she was having so much fun. They serve them dinner (4-5 choices at check in)...~$11.50/hr. Boma restaurant served a comprehensive buffet introducing many African dishes (~$30/person or 1 dining plan table service credit). The breakfast buffet was lovely also (~$20/person or 1 dining plan table service credit). The hotel seemed deserted but staff said they were at 98% capacity. That's essentially what we are after.....feeling like you are the only one using the amenities. Food is expensive as it is throughout Disney...$2.75/20 oz soda or water at the machines. Full lunch for 4 was $45 in the carry out Mara restaurant or 4 quick serve credits. Very knowledgible concierge. Able to check bags and get boarding passes. Never stood in line in the lobby.

We were booked in a pool view room (wasnt willing / afford to pay \u00c2\u00a31890 to upgrade). The check in was excellent, the lady who checked us in was everyhting you expect from disney, friendly and polite. Very informative about the resort and let us know everything we need to know. No mention of ugrades and being a shy englishman i didnt mention anything. She gave us our keys and directed us to the elevator. When we walked into our room, about a 5min walk from reception we were delighted. Clean and fresh everything we expect from a Disney deluxe resort. The magic then happened, i opened the balcony door and walked out to me met with Giraffe, Zebra, Ostritch and various othger birds and animals. We had been ugraded to a savannah view and what a view it was. Our savannah was always covered in animals no matter what time of the day it was. We spent alot of time sitting on our balcony looking over the savannah, the view alone is worth the money. We both agreed if we went back we would pay the extra for the savannah view, it truly does make for an amazing experience. Transport was generally good, although you are the furthest resort from most of the parks it never took more than 20mins to get anywhere and buses were very regular. Mousekeeping was excellent, towel animals left and always did an excellent job. All other staff we encountered were excellent and i enjoyed speaking to some of them about their African homelands. Pool area was very nice and clean as were the viewing areas. If you get the chance go to one of the viewing ares at night to look through the nightvision. Food options were good. I found Boma a little crouded and noisey all the time, but the food options were ok and i wouldnt complain about it, but as a couple I wouldnt go back. Jiko is fantastic and one of our favorite Disney restaurants and always try to eat their if we are in Florida whether visiting Disney or not.

Otherwise, while busy, you don't feel crowded. The lobby is spectacular, and the African art scattered throughout the hotel was quite interesting. The service was excellent, Disney's trademark, although it appeared to us that Disney is now waiting for a request to fulfill rather than being pro-active. Major initial problem, the 3rd floor (lobby-level) wheelchair room faced the central savannah at eye level with the observation area - not conducive to privacy or relaxing on the bed while viewing the animals. Our prior stay's wheelchair room on the Sunset savannah is now no longer considered savannah-view due to a major increase in an enclosure outside - which removed the close giraffe viewing opportunities we had enjoyed four years ago. The concierge level was helpful, but primarily for Disney activities. The coffee service there ends at 10 PM - with no provision for night owls. Amazingly the only internet option is a fixed Ethernet port at $10 per day. Hotel staff did pass along the possibility of wifi in the lobby area in the coming year, maybe. The pool area was not relaxing: think massive child's swim party with appropriate noise. Along with the Sunrise Safari, the best new option is the use of night-vision scopes after 9PM at the savannah by the pool. Cool to see the green-lit giraffes and other animals.

In general, I do not complain about hotels. I believe that a review should be based on realistic expectations, the actual price that you paid, and factors within the control of the hotel. That being said, the Animal Kingdom Lodge is a terrible value. And, I do not believe that what happened with my stay is unusal. I booked my room for October 2010 back in January. Since I was with a group, I booked it with a Disney coordinator. I paid full price for a Savanah room on the concierge level ($435.00). Here is what we got: We got a small corner room on the fourth floor. This meant that we had no view of the animals because a huge tree was blocking our view. If you have stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge, you will know what I am talking about. The building curves and my room was at the end of the curve. The end of the Savanah. In addition, our balcony was very public because there was a public porch directly to the left of our room. There was also a firepit directly under us. If the lack of a view, which I paid $435.00 a night for, was the only thing that I did not get for my money, I may not be so harsh. Why? Because, the Animal Kingdom Lodge can always tell me that they can't control where the animals go. Okay, I'll buy that. I judge a hotel by factors which are under its control. However, it was under the hotel's control to put me in a room which had a dead-on view. As a customer paying full-price, I expect to be given the \"full-price\" room. If I was a frequent customer that had \"elite\" customer benefits, then I would expect the \"upgraded\" room if it was available, if no one paid \"full price\" for a room. But, let's talk about the room itself. Because, I paid full price $435.00 a night, Which meant that I expected perfect service. I had no kleenix in the room. Silly, right? At first, I thought that was normal. I figured it was some sort of \"green\" thing. So, we used toilet paper. The turn-down service was just that: They turned down the bed and left chocolates. They didn't straighten anything up. They didn't update the amenities. Nothing. Just turned down the bed, left chocolates and they left. The last night...they didn't even leave chocolates. And, speaking of just leaving: The cleaning crew left everything. The towels where they were, the dirty plates. Everything. I don't know if it is a Disney thing but they didn't touch anything. Not even to clean it. After day two (2) I figured that if I put everything in a pile in the middle of the floor, the cleaning crew would take it. And, the amenities. Let's talk about them. Oh wait. I can't. During my four-night stay, I got one set. This is when I arrived and that was it. By the last night, we were rationing soap. Thank goodness we travel with our own shampoo. Now, before you start thinking that I was on the phone whining to the manager, think again. I never complained to the manager, not once during my stay. Why? Because, the Animal Kingdom Lodge knew that I was paying $435.00 a night for my room. And, they knew it was sub-standard when they put me in it. The only complaint I made was when I first checked in. I called and verified if this was really my room. I asked them to check. They said yes. I asked if my room had been inspected and they said yes. The woman said that they had \"stringent\" quality controls at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Okay. Then, I didn't have to call the manager to tell them it was sub-standard. They apparently already knew it since they had quality controls in place. And, since I was paying $435.00 a night for a room, I was pretty sure that my room was at the top of the list for quality control. And, as a note: I was there with a group. If I had not been there as part of a group event. I would have left. I love Disney. I go to Disney all the time. But, I have never stayed at one of the properties. I was excited for this trip.

Unlike some I thought the food was lovely and plentiful, we booked the Disney Dinning Plan and had some beautiful meals in the hotels, resorts and Downtown Disney, but I would recommend you pre-book because they can get very busy and that way you avoid standing about wasting precious Disney play time. AKL financially is a stretch on the wallet and you could get a hotel in Orlando of a much higher materialistic quality than AKL but you are also paying for the magic that is Disney and I for one would go back tomorrow if I could. The whole experience left me with many many happy memories I will cherish forever and in the many years I have travelled to Disney I would rate this experience as the BEST SO FAR. If I had one thing to moan about it would be ........I only booked two weeks and it should have been four...but I know next time.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Charles, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cAmazingly beautiful, fun & relaxing!\u201d", "Author": "momcrass", "ReviewID": "UR83182684", "Content": "The pool is very nice & has a great waterslide that even the little ones can enjoy.

Our favorite restaurant was Sanaa, which offers a great view of the wild animals from your dinner table, as well as fantastic food. It is a lot of fun to view the animals, and there are several viewing stations around the property. However, while I would strongly recommend a visit to the grounds, I would not recommend staying at this hotel. We had several problems with staff clerical errors. First, they checked us into a double bed room with a bunk bed (we had specifically reserved a king room) with a view of a concrete wall out the balcony. They also charged us more for this room than the single king we had reserved. We had to go back to the front desk to change rooms, and all hotel had available was a two-double bed room. At far cheaper hotels, the staff will often bring new room keys to you if there is a booking error - not so here. We also came during the slowest week of the year, so I would hate to see how the hotel runs during busy season. We purchased two 3 day park hopper tickets from the hotel, of which only one ticket worked when we tried to enter the parks the next day. It took the customer service more than 30 minutes to reissue my ticket, and they charged us again because the park computer systems do not interface with the park hotels, so the parks cannot refund or replace tickets issued at a Disney hotel. The customer service people were very nice about the incident, but it cost us the majority of the \"extra hour\" time that the park was only open to disney resort guests. When we tried to address the issue with the hotel management that evening, we were told that they can only discuss billing problems during normal business hours (ie time that should be spent at the parks). We returned during business hours and were told that a refund would be issued for the one ticket that was defective, and the refund would show up on our final bill. When we checked out, the hotel had accidentally charged us again for the defective ticket instead of refunding the ticket. The staff was very apologetic about the whole matter, but it was frustrating and time consuming. Trying to do anything at the front desk, whether it be checking in, buying the park tickets, or discussing a problem took a lot longer than it should have. Bottom line: buy your park tickets at the parks, not at a Disney hotel, and review your hotel bill very carefully. Also, be very patient anytime you need to approach the front desk. The room service was also a very long wait - we ordered one night after staying late at the parks (the hotel restaurants had closed) and were told that our food would be delivered in 30 minutes. Over an hour later, we called the front desk (because no one would pick up the room service line) and was told by the front desk that we need to talk to room service ourselves to verify that food is actually coming, and if room service doesn't answer, there is nothing the front desk can do. The food did eventually come, but we were about ready to leave the hotel to see if we could find a restaurant elsewhere. The rooms themselves were moderately comfortable, but I would put them slightly below a Best Western. The beds are very hard, and the frames squeak loudly anytime you jostle the mattress at all, so turning over in bed is sure to wake a light sleeper in the room with you. Otherwise, the rooms are average for a 2 star hotel. If you are going to stay at a Disney hotel, you might consider staying at a hotel connected to the monorail, because the busing from hotels to parks is not a fun experience. With the exception of the neighboring Animal Kingdom park, all of the bus rides were fairly long, with a long wait for the bus to come, and the buses were very crowded. The hotel did have nice restaurants, as well as a nice gym and spa. We did not use the pool, but the pool looked nice as well. The parks, as always, were great. I was told that if you stay in the most expensive rooms, the animals will occasionally come up to your balcony in the morning. So if you want to spend the money for the best room, you might like this hotel. Otherwise, just come for dinner and stay somewhere else.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "greenville", "Title": "\u201clove it\u201d", "Author": "kpmdjm", "ReviewID": "UR82686012", "Content": "we stay here almost every trip and we love it.

Our room was ready even though we were early. We were in room 3014 on the Giraffe trail. It was a great location for us. It was pool view, a short walk to the lobby (no stairs or elevators needed) and a short walk to the stairs/elevator to get out to the buses. The room was a nice size. There are double sinks, a closet with hangers, a huge dresser (three very deep large drawers), a balcony with two chairs, and we had two queen beds. Our room was very clean. Mousekeeping did a great job, although we did not get any towel art even with mousekeeping tips. We went to Mara multiple times a day to fill up our water bottle. We had one meal there (cheese flatbread- yum!). We did not eat at Jiko or Boma so I can't comment on the food. The pool was great. There were always plenty of towels and chairs. My stepdaughter enjoyed the slide. The playground was lots of fun when my nieces came to visit from Pop Century. The animals were amazing! we went out to look for them in the mornings, the afternoons before dinner, and then with night vision at night when we returned. It was so wonderful to be able to see them roaming around, often times very close up. My only complaint about the resort was the bus service. We often had to wait for 40+ minutes for a bus. Sometimes they would come but would be full from Kidani. However, I spoke with another group who stayed the same week we did and said they had no problem with the buses (???).

The blankets must be 20 years old, the bathrooms straight Out Of Africa, the worlds tiniest bath towels and the food, the worst we have ever had in any hotel anywhere in the world. The \"Chilled Shrimp\" on the R/S menu were on looks alone, enough to give a solid bout of upset stomach, but upon eating did not disappoint, they really did deliver on the appearance. And the Burger, from the country that deleivered the hamburger, well maybe this place would be better off to call up for Big Mac's. thje delivery time could be no slower.

But then tht is faster than lining up for 20 minutes to get into a hotel restaurant. You cannot complain about portion sizes of the food. They are huge. But who can eat huge amounts of woeful food. Surprisingly, the rooms are very child UN-friendly with high beds and wooden bases that are almost dangerous. With just 2 adults and a 4 yo child in the room, there was no room to swing a cat, or even a mouse. The photos on the website of rooms overlooking the savannah are rooms with glimpses of tired giraffes, a few zebra and some buffalo in what is basically a zoo, do not deliver the image that is promised. The Disney Transport which is amazingly efficient (luckily) picks up and drops off at all the parks, but Animal Kingdom is a 20 minute jammed pack bus ride to the other parks, so unless Animal Kingdom Park is your main focus, I would recommend one of the hotels nearer Magic Kingdom or Downtown etc. Typical Disney \"welcome home\" staff that deliver on the service.

My niece is a huge animal lover so there was never really any other choice when it came to deciding on a hotel to stay in. We booked a meal plan, which I would highly recommend, and we also booked a dinner at Cinderella's Royal Table for my nieces birthday, which I wouldn't - but I'll discuss that a little later. The rooms are of an average size but more than adequate for sleeping / changing and storing your luggage. The balcony with a view of the animals was a great way to entertain a 6 year old while taking it in turns to get ready. Just like Africa? Absolutely not. But just like a 6 year olds Disneyfied perception of what Africa is like? Absolutely. And that's the great thing about the Disney hotels: everything is geared towards satisfying their expectations and everything is tailored to making their time there a special one. What might make me cringe, a six year old will think is absolutely magical. The pool was big enough to never feel too crowded and it was never any trouble getting a lounger. The food at breakfast in Boma was fantastic, although it got a little much for us after a week and I tended to grab a croissant from the Mara cafe (a bit like a fast food place by the pool). We tried Boma a couple of times for dinner, as reservations were never needed. The food there was OK, and with lots of choice, but we tended to prefer the a la carte options. Jiko - the signature restaurant in the hotel - was also very good, and we didn't require a reservation there either. They also serve Tusker lager throughout the hotel which was a nice touch. One of the benefits of staying in the Disney hotel - as well as getting the buses directly into the parks - is the room key system of paying for anything anywhere within the resort. This includes all the shops in downtown Disney aswell (inc the sunglasses shop). However everything around Disney is geared towards parting you from your money, and they are experts at it! There wasn't a day went by that my niece \"needed\" one thing or another, even if it was nearly identical to the thing she'd \"needed\" and bought the previous day. One tip is to try and book as many restaurants as you can as soon as you arrive (or even before you go) as these book up fast. We were given a booklet detailing all the hotels and restaurants when we checked in, and on the third day I rang up the Disney reservation helpline (free from your room) and managed to make dinner reservations at various restaurants for the rest of our time there. The woman on the other end of the phone was extremely helpful in helping us decide on the restaurants based on the cuisine we wanted. Our favourite restaurants were the Japanese Teppan Edo in Epcot and Citrico's at the Grand Floridian Resort, although we enjoyed every meal we had on the dining plan. Except one.... and that was supposed to be the most special meal. As I alluded to in the opening paragraph, we booked a meal at Cinderellas Royal Table at the castle in the Magic Kingdom on the evening of my nieces birthday. She was so excited, and dressed up in her own princess outfit in order to meet Cinderella. The experience up until the meal was magical for my niece - the castle looks and feels real, and she got to meet and chat with Cinderella before posing for a photograph with her. But once you are taken up the stairs to the restaurant, the magic really ends. It's busy, noisy and looks like a regular restaurant. And the food was fairly awful. They do have a kind of song near the end of the meal where Cinderellas mice come out, but by the point the magic had already been lost. Much better, and much cheaper, was the character breakfast we booked at the Animal Kingdom Park. Here you have a regular buffet breakfast but all the Disney characters come round the tables while you're eating and sign the autograph books and take pictures. It was far more informal, and far more enjoyable for my niece. Just seeing the excitement in her face and seeing how real it was for her still makes me smile; this wasn't somebody dressed up in a Donald-duck / Goofy costume, this WAS Donald duck and Goofy. We also got tickets to the Cirque du Soleil, which my niece (mostly!) sat through and was entertained by (we also booked this through the helpline from the room). The only times we ventured outside of Disney was to Florida Mall and to the Universal Studios, and we got a taxi each time. These weren't too cheap, so I'd probably think about hiring a car for a couple of days if I wanted to explore more. Overall, we had an excellent stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. It's not super luxurious, but the atmosphere is relaxed and there's a really good vibe about the place. And the main thing was that my niece loved it. The only thing I'd change is the fact that they only had one room with internet, which was a little frustrating given the size of the hotel. The service wasn't fantastic either, but I think that has more to do with the corporation than the hotel itself. You are better arranging anything you need through the central Disney helpline, which is free to call from inside your room.

I was worried that the rooms would be too dark, however this was not the case. I loved my room, from the African wallpaper, tiles and shower curtain in the bathroom, through to the African shield on the door. It was all so different and a change from the usual decor of most hotels. I did not find the beds the most comfortable ever though, they did creak a lot and were quite high off the ground, that I worried my daughter would really hurt herself should she fall out of bed. I had a standard room, near the lobby which was great. We did consider upgrading and paying more for a savannah room, but knowing what I know now, I am glad i didnt pay the extra. I think you have ideas that the savannahs are full of animals, but there are not as many as you think, and in my opinion does not warrant the huge supplement . Disney Dining Plan was great, cannot fault the food. Boma although amazing was a bit loud/mad/busy most of the time. Disney bus service excellent and I thought the distance to the parks was fine and not too far away, although the bus to Downtown Disney is about the furthest/longest as stops at Typhoon Lagoon first. If i had to complain about one thing, it would be the pool. It is extremely busy, day and night. Wouldnt recommend paying for a pool view if you like to sit on your balcony for peace and quiet. Would of loved a quiet pool and think just the one pool is a mistake. We went late on about 9.30 pm one night, and it was still crazy, too busy to be enjoyable.

The animals, the various savannahs, the gorgeous (and clean) pool and the easy access to the park.

The rooms on the fifth floor are part of the Disney Vacation Club (although we are not DVC members and booked this accommodation as you would a regular room via the website) and were a really nice alternative to the standard room given the full kitchen in the one bedroom suite (kitchenette in the studio) and laundry machine. Because we were not DVC members, we had daily housekeeping service which was excellent. As you would expect with Disney World properties, the service and hospitality was excellent throughout. The food in the restaurants was good. I heard more complaints about the Disney Dining Plan than I heard kudos, but am told it's a wonderful way to save some money. The bell desk is 100% full service. They received and held a motorized scooter for a member of our traveling party. They also received, held and refrigerated groceries for us which we had ordered online (http://gardengrocer.com/) and had delivered to the hotel . Just a couple notes, if you are staying in the DVC rooms (whether DVC or not), detergent for laundry is provided (but not dryer sheets). Dishwashing liquid and automatic dishwasher detergent is also provided as are towels and sponges. I didn't know this and had ordered some from the grocer. This was our third stay at this hotel and we would not hesitate to stay here again. Transportation to all parks is via bus with Animal Kingdom being the closest. The staff throughout Disney is so helpful and friendly. And the families traveling there are also quick to help a stranger, too. The animals visible from the savannah view rooms are always neat, too. Even if you don't have a savannah view, there are many points throughout the hotel to see animals for everyone... including while walking from your room to the lobby sometimes... depending on which wing you are in. I would probably suggest going to one of the full service spas around Disney, if you are looking for a relaxing afternoon as the one in the AKL is four treatment rooms right off the workout area and is more akin to what you might find at your local gym.

Not so much. We arrived with online check in and were greeted as we got out of the car with our Disney \"package\". While I am all for hurrying things along, this didn't make me feel welcomed just rushed. I couldn't ask a front desk person questions about the room or about the celebrations I had planned. Didn't like it. Plus our package of material had a map of the hotel and a sheet of what was happening at the hotel. At other properties, even with online check in, you get the brochures from the parks, and all sorts of other paperwork. But the real disappointment was when we went to our room. We stayed here six years ago - and thought it was nice. Either my mind has shaded it rosy - or I just liked the animals. Although we had a Disney passholder discounted rate, the fact that they gave us (or anyone) that room is quite sad. Room 4009 has a bunk bed and a queen in the size of a cracker box. The balcony overlooked the parking lot but there would be no way for an adult to get on it. As you opened the door, it was not a sliding door but one that pushed forward, it actually touched the railing. The balcony had to be less than 24\" wide. It barely fit a chair so it wasn't very long either! I called down to see if our room could be changed. Was told someone would call me back. 25 minutes later, I called again (I would have gone down but I was afraid my luggage would get delivered and I'd miss it). I got someone who said they had another room available on the 4th floor with a limited view. I said that would be fine. We went down to 4259 and the room was larger. I know they advertise the rooms at 380sf or so but that first one was much smaller. Plus, our new room had a balcony that went across the length of the room like most balconies do. We had a view of animals (giraffe, zebras, elands, ostriches, African cattle, vultures, etc) the entire time so I do not think the view was limited at all. It was great. But the room itself is very small for a deluxe. We had bunk beds and a queen. Every time you moved on the queen it made noise. LOUD noises. The springs were horrid. I woke up all night just rolling over! The bath supplies were face and bath soap, shampoo and conditioner. At the Polynesian, they throw in shower gel and lotion and a lot of other goodies. There is no way to compare the two hotels. Animal Kingdom is a deluxe moderate - but not a deluxe. It has one shop. Just like Port Orleans or any other moderate. But it is deluxe in the size and look of the lobby - plus two sit down restaurants. The slide/pool were about the same as Port Orleans Riverside. The animals are the draw here. But by the 5th day, you don't even go to the window to look out. There is a flat screen television, coffee maker, and small fridge. The rooms are clean and we had Disney towel animals daily. I can't see myself staying here again. Absolutely LOVE Boma's for breakfast. Haven't done dinner there in years. But I love the breakfast. Mara's is the food court type of restaurant - nothing special. Ice cream offerings are only prepackaged bars/sandwiches. I was really looking forward to the night vision goggles everyone talks about thinking we could go exploring. Nope! There is a lookout room - where people get in line to wait for the two pair of goggles. There is an attendant to hand you the goggles. The line flows as the family involvement is. Meaning, for our family - we took about five minutes or less for all of us to get a look. Meanwhile, a man and his 7 year old son were there when we got there and still there when we left asking all sorts of questions about the animals they were viewing. We waited about 20 minutes for our view at 9:00. Keep in mind, these are the same giraffe/zebras/elands you see all day. The only difference is they are green. If you rate just the rooms, this hotel is a moderate but throw in the animals - and there's where it gets the deluxe rating. We were there for my husband's 50th birthday - which I think should be a huge event and my daughter's birthday as well. They did give the room one birthday card (we gave to her) and a birthday cake towel. They did nothing special - and when you take into account our first room, they really could not care less about celebrations and trying to make your stay a little more magical. It would not have hurt them at all to give us the 4259 room right off the bat. But they gave us 4009 first - which just really does not make sense. Unless the hotel is packed solid - NO ONE should have to have that room! In our room, we could hear the neighbors when they flushed the toilet - and when they used the sliding glass door.

Although my parents did mention that they probably wouldn't do the Savannah view again since they only got to see a giraffe twice from the room.

We had this issue on our last day where we walked up to the bus stop for Blizzard Beach/Hollywood Studios right as that bus drove away, so we had to wait for 20 mins and when the bus finally arrived, everyone who had only been waiting for 5 mins or so rushed the bus and were all able to get on and get seats. I was able to get one (thankfully since I am 6 months prego and had a 1.5 year old to carry) but the rest of my family had to stand. I think that next time we visit, we'll try to stay somewhere near Epcot since it seems to be more centrally located. We were on the Quick Service dining plan, which was absolutely great! We each got 2 meals and 2 snacks per day and ended up using the last 2 meals for breakfast on our last morning and ended up with 6 leftover snacks, which was fine. We didn't try Boma or Jiko since we didn't want to spend the money, but the food at the Mara was very good. My only gripe is that I wished that they had another menu that they would swap out every 2 or 3 days, because after a few days of eating the same exact thing every morning for breakfast or dinner gets old fast. It was nice to be able to use them in all the parks though. We found out that we could get creative though since each came with an entree, drink and dessert I would swap out the dessert for another drink. I needed water more than a brownie most of the time anyway. Or if we were at a place that had snacks they would let us swap in a snack instead of their dessert options. It takes a few days to get the hang of the meals plans, but luckily every person we dealt with at the registers was great at making sure we got the most bang for our buck. We did both water parks, first Typhoon Lagoon on Wednesday then Blizzard Beach on Saturday. We weren't super early risers since we would be out at the parks late at night, and got the Typhoon around 11:30am and it was PACKED. To the point where it took us about 30 mins to find an chair....then trying to find a spot in the shade to put it was another task in itself. I found that you really need a spot to call your own, especially with a little one. So while we were at that park eating lunch I called the WDW phone number and got connected to the Recreation dept and I booked a private cabana for Blizzard Beach. It's not cheap ($250, plus tax), but for an entire day you get a private area with 6 chairs, an umbrella, a few little tables, a locker and a cooler with waters. You also have a person who comes to check on you every 20-30 mins and will bring you your towels and will also order your lunch and deliver it to you. Worth every penny in my book. They only have 8 cabanas though so I would highly recommend booking ahead of time. Most every cast member that we dealt with was very helpful and friendly. Although the lady that painted my daughters face in Toon Town was the rudest person ever. She barely said two words to us and never once cracked a smile. I have a hard time biting my tongue, so I kept repeating \"Pixie dust, pixie dust\" in my head so I wouldn't rip her head off. The hotel staff was amazing. My parents lost a pair of reading glasses and they credited them $200 for them. Our room was clean when we arrived and remained that way during our entire stay. The fridge is great since you can really stock up on snacks and drinks from the Mara and keep them in there, also great for us with a baby to have a place to store milk and juice. The room is not huge, especially if you need to set up the portable crib...that really made it hard to move around the room, but it's Disney so how much time do you really need to spend in the room! The beds were very comfortable, but very noisy! Everytime I would roll over or switch positions, I was afraid I would wake up the baby.... Oh and if you want to see Fantasmic, get there super early! We got there an hour ahead of time and it was already full. I also highly recommend the Wishes Dessert Party: http://www.disunplugged.com/2009/06/24/disney-debuts-magic-kingdom-wishes-dessert-party/ We made reservations a few months prior and had a great seat for tht fireworks. Don't worry about getting there too early to wait in line and get a good table, they already have the tables assigned since it's by reservation only.", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBest disney hotel ever\u201d", "Author": "jodola13", "ReviewID": "UR76208835", "Content": "Stayed at AKL 03/08 2010 for two weeks and its the best hotel i have ever stayed in.

We booked our vacation directly through Disney. We chose AKL, premium dining plan, and concierge level. We were beyond happy with our choices! From the minute we drove up to the hotel the staff was friendly, accomodating, and full of information. With the concierge level you get met at the doors and personally taken to your room where you will be checked in. Our room had bunkbeds and a queen bed, this arrangement was perfect for us and felt roomier. Another bonus was our amazing view of the savannah and animals. The concierge level is also worth it for the lounge. AKL provides food throughout the day, drinks, and has staff on hand for any needs. A lot of people say isn't it too much food and drinks when you have concierge and the dining plan but we used our dining plan credits to eat at all of the nicer restaurants (usually 2 credits) and so the lounge was perfect when we didn't have a meal booked. All of the staff at AKL was terrific but especially the concierge staff. We decided at the last minute to add an extra night onto our vacation. Naturally we couldn't stay in our concierge room (School vacation weeks = sold out) but the staff moved us to another room and checked us out and back in right there in the concierge lounge. Tips: When you book concierge level and dining plans they will be good for the entire day when you check out of the hotel! When we moved rooms we were no longer concierge level and our cards reflected that. However our old cards were still good until that evening. It sounded crazy to us but if any of the theme parks are open till 2 A.M. (like when we were there) sleep in late and stay at the parks until they close. We were able to go on every ride we wanted to with no lines! If you are driving to Disney or renting a car pay to have valet service. We made a lot of dining reservations at other properties. We looked into the Disney transit service but decided to just take our own car.

After several weeks of frustration with the Disney website getting our hotel and meal plan accomodations, the day finally arrived. We had reserved a king bed (we thought) but when we checked in, we were told they had only two queen beds. We were puzzled. \"We are on our honeymoon and we booked a king bed.\" No help. She told us that all kings were booked, but if we would take a queen bed for a few nights, they would find us a king bed as soon as possible. Disgusted without how the first evening started, we went up to our room. We found both of our rooms clean and tidy. The rooms were nothing more or less generous than any other hotel. We had some difficulty getting soap, though each day they cleaned our room and left us every other toiletry item. The hotel is the furthest from any park, and taking a bus to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot was a time consuming adventure. The Disney busses did not appear to show up to the hotel on a regular basis, but when they did arrive, we usually had an opportunity to get on any bus we wanted without having to wait for the next. About seven days into our ten day adventure, we decided we wanted to go to Daytona Beach and so we decided we would need a car. We called the front desk for information regarding a rental car, and they were no help at all. They refused to assist. Disney does NOT want you going off property for ANY reason, so they are certainly not going to help you get a car to leave. We finally called a local company and found that Disney actually has a rental car company ON THEIR PROPERTY. After renting a car, we discovered that we should have done that from the beginning. If you have a key to your hotel, you can park for free at any park, and it's a lot easier to get around to the parks in a rental car - especially if you have dinner reservations and don't want to spend an hour and a half park hopping to get to the right resort and restaurant. The front desk and concierge service was abyssmal. It seemed that any request we had from trying to find a massage to finding out the schedule of fire works at a park were all met with \"I don't know.\" One night we tried to rent a DVD player to watch a DVD we had brought. The front desk informed us that there were no DVD players for rent to the hotel guests. So we went out and bought a DVD player at Wal-Mart. When we brought it back to hook up to the television in the room, we found that the back of the entertainment center was bolted closed and there was no way to hook up the player to the tv. UGH! I won't make this a review of the parks, but the restaurants in the hotel were not spectacular. We did not get to eat in the large buffet style cafeteria but I heard that the food was pretty good there. We did eat in the fancier restaurant on the first floor but it was farm from the best food of the trip. We did see plenty of animals from both of our rooms. Mostly giraffes. The pool and hot tubs were a welcomed respite, and not too crowded. Despite the number of rooms in the hotel (and quite a walk to most of them from the lobby) we did not feel over crowded. The laundry facilities were easily accessible and relatively convenient if not a bit expensive. The rooms were quiet, but they certainly are not designed to keep you indoors. Disney wants you out of the room and spending your money in their parks and in their gift shops. That's also the reason behind them keeping DVD players and hookups out of the room. In the end, the hotel experience was more than adequate, but it was far from the honeymoon romance we desired. But again, if we wanted more relaxation and romance, we would have gone elsewhere. For what it was, we had a pleasant stay, but the luster you expect from a Disney property was certainly not present.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antrim, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat holiday\u201d", "Author": "cynfranelle", "ReviewID": "UR74183798", "Content": "husband daughter and i stayed here for 2 special dates our daughters 4th birthday and our 21st anniversary and it was fab from the minute we got there to we left was all we expected and more. we arrived and were given room overlooking carpark but i said i would not be happy with it so lovely girl in reception changed us right away to a suvanagh room with great views how happy were we.

We saw animals (giraffes, storks, cranes, ankole cattle, water buffalo, eland etc etc) from our balcony every day. The decor was very in keeping with what you would imagine African decor to look like. It appeared well kept and saw no visible wear and tear. There are lifts located all around the hotel. There is also a coin operated laundry area for guests to use. We spent $1 on detergent and $2 on washing and another $2 on drying and all was washed and dry within 50 mins. There are 3 places where you can eat. The Mara which is a canteen type eaterie that serves all day (06.30-00.00) although lunch/dinner can get boring unless you like burgers/pizzas and chicken nuggets. Price wise average breakfast we spent $15 for 2. There is a buffet style restaurant called Boma which serves breakfast and dinner and i would highly recommend this especially the desserts namely the zebra dommes (ladies that is definately one to try). Price wise the breakfast buffet was $23.99 and dinner was $34.99 plus taxes and tips. There is a 3rd restaurant called Jiko, but we did not try this as the food on the menu did not appeal. Looking at the menu average cost for a main meal was about $30 plus tax. The lobby in the hotel is very appealing to the eye and there are plenty of places to sit and relax with also a tv playing disney films for the children.

I was pleasantly surprised - the room wasn't as small as I had been led to believe; it was fine for the three of us with two queen beds. Bathroom was a bit disappointing, shower with curtain over the bath, very small area. A couple of corridors along from the lobby, once we had tried a couple of routes we found the best way. View of savannah was good from our room, we had giraffes and zebras very close to our window (on 2nd floor, room 2252) most of the time, apart from about four days when there was nothing at all. If you are struggling to pay for the savannah room I would suggest you don't bother. There are numerous viewing places all over the hotel and for the two minutes a day (max) you are looking out of the window is it worth it?? Also there are night viewing areas with night-vision goggles around the grounds. We had planned to sit on the balcony at night watching the animals with a bottle of wine while our daughter slept, but it was very humid and so couldn't stand to. As for being out of the way, this didn't affect us at all. We drove to the parks instead of getting the bus as I couldn't be bothered to wait and wanted to be in control of when we left, heading off to restaurants etc after the parks. Jiko is good but expensive.. Boma gets old very quickly, and if you are on the dining plan a meal there counts as table service, although is technically a buffet. Mara is the fast food canteen but is fine for dining plan grub. If you're paying for your meals, go to cracker barrell for breakfast, was definately much better value and quality. There is a shortcut off to the 192 (Sherbeth Rd) right near AKL which saves time. We were lucky to get the dining plan thrown in as part of our deal but I don't know if I would have paid for it. Even for free, you have to consider the 20% tip per meal. So for a Jiko (two point per person) meal for two with a glass of wine you are looking at about $20-$25 dollars for a tip. If you are on the dining plan, paid for or not, read up about the dining plan before you go and of course plan your reservations. The pool area is good but very busy and people reserve chairs very early, sometimes not using them all day which is annoying. Free pool towels which is handy. The fitness centre was a bit outdated but practically empty the (few) times I visited. We used Simba's Cub house twice for evening child care - my girl was the only kid there the first night but three the second.

I have to be honest, i was a little nervous about the Magical Express baggage pick up and bus situation. But no need to worry disney pulled it off with no problems! We just checked our bags in Virginia and through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Disney magic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they were in our rooms by the time we returned from the park on our first night.

It has a mini fridge, flat screen TV, Safe, Small table ect. The BEST part about this room was the Savanna view/balcony. My wife and I spent every night and early morning sitting out on the balcony while our child slept. A few nights we could even hear and see the fireworks from the Magic Kingdom! Also, at night the giraffe would lay down in front of our room! I would recommend the 3rd floor and up, if you have a choice. We also spent sometime every day at the pool. It was great and refreshing on those hot florida summer days! It is a large pool with a small kids type slide. I think the max depth was under 5 foot. It ha large lights that keep it well light at night. There is a small bar, and plenty of seating. They also have life jackets for kids. There is a small kids pool and a small hot tub also. There are 3 restaurants at the hotel. We ate at Boma, and the Mara while we were there. I would HIGHLY recommend a Disney Dining plan, and the meals can be expensive. We had the Deluxe plan for everyone in our family. This includes 3 meals and 2 snacks per day for everyone. We ended up having 5 meals left over and used all of our snacks. We did ask on the last day if we could exchange out some of our meals for snacks, which they gladly did at a rate of 3 snacks per meal. So we had plenty of snacks for the plane ride back! We also received 3 refillable resort drink mugs! These were great because you could fill them with any of the soda, tea, or coffee at the mara drink stand. We ate breakfast @ the Mara/Boma most of the mornings that we were at the resort. Dinner at Boma is excellent! I would recommend making a reservation though, as it is really busy. We did walk in 1 night, but had to wait 45 mins. I read a lot of complaints about the distance of the hotel to the parks and having to wait for the bus. We only had a problem with the busses one night. The first night we stayed at the magic kingdom until it closed (to watch the parade and fireworks) we had to wait about 40mins for the bus. This was ONLY because everyone was trying to leave the park at the same time. Other then that, we waited a max of 10-20 mins for a bus. It was very easy! Its about a 20min ride to the Magic Kingdom (the furthest park away). I can tell you this, after a long day at the park, i didn't mind the 20min in the A/C of the bus.

The hotel was very quiet at night and we were able to get a good rest after our long days. Bus transfer to the parks was fairly efficient and we usually did not have to wait terribly long. The distance from Magic Kingdom/Epcot I thought was the biggest draw back to this beautiful hotel. We found the bus trip to be rather long especially if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a seat. This was especially difficult with our stroller, bags and four year old daughter in tow. We ate one breakfast and two lunches at the Mara quick service restaurant and it was good. I regretted a bit not getting a refillable mug when we first got there as it would have been handy for morning coffees and drinks by the pool. The dining plan portions are huge with a massive dessert accompanying each one. We found the two huge meals a day to be even more food than we needed. We also dined at Boma one evening. Boma was a treat with its fabulous African themed buffet. The pool area was huge and beautiful. It easily rivals the pools we encountered at Beaches resorts. Much busier though. This pool is full of people from morning to night, much like all of Disney. Getting a lounge chair proved to be difficult sometimes with so many people at the pool and likely many not even at the pool but reserving their chair. Services available that we used on site were the gift shop for milk /beer and souvenirs, the concierge for reservations and questions, the photopass desk and laundry facilities. In the heat we were going through clothes like crazy and needed to do wash about 5 days into our trip. Other nice features of the hotel are the playground, the viewing area, and the activities throughout the day. This hotel could be a destination in itself and we would have liked to have more time to spend at the property. I would highly recommend AKL to get away from it all after the long hot days in the park. It would have been a bit disappointing though if we had got a poolside room. You would lose the peacefulness and feeling of getting away from it all. It was a great place to see and stay at once. Should our travels ever take us back to Disney, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d likely try to get a deluxe resort closer to the park on the monorail. You spend enough time waiting in Disney and we found the travel time took up too much precious time on an already jam packed schedule.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort/Magical Time/Amazing Birthday\u201d", "Author": "_lovetotravel4_33514", "ReviewID": "UR72255592", "Content": "Stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge- Jambo House Villas last June. I am planning another trip and was reading some of these recent reviews and I felt compelled to share my experience .This resort is exotic and beautiful the moment you walk in. The staff greeted us quickly. Check in was very fast and friendly even though they were busy. Our room was a little jaunt from the lobby where you walk out and catch the buses and the pool and both restaurants but this gave us more opportunity to catch another view of different animals as your walking through the halls and good exercise. If the boys were getting antsy while my husband and I were gathering last minute things or still getting ready, they would go to several different animal look out spots and try to name the different ones and spot any new animals. They would also go to the lobby where they played great African music and there are several comfortable spots to sit and watch childrens movies or disney cartoons while waiting. There is alot of art and interesting artifacts to see as well. I traveled with my two sons 6 and 16 and husband. Arrived on a Wednesday stayed till the following Tuesday. First night ate at Boma it was very good, large variety of food. We planned this trip to celebrate my 6 year old sons birthday and everything was absolutely amazing for him and well everyone. While the boys swam and rode the slide, my husband and I sat and watched them and sipped on a few cocktails. It was nice they had complimentary life jackets for little ones. The slide does drop off into about 31/2 4 feet of water. Wearing the jacket made my 6yr old feel much better. The pool is not as large as other resorts it is very clean and relaxing with plenty of towels and lounge chairs and the landscaping was lovely. They also have a spa which is situated over by this beautiful bird area. You can watch many different types. Again, the staff was very helpful and friendly. Housekeeping was great, again very pleasant and prompt. We took one day for some down time slept in and did a bit of laundry which was convenient to have in the hotel but we did have to walk a little bit to reach it, not a big deal though. Our room was great, clean, roomy we had a king size bed and a sofa sleeper, the bed was very comfortable and the dark blinds were very nice if you sleep in once in awhile. Sink, mini fridge, coffee maker, table chairs flat screen tv lots of toiletries, the balcony was so cool to sit out there in the morning and evenings and just gaze out at the Serengeti. Ok well almost. I feel bad for the other guests who had some issues at AKL. If they read anything about the resort they were staying at they should of know the AKL is the furthest hotel from all the parks which of course would take a bit longer. Never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get a bus only because we happened to miss the one pulling away. Your on vacation and have spent alot of money to have this experience, shouldnt you slow down a bit and relax. Instead of constantly rushing? The gift shop was great they had many snacks and grocery items you could take to your room and stick in the mini frig(cereal,milk, yogurt) and many great gifts. One minor glich we did not realize, one day we were at one park and felt like we were done there so we headed to Epcot to use another days ticket to enter there and they would not let us. We knew we had one extra park day to use since we had that lounging day and then went to Downtown Disney instead and did not use our park ticket that day. Unless you buy the Park Hopper add on you can only enter one park a day. Oh well we just went back to the first park and had more fun there and did more shopping. We did pay extra for the savannah view with our room and we loved loved it. Every morning to wake up to giraffes and zebras and amazing birds it was just incredibe and beautiful. I just can't say enough. When I told the boys we were taking this trip, this was the first place they wanted to stay. So worth it. While we were at the Magic Kingdom on Thursday the actual day of my 6year olds birthday we purchased a gift ahead of time, in which they came to our room while we were at the parked and had several different decorated boxes with different gifts inside from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy and Pluto and Tink. They sprinkled pixie dust in the room, tink was waiting for him Mickey left several gifts including his autograph and so many other gifts-cant mention them all. My son was amazed at how they knew it was his birthday and where he was staying. To walk in and have the entire room sprinkled with different size boxes and gifts was just so so Magical, if you could only see his face. Everyone at the Animal Kingdom Lodge and every park we went to made my son feel incredibly special. They wished him Happy Birthday and stop and talk to him and he was able to steer the Jungle Safari boat at the Magic Kingdom Park and wore the captain hat. Ok Ok enough there were so many magical wonderful things that happened I could go on and on. So to finish up the Tuesday day of check out we left all our luggage with the concierge staff and let them know we would be back for the Magical Express bus later to take us to the airport but we were heading to Epcot one last time and they took care of all our belongings. We still had meals on our Dining Plan that was not used. We did purchase the plan which gives you one table service meal one quick service meal and one snack per person each day. Alot Alot of food it was great What we did is we went to Epcot ordered our lunch and then asked a few people behind us if we could buy them lunch, to use up our plan so as not to waste it. They were shocked. What an incredible trip. My soon to be 18 year old wants to spend his birthday here in September.

Cast members were all over the place, all eager to answer questions and/or offer assistance. We had a one bedroom villa, savanna view. Giraffes, zebras, ostriches, and other animals were right outside our room! The room was very comfortable with a sleeper sofa and sleeper armchair (about the width of a daybed and very comfy), plus a king bed in the separate bedroom. Two full baths and a full kitchen, plus washer and dryer. It was very spacious but still very cozy.Our room was a short walk from the lobby, and just a couple of doors down from the laundry room, arcade, and community room; yet it was very quiet. Only twice was I able to hear people chatting while walking in the hall. Noise is not a problem here... Sanaa (restaurant) is just lovely: Indian food with some African influences (try the orange-sesame cake for dessert; amazing!). We all loved our dinners. I worried about the distance and waiting/transit times to the parks (I read many comments online and in guidebooks from people griping about this issue). But we went in \"high season\" and never waited longer than 10 minutes for a bus to or from any park (and we left the parks at closing time every night we were there). Also, the buses are shared by Jambo house and Kidani village; I didn't feel that the shared route made the commute to/from the parks any longer. I will definitely return. Only one issue: no food court. We used a meal plan and realized we had a lot of counter service credits left the night before we departed. I think if we had been nearer to a food court, we would have used them all up. (The nearest food court is at Jambo house, a decent walk.) There was a little golf cart that shuttled guests to and from Jambo house, but only in the daytime. Still, with better meal planning on my part, I will be back to Kidani village.

We saw animals from our patio at all times of the day (pelicans, zebras,ankole cattle, girafffe and more). The rooms themselves are small for a family of 4 and their luggage. As well as the great savanna view from our room, we could see the top of Everest over the trees. As for \"club level rooms\", the club lounge is on the 6th floor. We were on the 4th and it was quite a walk to the lounge. The lounge has ample supply of beverages and different snacks throughout the day, we went most mornings for the breakfast items. I was disappointed the lounge closed around 10pm. We usually arrived back at the resort from the parks after that time and would have liked to have stopped in for beverages. The biggest disappointment for us at the AKL was the bus transportation to all the parks. Our wait times were anywhere from 15-35 minutes to get a bus leaving the resort and coming back from the parks it was usually a 30-60 minute wait. I do not remember wait times being so long on previous visits at other resorts. As a deluxe resort I would expect less wait times. We were there 10 days, so we could afford to wait because we had plenty of days at the parks, however, we needed to plan on at least an hour transportation time to be on time for dinner reservations at EPCOT.

We stayed in a savannah view room - we saw giraffe and other animals outside of our room daily - definitely a unique experience. There are plenty of areas around the hotel for viewing the animals, and if you don't want to spring the extra $100+/night for the view, you can get by seeing the animals throughout the hallway windows and the many viewing areas in the hotel. We ate at BOMA one night (just okay) and the Mara for breakfast and lunch (good food, a bit chaotic with kids at times). We didn't eat at Jiko, but peeked in and it was mainly empty for the nights we were there. The pool at AKL was smaller than expected, and crowded! We visited the pool at the villas - a long walk away but worth the smaller crowd. My main complaint about this hotel is that it is FAR FAR FAR from everywhere else in Disney, except for Animal Kingdom. The bus ride alone to Magic Kingdom is a full 20 minutes, and when you add in wait times for the shuttle (which always seemed to be longer for AKL than the other hotels), it takes at times a full hour to get to anywhere else on the Disney grid.

Buffet breakfast at Boma was lovely, so much choice with some of it African themed, ate there once for dinner which was also lovely but then discovered the signature restaurants!!

The imposing building and large front driveway leading up to the building is the first to greet you. There is no shortage of staff to greet you or ask if you need help. Once inside there is a large foyer with African details throughout. Lots of lounge chairs and even a TV playing old Disney cartoons to entertain. The concierge could book your activities or get you tickets. We also got tickets to a Luah at the Polynesian Village Hotel. At the back of the lobby was a large window which must have been the entire 5 stories tall. Lots of African artifacts to look at all over. Even a Caricature artist was stationed there each evening. Our hotel room overlooked the Arushna Savanna and almost every night, a giraffe was sleeping right infront of our balcony. Each day we would see giraffe, zebra and various African animals and birds. The staff at this hotel and all of the theme parks can't do enough to make your stay memorable. The room was a large double (wouldn't say it was a queen) with bunk beds and not overly large. The bathroom was dimly lit and the door almost swung into the toilet so it was very small. At least there were 2 sinks on the other side of it. That helped. The pool was large and open 24 hrs. There was a small children's slide. It was lifeguarded from 10-10 each day with a Tikki bar. The restaurants were nice looking but we didn't eat at them. We had booked other restaurants at each of the theme parks we went to each day. The quick service cafeteria had food. We only ate there for 1 breakfast and a late night snack. It was a little pricey but no different than the theme park prices. They even sold microwave foods since there was a microwave in this cafe as the hotel room itself only had a fridge in it. We saw people making their own toast for breakfast there and if you bought a refillable mug, you could add any pop or coffee at any time in any of the hotels. That would be a challenge as they are pretty strict on security and we were screened each time we entered and exited the hotel. If you stayed at this hotel you could visit the Villas next door and use their facilities. The pool was smaller but had a different slide. From there you could see more animals too. There were staff stationed outside each outer area to ask questions. A nice \"cast member\" from Nairobi I believe chatted with us about the giraffes. At night you could observe them through night vision goggles too. There were children's activities each day. You could also pay to have babysitting service. My 9 and 11 year old only took advantage of crayon etchings of African animals on the floor of the lobby. They were also going to make cookies after that but we declined the offer as we were off to a theme park. The hotel offered the free Disney shuttle buses but we had a rental so never used the service as you were given free parking to each theme park with your stay. We also saw cruise line buses picking up people and also airport shuttle buses. Although the room was pricey it was worth having a Savannah view even if we did it just once. There were observation decks for guests to see the animals, but with it being so hot and humid and there were mosquitos at night, it was nice to slip back into the room quick after you took photos of the animals. We did luck out as not all of the Savannah rooms would get animals parked out infront of their balcony. We just happened to be given a lobby level room that was infront of a feeding station. The grounds staff were always out each day cutting the grass and tending to the animals' needs. They seemed to be well cared for. Our maid (\"mousekeeper\") made different animals out of the towels for the first couple days after we left a tip each day for her. Not sure if all the housekeepers do that. She was very thankful for the money and personally thanked us on the last morning of our stay. Although the location was the farthest away from the Magic Kingdom, it really only amounted to about 15 mins. by car. Not sure how long on a bus. It was very secluded. There was a McDonald's close by but it seemed to have \"tourist prices\". The parking lot was very large and required a bit of a hike up the hill if you didn't park near the front. What we liked the most was having the African experience and feeling like you were actually in some of the countries there, also the fact, you could spend your entire stay right at the hotel and have something to see or do. The villa next door also had tennis courts and basketball. If there was something that we didn't like so much, it would have to be the size of the room. The pillows were also very tall and my neck started hurting after a couple days. Also, you had to pay for the internet ($14/day). At the prices they charge, it should really be included. What was nice in the room was the fact the air conditioner was very quiet which makes a change from many hotel rooms. We also used the laundry facilities too. That seems to have covered most of the hotel. It really did add a great deal of pleasure to our whole Disney experience. After a long, hot tiring day out at the parks, it was great to be able to come back here. The security guard would even say that each time you came back , \"Welcome Home\".

Great free self parking too. The only issue is with the price of the rooms...a 3 night stay durring peak would have been almost $1500, good thing we only paid 1/2 other wise you can find cheeper.

The attention to detail in the architecture is second to none, as is the service. The rooms are not large, but are beautifully furnished in African style. I found the bed a little hard but I suppose that's a question of taste. We were able to use the pool at Kidani Village aswell as the one at Jambo Lodge which made a nice change and meant that neither pool was too busy. The Mara foodcourt was fairly priced for Disney and had a good selection (not just the usual burger and pizza), however beware of the buffet breakfast at Boma.

The food was great, and i would really reccomend going on a dining plan as it saved us a lot of money.

It was over 1,000 steps to the front door from our room. This doesn't sound all that terrible - but when you forget something in your room and don't realize it until you are at the bus stop, or consider that all of the dining options are on the OTHER side of the resort, or you have spent the entire day walking in a park - you will realize that this resort is extremely LARGE. We had reserved a Savanna view room, and our view was of the Arusha Savanna. You WILL see animals - but keep in mind that animals and humans have different schedules! Very early morning and early afternoon/evening is when we saw animals. It doesn't get any better than seeing a giraffe first thing in the morning, feeding outside your room! It's quite incredible! As far as the service - the front desk staff wasn't all that great. The young lady that checked us in was really unsure of everything. She didn't have definitive answers to any of our questions. Later during the week we stopped by to change a dining reservation, we really had a tough time working with the guy at the front desk. The hallways leading to our room were not clean, there was a lot of dust and dirt in the corners - and a lot of the lower wallpaper was damaged from the mousekeeping carts. When the decor of the hotel is meant to look a little worn, there is a fine line between worn - and dirty. We bought refillable mugs - but we always had to take them with us in the morning if we didn't want to walk 2,000+ steps round to the counter service location. It is a LONG walk! The pool is great - but you may want to consider taking clothes and changing in the pool locker rooms if you are assigned a room on the Kudu Trail as it's not fun going all the way from the Kudu Trail to the Pool and back in wet clothes, wet sandals etc. As with all the Disney Resorts the toiletry amenities are great - the H20 brand products are great! All in all - this resort is beautiful, and it has a lot of really unique benefits, opportunities, and features that are not available at any other resort.... let alone a Walt Disney World Resort. While it's not our favorite resort (Wilderness Lodge is!) it's a great place to stay, and does have a lot in common with Wilderness Lodge, it just isn't the same! We have stayed at several Disney hotels, and this just wasn't on par with the rest. The animals are a big draw, but you can go see the animals even if you aren't staying at AKL.

This resort is just amazing as soon as you start driving towards the main gate you know you are about to see something special. As soon as you see Jambo House you'll know what I mean!!! When you walk through the massive entrance into the huge lobby that has so much to look at you wont know where to begin. We were treated exceptionally from the begin we had separate park tickets that we purchased before leaving for the US and I remember from previous visits as child/teenager that you can combine your room key with your Disney Pass I enquired about this and before I knew it they had already done it on reception for me. The receptionist was very nice and was brimming with information although as a frequent visitor growing up I knew a lot of the information needed she asked us about ourselves and our visit and really made a fuss about us after we told her about it being our honeymoon. She gave us the just married pins and some additional pins which came in handy later on in trip with loads of express passes and being greeted with \"Congratulations\" from every cast member and other visitors alike. I was hoping for a free upgrade but I think we lucked out on that one but our room was amazing none the less. I will always love the Disney little touches to improve your stay being welcomed when entering the hotel by a cast member with them saying \"Welcome Home\" every time you entered. The towel creations made by the maids everyday from the love birds to the Mickey mouse head we couldn't wait to get back to see the next creation. We were never disturbed by guest services they came in cleaned and changed the linen without us even knowing. The rooms were always cleaned to a high standard. We dined at Boma, Jiko and the Mara. All had a great variety of food and had some extremely amazing dishes. At Boma our waiter gave us a free mini selection of mini deserts which were out of this world. Jiko is by far the best restaurant at WDW amazing food and wine selection. At Jiko our waitress was amazingly nice and saw that we were on our honeymoon so gave us a free bottle of wine and Evian during our meal. You must also take advantage of the night vision animal watching that is run in the late evening you will spend a very long time watching the giraffe's and other animals grazing in the Savannah. The pool, spa's and gym were all great although we didn't pay that many visits to them. Although it was nice to take a dip in the spa or the pool after a hard day at the parks. People moan about the price of staying here but I say you get what you pay for. They also moan about it being to far away by transport it is further out than some resorts but it is not that noticeable when on the highly entertaining Disney transport. Yes this hotel is not the cheapest option by any means but it was worth every penny. Unfortunately now on our future visits to see the Mouse my wife will not stay anywhere else and to be honest I don't either. lol. . We loved every minute of it. Would we recommend to a friend ?

We had a very long journey as we got a connecting flight (with Delta who were amazing) and used Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Magical Express service from MCO and we arrived at AKL at around 8.30pm. When we were checking in I mentioned it was a special trip for us (wedding planning) and cheekily asked if there was any possibility of upgrading to a Savannah View room. The check in lady looked at me a little confused and said we already had a Savannah View \u00e2\u20ac\u201c result! We had the most amazing room location, if they had given us a map of the resort and said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchoose your room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it would have been very close by! We were less than a minute from the lobby overlooking the main (Arusha) savannah. And close enough to the Arusha overlook that if we opened our balcony door we could hear the African music that they play from the back of the lobby. Magical! Our room was the best Disney Resort room we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had (also stayed at Disneyland Paris resorts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hotel New York, Disneyland Hotel and Sequoia Lodge) and mousekeeping were amazing. We had lovely towel animals and an awesome congratulations card from Mickey and Minnie. Everyday we saw loads of animals, and there was a cow/antelope guy who would come within 2 feet of our balcony as he was smart enough to get past the fence so he could eat and sleep in a certain bush he liked. Before our trip I was a little worried about the bus service to the parks (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rent a car) as on a map the Resort is far out from the rest of WDW but we never waited long (except for Downtown Disney/Typhoon Lagoon buses which were sometimes 20 minutes) and the longest journey to the Magic Kingdom was only around 15 minutes. We ate at all 3 restaurants, we thought the Mara (quick service) was great, and offered a good selection, we had breakfast and dinner at Boma (buffet) we really enjoyed dinner but weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too impressed with breakfast. The best meal of our trip was in Jiko (Signature restaurant) the service was amazing and food was fresh and delicious, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll definitely be back. The staff (like in all of Disneyworld) were second to none, on our arrival night my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 had a bad headache, so I ventured out on my own to find the restaurant and buy us some drinks and snacks, as I got to the lobby I saw a Cast Member and asked him the way to the Mara, he walked me the whole way and we had a great conversation. On another occasion we asked the concierge desk if there was any possibility of seeing the suites as we were considering staying there again for our wedding trip, they were so helpful and showed us the beautiful vice presidential suite and also advised us to go over to Kidani Village to see the 1 bedroom villas. Kidani is a short 10 minute walk away and is definitely worth visiting, the lobby is like a small version of Jambo house and is beautifully done. We loved everything about Animal Kingdom Lodge, but the question is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will we be back?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.... We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve rebooked already! This time we have opted to pay the extra for a Savannah view as it was so amazing looking over the main savannah that we wanted to benefit of being able to request an Arusha view room. This is for the first 5 nights of our wedding and honeymoon trip and we have raved about AKL so much that our family and friends have also booked to stay at the resort.

Rooms: Spacious, clean, comfortable beds/pillows! The balcony and views of the animals was a truly unique experience that could be enjoyed by guests of all ages. The property was quite large and we had one of the rooms at the very end of the property so it was a bit of a hike (especially after full days of walking) but it was very quiet and private! Staff: I would love to attend an orientation for Disney employees, they are all so friendly and welcoming regardless of their position. Their Disney personality shines through and makes the experience enjoyable. Activities: It was cool to see how many activities they had for children at the resort, just when you felt you had too much to do, Disney throws a few more things your way. Food: Did not eat at the resort for dinner, had a snack - I'm a picky eater and do not like spicy food, I had a pizza with spices on it that I could not handle, but me knowing my eating habits I should have just ordered a cheese pizza - ha, ha! Loved the shampoo and soap - and you can even buy it at the gift shop (I guess they got wise to people grabbing a few extra souvenirs off of the maids carts - they are now locked up :)).

Its worth noting that the best time to view the largest variety of animals is before 10am as it tends to get too hot for them after that. The free Disney shuttle service is also something that should be taken advantage of. They pick up from outside the main entrance and drop you at most locations within the resort. The seemed to be running very frquently and late into the night which is great if you are watching one of the firework shows etc. The only slightly negative comment that I would have is that the pool area can get very overcrowed and the pool itself isn't that big considering the overall size of the hotel.

Needless to say, I was a bit hesitant and worried that we would be spending half our trip waiting on buses/riding buses. Either we had impeccable timing each time we caught a bus, or Disneyworld bought more busses to shuttle between the hotel and magic kingdom. Not once did we wait more than a couple of minutes for a bus. With that being said, it is true that Animal Kingdom is farther away than anything else, but I knew that going in, so it didn't bother me. One piece of advice....thank the bus drivers, and make sure your kids do as well. First of all, it's the polite thing to do, and they work hard and do a good job. Second, sometimes they have little trinkets in their pockets to give to kids. As it relates to the rest of the trip, my wife and I are convinced Disney has thought of everything when they planned the Disneyworld complex. The greatest was the Magical Express to and from airport. If you are traveling with kids, or if your wife packs too much, you need to sign up for this. It made our airport portions of the trip much less stressful. At Animal Kingdom, make sure to get the savannah view...it is worth it. our kids loved waking up in the morning and going out on balcony to say good morning to the animals.

We booked out trip through DreamMakers Vacation. Lynda is the Disney specialist and provided great support and information through our booking process! She helped with restaurant reservations, booking changes, and information about all of the Disney properties. Another bonus is that if you refer family or friends to DreamMakers, they offer you a gift card as a thank you for referring their service. When looking for a hotel/resort to stay at during vacation, rooms and cleanliness are VERY important to me. I know people say that you don't spend a lot of time in the room, however, for me it is critical that the room is clean, well maintained, decent decor, and good service. I found all to be the case at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge. My family and I consisting of myself, my husband, and a 3 and 1 year old stayed at the main lodge along with my sister's family who were in a room across the hall (She also has a 3 and 2 year old) back in April and we all had a wonderful stay. The PROS are as follows: -Listed as Deluxe Property -Clean Room -Seeing the Animals - We had a partial Savannah view room. Every morning/day we saw all types of exoctic animals including Zebras, Giraffes, Gazels, Antelope, and some animals I dind't even recognize! The children loved it! It was a daily trip to the zoo! -Great Customer Service (The mini fridge in our room wasn't working and one of the wonderful folks in housekeeping came to help fix the problem. The temp control just needed to be turned down to allow the ice to thaw. In the meantime she brought a container full of ice for us to keep the water, juice, and milk we brought for the children) -More on Great Serive - We used Disney's Magical Express to and from the hotel so we wouldn't have to manage our bags and the children. The hotel has a airline and baggage check in right in the front. You can check in your bags there and again not have to carry the luggage to the airport. The day before our departure, the Magical Express Service had our boarding passes AND luggage tags printed out. All we had to do was to take the bags downstairs, get them weighed, and wait for our shuttle. Even if you don't take the Magical Express, the luggage and airline check in is available for guests of the hotel -Great Restaurants - We were on the dining plan which consisted of 1 Snack, 1 Quick Serivce, and 1 Sit Down meal per day per person (excluding the 1 year old who you don't have to pay for) The restaurants in the hotel were wonderful! Mara was the quick service which just means it's cafeteria style. But the food was good and they always had plenty of options! Jiko was the fine dining. We ate there our first night and used up 2 of our sit down meals a peice for this treat. The food was excellent as well as the atmosphere and ambiance. Keep in mind we were dining with a 3 and 1 year old in an enviornment which reminds me a little of steakhouse and the servers were all VERY accommodating to the children and no one (including the staff and other diners) seemed to mind the baby's talking during the meal. Finally Boma is the buffet. We had dinner there one night and breakfast on the day of departure! Excellent cuisine! Animal Lodge has an African Theme and all of the restaurants offered cuisine from Africa. However, diners will be delighted to find that you had many choices including a Kid's section of the buffet which had chicken fingers, french fries, mini pizzas, etc. These were options as well as the falafel, cous cous, salmon, and some other ethnic dishes from that region. All the restaurants were great! TIP ON RESTAURANTS - If you are okay planning some of your tirp, make your meal time reservations for the sit down meals in advance. Even if you call the same day it's better to have the reservation to guarantee quick seating if the restaurant happens to be crowded at that particular time. We didn't have a problem with walking up but reservations are great and pretty much accepted everywhere except the quick service dining areas. Location - Disney's Animal Kingdon is obviously the closest Theme park to the lodge. However, the shuttle service was excellent. We never waited more than 10 or 15 minutes for a shuttle. Plus the hotel had shuttle stops to Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom, Epcot, one of the Water Parks, and Downtwon Disney. These were all of the places we were interested in going to. Given we didnt' have a rental car (by design) we got everywhere we wanted to go easily with the children. -POOL The pool was great especially for young children and had a great water slide. They also offered free floating vests and had them in different sizes from babies, to toddlers, to older children! I thought that was great! CONS: Really not many. I thought the hotel was great. The rooms were a little small but we had two children and a crib. Upon check in we inquired about getting an upgrade which the representative happily looked into for us. If we wanted to pay more money we could have received the upgrade. The villas side may have had more room but is a bit of a walk to the main lodge where all of the main restaurants are located. This would not have been a problem if we didn't have the smaller children WI-FI The only other conern was that you had to pay to get internet access. There was a daily fee of over $10.

We are talking watermelon and beet salad with tandoori chicken. No joke. It did not appeal to us so we ate every meal off site. The tv in the room has NO movie channels.

This was zen at Disney!\u201d", "Author": "alliecallie", "ReviewID": "UR64387932", "Content": "Just got back from a 9 day stay May 7- May 16 and my sister had to peel me out of the hotel to get on the bus to go home. This resort was breathtaking, fun, and relaxing all at the same time. I took this trip with my sister age 24 and I am 27. Have stayed on Disney property many times but this was my first time at AKL. (see my profile for review on Carribean Beach). I'll start my review with an awesome money saving tip! Since I was staying for 9 nights there was a huge price difference for a savannah view vs a pool view. I booked the pool view, but I also booked the Waynama safari. All safaris are for concierge guests- but Waynama is open to ANY guest of the lodge. It was $175 per person, and we got to see EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL AT THE LODGE UP CLOSE!! You get in an open 'bus'/trailer with bench seating. The tour is limited to 12 people so you get to have all of your questions answered on the animals. You get to see the barns where they keep the animals, learn all the animals names, and fun facts about them. (like one animal had sinus problems and has seen 3 different ENTs for it, and learn which animals are pregnant, etc). They pulled the truck RIGHT up to the animals and you got to take pictures of them- no zoom required! The safari also included dinner at Jinko (will talk about later in review). We saved a lot of money having the pool view and still got to see animals and learn so much about them! As for the pool view I was on the 3rd floor of Zebra trail. I didn't know what floor to ask for when I booked (Disney will often honor such requests if they can) but I was THRILLED with the 3rd floor. When you walk into the lodge you are on the 3rd floor- so I had no stairs/elevators to get to my room at night. Pool and all dining is on first floor but 2 flights of stairs is not bad at all! (we choose stairs over elevator to try and walk off that dining plan!) Our room was spotless and mouse keeping was wonderful. The pool view was very nice- of course we are in our 20s so the sight of a pool bar is a gorgeous site to us! :) It was a very quite room- even though the pool is open 24 hours- never really had any problems with noise. As with all disney resorts I could hear other peoples toilets flush, but never talking, tv, etc. I had read on Trip Advisor that the rooms are very dark. This is true- but only a problem at night. Its very dim in the lodge in the evening so the animals can have their normal sleep cycle. (thats what our safari guide told us). I enjoyed coming home to a quiet place in the evening- it was relaxing walking back to your room. If you will need to put on make up at night- bring a mirror with a light. Or if you have small kids afraid of the dark- a night light to plug in. Leaving your curtains open won't be a lot of light. During the day we just did our make up by the patio window (they have a table by it) and we had no problems at all with the lighting. We ate in all 3 restaruants that AKL had to offer. (we were on disney dining plan) Mara is the quick service location and is more of a food court. Breakfast was your standard mickey waffles, eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, and an assortment of rolls and muffins. Lunch and dinner were not my favorite at this location. I tried the cheese flatbread but it was literally cheese with little to no sauce on a cracker. It wasn't filling or tasty. Another night I tried a chicken pita which was better- but nothing to rave about. My sister is a vegan and had a hard time finding things here because even the hummus had cheese in it. If you are self pay breakfast was ~$6 per adult, lunch and dinner ~$12-15 per adult Bohma was the buffett place and we ate breakfast here twice. (if self pay breakfast was I believe ~$30 per adult). It was really good- it did not have a lot of \"african\" offerings at breakfast (I hear it does at dinner) but they had scrambled eggs with goat cheese and chives (AMAZING) and an African oatmeal that is high in protein. Otherwise, it had standard breakfast fare, eggs, omlets made to order, pancakes, waffles, cereal, fruit, yougart, etc. Jinko is the place you HAVE to eat at it you stay at this hotel. We got to eat here after the safari and it was so good I made my sister go back! This place is very expensive if you are paying out of pocket (~$50 per adult) and costs 2 meals on the dining plan. It is WORTH it! Tried the nan with the spreads (hummus) and I could have licked the bowl clean. Had the steak with mac and cheese- and its the best steak in disney world! (beats canada Le Cellier in my opinion!) If you are looking for a place to really treat yourself- this is it! The most common complaint I had read in trip reports was the busses. It is true- bus rides are longer from this resort then more centralized resorts, however, only by 5 or 10 minutes. My sister and I were there 9 days and NEVER waited more then 15 minutes for a bus. NEVER. You only have 2 bus stops at AKL- Kidani villiage and Jambo house. Kidani village is the vacation club place, and Jamo house is the big lodge itself. 2 bus stops is not a big deal at all. Especially after last year being at CBR. I don't think there are many disney resorts that Don't have more then one bus stop. Yacht club and beach club share a bus, Boardwalk and Swan and Dolphin share a bus, Polynesian and Contomparay share a bus, Grand Floridian and Wilderness Lodge share a bus, and then the moderates all have numerous stops with in them. So more then one bus stop is next to impossible to avoid unless you stay at Pop. One other thing that I LOVED about this resort were the cast members. Many of them grew up in Africa and gave power points about their home towns, or did presentations on the animals of their country. They were all so engaging and I learned so much about Africa from them! I also can tell the difference between a cheetah, jaguar, and lepord. The only negative thing I have to say about this lodge was I had a little bit of trouble with the front desk. I got sick with a sinus infection the last 3 days. I found a pharmacy that delievers (Turner Drug) and the front desk said they would call my room when my medicine arrives. Noone ever called, and when I went to the desk to ask them they could not find my medicine. I am a pharmacist- and so I was pretty confident that the pharmacy had delievered it. I called them and they said they had. It took the cast memeber 2 trips to the back before they found it- but they did find it. The cast member was nice about it- but being sick and miserable I just wanted my medicine. Over all animal kingdom lodge was beautiful. You can look at pictures, but until you are standing in the lobby, over looking the savannah, you can't appericate the beauty and detail. My sister and I wanted to try a new hotel every trip- but it will be hard not to stay at this hotel again. It was a wonderful experience and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. : )", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alma, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWe LOVED it!\u201d", "Author": "JoMich", "ReviewID": "UR64163391", "Content": "My husband, two daughters (11 and 17) and I stayed at AK Lodge last August and loved it!

It is a beautifully designed hotel which really transports you out of the whole Disney mindframe. I believe what really makes the hotel special is having the Savannah room and having the children be able to wake up to the sight of the animals. We would bring some breakfast food from the concierge level and let them eat breakfast on the balcony while watching giraffe, zebra and other animals, they really got excited about this. Animals were almost always visable, anytime of day. The rooms are small and dark, but the \"dark\" kind of fits with the Dark Continent theme of the hotel. Really, my only complaint of the hotel is the bus transportation home from parks. As people mentioned earlier it is not really an issue in the mornng getting to the paks but getting home is terrible. There seems to be fewer buses to AKL than other hotels even though it is the only Disney transportation available (no boat, monorail, etc). Also, it stops at the village first and usually picks up passengers to bring back to the main lodge. For instance, it took us over 45 minutes to get back from Animal Kingdom on day after waiting for the bus and taking over 10 minutes to load passengers to go back to Jambo House. (Disney, please put in a small dedicated shuttle to get people between the 2 if they need it) I am convinced it would have been faster to walk. One last thing on the transportation, if you are taking the Magic Express from the airport, be aware thet stop at 3 hotels before you get to AKL and then you stop at the village 1st as well. Really for a deluxe hotel I think they should have a different route. All and all, I think for parents traveling with younger children who would really would really get a kick out of being so close to the animals, AKL is a fantastic choice. PS- We had great meals at Jiko and ate there multiple diners and there is a pool with a slide at the main lodge but from what I gather it is not as elobrate as the village or some other hotels but it was plenty fine for the younger children that I think the hotel caters too.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cTypical Disney Resort, just a bit better\u201d", "Author": "Beaker40", "ReviewID": "UR63774779", "Content": "We've been to Disney a million time and usually stay in one of the \"Deluxe\" resorts, if not the Cabins at Fort Wilderness (still my all time favorite).

It was my 25th wedding anniversary with my husband and we spared no expense to make this a wonderful lasting memory. I researched for months, read many books and watched alot of reviews to have the most knowledge about Disney as I could to make a decision about our visit and finally wanted to stay at the Animal Kindgom Lodge. I thought it would so cool to watch the animals from our balcony on the Savannah view. I must say that I am a very low maintainance person and was disappointed with my stay here. We saved our money to go on this trip and it was not worth all the hype for this hotel. It was not until the 3rd day that we even saw any animals except some pelicans and a few birds and would not pay the extra money for this perk. There are plenty of public viewing areas and the little time you spend in the room coupled with the fact that the animals are far away and never out close to your room made me frustrated. We were up all times of the day also to try to catch the animals. We were on the Zebra trail and maybe there are some savannahs that are better than others but the pictures are not quite accurate. In order to get pictures of the animals up close I had to leave my room and run down to the public viewing area and snap some shots. That was crazy to me. That being said it was a beautiful hotel. Lobby very impressive. Very cool theming. Staff very nice and helpful. The restaurants were great. The pool was beautiful with lots of seating but we didn't use the pool. The rooms were nice. Beds comfy. Shower great. Mouse keeping was so good that with dusting under the tv they disconnected the tv and there was no manuel way of turning it on and it took 5 hours and 3 calls to front desk to get it fixed. It took 2 seconds for them to fix it. They told us we had to be in the room to do this so the one night that we wanted to explore the different savannahs was wasted in our room waiting for someone to fix the tv. They apologized for this and probably would have done compensation but I didn't want that, I just wanted my time back and my tv fixed sooner. The gift shop is awesome and and the buses were great going but not coming home. Never had to wait long on the buses to take us to the parks but had to wait long amounts of time to get the buses from the parks home. One night at magic kindom after fireworks we waited 40 minutes for a bus to come and load and then another 20 minutes to get to the hotel. We left early from Fantasmic to \"beat the crowd\" out of the park home from Hollywood Studios and had to wait 35 minutes to get a bus. It seemed as though they only had 1 bus running to our hotel when I saw multiple buses picking up for other hotels and there were long lines for people to go back to Animal Kingdom Lodge. I'm glad we stayed here to say we did, but out of all the places I could have stayed for the same money I wouldn't stay here again. It is still Disney and they do alot of things right. They try to think of everything from the dining plan to magical express, airline check in from the hotel, and everyone wishing us a Happy Anniversary due to the 25 year buttons they gave us to wear saying Happy Anniversary with Mickey and Minnie.

It simply didn't live up to the hype. I've stayed at nearly all of the Disney hotels, and this one fared on the low side. Everything was very, very dark... the room was so dim you couldn't read a book. The pool was satisfactory, but not nearly as elaborate as many of its competitors.

Everything about this hotel is fabulous from the rooms, to the animals and everything else in between. The studio room was beautifully themed, we had a pool view which was lovely with very comfortable beds and a flat screen TV. The usual separate wash basins, bath and toilet. As it was a DVC studio we had a small sink, fridge, coffee machine and toaster, crockery etc. - very useful. There was also an ironing board, an iron and a safe. We ate at Mara, Boma and Jiko and the meals in all were great. The shop has a varied and wide choice of goods with additional day to day things e.g. food, plasters, pain killers etc. The staff in the shop go 'the extra mile' to help you purchase or locate something special. The pool is large with life guards, plenty of sun beds, a slide and jacuzzis, sun and shade can be found as necessary. Free laundry facilities and internet access are available to DVC members. There are viewing spots throughout the property to see the animals, which of course are the 'stars of the show'! A stroll among the savannah sections almost always allowed the animals to be seen, so if a savannah view is out of your price range, don't panic as the animals are there for everyone to see. Yes, it is a longer trip to the Magic Kingdom but still no more than 20 minutes at the worst and it is worth the longer bus trip to be staying there. It's not that far to any of the other parks.

The lobby is breath taking and they have little sitting areas just to hang out and an area set up with a TV like a family room.

As for the food we only ate at Boma for breakfast and it was fantastic I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a personal Chef so I can be very critical about restaurants. We ate at several other restaurants on the Deluxe dining plan the only complaint was every place is slow give yourself at least 2 \u00c2\u00bd hrs for table service not sure why as all the restaurants have a set menu with only a few choices. The Coral Reef was everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorite.

My mother In law couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do a lot of walking so we rented a Stay Cool scooter from AA Tourist Rentals, they delivered it to the hotel and we charged it right outside or hotel room door.

We only had 3 days so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to check out the pool but we did enjoy just walking around the hotel checking out the scenic views and they have night vision binoculars to see the animals at night.

On both trips we have been upgraded to a Savannah view room free of charge. Ten days prior to our reservation date, I contacted the hotel direct and requested a free upgrade. Although rooms aren't allocated until the day of arrival, I was told that my request had been noted. I'm not sure it made any difference, but we did get the upgrade so I would say it's worth a try (you don't get if you don't ask). The hotel is beautifully themed and all of the staff extremely helpful. When we checked into the hotel, we told the cast member on reception that it was our 4 year olds first trip to Disney World. He made a huge fuss of our son and gave him a 'first visit' badge and some stickers. Needless to say that (combined with the free room upgrade) got our holiday off to a great start. There are lots of activities for small children and African Guides are always on hand to answer any questions. One of the guides spent time with my 4 year old, writing Swahili and Zulu words in his Epcot passport. The food in the hotel is of good quality (even in the quck service restaurant). It can be quite a walk fom the lobby to your hotel room, but it's worth it when you get to see Zebra and Giraffe walking past your window. The location of the hotel is both a plus and minus. Although the hotel is quite a way from the parks, obviously with the exception of Animal Kingdom Park, it is only a mile away from a whole host of shops, supermarkets and restaurants located on the Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway. I would recommend hiring a car as the bus transportation is slowed by the addition of the Kidani Village. The bus now dives past Jambo House to pick up and drop off at Kidani first. This is an inconvenience when being collected in the morning as the bus sometimes arrived almost full. After a tiring day in the parks, it was also an irritation to have to drive past Jambo House to have to drop off other guests first. Security within the resort is excellent. Each time you return to the hotel, you are stopped at a security point and asked to show your room key or photo ID. Each time your identity is validated the cast members greet you by saying 'Welcome Home' and after a few days, you really do feel as if you have come home.

I'm not sure how a family with lots of luggage would manage. You are paying a lot for these rooms, because they are Disney rooms - but the bathroom part of the Animal Kingdom Lodge rooms remind me of less expensive motel bathrooms. Bathroom was not outright dirty, but could have used a good cleaning. Walls were splattered with assorted things (toothpaste? cosmetics? hairstuff? who knows what?). Room location - We were at end of hallway and it was really quiet. Walk from the lobby took about 5 minutes. Savanna view was average. I'd recommend staying closer to the main part of lodge. Service - absolutely exceptional! The cultural programs, with representatives from various countries in Africa, were wonderful. Dining - We ate at Jiko, Boma, and Saana. All were wonderful, with great food and great service. The fast food type restaurant (Mara) was just average, nothing really special.

The atmosphere was great and my kids (aged 14 and 4) loved the safari animals. We booked a standard room and are glad we didn't upgrade-- we were rarely in our rooms long enough to have enjoyed a more expensive view. Plus, there are so many observation areas around the hotel that you are sure to see plenty of animals without having to pay the extra money for a Savahanna view. The pool was what really made this hotel great. The zero depth pool really made it feel like you are swimming in a watering hole. It was never overly crowded and the waterslide was perfect for both of my boys. Again they rarely had to wait in a long line to go down the water slide. Word of warning though -- we went in August and there was pretty much an afternoon thunderstorm every day. They will make everyone get out of the pool if there is thunder and lightening. So be prepared to take a little break and return later. The food was EXPENSIVE!! We did not purchase any of the Disney dining plan options. Next time we will. We primarily ate at the Mara cafe (Quick service) because the other restaurants seemed to have a long wait and were much more expensive. The Mara was okay though limited in choices if you eat there pretty much every morning. What we didn't know is that the room had a refrigerator and there is a staple of food supplies that you can purchase at the gift shop. We didn't realize this until about 4 days into our trip. The food supply area is kind of off to the side of the gift shop and you could easily miss it. So I recommend stocking up when you get there if you don't want to spend tons of money on food. Transportation -- it took a LONG time to get to the Magic Kingdom and Disney's Downtown area. So be prepared. We tried to take advantage of the early magic hours ... well it seems that everyone else was as well so the buses get crowded. Especially to the Magic Kingdom. If you use Disney's Magical Express-- Animal Kingdom Lodge is the very LAST stop on the way in, and the first stop on the way out. So basically, be prepared to be on that bus for an hour or more. That took a while. It was very convinient, but definitely took a while. The room was fine. I guess for the price you expect more, but it wasn't bad. The beds were really, really squeeky and noisy though. The first night we didn't get much sleep but after that we were all so tired from having been at the parks all day we slept fine. There are a couple of laundry rooms that came in handy as well. We used these at least twice. It was quite a walk from our room, but worth it to not have to pack as many clothes and get to wash them. We brought our own laundry supplies (those new detergent/softner sheets are small to pack and worked great!).

The room itself had two queen sized beds, a small desk & chair, a cabinet with the tv and a small fridge. There was very little space anywhere else & we felt quite cramped, as this was near the end of our trip & we had quite a bit of luggage with nowhere to put it. The bathroom was absolutely tiny with just the bath/shower & toilet in a separate room. The vanity was open space adjoining the bedroom.

I have visited Disney World 12 times over the past 10 years. I always stay at a Disney owned property since I love the full \"Disney experience.\" In February, I took my 5 year old son for a mommy & me trip without dad or other siblings. I opted for the Animal Kingdom Lodge since I had stayed there 2 previous times with enjoyable results. Unfortunately, this time was not as great. We arrived on February 8 during the \"value season.\" Although our room was ready by 10am, I was not pleased with the room. It was located overlooking a parking lot and directly next to an ice vending machine. I heard the ice drop while unloading our bags and immediately asked to move. The front desk granted me request and moved me to a room that had some bamboo in front of the balcony. (Little did I know that my room was directly above the designated outdoor smoking area.) While my son slept in the first morning I stepped outside to read the paper and have coffee on the balcony. The smoking area had 12 smokers enjoying their morning ritual too. I went back inside to the dark room and tried not to wake up my exhausted son. On day 2 I found peanuts behind a chair I moved. That would normally not bother me except that my son has a life threatening food allergy to peanuts. I quickly picked them up and flushed them down the toilet. I shudder to think what would have happened had he found them first. The room itself is nicely appointed. It's a nice touch to have a small fridge in the room and a coffee maker. The bathroom has double sinks too. The beds were comfortable and having a balcony was an added bonus...minus the location. Where this Disney property falls down on the job is its front desk. All 3 times I have stayed here I have been displeased with the attitude of the front desk employees. They have all been competent, but never friendly or accommodating. Overall, this hotel is worth its premium priceonly if you have the savana view room. Without it, you might as well stay at a moderate resort. The property is issolated and requires a lengthy bus ride to get to any park except the Animal Kingdom. (No convenience here.)

The hotel is thatched and everything is themed around Africa including the food. Zawadi Marketplace - the gift shop has a great selection of African artefacts including drums, Ostrich eggs, carved elephants, beads and there a few Disney gifts. Animal Kingdom Lodge is a fantastic hotel and there are plenty of viewing areas around the hotel to see the animals. We have recently returned from Animal Kingdom Lodge and this was out third time there. The Animal Kingdom Lodge is magical. We love Animal Kingdom Lodge in 2004 we stayed 16 nights and had a fantastic view of the Uzima Savannah even though we only paid the standard rate. In 2006 we returned for 21 nights and were initially given a room overlooking the car park, soon swapped to the Sunset Savannah, view was not fantastic, but again I only paid the standard room rate. 2009 we stayed for 15 nights and had a fantastic Savannah room (this time we paid for the upgrade). Each room has a reasonable size fridge (empty), a large TV and DVD player, coffee/tea making facilities, a mini wall safe and the usual hairdryer. I would recommend that you hire a car for the full period, especially staying at this hotel. Besides it being isolated, it is also expensive to eat at. This time we only ate at Mara in the hotel (self service), the rest of the time we ate off site. Boma was expensive in 2006 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could have 2 meals at TGI Fridays for the price of one at Boma. At Easter 2009, one English couple with two kids had a meal there with a bottle of wine the total bill was USD150. Mara is the self service restaurant down by the pool, it is open from about 6am to 11pm, the lunch/evening menu includes stews, seafood platter & chips, burgers, pizzas, chapatti filled with ham, chicken nuggets as well as a reasonable selection of salads and fruit. They also sell refillable mugs which cost about USD13 each and you can refill them with hot and cold drinks (excluding juices) as many times as you like at your hotel during your stay and they are a great souvenir to take home, this compares with a charge per drink of USD2.50 if you do not use the refillable mugs. Unfortunately you cannot refill them in the parks. We love sitting on the balcony watching the Giraffes, Zebra, Thomson Gazelle, Bongos, Wildebeest, Blesbok, Eland, Impala and a whole host of other animals. Also down by the pool are Flamingos. The theme is African and very little to indicate that you might be in a Disney hotel. Our daughter loves the place and painting ostrich eggs. I am up early watching the animals being fed by the hotel; I get some fantastic close-up photos of the animals. The pool is designed for kids, so the deepest area is about 5\u00c2\u00bd feet and gradually goes from a very shallow area to the deep area. There is also a good waterslide. Down by the pool there are two hot tubs and showers and changing rooms. Towels are provided free and can be found in portable bins, also life jackets are provided for non swimmers. The games room by the pool will keep any child happy for hours, with slot machines, air hockey & racing games. From memory we had to vacate our room by 11am on the day of departure, we took our cases to Downtown Disney as we were flying with Virgin and returned to the hotel and used the pool, later showering and changing for our flight home.

The room are amazingly clean. We didnt find one speck of dust in the room for the two weeks that we were there! The resteraunt wasnt like a posh hotel resteraunt, but the food was nice and the staff there were very friendly. When me and my brother went down to get hot chocolate or something like that, it was about 5 dollars for the both of them (expensive, i know) and we only had about 3 dollars, they let us have them, and didnt even make us pay them back the next day, even though my dad tried to! It is nice and it fills you up, and is much better than paying a lot for a 'high class' meal in the resteraunt downstairs. The thing about the mara is, there is only 3 dinner and breakfast and they get a bit boring after a while. For breakfast i say you should have bacon with a waffle and drown it all in maple syrup! Sounds disgusting but its lush, honest. The hotel makes you feel very at home and friendly, and it has a very comfortable atmosfere. The caricature man or woman is very good, and he will even frame your pictures for you! Animal Kingdom is quite far away from the parks, especially universal. It took us about an hour to get there, but it was well worth it! I also recomend you not to waste your time and money on seaworld, as the only good thing there is the whale show which has probably put lots of people off because of the little killing incident recently. The journey from Bristol airport is 12 hours, so i would prepare yourself well! Hollywood studios was my favourite park, defo. The shop in the Animal Kingdom Lodge is really nice, with everything that you would want and need... well, you shouldnt need anything at all in this hotel! You seriously get what you pay for! The beds are extremely comfy, and made you want to sleep early which is easier to get up early! The buses for the parks are running all day long so if your tired and want a lie in or a relaxing swim in the pool or spa session you can go to the parks in the night or the afternoon. The african theme is very cool and disney! Last word: Rent a car... it;s much cheaper, quicker and easier than to catch a taxi or bus to universal or the shopping malls!

But we also did our homework and when traveling to Disneyworld it is necessary! I bought several of the books recommended (Passporter) to make our stay the best it could be (available on Amazon or at Borders). I knew to book a One Bedroom Savannah Family Suite with a kitchen (plates, glasses, toaster dishwasher included) at the Jambo House (even though I am not a DVC Member they are available and very spacious). We had a king bed and the family room had a pullout double couch and a pullout chair twin bed and washing machine set (convenient to throw our soaking clothes into from the daily rainstorms). The view was fabulous from our balcony and we were treated to giraffe mating season right outside our room. Kids got a huge kick out of and so did we answering many questions. Because of this type of room we had one of the local grocery stores deliver drinks and breakfast foods to our room the day of our arrival. Not only was it affordable but convenient to not have to eat out for breakfast everyday. Also ordered a case of water which I recommend if traveling in the summer as it is HOT! I also advise the meal plan. The one that had a counter meal a snack and a sit down dinner was perfect for us. We knew which parks we would be visiting on a daily basis and we scheduled dinner at a restaurant at that park in advance. (This is a MUST! When they say call 180 days in advance for reservations, it means just that!) This timeframe has been known to change so please check on it. We had no problem getting into the best restaurants every night we wanted, and we ended up way ahead on the meal plan as I totaled what we spent vs. what we paid at the end of each day and you do come out better IF you eat at the nicer more expensive restaurants either on property or at the parks. We ate at Le Cellier, Coral Reef, Boma, Saana, 50's Diner, and Crystal Palace (disappointing buffet) for dinner and lunch at each park. Saana, Coral Reef and Le Cellier were our favorite. Our waitress at 50's diner was a hoot. Just know that reservations are a must and those that stay at the resort and purchase the package get preference on reservations. Negatives: Room Service trays were not picked up all day in the hallway on several occasions. Our room was not vacuumed when we arrived (hair ball on floor) but that was quickly taken care of. Because we stayed in a room typically reserved for DVC members we did not get towel service on the second day (typically if you are a DVC member your towel service is every few days). When I called and reminded them I was not a DVC member and that I would like fresh towels daily we had them. Property is the farthest away from the Magic Kingdom but sometimes the decompressing ride back on the bus was just what our kids aged 13 and 9 needed to unwind. We went in August and there was a thunder/lightning storm almost every afternoon and they would close the pool due to weather conditions - not Disney's fault but that was when we wanted to swim the most was early evening and sure enough it was pouring and lightning. Make sure to bring your ponchos! Also, be sure to ask when Disney checks your bags at the hotel (service offered free as part of our package) that the flight has not been canceled or delayed. Our first flight was delayed causing our luggage to be checked all the way home and we had no control in changing it once we arrived at the airport and found we had automatically been rerouted on another flight. We made it home fine......3 out of 4 bags didn't until a day later. Pros: We never waited more than 15-20 minutes for a bus. If you have ever parked at a disney park you know that the bus service is worth its weight in gold. Our boys loved the map to search and find every animal at the Jambo House and even went out at night with the night goggles they provide to look for the animals. The pool at the Kidani Village is better and I would recommend taking the quick 5 minute bus trip up the road to the sister property to use that pool. However the bartenders at the pool bar at Jambo House were very friendly and accommodating - great drinks by the way! They also have a gaming room for the kids up at Kidani Village as well however the lobby is 1/10th the size it is at the Jambo House and way less impressive. Ladies were in the lobby daily giving facts and information about Africa and its history and the kids enjoyed asking questions and getting answers in the lobby daily on our way out for the day.

The staff at both facilities were very friendly and helpful. Both facilities were very clean and up to Disney standards. The design of the Jambo House lobby is extraordinary, very very impressive much more so than the Kidhani Village lobby. Kidhani only offers one restaurant which is somewhat formal. Most of the villas at Kidhani have full kitchens since it is part of Disney's Vacation Club. Jambo House offers a few different restaurants including one which is cafeteria style and very casual. We found that the food was good but rather pricey. The pools at both facilties are very nice and heated. The pool at Jambo House is beautifully landscaped with a nice waterslide. The pool at Kidhani has a longer waterslide than Jambo. Jambo House has a good size retail store, but the store at Kidhani is rather limited. Both facilities have 2 savannahs. We had a room at Kidhani which overlooked the larger of the two savannahs and it had something like 5 or 6 types of animals including zebras, giraffes, antelopes, osteriches, and a type of cattle. We also saw vultures in the savannah. The animals were out in the savannah much of the day and slept out in the savannah at night. We all loved our savannah view and would highly recommend booking a room with this view. Overall, it was an excellent experience and would not hesitiate to return to either the Kidhani Village or the Jambo House Resort at the Animal Kingdom Lodge.

We found that with the cool weather of December that the animals were out and visible more during the afternoon - a time when we were at the parks and not in the room. We did enjoy the views from other points in the hotel that are open to all who stay there. We did spend the majority of our time in the theme parks. The weather was too cool to utilize the pool, but it did look very inviting. Our children did participate in a unique ornament making and the staff truly seemed to enjoy helping our kids be creative. If you or your children are picky about different/unusual foods, you may want to make sure to make dining plans elsewhere. We did enjoy the unusual flavors at Jiko (fine dining) and even in the Mara (counter service). They do have a few usual standards. AK Lodge is a beautiful hotel and the service was very good.

Disney has done a wonderful job with this facility. The kids and I are animal lovers and were blown away at being yards away from all of these exotic animals and birds in a sudo-natural environment. We happened to travel during the COLDEST WEEK IN HISTORY, so most of our time was spent admiring the animals from inside the room but the animals were troopers and roamed all around for equal visibility. The Disney \"experience\" starts as soon as you hit the check in desk. The staff asked if we were celebrating anything and when we responded a birthday, she pulled out a button that said \"Happy Birthday\" and wrote my son's name on it. For the next 4 days 75% of every Disney employee we came across wished him Happy Birthday and he LOVED every minute. LOTS of things for young children to do at the hotel including daily arts and crafts, games, a game room and a kids club (babysitting service) located in a room with as many toys as your local target. My son was in tears while we were at Magic Kingdom (yes, we were AT Magic Kingdom) because he was ready to leave the park and go play at the kids club back at AKL. Wish we had more time to enjoy the facilities at the hotel especially the Agave Margaritas....yummmm. Highly recommend signing up for the dining plan while making your reservations. The food was very satisfying and tasty, however, pricing can leave you with sticker shock. Then again, it is Disney soooooo inflated prices is kinda to be expected. Really enjoyed the buffet and being able to sample all of the ethnic foods but think that $30 for anyone 10 and older is a bit much. Only ate there once during the trip. Was very pleased to see a wide selection of beer and wine at the Mara!!! And after a day at a theme park with the kids, I didn't care how much that bottle of wine cost :-) Mara had a decent offering for breakfast, lunch and dinner that was satisfying for everyone in the family. Didn't go all the way to Florida for chicken nuggets & burgers, but that's what it took to keep the kids quiet so.... so be it. We traveled with the kids, but wouldn't mind going back just Hubby and I. Just need to adjust your expectations about a 'mature' experience because the reality is that it is a family resort so the kids do kinda run the show. Only disappointing experience is with Lost & Found. Ended up leaving something in the room and have left two messages with Lost & Found but have not received a return phone call :-( If the tickets to the theme park don't break the budget, spend a few extra dollars to stay at AKL but most importantly, plan to spend some time and enjoy all the benefits the hotel has to offer", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cI agree about the pool\u201d", "Author": "mmsanfca", "ReviewID": "UR56385189", "Content": "Well, it sounds like the pool is still having it's problems.

Every year Walt Disney world near Orlando Florida holds the Disney Marathon. My partner was a finisher in this spectacular event on January 10. We stayed in the Animal Kingdom lodge: Jambo House, with savanna view room overlooking the exotic animals that roamed the African grassland surrounding the hotel. There was a variety of species which contentedly went about their daily routines with little regard to the hotel and guests a few meters away. It was a treat to wake up to this idyllic scene and watch the sun rise in the morning. The room was adequately spacious and had 2 large queen beds, a small table and chair set, a nice balcony, large screen LCD television with an external port replicator making device connection easier. Ours however was not connected and required some minor maintenance to re-enable. The bathroom was in two rooms with the shower and toilet in one and the vanity and two sinks in the other. Fortunately the room also had a furnace, due to the extreme cold weather, it came in quite handy. The resort was in great condition, very well maintained and had two restaurants. The pool was under maintenance but we had access to the Kidani lodge pool a few minutes away. It was too cold to swim so the pool was not an issue. The menu plan we chose included one full service and one fast food meal with snacks daily. I would recommend buying one of the menu plans which saved us many hundreds of dollars. Without it, food can be very expensive and there are very few places to eat that are not Disney affiliated restaurants. The two menu restaurants at the lodge are Boma and Jiko. Boma, is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153order from the menu\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self serve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd buffet. Its African inspired cuisine was quite good although the flavour bases were somewhat repetitive with cinnamon, curry and chipotle predominating. Roast beef and spare ribs were featured daily. Varieties of soups and salads and other food choices were available and changed on a daily basis. Parties of six or more are automatically charged an 18% gratuity, Parties of 5 and under were not. Alcohol based drinks are not included in meal plans and they can be pricey. Soft drinks etc. are usually included. Jiko, a 5 star restaurant with a full menu of meat and fish was excellent and the service was very good. Two food menu credits per person are required if using the meal plan at Jiko. The bread and cheese selections were particularly good, with different African breads and both cow and goat cheeses available. The Sanaa restaurant at Kidani village is very good and offers African influenced dining along the same lines as Boma and Jiko. Mara at Jambo house is a quick service based outlet offering traditional American fast food cuisine with a static menu and interchangeable options. Casey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which offered baseball themed fare at Magic Kingdom was a particularly good choice for a quick service meal, the ballpark franks (hotdogs) were very tasty and the food plan can be used at almost all the food outlets and restaurants. Food plans can also be used at some of the non Disney restaurants. All were clearly marked regarding food plan inclusion or non inclusion. Guides for everything can be picked up at the resorts or anywhere in the Disney parks. Park passes are required if using the food plan option. Passes may be purchased anywhere but are cheaper and more convenient if included in your vacation package. A park hopper pass allows you to bounce from one park to the other at any time. Without it parks can only be visited on one day with unlimited access. Book your food reservations as soon as possible to avoid eating at odd times or late in the evening as the traditional meal times are booked first and quickly. The best most efficient way to travel anywhere in the Disney parks is by the Disney transit system which is very efficient and goes everywhere, a bus comes approx. every 15-20 minutes.

So, assuming you know that the Disney properties aren't a great value, read on... This is a nice property -- the atrium is gorgeous. We got upgraded from a standard room to a room overlooking one of the savannahs, and we were across the hall from an overlook above the savannah on the other side of the hotel, which made viewing animals pretty easy. But after a couple of days, my wife and I were in the mindset of, \"oh, cool...there's a giraffe again.\" My son lost his interest in the zebras, giraffes and other critters after a couple days as well and started asking where the rhinos were. There are no rhinos, so we dealt with that the best we could. :) The room was comfortable, but a little smallish. It needed a comfortable sitting chair and didn't have one. Bedding was plush. Lots of Disney details throughout the room. TV options were HORRIBLE (#1, be prepared for 10 ABC channels and 5 ESPN channels and not much else; #2, our remote worked about half the time and there were no buttons on the TV to manually change channels). Most of the staff we interacted with was terrific -- housekeeping staff was especially friendly, as were the folks posted outside who provided information about the animals. Here's the biggest issue: This is a big resort. The last thing you want to do after a long day at the parks is spend another 7-8 minutes walking from the lobby to your room. You must enter through the lobby and then schlep yourself to your room -- in our case this was a solid 7-8 minute walk. Everything is a good walk away (and we were in a fairly central room -- there were rooms that were farther away from things). On the day of our checkout, there was a system-wide computer failure which made for an inconvenient checkout (computers still weren't up when we left.) Also, the pool was closed for the duration of our stay, even though when I booked our trip it was slated to re-open prior to our stay. We discussed the decision to stay at the AKL afterward and my wife and I decided we were glad we stayed there...even though we would've been more comfortable at another hotel. If we hadn't stayed here we would always wonder what it would've been like...if you're considering it, go ahead and stay here...once.", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Paso, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAwesome ... great resort\u201d", "Author": "Army_Dude", "ReviewID": "UR55586347", "Content": "I went here with my wife and it was an amazing experience for a couple.

I had used my debit card & this second charge had eaten up my entire cash reserve in my bank account. the charge was easily visible on my bank account but didnt show up in the AKL \"system\". Since it didnt show up in their system they refused to help. Even though i showed them my account online where the double charge was plainly visible, 2 front desk people refused to help even though i was at the front desk crying saying that since it was sunday i had no cash & couldnt talk to the bank until Monday. Even the manager said that all i could do was to talk to their financial services dept. Financial services said my only resource was to wait until Monday & have my bank call them. so, Monday my bank manager did a conference call between myself & WDW financial services. even after my bank manager explained how they had double charged me & how it was clearly their mistake, they still REFUSED to help me. My bank manager reversed the charge herself so that i would have my money back. it was a nightmare. however, i have been to WDW 15 times & this was the only experience i have ever had that even comes close to negative. the lesson is never use your debit card at a hotel. ever. so back to this trip. my boyfriend didnt have any idea what the hotel looked like (i am the planner), he couldnt believe how beautiful & \"not disney\" it looked. he just couldnt say enough how much he loved our hotel. i love the AKL most for the same reason that a lot of people compain about: the \"darkness\". i dont consider it dark, i think its beautiful, sophisticated & mature. its everything i want as an adult, without kids, traveling to WDW. also, we were super lucky that when we arrived at 7am from an overnight flight, they had a room ready for us. it was fantastic. i had called a couple days before arrival & had them note that we would be coming in early & if possible to check in early, but there was no guarantee. we totally lucked out. The room they gave us was \"standard\" view, but we lucked out again, because we were on the ground floor & right across our balcony was a savannah. we had a perfect view of giraffes ever day! also, we had purchased park tickets separately, and the front desk was nice enough to attach them to our room keys. everyone was so nice. the other main reason i like AKL so much is the food. i think they have the best selection of non fast food type food. i am a vegetarian & my boyfriend isnt really a cheeseburger guy & the AKL has great food. actually, i should say MARA has great food, because we dont do the restaurants ( i dont like making reservations so far in advance). They also serve my boyfriends favorite beer, Casa from Morocco, which didnt hurt either. Regarding the bus rides: unless you stay at a monorail hotel, you are going to wait for a bus. so plan accordingly. we barely ever waited more than 5 minutes for our bus to arrive, and this was during the off season. and yes, some places are further away than others on the bus, but you wouldnt get there any faster in your own car. (and if you are like me & my boyfriend, you love to go to Epcot & drink & have a sober bus driver take you home). the buses dont bother me, but thats just me. i'm on vacation, i'm not in a hurry. over all, i think this hotel is beautiful & everything great about Disney while still being adult, romantic, mature & comfortable. the rooms arent huge or fancy, but at WDW whos spending that much time in your room anyways? i would recommend this hotel to anyone, but especially people who want Disney, but dont want \"Disney\".", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cStay Here!\u201d", "Author": "mom3boysNj", "ReviewID": "UR55510344", "Content": "Loved this hotel... it is very unique.

However,.....that's about all you get from it - because it is very poorly run. The staff are very helpful and friendly and try hard - but this still doesn't hide the fact that little works as it should: a true African experience, you might say. The building is everything, the rest is below-par. Like the other posts below, housekeeping isn't quite on the ball and it took 7 consecutive visits by amiable, smiling staff just to get 2 teabags (which should have been there anyway). By the 4th tap on the door, I was wishing I hadn't asked! The deluxe rooms are a bit cramped - and quite frankly the views of the savannah are a bit irrelevant if you have just visited Animal Kingdom where you see many more of the same animals right up close, should you take the Kilimanjaro Safari ride. The views of animals from your balcony are usually at some distance and after the first 5 minutes, you probably couldn't care less. Even my 8-year old had no interest and she loves animals. You can't get a table for breakfast or dinner unless you book well in advance: the desk staff say this is because it's such a huge hotel (which it is) and also it's a popular dining venue - which is cold comfort when it's 8am or pm and you're starving. Forget about dining in Jiko unless you reserved last week - and when you do get a table let's hope you are more impressed than we were. Good, yes. Special, no. More of an up-market canteen, really. The acid-test of how poorly-organised this place is manifests itself at the front-desk. Trying to get someone to talk to you is a fight of the fittest - and you have to be patient, very. The poor staff are visibly harassed and hiding from people because everything is a direct or veiled complaint - just spend a few minutes listening if you have the misfortune to stay there. I loved the decor and the cathedral-like atmosphere of the lobby but who wants to stay in a cathedral? For somewhere so beautiful, it really is quite soulless. We stayed for our first week in a budget hotel before moving to the AKL where one night cost more than the week in the previous hotel. How I wish we hadn't moved! The first hotel was better all-round and near I-Drive instead of in the middle of nowhere.

We'd booked a standard view room but were kindly upgraded upon arrival to a Savannah view, room #3452. The good: This resort has incredible decor. Lots of art and artifacts, with plaques telling the story or describing what you're seeing. Many of the Cast Members are from Africa, in an exchange program Disney has set up with African Tourism and Animal preserve organizations. The Cast Members are very knowledgeable about the animals on the property, and the art and decor in the lodge, and are happy to tell you about their life in Africa. While waiting for the bus to the parks in the morning, there were often Cast Members out there with animal parts (teeth, antlers, etc) and educational games for the children. The gift shop, Zawadi marketplace, was immense, and had a generous selection of gifts as well as food and toiletry items. The not so good: The room was a lot smaller than we anticipated for a Deluxe resort. We were glad to have 2 queen beds (instead of doubles, which are too small for us), but there was a tiny table with only 2 chairs, so the four of us could never all sit down together. Mousekeeping had done a quick job preparing the room -- we found gummy candy on the carpet and the exterior of the fridge was covered with sticky hand prints. Also one sink did not drain (the plug was stuck in the down position), the clock and phone were covered with sticky residue, and the i-home clock was set 10 minutes too fast, and we couldn't figure out how to reset it without instructions. We enjoyed seeing a few animals from our balcony, but were disappointed that there wasn't a quidebook or pamphlet to tell us what we were seeing. When we asked for one, we were told they weren't available anymore. We also had to ask to receive a tip sheet with the daily activities for the resort -- we were not given one when we checked in, and there was not one in the room, so we had no idea about all the activities until our visit was almost over. The pool was closed, and the \"shuttle\" to Kidani village was actually just using regular bus transportation, so the one time we made the trek to go swimming, we ended up walking 10 minutes instead of waiting 20 minutes for a bus. We were told there would be a shuttle, which we assumed would be a van or mini bus between the two. The quick service restaurant is downstairs, in the basement, so refilling those resort mugs can take a long walk. Often we'd go get a drink to take back to our room, and by the time we actually got back to the room the cup was empty! There should be \"refill stations\" in other parts of the hotel, like at the ends of each wing! The soundproofing between rooms is very minimal. We could clearly hear the family in the next room each night as they struggled to get their kids to sleep, one night as late as 2:00am! We also could hear the plumbing noise of toilets flushing and showers running in the rooms above, below, and beside us. Not what you'd expect from a \"Deluxe\" resort. Overall: We enjoyed or stay at Animal Kingdom Lodge/Jambo House, but didn't really have time (or the information sheet until the 2nd to last day) to partake of all the activities it offered. It was a one-time splurge, and we won't likely stay there again. I'd recommend this hotel if you love Africa and observing wild animals. Also if you are up for the walking (the place is really spread out) and stairs/elevators (restaurants on basement level). I would NOT recommend this hotel if you have small children.

So, after much review, we decided to take the Disney route. I finally decided on the Animal Kingdom Lodge because of the pictures of the swimming pool, Disney's transportation and the ability to watch animals from your room. Our trip was good, but it would have been great if only Disney would have disclosed a few items, and would pay a little closer attention to details. Let me explain... We arrived at 2:30 for a 3pm check-in. We knew that we were early and that we would probably have to wait for a little while and we were advised that we would have a room by 3:30pm. What we didn't realize, was that we wouldn't be actually given a room until after 5:30. I would not have minded the delay, if they would simply advise you of the timeframe, so that you don't find yourself sitting in the lobby with your luggage for 3 hours like we did. After we finally made it to the room, we decided to take the kids to the pool, only to find that it is closed for refurbishement. This would have been really nice to know before we booked our package. They do offer shuttle service to the next villas to use their pool, but who wants to get on a bus and ride to another facility to use their pool while on vacation? Our room was nice and well appointed with great views of the animal areas, but it was a tremendous effort to just to reach it. I actually counted from the lobby, and it was 357 steps to the room. I'm really not sure of how this is equivileant in mileage, but it was definitely a long way, and I am a 10 mile a week runner. My advice on the transportation system to the park is to not use it. It is much easier to drive and parking is free as long as you are a guest at any of their resorts.

Having said that, it IS fun to watch animals from your private balcony as your schedule allows. Animals can also be seen from various viewing points both inside and outside the lodge. We were on the dining plan and ate at Boma and Mara several times. The Boma buffet at breakfast and dinner includes choices for both picky and adventurous eaters. The quality of the food is outstanding. The value at Mara for breakfast is especially good - a couple can easily share one of the combo platters. The lobby of the lodge is breathtaking. The shop has all of the souvenirs and convenience items that one expects in addition to a wonderful selection of African wares.

We brought our 10 month old son for his first vacation. I was nervous about planning a trip with an infant & didn't want to have to worry about little details. If you have any questions, I would encourage calling the 1-800 number on Disney's website. Their customer service people are very helpful & can answer minor or major questions/concerns you might have. Because of needing a large amount of supplies for an infant (i.e. diapers, snackcups, bottles, baby spoons, snacks, babyfood, etc.) I shipped a package to myself at the hotel. I would HIGHLY recommend doing this if you have a child OR just if you have too much to take in your suitcase! Its very simple to do if you are staying on Disney Property. You simply ship the box to yourself...with your name, Disney reservation number, & hotel address on it. Ship it so it arrives no earlier than 2-3 days prior to your visit. This process is wonderful! The disney cast member will link the box to your reservation in their computer system...so whenever you arrive, you don't even have to ask about your box! They will retrieve your reservation & get your box immediately! It was so convenient! As I said, this is good even if you don't have kids...simply mail yourself clothing, shoes, whatever won't fit in your suitcase! You can ship yourself a Large Flat Rate box for around $13.95 (up to 70 pounds) and this is much cheaper than the cost for an extra suitcase with the airlines! (just an extra tip!) Upon arrival, they also gave us a button that said \"First Visit\" for my son. He was a little young, but still loved the fact that he was given something while the cast member spoke to us about our room. The check-in process was very quick (I also recommend check-in on the Disney website if you book through Disney...you can do it the day before you leave & it makes the process much quicker/smoother!) Before saying anything about our room, I must comment on the huge lobby...it was beautiful!!! It is decorated with an African culture theme & has huge windows to see outside. Its absolutely beautiful! There is a gift shop onsite with Disney items (like stuffed animals, keychains, mugs/glasses, photoalbums, shirts, etc) as well as Animal Kingdom items & African culture items. Its a very nice store with a wide variety of items. In addition, I was surprised at the large variety of \"convenience store\" items you could get. One evening, we needed a bunch of things & I was planning to run to the giftshop...I made the comment to my husband \"If they have it.\" I didn't think they would have the items I needed...I was afraid I'd have to run to Walmart or Target. Well they had everything I was looking for. They have toothpaste, shampoo, pretzels/chips, some first aid items, a freezer with icecream...just to give you some examples. Over the course of my trip, I spent close to $250 at the giftshop at the Lodge & I watch money carefully (I am not a spender!) The rooms are very spacious. I don't know why others have complained about room space. Keep in mind, I had an infant who was crawling & starting to walk...he needed lots of space. I had no complaints...there was a closet with enough room to hang all of our stuff. I didn't have enough hangers though for all 3 of us but we just put our extra tops in the drawers. I had more than enough space in the 2 large drawers in the armoire...one for our clothes & one for my son's diapers, shoes, & toys/books that we brought along. We had a King-size bed, a couch, a small refrigerator, coffee maker, a small table with 2 chairs, and a private balcony. The vanity area has double sinks & the bathroom is separate from this area...I liked this a lot, it made getting ready in the morning a lot easier. The shower was huge & the bathroom had a door for privacy. I would suggest upgrading your room to the \"savana view\" so that you are able to watch the animals. Its not a necessity but it makes your trip a lot more enjoyable! My son & I spent many mornings & evenings on the balcony watching the animals. (hint: the animals are out more in the morning than evening...I think it is easier to see the animals from the viewing areas in the evenings) If you are planning to spend 10+ hours in the parks, I wouldn't suggest the \"savana view\" because you could spend that extra money on food, souvenirs, or another park ticket! There are many areas throughout the resort where you are able to sit in wooden rocking chairs & watch the animals. There are cast members (most from Africa) who are extremely knowledgeable & can tell you tons of information about the animals & culture! This was a great part of the trip! There is also a large viewing area outdoors, a playground, weightroom, arcade, and pool. Unfortunately because of my son's age, we weren't able to use the weightroom, arcade, or pool as much as we would've liked. The pool does have a nice wading area for small babies/toddlers. I took my son there one evening & he enjoyed it (it was the 2nd time he was in a pool) and I noticed the kids & how much fun they were having. So, even if you have very young kids, they will still be able to enjoy the pool area! One tip -- don't bring towels to the pool. There are areas (they look like large garbage cans) that have towels for you to use at the pool & an area to put them in when you are done. Very convenient! The eating areas -- AKL has 3 of these. Two are restaurants (I believe the one only serves dinner) -- they are the Boma & the Jiko. Unfortunately we did not go to either because you had to have reservations ahead of time. The one night, we went down & asked how long the wait would be & they said 45 minutes to 1 hour. It was nice because they give you a \"button\" to take to your room & it will light up & vibrate when they have a table ready for you. Unfortunately, my son fell asleep back in our room & since we didn't want to wake him, we cancelled with the restaurant. I have heard wonderful things about both restaurants & know people from other resorts who HAVE to go to the Boma every visit to Orlando! We primarily ate at the parks or at the Mara (the quick-service restaurant). I feel that they had a large variety of items (burgers, pizza, fried shrimp, soups, etc.) as well as three coolers full of snacks & side items. I would recommend getting the \"Disney souvenir mug\" with unlimited refills...HUGE savings! I believe it costs $14-15 and you will spend this your first day on property. In the coolers, they have different fruits, carrots, cakes, yogurt, tons of options as well as drinks. I would say however that its pricey...if you have a rental car, go to the local Walmart or Super Target & stock your refrigerator with snacks & drinks. They have a large seating area indoors as well as a few tables outdoors. Its nice to sit in the airconditioning after being outside at the parks, but its also nice to sit outdoors & enjoy the plants/scenery. There are stairs & elevators to get around the hotel & to the eating areas. I also recommend if you do not need a rental car, use the Disney Magical Express for yourself & your luggage. It is a simple process...at the airport, you go to a specially designated counter...its huge, you can't miss it! One person goes to the counter while the rest of your party waits on large couches/chairs. You check-in & it takes less than 5 minutes (even with a long line). You then go to another line & immediately get onto a bus which will take you to your hotel. We were the last stop & were there within 30 minutes...I thought it was pretty quick & loved not having to drive through Orlando traffic. You also get to see other resorts along the way. There are tvs on the bus for small children & adults to watch & learn about Disney. The day before you leave, the resort places a note on your door that says when the bus will arrive to pick you up. You simply take your luggage downstairs, check in with a cast member (who takes your luggage), and then head outside to wait for your bus. It takes you directly to the airport & you don't see your luggage again until you arrive at your home airport! Its very convenient & its one less thing you have to worry about. We also used the Disney shuttles to get to the parks. Make sure to ask when you check-in for a bus schedule. The buses arrive every 15-20 minutes (we never had to wait for a bus) but the schedule will tell you how to get around. For example, how to get to Downtown Disney via the bus route. I also highly recommend the Disney Photopass CD especially if you have kids or are traveling in a large group...order it online ahead of time for around $120 (sometimes they have a special for $99). This sounds expensive, but if you wait until you get home, you will pay $14.95 just for one picture or to get the download of ONE picture. We didn't even use the Photopass photographers that much & had over 50 photos. This is how it works: You will get a card (looks like a credit card) with a 16-digit number on it -- this service is free. Throughout the parks & some hotels, photographers will take pics for you. After you get home, you will enter the code on the website & can order whatever pics you'd like (or you can have a cast member do it for you at the resort or a photo center at the park). As I said, if you prepay the $99, you can have a downloaded copy of all the pictures & license to use them/enlarge them/whatever you want to do with them. You also can go on Disney's website & find locations of where the Photopass photographers are located throughout each park. They also come to the character meals. If you have a very young child & don't ride much, you may not see as many Disney characters because a lot of them are at the end of the rides. Ask any cast member & they can tell you where to get a \"Character Greeting Times Guide\"...this changes day-to-day & at each park. You can pick one up at the Magic Kingdom at either City Hall (in Town Square) or at the main tip board on Main St USA. I'm not sure where the guides are at other parks (probably near the entrances...ask a cast member). I also advise reserving meals ahead of time that are a MUST to your trip, especially Character Dining. You can do it on the Disney website or through their customer service number. I apologize for the length of this review...but I wanted to make sure to get all of my information in! I came home & said \"Oh, I wish someone would have told me that before I went\" at least a million times! So I didn't want to leave anything out. My main advice...if you don't know something, ask a Cast Member. They are all knowledgeable & can assist with any question you might have. If they don't know, they will find out...very nice people at all resorts & parks!", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Fe, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cComfortable and Pleasant\u201d", "Author": "InTheBizMyself", "ReviewID": "UR53412966", "Content": "We took mom for a milestone birthday to Kidani Village.

Ate breakfast downstairs in the quick service each morning. Ate dinner one evening quick service and also used our refill mugs for cocoa or cola. We have stayed the All Star Resorts and Pop Century.

Here is my review of the hotel with some thoughts about the Disney experience as a whole. The Hotel is indeed beautiful. it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a massive, African themed structure packed with eye-pleasing wood carvings, moldings , and lavish displays of every kind. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Disney, and definitely does not disappoint. The rooms are also decorated in the same substantial wood decor. The balconies are a little small, but the views of the savannas and grounds are very pleasurable. I was a little naive expecting to see animals all the time, but for the most part there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t many animals walking around. But when they were there, it was awesome! Especially the giraffes, but again they were only around for about 10 minutes a day. To be fair, we only had a few hrs of viewing time in the mornings as we were gone by 9 or 10 and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return till after dark. We were on the 3rd floor Kudo trail. And you can smell the poop at times. We dined at Boma, the buffet several times for dinner and twice for breakfast. I loved the variety of foods, and sampled everything. There were also plenty of kid friendly foods, French fries, pasta, along with chicken, beef and pork. The one thing I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like was the 18% gratuity extracted as the wait staff weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that visible and basically just refilled sodas. If there was one thing I regretted about the trip is that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch on to was the reservation concept. I thought that only character breakfasts needed reservations, fortunately I was able to get last minute reservations ( two weeks prior to arrival) at some nice places, Trails End at Wilderness lodge being one of them.

We debated staying down at the port but one of the families we were with wanted to stay at Animal Kingdom Lodge. Checking Disney's website showed a basic, non-view room would be $300/night. However, Expedia had the same room for $170/night. We booked and had low expectations- room near an elevator with a view of the parking lot. Our expectations were set too low. We had a quiet room down a hallway with a view of the animal area. It was great. Giraffes, zebras and antelope-like animals would wander near our room. They weren't 10 feet away, but sitting on the balcony gave a great view while the animals walked around and ate. The room itself was nice. We have previously stayed at Disney's cheaper resorts- Caribbean Beach and Coronado Springs. Those places were a little run down, with squeaky beds, old TVs, etc. Animal Kingdom Lodge has nice beds, flat screen TVs, nice fixtures in the bathroom, etc. The hotel premises are great. There are a bunch of animal viewing areas where you can sit and watch the animals running around. There are two big pools, each with a waterslide, and one with a water park (water cannons, a waterfall, a water playground). Disney staff were doing games and activities for the kids (free) at the bigger pool. There are at least three restaurants on site, including one that has quick service (with made to order plus pre-packaged food for sale). I do wish they would improve a few things: -WiFi should be free in all rooms. Instead, they have a wired connection available for $10/day. -Channel selection on the TV is pretty weak. -Food quality was a little sub-par. Not terrible, but could be improved. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It is more expensive than the cheaper places, but if your kids like pools and the weather is nice, you can skip the parks for a day or two and just hang out at the hotel (free), go to Downtown Disney (free), and go to The Boardwalk (free). The money you save just might make up the difference, and the rooms are substantially nicer than the cheaper places on the property.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge !\u201d", "Author": "manzoorf", "ReviewID": "UR50628354", "Content": "What a wonderful experience at the AKL. Starting with our Magical Express bus trip from Orlando Airport and the smooth and relaxing 35 min trip to the hotel, this was exceptional service at its best. The lobby itself is something to behold ... very impressive yet warm and inviting. Having arrived a bit earlier than the 3PM check-in time, we were pleasantly surprised to have a room available for us immediately. It gave us a chance to freshen up before heading out to Epcot. Being a stickler for room and hotel cleanliness, we were struck by the upkeep and cleanliness of our hotel room, bathroom, the hotel lobby and general access areas. Our room had two queen beds and a pool view. Very comfortable beds and pillows and the flat screen TV and balcony seating was great. Even though we didn't have a Savannah view room, viewing Giraffes, zebras and other animals from the various animal vantage points across the hotel was easy and fun. I know some people have commented about waiting times for the shuttles to the parks but we never waited more than 15 minutes and the ride was quick and direct to every park. From what I understand, the AKL is one of the few Disney properties that have direct shuttles to every single park. The only gripe we have about shuttles was that after park closing times, there was not always a shuttle readily available to hop back onto and usually the shuttles were standing room only and we had a stop at the Kidani Village lodge on the way back. However, again the wait was no more than 20-25 minutes every night. Boma : We had the breakfast buffet at Boma one morning and while it was very expensive (almost $70/2 adults + a 6 yr old), the choices were varied and exceptional. I especially enjoyed the corned beef with the Boma mustard. My wife was a big fan of the \"omlette your way\" option and the goat cheese scrambled eggs. We did breakfast at the Quick service Mara most other mornings and while not exceptional, the breakfast was not bad (and comparitively cheaper). Jiko : Between the superb soups and appetizers and the exceptional dinner entrees (tuna and curried prawns were superb), I can see why its such a highly regarded restaurant. It was an expensive indulgence that was well worth it. Simba's Clubhouse : We had the kids stay at Simba's Clubhouse the night we went to Jiko restaurant. The kids loved the Clubhouse and had lots of choices of activities - coloring, reading, movies and playstations that kept them busy and happy. Plus we were able to order the kids dinner at the Clubhouse. The rate was reasonable at 35/hr for 3 kids (ages 5,6 and 8). The Mara : Great location for snacks and quick meals. Open till 11:30 PM which made it convenient for quick snack runs after we returned back from park closures. Zawadi Market : Great selection of Disney branded items. Prices were comparable to about what one should expect for gifts/items in the parks. Our return back to the airport on the Magical Express was yet another smooth affair. In all, kudos to Disney for a job very well done with the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Some of our friends who visited the hotel and had stayed at other Disney Resorts in Orlando were very impressed with the overall ambience of the hotel.

However this review is for those who tend to stay at upscale resorts when traveling. We booked a standard room with the Savannah view (facing the animals) and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure it was worth the extra money. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time in our room, let alone on the balcony and there are quite literally dozens of opportunities to see the very same animals on your walk to the lobby and as you walk the grounds of the resort. If you plan on spending time in your room during the day or have children who might spend time on the balcony, I would absolutely suggest the Savannah view. If you plan on being out of the room during the daylight hours, I would suggest you save the money and get a garden view. The dining options at AK Jamba house (the main section of the resort) were a bit disappointing. The newest restaurant, Jiku, bills itself as an upscale South African dining experience however they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite there yet. The wine list was unique, try the Del Toren Fusion V, the food was delicious however the service was lacking in that we had to ask for water and we used the same utensils throughout the meal. For a meal that is comparably priced at Morton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steakhouse ($41 for an a la carte filet), I expected the service to be spectacular and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Every restaurant has a bad night; however we spoke with a couple at Epcot who experienced the same thing earlier in the week. We did not eat at the buffet, but there seemed to be many choices of meats, fruits and vegetables. The quick service section, the Mara, was as is to be expected. Fast food, coffee, soda, bagels in the morning. The pizza (cheese flatbread) was excellent believe it or not. A good place for a quick lunch or a snack as you lay by the pool. As I mentioned, there are many opportunities to view the animals that are kept in the resort.

We did not book a special room but we still had animals every day at the rear - giraffes, all sorts. The staff couldn't have been friendlier, the check-in was quick and easy and the hotel room was gorgeous. Yes it can be shady as the wood is dark but it is truly atmospheric. The dual sinks and separate bathroom works well with more than 2 people sharing. The beds were comfy. The TV was huge - mostly US channels but hey, you are in the US and why would you come if all you wanted to see was UK channels ! It's a fair walk (2 minutes !) if you are in a room a way away but no haslle, and good exercise and there are viewing windows and patios and things to look at all the way along. Even drinks/food/ice machines ! We tried all the restaurants - the quick self-service restaurant was excellent - the food for self-service was great and reasonable - coffee $1.25 ? You don't get that in the UK anymore. My fave was the soup that came in a hollowed-out bread roll dish, wonderful. The buffet restaurant, though always busy, was easy to get a table if you didn't mind waiting half an hour or so - go there about 5 and they will give you a pager for when your table is ready even if it's 2 hours later. Its always fully booked months in advance but you will get a table. It was no problem. The food was really good and all-you-can eat for about 30 dollars adult, 15 child. Quite expensive with the \u00c2\u00a3 not being as strong as it was but worth it. The range was amazing. The fine-dining restaurant is exactly that. So don't go there if you're looking for a quick large portion meal. It's not that, it's all carefully freshly prepared and has wonderful fine ingredients. We paid $200 for 3 of us for 3 courses plus wine and soft drinks but it was top notch. Try the room service also if you can't get a restaurant table - the food is in huge portions but soo worth it !!! The pool area of the hotel is also excellent. Tons of sun beds. Towels provided.

The toilet and bathtub area is very small and dark. I like to read while bathing and that was not possible here. I couldn't imagine having to bathe a couple of kids in there. The only amenities we were given were soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Nothing special or extra. The beds were comfy although I prefer a duvet rather than a sheet covered blanket configuration used here. The linens were very nice and crisp. Also, don't expect wifi in this hotel. Internet access is $9.95 per 24 hours and is wired. A wire is thoughtfully provided since most people would expect wifi and probably not bring a cable with them.

Tea is held in the afternoon while wine and cheese plus other snacks are available at 5 pm. Then at about 7 pm cordials and desserts are brought out. There is also soda, beer, juices, espresso, etc. at no charge. Of course, the best thing about this hotel is the animals. Make sure to book a savannah view room. Although the pool view would be fine in any other hotel ,seeing giraffes, zebras and numerous other animals and birds from your balcony is amazing. Also, I have to add this. It can be a very long walk to the lobby area from your room because of the layout of the hotel. If possible, ask for a room closer to the lobby than we had.

The only disadvantage to staying here is that it is not as convenient as the Magic Kingdom or Epcot resorts are. With some of the Magic Kingdom and Epcot resorts you can easily walk to the parks.

The quick bite cafe closes at midnight and there is no 24 hour room service (only breakfast, lunch and dinner). One other thing to note is that hotel does not have a business center or wireless internet access in the rooms. You have to pay about $10/per day for internet access (wired).

Ate at Jiko - absolutely fabulous - worth every penny - this is my 2nd time there and it truely is one of my favorite restaurants. Also ate the breakfast buffet at Boma - really good - great food selection and at $16.99 - i thought a good price. Didn't go in the pool this time - too busy running around the parks, but we did go to the other Savanna viewing areas - i really recco going at night and looking through the night vision binoculars. I think the only thing i didn't like about AKL was that apart from Animal Kingdom it is a long drive to the parks - the buses are great - just factor in a good 20 - 25 mins or so travel time plus however long you have to wait for the bus. In all honesty i think that apart from Magic Kingdom - its easier to drive to the parks as the price of parking is included in your hotel accomodation. Just one thing to know - if you are people who will be leaving your room at 6.00am and staying at the park till close then the Savanna view is probably not worth it...we spent a lazy saturday morning having breakfast on the balcony watching the animals, and then we had drinks on the balcony that evening watching the animals....so for us it was a huge part of the experience of AKL.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitehall, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWe loved our Animal Kingdom experience!\u201d", "Author": "Suebee70", "ReviewID": "UR47603107", "Content": "My husband and I along with our grown children stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge for 5 nights in October.

We felt that the room was very well appointed and particularly liked the flat screen TV as it allowed more storage space than we have previously enjoyed at WDW. We made use of the fitness centre and can warmly recommend the massage and facial services, the ladies were great.

We traveled with 4 generations of family...great grandparents, grandparents, parents (my husband and I) and our 3 children, ages 9, 5 and 2. We made our reservations about 6 months ago, and took advantage of the free dining promotion that Disney was offering. We upgraded the dining plan to the deluxe dining plan so that we would always have the option of a sit down meal, which the older folks prefer. The Animal Kingdom Lodge is lovely. We had stayed there once before, with just our immediate family, so we knew that we'd enjoy the surroundings. We had savannah view rooms, which meant that there were zebra and giraffe outside our balcony at times. Not too close, mind you, but it was neat. The other thing that's really neat about the AKL is that there are tons of African museum quality items throughout the resort. So much so, that the resort is actually considered a museum. A nice educational component, I think. The other thing that we really like about AKL is that there are a lot of programs for kids (and adults, actually) most of which are free, and quite educational. The kids learn about culture, conservation, music, etc. from the staff, over 50% of whom are actually from the African continent, which is really cool. Of course, the animals are always around, which is also really cool. The pool is nice, with a zero entry area, which is nice for the little guys. There is one water slide, which is open from about 9am to 8pm, but the pool itself is open 24 hours, which is also a great feature. The hot tub is large and was not crowded. There is a playground, too, and a very small kiddy pool which is about 1 foot deep, although I don't think that i ever saw anyone there. The restaurants are nice, the Boma has nice buffets with a lot of variety, and the Mara is typical Disney quick service dining. We didn't go to Jiko b/c some of us aren't very adventurous eaters, but I've heard that it's wonderful. The room service dining was fine, but quite pricey, and it was nothing amazing. In fact, my very expensive steak was overcooked. Here are my gripes about our stay: We booked over six months in advance, and requested connecting rooms. We had a total of 3 rooms reserved. We ended up with no connection rooms. We were near each other, but across the hall. And, it seemed like the rest of our party that was across the hall always had animals outside of their windows, and we rarely did! Who knows for sure! The other issue is that my 86 year old grandmother was with us, as was my dad, who, due to a recent injury, was in a wheelchair. Our room was about as far away from the lobby of the hotel as we could be. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that it took us 15 minutes to get to our room from ANYWHERE in the hotel. It was frustrating, to say the least. It made our days much longer, and the older folks much more tired. It was unnecessary and disappointing to me, especially since we booked so far in advance, were with folks who were elderly and infirm, and went at an off peak time. There were very short ride times in the park, so there's no way the AKL was anywhere near its capacity. Also, the AKL rooms seem to be a little smaller than the other Disney Deluxe resorts like Wilderness Lodge. The room description notes that there's a daybed in each room, but there wasn't one in any of our rooms, nor do I have any idea where they'd have put it. We had 2 queen beds, a small table with two chairs, and that was tight! Another issue, although one I knew to expect, is that AKL is far away from the other parks, so expect a long bus ride, no matter where you go...that's the trade off for staying in a place with lots of wild animals!! The one good thing is that AKL basically has its own buses...they don't stop at any other resorts! All in all, a great place to stay, lots of great kid programs, but a big lodge...so bring your hiking boots!!", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boynton Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best Disney has to offer!\u201d", "Author": "grena4", "ReviewID": "UR46303629", "Content": "We have stayed at a number of Disney hotels and this is one of our favorites.

Also, the room safe is not the size of other hotels so don't plan on being able to lock up your laptop.

A bit of a disappointment is that, though you have access to the club lounge via your room key, the actual floor on which this room is located is only for vacation club members. We requested a room close to the main elevator, making it easier to get our snacks. The room we were given, even though Club, wasn't really prepared as such. When we asked, we were given our robes and extra toiletry amenities as well as turn-down service. They have eliminated plastic water bottles when staying at Club.

My one complaint with Disney is that there is no affordable option for Internet access. With the rates we are paying for rooms, that would be a nice touch.

I prefer the pool view- the lush trees and tropical feel is more my idea of rest and relaxation. The pool is warm and clean. It is expansive in size- and doesnt reach over 5 feet high in depth.

We had booked a standard room as we couldn't justify the extra cost of a savannah view (\u00c2\u00a3700) and hoped to be upgraded anyway. When we got there we were given exactly what we paid for - a car park view room! There are other areas to view the animal but to be honest we only went a couple of times so feel better that we didn't pay the extra for a savannah view. The advantage of a standard view is that it was closer to the front of the hotel and therefore the car park, lobby, bus stops etc. I'd never stayed at a deluxe Disney hotel before and assumed the deluxe tag was for the savannah, however the hotel was fab. The beds were extremely comfortable (although this is always subjective) if a little high. I'd read reviews that said the rooms were small and dark but I didn't find that at all. With all the lights on or the curtains open they were very bright and although not large there was enough space. The counter service restaurant The Mara was average but we ate at Boma a couple of times and it was lovely. The pool area was beautiful and the pool itself lovely and warm. The only negatives - housekeeping tended to come late, one day at 4.20pm when we had returned to get changed for dinner which was inconvenient. Not a problem if you stay out all day. The other negative was the car park. Because of the savannahs it's all at the front of the hotel which means you can be parked miles away. It's the farthest out of the Disney hotels which can be a pain but it also makes it quiet.

Another complain I have was that the room smelled very musty. Also, there is a foul smell in the hallway by the public restrooms on the third floor. Even after all that, we wanted to stay an extra night but was told they were sold out (which I find hard to believe) so we moved to the Swan Hotel. Being that it is an older hotel, it was very clean and updated. Even though I will very much miss the Savanah view at Animal Kingdom Lodge, I dont think we will be staying there again. The Disney Transportation is also very slow. I feel like we spent most of our vacation waiting for Disney transportation than enjoying ourselves.

Let me just say that the hotel was amazing!! From the moment I walked through the front doors, I knew that I was transported far away from every day life the way only Disney can do so well. The lobby of the hotel is fantastic. The theming is done so well that you really do feel as if you've been whisked away to a lodge in the middle of an African savanah. It's very cozy, and there are plenty of nice spots to just sit and relax. Upon reaching the check-in desk, we were immediately greeted with a warm welcome and a smile. I had reserved a standard room on Expedia with a very good rate I might add, so I wasn't expecting any special treatment. To my surprise, we were given a Savanah room with a view of the animals, so I was very happy. There is something about waking up and looking out over the balcony to see giraffes that I thought was pretty cool. I really did enjoy it. As far as the room itself goes, it was beautiful. I thought the size was above average, and did not seem small at all. The room was well decorated, and continued the theming from the lobby and the rest of the hotel. Our housekeeper was also very friendly. Every morning she said hello to us, and on our last day she said goodbye and told us that she hoped to see us again really soon. It seemed sincere and it left a good parting impression on us. The food at the hotel is very good. We ate at Boma one morning for breakfast and it was excellent. The guick service eatery Mara is also very good, we ate there several times. I cannot comment on the dinner buffet at Boma because it was booked solid with reservations when we tried to eat there one night. I want to add that the location of the hotel is not bad at all. Indeed, it is located at the far southwest side of Disney property, but it was not a problem at all. We never waited longer than ten minutes for any bus to arrive, and the farthest ride was to Magic Kingdom, which took 10-15 minutes tops. Honestly, the location is fine, so if anyone is hesitant about staying there for that one reason, DON'T BE!!! The Animal Kingdom Lodge is far too beautiful and wonderful of a resort to pass up because of its location. All in all, I had a wonderful time staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. The grounds are beautiful and the staff really does a great job at taking care of you.

Our only complaint is that we wished we had longer than the 5 nights so that we could have stayed in the hotel a bit more! The Disney dining plan was absolutely superb. We met someone who said he would 'be glad to get home 'from chicken and burgers'. Well this wasn't our experience. We used our vouchers for breakfast, and meals at some of the top restaurants and didn't have a complaint at all. The snacks were excellent for bowls of fruit or fresh orance juice. We thoroughly enjoyed Donald's Safari breakfast (who wouldn't with a 5 year old?), dinner at the Coral Reef restaurant (Epcot) and a fabulous meal at Jiko in our hotel. Yes we did trade 2 table service vouchers but it was worth it. I can only hope that anyone who goes has such an enjoyable time as we did. Please look out (from the Arusha Savannah) for the large animal (I think an Anikole Cattle) who has his head on one side.

This lodge is a nice property, but our stay wasn't without some bumps. We arrived via Magic Express late on Wednesday evening. Upon approaching the Disney transports at the airport we were directed to go to \"that\" bus. I allowed my family to precede me on to the bus, handed my paperwork to be scanned by the cast member and she said, \"your on the wrong bus.\" I stepped up the three stairs and called the family off. In the mean time, the cast member walked away to see where I needed to be only to step back to us and let us know it was okay to board after all. The driver had four stops total. The Animal Kingdom was last. He said it would take 35 minutes. We arrived 50 minutes later. My kids were wowed upon entering the lodge. We arrived about 10:00 PM. We chose to bring carry on baggage with change of cloths, etc. since we didn't know how long it would take for our bags to arrive. There was no one in front of me at check in, and \"Kat\" was very gracious in welcoming us to the lodge. We had our difficulties thanks to a computer glitch. It was a long enough process for my wife and two kids to walk in the lobby and snap photos, go to the restroom, and walk in the lodge's shops. They came back to find me studying my materials about the dining plan and park hours for our days in the park. Kat had disappeared behind the door behind the check out. She had been gone for no less than 15 minutes trying to fix the problem. When my wife asked what was wrong I told her it was computer related. Apparently the computer was having problems making my wife and my room cards table to be used as charge cards. I asked another cast member to get Kat and she informed me of the problem was not fixed, but my kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s keys would open the room door. Off they went to drop the baggage. My family returned to find me in the same spot. The cast members at this property work hard and with sincerity. I do believe it was a computer glitch, but it was making for a very long check in process with the four of us very hungry and tired. My son informed me our view was of another buildings roof. I asked for a Magical Upgrade and Kat told me to check back in the morning about 9. Finally the glitch was fixed about 10:45. We hurried to the fast food court anticipating it closing at eleven. Mara is open till 11:30. We made it to our room right at 11 PM. Our luggage had not arrived. I called down to the bellman and learned that they \"say\" to allow 3 hours for the bags to appear. My daughter wears contact lenses and we didn't think about bringing additional cleaning supplies in our carry on bag for her lenses, so she and I head down to the shop. It was about 11:05 and the store closed at 11. I called down at 11:30 and our bags were there. They soon appeared. The following morning everything got better. I asked for the magical upgrade and was granted a beautiful pool room view from the fourth floor. The first room we were in had five drawers available to us in two different chests. The new room only had two drawers as part of a TV Armoire. This property looks just like the Wilderness Lodge. We stayed at the WL over Thanksgiving and when we walked in to the beautiful Animal Kingdom's lobby, we both agreed it was the same dimensions. The rooms are also the same as the Wilderness lodge. The beds are very comfortable. The linens and cleanliness of the room were all at Disney standards. The room could be larger for the four of us and all the \"magical stuff\" we accumulated over 4 days. We loved the pool. It has a zero entry and is positioned to receive most of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sun. The water was warm and the depth was comfortable for most children. The slide was delightful as well. The food at Mara was good enough. The selection is great for a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appetite and there is a person taking orders to improve the congestion and ordering process. My son and I did spend time in the arcade. I would guess there was close to 30 games. You could find both new and a few older ones for the mature crowd. Take a credit card or cash to play. There is a game card dispensing machine you need to purchase to play. Some members of Trip Advisor have mentioned the Disney property buses are too slow but we would not consider the time waiting, nor the time getting to parks, to be any longer than any other property. The negatives about my stay in the Animal Kingdom Lodge are few. On our last day we went to the parks, came back in the afternoon to swim and our room had not been clean by 4 PM. While getting ready to go back to the parks for the evening, two cast members knocked and when seeing us there asked if we would like to have housekeeping. I said yes. They said they would come back after 4:30. We came back to our room at 10 PM and the room was still untouched. I called down for clean towels and they brought them in minutes. The other thing was part of the theme of the lodge. As impressive as the details to the lodge are, the drumming music that plays nonstop from any speaker in the lodge or restaurants got real old. I wanted to hear a little different magical music by the end of our stay. My family and I agree after our departure we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here again. It was nice enough but not as great of a deluxe property as we anticipated. We are huge Disney fans, but this lodge was simply not a good fit.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, FL", "Title": "\u201cDeluxe Disney...Plus Animals!\u201d", "Author": "Hosalito", "ReviewID": "UR42479511", "Content": "My husband and I just stayed at the AKL this past weekend. Here are some observations that may be of use to you. 1) The lodge is located near (surprise!) Animal Kingdom. With that said, the bus rides to other parks/Downtown Disney do take longer than they would from other resorts, but never more than 20 minutes. The lobby is amazing with all of the African theming and the wood, but with that said, it as well as the interior corridors were also very dark, so if anyone in your party has vision issues, you may want to stay somewhere else. 2) We had a savannah view room with 1 queen bed (slept 2 adults just fine) and bunk beds. The room size, in all honesty, was not much different than the rooms at the moderately or value priced hotels. The part of the bathroom where the sinks are was spacious, but the actual area where the toity/shower are located was a TIGHT SQUEEZE and rather dark. Somewhat surprising for a deluxe Disney hotel. Also in the room was a desk, chair, a small balcony with two chairs and a tiny table, chest of drawers (under the flat panel TV), a converter so all you'd have to do is bring your gaming system, a wire (in the closet) for high speed internet access ($10/day), a refrigerator, an iron and ironing board, and a hair dryer. 3) I would try to book a savannah view room if possible. Yes, there are plenty of places to view the animals from other spots within the hotel, but waking up and throwing open your balcony door to find some giraffes grazing right outside was REALLY AWESOME. 4) We've eaten at Jiko many times and this time was no exception. Really great wine selection, service, and food. Ask for their separate vegetarian menu if you don't eat meat - they have some great offerings. I believe the room service is also provided from Jiko's kitchen so that is a huge plus! 5) We also had some drinks at the bar that is located on the 2nd floor, and they were reasonably priced and good. The bar doesn't stay open very late; it closes at midnight. So if you want late night drinks, I would suggest buying something at the store inside of the hotel and then keeping it in your refrigerator in the room. 6) It was our first time trying out Boma, and we only went there for the breakfast buffet ($16.99). The food and service were good, but there was not a whole lot for vegetarians or healthy eaters. I know this IS Disney and hey, you ARE ON VACATION but some of us don't like to indulge at every meal, especially at breakfast. 7) We also ate at Mara, the counter-service operation. Food from there was good as well, and it was never 'crazy busy' when we went. 8) This hotel has one of the best gift shops of any Disney resort in my opinion. It is huge and offers it all (all sorts of toiletries, booze, drinks, snacks, along with a plethora of the usual Disney souvenirs). 9) My only gripe was the amount of time it took to get our tickets, that we had purchased online, turned into real tickets at the Front Desk (if you are a Florida resident, you must purchase the tickets online if you want to obtain the discount - they will not offer it at the hotels/parks). We waited so long that they finally gave us a credit on our room, which was much appreciated, but the time was still lost. 10) Valet is not really that expensive at $10/day. I've seen worse! But the self-parking was not that far from the entrance so that would be \"doable\" on a non-rainy day. 11) We walked to Kidani Village which was pleasant. Kidani is definitely BRAND SPANKING NEW and their restaurant, Sanaa, has a great menu and looks out over the savannah. We did not eat there however. 12) Room was spotless during our entire stay. Cannot fault the maid service at all. 13) Noise level was not that bad. We could hear the people above us in the bathroom, however, which was a bit annoying at times. And you cannot escape the noise of those powerful Disney toity flushes! 14) The pool area looked amazing, although we did not go in. Nice slide for the kiddies and a couple of spa areas for the parents. Plenty of life guards on duty. We stayed here using a 40% off coupon that we had received from Disney. Had we had to pay full price, I am not sure I would have felt like I had gotten my money's worth (due to the room size and lack of soundproofing).

Yuk! The bathroom tub was dirty and there was hair all over the blanket on one of the beds. The standard room had dust fly out of the coverlet on the bed. When my 4 year old starting sneezing the next day, I wasn't sure if it was a cold or allergies to the animals & dust in the room. By evening, he was very congested. He continued coughing, sneezing & eye rubbing throughout our stay. His symptoms improved after we left As far as the rest of the hotel goes, it's somewhat dark in the halls & rooms.

It jwas our very first trip to Disney, and we were not disappointed. It was a very nice resort. The lobby and grounds are beautiful and the rooms are fine. The bathroom area is large and roomy while the sleeping area is a bit small, but this was not a problem for us. We had no issues with housekeeping. Our room was cleaned well every day and on a few occasions when we requested extra items like bedrails and hangers they were brought up immediately. Staff overall was very accommodating. The best part of this resort is, of course, seeing the animals from the privacy of your own balcony. Prior to our visit, I had requested an Arusha savannah view on the 3rd floor. When we arrived, we got an Uzima savannah room (3510). I loved the location of this room since it was in the middle of the zebra trail and close to everything, however we rarely saw any animals in this savannah. I requested a room change and mid-week we were moved to the room directly opposite (3503) with a view of the Arusha savannah. This room was fabulous - we saw a wide variety of animals all day and it was again in the middle of the zebra trail so not a far walk from the lobby. I also liked being on the 3rd floor as it is the same floor where the lobby is located, plus it is at a good level for viewing the animals. This room also adjoined to another room, which is nice for large families that want to be next door to one another. The adjoining door area gave us a bit more space too, which was nice since the room is a bit on the small side. My son absolutely loved the pool. We couldn't get him out of it! The zero depth entry is nice for little ones, and the slide is great as well. He could go down it all by himself. The entire pool, except for a very small area in one corner, is pretty shallow, so it is ideal for preschoolers and grade schoolers. Teens and adults might find it a bit boring but we thought it was nice. We also went to both water parks and while our son had fun there, he preferred the resort's pool. The food at the resort was just ok. The food at Mara - the quick service restaurant - was pretty mediocre. We had the same Mickey waffles and scrambled eggs every day. There is not much variety and the food was bland. Boma was good but not great. Nice variety and flavors. Jiko was also good, but very expensive. I had the filet, my husband had the pork loin and our son had cheese pizza and the bill was $150. Again, a good meal but nothing outstanding and for the price I would have expected more. Our best meals of the week were at Artist Point at the Wildnerness Lodge and Ohana at the Polynesian resort. The food at Artist Point was fabulous and Ohana is a fixed menu restaurant where they bring the food to your table and it never stopped coming. The food was absolutely delicious and we didn't pay more than $70. We also ate at Chef Mickeys and the California Grill. Chef Mickeys is great for the kids so they can meet all the Disney characters, but the food is not very good at all. The California Grill was good but very expensive. We ate there late one night so we could see the fireworks from Magic Kingdom on their 15th floor observation deck. I feel that we paid for the atmosphere and view more than the food. We did enjoy watching the fireworks from the observation deck though. We were a little worried about booking this resort because of its far location from Magic Kingdom, but honestly we didn't have any transportation issues at all. Expect for on one occasion, the buses came frequently (every 5-10 minutes). We took the buses to Epcot, Magic Kingdom, Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon. The two days we went to MK and came home after the fireworks, we did have to stand up in the bus but that was to be expected. The buses came frequently and we were not waiting long at all. I was pleasantly surprised. So I don't think this resort's location is an issue. Transportation is quick and very well organized. We enjoyed our first trip to Disney very much, and this resort had a lot to do with it.

I didn't in the end but as we arrived at the check in and looked at the amazing lobby a suddenly decided that I wanted a savana view room. As we checked in I asked the recepionist how much it would cost to upgrade to a Savana view room. She said we had a savana view room. I couldn't belive it and was glad we didn't pay the extra \u00c2\u00a3600. We went up to our room and dumped the bags. The room was large, light and bright. There was bottled water in the fridge (tap water was not very nice as I found out) ready for us and a safe in the room. The bed was a kingsize bed and was very, very large. The view from the balcony was amazing. We had giraffe, buffalo and many other animals out side the window. During the trip all the staff were very friendly and helpfull. We had the Disney dinning plan and this saved us about \u00c2\u00a325 a day in food. It cost \u00c2\u00a350 a day for the two of us. This included a quick service meal (burger and chips, dessert and a drink), a snack (ice cream) and a table service meal (sit down meal, main course, dessert and a drink). We added the cost most days and it was about \u00c2\u00a375 a day. It was expensie to eat at Disney and we could have eaten cheaper out of disney. Some of the better Disney restaurants required 2 table service meals. This did limit you to eat at Disney Restaurants. One evening we ventured out of Disney and went to Ponderosa steak house (steak and all you can eat buffet was \u00c2\u00a36) this was excellent. The only problem was you have to tip everyone and we estimated that we spent \u00c2\u00a312-\u00c2\u00a315 a day in tips on the meals alone. Another tip if you eat in Disney, is book the restaurants in the UK before you go. We had problems booking into as they were all fully booked. You can book them online up to 180 days before you go. There was about 8 restaurants that we wanted to eat in but were all fully booked. Also you can buy a refillable mug for $12.99 (\u00c2\u00a38) at the hotel and you can refill this as many times as you want during your trip at the disney resort hotels. The holiday was excellent and the hotel was top class. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We did vist every other Disney hotel and tried to have a drink in every bar. The other hotels that looked very good and would consider staying in next year are: 1. Grandfloridian 2. Coronado Springs 3. Yatch and Beach 4. Polynessian The Pool was large and there were about 4 life guards on duty every day. We did have a beer and a glass of wine in the bar. This cost us $14.50 (\u00c2\u00a311). So we then decided to drive to Wallmart and we got a large case of beer and 2 bottles of wine for the same price.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales", "Title": "\u201cAfrican Paradise where tropical animals roam freely in the wildlife reserve surrounding your resort\u201d", "Author": "JSlarkey", "ReviewID": "UR39151443", "Content": "We stayed at the AKL from 9th August to the 23rd August 2009. Overall The AKL has the WOW factor in particular the lobby and landscape window looking out onto the Savannah. The attention to detail is excellent, especially the lights, shades, wooden d\u00c3\u00a9cor on the room doors, panelling, carpets and furnishings etc. Even the lift doors have a giraffe embossed on the metal. Rooms We had a Uzima partial Savannah view (Room 4547) and were not disappointed; the wildlife roamed freely beneath our balcony, providing great photographic opportunities. So think again if you are considering paying the difference for a full Savannah view. The room although on the small size comfortably accommodated 2 adults and 2 children. We had a queen size and bunk beds. The room had a tastefully decorated African theme and cleanliness was excellent. However, there was a distinct lack of storage space; only 2 drawers to satisfy 4 people. So we had to live out of suitcases, which was inconvenient. The walk from the lobby to our room was a bit of a trek, approx 5-7 minutes, however, ideally situated for the pool and Mara restaurant. Pool The pool can get quite busy during the day, but not over crowded. The pool is designed for relaxing and not the serious swimmer. It is a lovely pool surrounded by green shrubs and trees, and has two spas. Access to the pool is easy; ideal for children as the deepest part is 4\u00e2\u20ac\u212211\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; plenty of sun loungers in and out of the shade; 4 life guards patrol the pool from 9 to 9; and pool towels are plentiful. The pool slide is on the tame side and therefore is preferable for under 8\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Food The AKL provided a wide choice of dining options. The Mara offered a counter service (fast food) dining option. The food was freshly prepared and tasty, although there was a limited choice of healthy options Boma offered a table service buffet dining experience. There was plenty of choice to suit everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taste and appetite. Jiko catered for the more discerning diner, providing a table service signature dining experience. Since our last visit (2003), we have noticed a significant increase in the price of food and drink. Therefore, for the British tourist, we would highly recommend the Disney Dining Plan. The plan we opted for included 1 table service meal, 1 counter service meal and 1 snack per person per day. And it may surprise you that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t utilise all our counter service meals during our stay. Without the dining plan you can expect to pay the following: \u00ef\u0192\u02dc Table service meal costs on average $50 per head and includes a main course (steak or fish), dessert and soft beverage. \u00ef\u0192\u02dc Counter service meal costs on average $15 per head and includes burger and chips, soft beverage and a dessert such as fruit or yogurt. \u00ef\u0192\u02dc Snack costs on average $2.50 per head and includes one bottle of water or coke, coffee, an ice cream etc. You do the maths. Over 14 days, you would be expected to pay a minimum of $945 per person. So a family of 4 would pay $3,780 (equivalent to \u00c2\u00a32362). In the US, waiters expect a tip. The going rate is 18%. For parties of 6 or more, this is automatically added to your bill. So you have to add this extra cost on top of your table service dining option. SO PLEASE CONSIDER DINING OPTIONS AND GET YOUR TRAVEL PROVIDER TO INCLUDE IT IN YOUR HOLIDAY. I would also recommend the refillable mugs. They cost $12 each but allow you to have unlimited refills of any soft beverage at the hotel. Staff We found the staff to be friendly. There was always a good morning and friendly banter. OK \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of the Waiters had an attitude, and cared more about the tip than the service. Transportation The AKL is remote from some Disney Parks and Attractions, however, is on the door step for the Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios and Epcot. No matter what other visitors say, our longest wait experience was 20 minutes and that only happened on 2 occasions, and we were living on the buses commuting between the Hotel and Parks. The bus service is regular to the AKL and if you have to queue then talk to your neighbour and have a laugh. You are on holiday! The buses can be often crowded particular in peak season, so be prepared to stand. It can sometimes be like sardines or peak times on the London Underground. But seats are often given up for woman and young children. Please feel free to email me about any details. General Disney Expectations As returning visitors to WDW, the previous visit being in 2003, we have noticed that Disney has lost some of its magic. Although we love Disney it still remains a wonderful place to visit, especially to the first time visitor. The principle of the dining plan is excellent as it saves you money overall. However, as there are 22 Disney hotels, the restaurants get booked up very early. What we noticed is that with the dining plan you are planning your holiday itinerary around restaurant availability, which takes away the fun, spontaneity and freedom of choice. Even when you have made a reservation, be prepared to wait up to 1 hour to be seated. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is very frustrating especially as they recommend you check in 15 minutes before your scheduled time. Our experience this holiday was: \u00ef\u0192\u02dc Chef Mickey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s booked for 10:30 am seated 11:30 am \u00ef\u0192\u02dc California Grill booked for 21:40 seated at 22:20 \u00ef\u0192\u02dc Le Cellier booked for 14:45 seated 15:15 \u00ef\u0192\u02dc Tusker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s House booked for 10:20 am seated 11:10 am \u00ef\u0192\u02dc Sci-Fi Restaurant booked for 19:30 seated 20:15 \u00ef\u0192\u02dc Mama Melrose booked for 16:45 seated 17:30 \u00ef\u0192\u02dc San Angel booked for 19:30 seated 20:20 We also tried \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWalk-ins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but found it very difficult to get a table except for the Rose and Crown where we managed lunch without the wait. The Fast Pass (FP) system has deteriorated. Again it is good in principle but for the most popular attractions and rides the allocations of FP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have gone by midday. So if you are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the Park early expect a stand-by wait up to 2 hours on the popular rides. For example, we got a FP at 10:00 am for the Toy Story ride in Hollywood Studios for our ride window at 15:15-16:15. We then had to wait a further 2 hours before we could use the FP again. Disney needs to learn from Universal Studios. We had a FP (paid extra for it though) that entitled us 1 FP per attraction available any time of day. You are then not planning your day around the FP system. Avoid the Extra Magic Hours in peak season. The FP does not apply and furthermore every man and his dog are there, so expect very long queuing times. For example, we queued 70 minutes to go on Soarin, 70 minutes for Test Track and 65 minutes for Mission Mars. We noticed that the Parks without the extra magic hours were quieter. The merchandise in the Disney shops is not as nice, and the choice is more limited, but prices have still inflated. It is not value for money. But if you are like us, it is always nice to bring back some mementoes. I recommend that if you are staying in a Disney Hotel and use the delivery service from the Parks to your Hotel, check your packages carefully, as on 2 occasions when using this service, the items were broken in transit. Disney did replace them, but if the hotel gift shop does not stock the item they will try and send elsewhere to exchange the item. So make a fuss and they will bring it into the shop. Disney is reactive to guest problems as opposed to proactive. I believe they are geared up to resolve problems. They probably see it as being cheaper to maintain. If you do have to complain, be prepared to be compensated by FP tickets for your inconvenience. And if the problem is severe, they will financially compensate you by refunding $X onto your hotel bill. This happened with us, as we were refunded $100 for our bad dining experience. So my advice is, complain and work the system to get FP Park tickets. I acknowledge it is not nice behaviour but seems to be the new Disney. Visitors with teenagers, who prefer more thrill rides, go to Universal as Disney are falling behind. They have let Universal catch up and overtake them. The Magic Kingdom is only for the younger visitor. My boys are aged 14 and 11 and soon got bored at the Magic Kingdom except for Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain. Unfortunately, Space Mountain was under refurbishment. I could go on but we will return to Disney, with our expectations better managed. Disney is still a magical place.

As you walk in through the doors, you are faced with the most amazing lobby you're ever likely to see. It really does impress and the rooms are beautifully decorated and appointed. To see a giraffe or zebra walking past your balcony is very special indeed. You really feel like you are looking out over an African Savannah and nothing about it seems 'man made'. The Uzima Pool area is also wonderful, the pool is great and is very relaxing which is a welcome break from the parks and the Hot Tub Jacuzzi's really do soothe those aching muscles after the amount of walking you do. We were lucky enough to be in the Jacuzzi when American child stars Zak and Cody of the Suite life and some of the other stars of the Disney Chanel were in there with us! They were superb and gladly posed with our nieces and other children for photographs which was priceless and made the kids holiday! I just love the shop at the hotel called Zawadi Market Place as along with sweets and chocolate, medication, drinks etc it also sells the most wonderful Aftrican carvings, paintings, instruments, and Disney clothing. I could browse around it for hours. The restaurants although very expensive are very good but the Mara Quick Service Food Court is fab. The food is of exceptional quality, varied choice and reasonable. The location is not a problem as you have to jump in the car or on the Disney Transport to go anywhere really so although some people have commented that it's a little far out, as Walt Disney World Resort is around 49 square miles, most places are a little far out if you're travelling to the other side of Disney! I would and do recommend this hotel to anyone who will listen and cant think of any downsides other than perhaps the restaurants being a little on the expensive side.

I had read reviews of the long bus rides from the Animal Kingdom Lodge but I guess I didn't fully appreciate the agony of the trips to and from the theme parks. Not only are the rides long but in the very least they are uncomfortably crowded and at the very most they are dangerous. When riding back from most theme parks the buses were over filled with people crowding every inch of the bus. Strollers block every egress point (in violation of the posted law). We finally just drove to the theme parks near the end of our trip. The drive was short and made for much more enjoyable trip. Now for the lodge itself. We were checked in by a very pleasant front desk attendant who explained every detail of the ticketing process, dining plan and hotel attractions. We had checked our luggage and valet parked our car for $10 per day. After finding our room we were hungry so the family went to eat at Mira, the quick serve restaurant. I called for our luggage and waited in the room, and waited, and waited, waited. After an hour I called and the attendant said they were busy. After waiting some more I went to pick up the luggage myself. They finally found the luggage and would not let me take it to my room. I had to wait for a bellman to bring the luggage. He was very polite and said he was sorry for the wait. This was the worst of the stay and everything else was great. The theme at the AKL is the best. The lobby, hallways and rooms are decorated in a tasteful African theme. We had a savanna view room where Zebras, Giraffe and Elk roamed not far from our window. It really is a great theme for all ages. Mousekeeping was great every day even though the the room was sometime made up late. After a long day at the parks it was nice to come back to a nice clean room and watch the animals from the balcony. The room itself is very small, especially for the price charged, but it was otherwise just fine. The beds are less comfortable than the average hotel. The AKL has 3 places to eat. We ate at Boma's and the quick serve restaurant Mira. Boma's was great and the Mira was fine for quick serve. The pool is large and attended by life guards during the day. It is still open at night without lifeguards but not as pleasant when foul mouth teens rule the water. There are two hot tubs but for some reason management put a smoking area right next to one of the hot tubs. Internet is an extra $10 per day so leave the work at well, work, and enjoy the animals at the AKL.

As others have stated, the bathroom is huge. In my opinion the bathroom could be a little smaller and the bedroom itself a little bigger but the glass shower, large closet and whirlpool tub are luxurious! The closet toilet is not as nice.

At times it was hard to not watch the animals. It was so unique and fabulous!!! We swam in the pool, it was not as big as i expected it to be but it was clean and well-staffed. The walk to the pool from rooms is long but it is an indoor walk through air-conditioned hallways so I am not sure what all the complaining is about. The reception area is smaller and more homey than the massive one in Jambo House, I like it better for DVC members...find it more welcoming. The only negatives I have is that our room was not ready when we arrived at noon, but check-in is at 4:00. Our room was ready a little after 2 p.m. Also, we were celebrating an anniversary and we received a knock on our door and a towel sculpture and photo pass after we had already been there for two nights.

Ever notice how they never have satisfaction surveys for your stay? Seeing the animals was nice but we were there very little since most of the time we were at the parks.I should also mention that you are picked up and dropped off before and after the other Animal resort that is there. Buses are not as frequent so waits will be longer. One day we waited for one hour at Animal Kingdom Park before a bus even showed. We all cheered with delight when one finally came.

Better to buy some groceries at the supermarket and put them in your tiny fridge in your hotel room. Use the hotel located outside near the pool to toast bread or heat up milk.

After 14 hours of travel we booked into a fuss free reception area and we were impressed with the reception area it has an africian theme to the hotel and nothing is cheap about this hotel its furnishing and ambience are second to none. The room we had was lovely near to all amenities with interconnecting facilities to our children's room, as we looked out across the balcony towards the Savannah where there were Zebras Giraffes and other amazing animals in a natural habitat with friendly guides to explain all about them in detail. The food was exceptional at the Bomo which is one of the main restaurants but expensive it cost us $130 for four of us and if your children are over 9 yrs of age you have to pay adult portion size .... my daughter was 11 and did not in any way eat an adult size meal which really annoyed me!!! The other take away facility on the complex call Mara was good for breakfast and a quick snack serving a variety of meals at good prices. Make sure you get the refill mug at $12 each as you can fill up all day as long as you are on the complex saves you a lot of money. The pool was fantastic lots of lifeguards and a slide for the kids but only a small one, there are some spa's which are nice for relaxation after a hard day at the Theme Park. The staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble I had a wheelchair and it cost me nothing for the duration and was taken to all the parks, you can buy your tickets for the parks at the hotel and they are cheaper, they then put it on your key card which was really a good idea. The rooms are clean and bedding is changed on a regular basis along with the towels our room was not cleaned a few times but a quick phone call to housekeeper services and it was like the faries had been in along with the cleaner making disney faces with the towels on our return the children did find this fun even at teenager level. You do get extra access to the parks because you are in a Disney Hotel worth enquire about as during the day they do get over crowded. Also washing facilities at $2 a wash also $2 for drying no need to take the dirty clothes home with you at all. You can use the internet if you ask at he Reception for 15 mins free to keep in touch with the UK , no english channels on the TV and English newspapers at Downtown Disney at the Irish bar if you want one !!! I would find the room for 4 would be small but you could manage I was delighted with our two rooms and the kids could watch the TV late on at night without disturbing us after a long hard slog at the parks. This was our first vist and it won't be our last an exceptional Hotel and well worth the extra monies as it is very big with lots of rooms glad we had one near the reception area. There is a shop on site and sells a variety of goods including food / fancy goods worth a visit but expensive. All Disney is expensive get the Disney dinner plan if you are from the UK as you will benefit from this a great deal otherwise its deep pockets as remember they have the monopoly and there is no were else to go as you are restricted to the complex or the Parks. This did not put us off and we had a fantastic time the best holiday - now we are looking to go again in the not too distant future.

There aren't many places in the world where you can do this for $159 a night. When we first arrived at this resort, it was like were arriving at a remote, exotic place. The vegetation, decor, and all the surroundings really make you feel like you could be in Africa- not in a resort hotel just a few minutes away from giant amusement parks. The lobby is beautifully and elegantly decorated. There is plenty of comfortable seating, and it never seemed crowded while we were there. There are cast members everywhere waiting to answer questions and be of service. I never had a problem finding help when I needed it, and everyone was very friendly. I only had to wait a couple of minutes to check in, and I visited the concierge desk several times. There were never lines. The hotel is HUGE, and our room was near the back of the hotel, so we had quite a walk. But the hallways are so nice, and there are views of the animals as you walk down the halls, so this was not a problem for us. You can also get complimentary wheelchair access if you have guests in your party who have difficulty walking. You also have the chance to request a room near the front (we preferred having a room at the back to see more animals). We booked a standard view room, but they gave us a Sunset Savanna view, nonetheless. They considered it to be \"partially obstructed\" because there were some fences below our balcony, but we saw animals every morning. We usually saw 6 giraffes, three zebras, several ankole cattle, some birds, some wildebeests, and some other types as well. They gathered back there for morning feedings, so it was a perfect time to sit on the balcony with a cup of coffee and enjoy. Even if you don't have a room with a great view, you can see plenty of animals. All along the hallways are public balconies where you can sit and rock in huge wooden rocking chairs and watch them. We sat there several times for a different view and to rock in the chairs. There was hardly ever anyone on these balconies, so it was like having them to ourselves. The rooms are very nice. We had four adults and a 2 year old in our one room, so it was a little tight, but we got along just fine. The decor is really nice, the beds are firm but comfortable, and there is plenty of storage space for clothing. The bathroom was small but elegant, and we liked that the sinks were not inside the same room as the toilet and the shower. The balconies are a nice size. You can't really sit down for a breakfast for four out there, but for just sitting to relax and watch the animals, they don't need to be any bigger. The pool is fabulous. There is a zero depth entry, which my two year old loved. She could walk right into the water without being scared. The water was clean and felt great in the afternoons after a hot day at the park. We watched the flamingos near the pool and she played on the playground. There were always plenty of chairs and towels, though perhaps not enough umbrellas for everyone. The pool never seemed too crowded. There are two spas, which were wonderful for massaging and comforting tired, sore muscles after a long day at the park. They were never crowded, and a few times I had the spa all to myself. The food was very good. We ate at both The Mara and Jiko, though we did not eat the buffet at Boma. The Mara actually pleased my husband, who is a bit of a food snob. He thought it was quite good, as did my mom and my sister. The food at Jiko was amazing. I ate scallops, which were perfectly cooked and came with a delicious cucumber salad, and my husband had the braised beef short ribs. The meat melted in the mouth. It was very expensive- our meal for the two of us was $120 which included one appetizer, two entrees, one beer, and one specialty cocktail. The service was not great. Our server was a little casual for our taste at such a restaurant, but it was okay. Nice ambience in the restaurant. We had a view of the resort pool from our table. Although we chose Jiko because my husband does not like buffets, I would probably skip Jiko next time and try Boma. From what I could tell, you probably get more for your money- and you get a much larger variety. For the price we paid, I think the location was fine. Although I would certainly prefer to ride the monorail to the parks, I don't think it is worth the extra money to stay at one of the monorail hotels. We had a car and drove to the park the first day, but thereafter decided to ride the buses. It took about the same amount of time to ride the buses as it did to drive, when you consider that the buses drop you off right in front of the parks and you don't have to bother with the huge parking lots or riding trams. We never had to wait long for a bus, and we never missed a bus due to large crowds, though sometimes we did have to stand. I had a large stroller, but it was not a problem getting it on and off the bus quickly, as the crowds were not too large. I would not, however, want to handle a stroller and a child by myself on the buses. You need at least two people for that. Another thing I love about this hotel was the willingness of the staff to make our stay as nice as possible. My mom developed a problem with her leg from walking so much, so I asked about renting a wheelchair. The bellhop said he could get her one that she could use for the entire length of her stay. She could even take it to the parks with her- free of charge. He immediately brought one out and gave it to us. I thought that was very nice. We had only a couple of small issues while we were here. It took about twenty-five minutes to get our luggage after we arrived, because they were slow getting it up to our room. It wasn't a big inconvenience, but we did have to sit and wait in the room for a little while. That wasn't too bad, since we had a nice view of the animals. Our refrigerator did not work, but quickly after we called they sent someone up who brought another refrigerator. We also found a lipstick stain on one of the glasses. Other than those minor things, we had no concerns whatsoever. All in all, we loved this hotel. I don't think you can beat it for the price, the service, and the ambiance. It is great for all ages. Everyone in my party had fun- from my 67 year old mother to my 2 1/2 year old daughter.

Magical Express \u00e2\u20ac\u201c used this to and from the airport and thought it was a great service. The trip to the hotel took slightly longer as the bus was busy and we dropped off at 3 hotels before getting to AKL which was slightly annoying after a long flight. Check in was a breeze, despite being a Saturday which seemed to be one of the busier days for arrivals. Took less than 5 minutes. Room - mine was on the Kudu trail. After reading other reviews on Tripadvisor, when we booked we had requested rooms that were near to the lobby/restaurants. I was on the 4th floor with a partial Savannah view. The room was immaculate, not a speck of dirt or dust anywhere. The rooms are a little dark but like others have said its in keeping with the resorts theme. I found the room to be plenty big enough, with ample storage space. Beds were comfortable, no problem with the air conditioning, plenty of clean towels and toiletries provided. Was great being able to sit on the balcony and watch the animals outside. I would not pay the extra for a Savannah view room because even if you aren't lucky enough to get a partial view there are so many places around the hotel where you can view the animals I don't think it is worth the additional expense. Pool - we spent most of our days around the pool, choosing to visit the parks in the evening when the weather was slightly cooler. The pool didn't start to get busy until 10/11am. We always tended to arrive before then so could get seats in our favourite spot, just behind the pool and right by the bar!! The lounger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right around the pool were always taken by lunchtime when the pool was at its busiest. However we always managed to get chairs even if we came down in the late afternoon. Plenty of towels available. Lifeguards on duty for most of the day and were really attentive. Great slide that the children loved. Dining - ate in Boma for breakfast and dinner. Was a little disappointed both times after reading such great reviews here, maybe I was expecting too much. I thought dinner was better than breakfast - prime beef was amazing. Did not eat in Jiko myself but some of my family did and really enjoyed it. We ate breakfast and lunch most days from Mara, I thought there was a good selection and prices were reasonable for a resort hotel. The one thing we all thought was missing from the hotel was just a normal restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so not a fine dining one like Jiko or a buffet like Boma. Somewhere to grab some lunch without having to go and get it from Mara. Would have been nice to enjoy a bite to eat at the pool bar for example. Transportation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c other reviews have complained about the length of time either waiting for a bus or the time it took to get to the various parks. We did not experience any of these problems. Only once we had to wait in a long line at Magic Kingdom for about 40 mins. Other than that the buses always arrived promptly and I thought the system worked very well. Yes the ride could take up to 15 mins but it was nice to get a break to sit down in an air conditioned bus! Overall, I thought this was a fantastic hotel. All public areas and rooms spotless.

If you have never experienced this place before, prepare yourself as you walk through the main doors. You need to stop and just soak in the scenery as you enter.

From endless couches to lounge on, to a TV area playing cartoons for big and little kids to watch, to a fantastic collection of artifacts from Africa found THROUGHOUT the entire resort\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you will be absolutely amazed. I know I was. We DID have a bit of a hiccup during check-in (which we had NO wait for and were checking in about 4:30PM on a Sunday). When we had made the reservations back in March, we knew that what we were asking for were just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153requests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but when we called back in April to pay off the trip, we were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153told\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd what room we were going to be getting\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6down to the floor and view\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which made us happy because it was all what we wanted. This was not the case when we checked in. We were expecting to be on the 3rd floor facing towards the main circular savannah, but we ended up on the 4th floor facing the left savannah. We had a lovely post blocking our view and very rarely had any animals to see. So word of advice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been talking to Disney via the phone and they give you specifics about room and location, you might want to take it with a grain of salt OR confirm it a week before you check-in. Be sure and get ALL names. We told the customer service lady this and she actually told us to complain. Meh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6just one bump in the road. We really wanted a nice vacation, so we made the best of it. Besides, we got to see a darling Eland just about every time we looked out our sliding door. The decorations for the rooms are quite impressive. Keeping with the theme, you will see animals in nearly everything in your room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6from the Lion King animals in the curtains (behind the drapes) to the hidden Mickeys you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see throughout the resort in the carpets, comforters and shower curtains. The wallpaper in the bathroom is very neat. Dual sinks perfect for just the two of us. There are shower and bath combos. Always plenty of towels (housekeeping here is wonderful). A nice ceiling fan you can turn on and off with the flip of a switch. BIG TV! Just the attention to details is phenomenal. It made for a very memorable stay. We had the two queen bed setup and unfortunately we had horrible sleep while staying here. I know, I know\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6more complaining.

I actually had to take sleep medicine nearly every night to make myself fall asleep. This part actually made the stay not pleasant, but we really tried to make the best of it. If you are able to fall asleep on just about anything, then you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem. I agree with what others say when they mention that the rooms were small. It was absolutely perfect for just the two of us, but with a family of four or more\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I can imagine it getting downright cramped! As for the sheets, if we ever decide to stay on Disney property again, we may decide to bring our own. And a bit of advice for parents with small children\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you might want to put in a request about NOT being next to newlyweds. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m quite sure we were next to some \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they were consummating their marriage nearly EVERY night and were quite loud about it too. Yeah\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6thin walls I guess. But it IS a hotel! No biggie, but I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d throw that out there. Even though we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see many animals from our room, they do provide a list of what you can find and even a place to mark off what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. They also add identification pointers and behavior tips too. Very cool. We even had the pleasure of talking to several cast members while roaming out in the Arusha Rock Savannah Overlook. We learned a lot about Elands and cows. Another nice touch is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd you will receive each time you come through the security check. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very pleasant to receive after a long day of playing at the parks. People who are driving will get to experience this. You might not get to if you are taking the bus. If you ARE driving, you will get free parking at all the parks. Parking now is $12 for cars. OUCH! There is LOTS of parking for the Animal Kingdom Lodge and some people complain that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too far from the main door. But there are LOTS of rooms for this enormous resort, so you need someplace for these folks to park! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Disney, you will be walking almost the whole time anyways. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all part of the experience. If you just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand the walk, they have valet parking available. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always somebody at the front waiting to help you out. The Animal Kingdom Lodge definitely has an impressive staff THAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S for sure. We were very impressed with everybody that we talked to there. We ate at two of the restaurants at the hotel (see my other reviews for these). We had breakfast at both Boma and The Mara. If I could have Boma for breakfast every day for the rest of my life\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I would die a happy person. It is a buffet full service restaurant and they are always preparing food to make sure the bowls are FILLED. The Mara is your usual quick service\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6waffles and eggs type\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which was good. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience either of these for lunch or dinner, but Boma always seemed busy. We always heard lots of drums playing down there in the PM. Such a wondrous experience for those dining I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure. We only nosed around the resort for a little bit during our stay, but what we saw was really nice. They have a very big spacious swimming pool which always had lots of people in it when we walked by. Life guards were on duty. The Mara is located right next to the pool as was Pumba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fun and Games Arcade. I was able to mail a bill in the room located just to the right of the Lobby Concierge. You can also find internet and payphone access in the same room. They also have a gift shop located just beside the main doors. Here you will find souvenirs that you can only get at The Animal Kingdom Lodge and then there are the usual goodies you can get throughout the parks. Also there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convenience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section in case you forgot to bring something\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6bathroom stuff, etc. Overall, I would highly recommend staying at this resort! There were so many more good things that we experienced than bad. I saw so many smiles on children and adults alike that it was just contagious. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a happy place and something that you just have to experience for yourself. If you are staying here in the future\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6be prepared to be amazed.

Rooms are the same, great theming albeit rather dark and at times the lighting is just not sufficient. Very nice main pool with lavish foliage and waterslide. BUT... AKL is SO large and spread out that you can literally get lost in it. It has a strange layout...the lucky ones were close to the lobby, we were not so lucky. There are also some extremely LONG hallways which lead to some rooms that make you feel quite isolated. If you like to feel as though you're part of the action, you won't if you're at the end of the hall...it feels as though you're off in no-man's land. When we saw the standard room we were given, with it's not-too-thrilling view of the parking area, we politely asked to switch rooms. NOTHING else available--in the entire, enormous resort--unless of course we wanted to pay more. And it was expressed quite rudely, too. This is the first time I've ever experienced such a lack of helpfulness, accommodation or understanding; usually Disney tries to make their guests happy but by the unfriendly staff's demeanor, I could tell they were not about to go even an extra millimeter or do anything remotely accommodating to help us out. Our only options were to pay $15 more for a pool view, or $75 more for a Savannah view. Figuring that this would give us a rare opportunity to see animals up close, we opted to pay the $75 extra and go with the Savannah view--after all it IS the AK Lodge, seeing animals is what it's all about, right? This is where the extremely long walk to our room came in...we found ourselves having to be escorted (the attendant said he didn't want us to get lost, since the route from the lobby to the rooms is \"very confusing\"--no kidding) down hall after hall, finally to nearly the last room on what seemed to be an endless and empty hallway. Frankly, it bothered us to be so isolated and removed, but we tried to focus on the positive and were eager to see the view, which the front desk called \"one of the best savannah views.\" Wow, what a disappointment. Yes, there were animals, although very far away--but I didn't have any illusions that they'd be right outside our balcony all day long. But in this supposedly great Savannah view room on the edge of the resort, we also got to see the high chain-link fencing, the large gate where the vehicles enter and exit, some sort of utility building, associated machinery/equipment, etc, and a striking lack of natural beauty--no grass, few bushes, trees were well off into the distance...mainly just dusty desolate acreage. And it seemed like the animals were rather avoiding this area too; I don't blame them, it really was a rather depressing sight. I loathed dragging my family around to switch rooms yet again, but common sense prevailed to say \"why are we paying $75 more for THIS?\" So, I went to the lobby while my family waited and switched rooms again...for a pool view. Most pool view rooms are partially or fully obstructed by some sort of foliage which, while lovely, natural, fits in with the theme etc., really does need to be trimmed or managed so that those who want a pool view are actually getting one. But at least when we were above the pool we could again hear music and activity, see other people and hear happy voices in the air, like we were actually at a Disney resort. We learned that we don't like to feel that isolated. Some people might...it just wasn't what we wanted. Also note: these rooms are noticeably smaller than nearly all other deluxe resorts--hence the lower price. The bus situation is pitiful--a real knock when you have sleepy children who need to get back to their room. The distance from nearly ALL the parks was quite a disadvantage at AKL. This resort made up my mind that I'll never stay this far from the parks again. WDW being about 48 square miles, it's an arduous journey back at the end of the night--even IF you're lucky enough to catch the first bus...don't be surprised if you have to wait for the next one. And there's no such thing as a quick afternoon break to use the pool at your resort--AKL's just too far away to make any midday break practical unless you really cut into your day. If you absolutely love animals you'll love this resort. But for us it was a bit different, perhaps in part because the expectation is built up so high with regard to the animal viewing, theming etc., that after a couple minutes we were already thinking: \"Okay, it's a giraffe...it's lovely...and pretty much looks exactly like the one we just saw at the Animal Kingdom. Very nice. Not thrilling, but nice...\" It is pleasant to see them out of your hotel window; for some guests, this may make all the difference. However, I found a lot more enjoyment seeing the animals from the observation deck at the end of the hall (in lush surroundings that look a lot more pleasant for the animals, since it was the INTERIOR courtyard) than from that savannah view room--the cost difference didn't seem worth it AT ALL--or by simply going to the Animal Kingdom itself. The distance and location of AKL simply overshadowed our enjoyment of this resort such that we're unlikely to return. We're glad we tried it, but see no compelling reason to ever go back.", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cFab hotel\u201d", "Author": "Chazanddi", "ReviewID": "UR36013650", "Content": "Better late than never review .

Check in went very quickly and smoothly - arrived at 3pm after just over an hours drive from Sanford International. Only slight down side was that it was difficult to understand the check-in clerks accent even though his disney badge said he was from London! However he was very informative and went over all of the hotel amienities and recommended booking for Jiko and Boma - we had done this from home already! After explaining on the map how to get to our room we made our way there. Our room (2484) was on the second floor although from the lobby this is actually down one level. The lobby is actually on level 3! After 5 minutes the luggage arrived and we were very pleased by what we saw. I was staying with my mum so had 2 queen size beds. The room was not at all dark and although we had a standard room we saw giraffes nearly every day from our balcony - bonus! Overall I can't fault the room or location. We ate at Boma during our stay - fantastic - one of the best meals we had at Disney. We had booked - via the american disney internet site - and I would thouroughly recommed doing this. The restaurant was VERY busy. We stood in queues for up to 10 minutes at a time to pick our food from the buffet. It was worth it though. Try the Zebra Domes - pudding - they are delicious. We also ate alot at The Mara - the quick service restaurant - serving burgers, chicken nuggets , pizzas and soups. A quick and simple way to grab something to eat between trips to the parks. Buy a refillable mug - about $13 - you can refill it with soft drinks, tea, coffee and hot chocolate as many times as you want for your entire stay! $13 for a 2 week stay was well worth it. The disney bus service to the parks was excellent. The longest we stood at the hotel or a park waiting for a bus was 15 minutes - and that was on the 4th of July at the Magic Kingdom after the fireworks! If you arrive at the hotel bus stop and see your bus leaving wave at it - more often than not the bus driver will stop for you! A word of warning. The Animal Kingdom Lodge now has 2 bus stops - Kidani Village and Jambo House. The first stop on the way back from the parks is usually Kidani Village (Disney Vacation Club Members) do not get off here! We and several other people we spoke to made this mistake. The two parts of the hotel are Not joined and it is a good 15 minute walk in the blistering heat back to Jambo House - the original Hotel!

There were plenty of animals roaming around, and the night goggles viewing is an experience you should try. I don't know why people complain sometimes about the bus service, and the lodge being a little further away from some of the parks. It's a bad rap because I didn't wait for a bus for more than 15-20 minutes the entire week I was there. The longest ride I had was only 20 minutes to Magic Kingdom. The food at Boma's was very good, both the breakfast & dinner buffets. A nice place to finish the night is at Victoria Falls, the hotel bar right above Boma's. It's small but friendly, and the bartenders are really nice and make great mixed drinks, try the rum runners or mudslides. The pool is also nice and roomy.

The rooms are a bit small but other than that I have nothing bad to say. Our savana view was great. It brought tears to my husband's eyes. He is such a softy. We were there for nine days and the only bad experience was one of the cast members in guest services had a little attitude. Room service every morning and never had to wait over 30 minutes. I recommend room service for breakfast as the only other choice is the buffet and it is 16.99 per adult. You can get full breakfast for less than that thru room service. Recommend 1 order of the Continental Breakfast for two adults. It includes large pot of coffee and a basket full of pastries and juice. This is only $11.99. It is the best deal on the menu. The pool was very nice and you also have privledges at Kidani Village which is less than a 10 minute walk from the Jambo House. Kidani Village is the new area of the AK lodge that was built for the Vacation Club members. Pool is very, very nice and great area for children. The housekeeping staff was amazing. They cleaned our room every day. When I say \"cleaned\" I mean vacuum, scrub shower and sinks, and so on. More than just making the beds. I also recommend that you get a car if you are staying at the AK lodge. (Great self parking area/very close to lobby entrance). It is on the very edge of Disney property and you can be in the city in less than 5 minutes. This opens up your options for eating and sight seeing. We took an air boat ride on Lake Toho.

The lodge and it amenities are wonderful! We truly felt like we were transported away from it all at this location. We rented points from a DVC member for a suite and paid approximately $145 a night for our accommodations. As great as this place is, I'm not sure I would spend around approximately the $250 - $350 rate the resort would charge for similar accommodations. There were some minor negatives as related below (Check In & Check Out). Check In - It took us a while to check in. The person who checked us in gave the typical Disney speech \"Welcome home, . . .\" however she said it in a montone without smiling and we felt as if we were bothering her. My husband and I noticed that the girl at the next check out stand had the same monologe but was animated and smiling. She went out of her way to give restaurant recommendations and make sure sure the guests knew special events happening that day. Our person did no such thing. She bascially handed us our packet and told us how much we owed for the Disney Dining Plan. We had checked in advance to make sure we could pay for the Dining Plan with gift cards and were informed it would not be a problem. Well, it was. Our attendant didn't know how to process the cards and then told us that people usually don't pay that way. She got some assistance and put them through. Unfortunately $200 worth wouldn't go through. She said we had probably used them in the parks and said we could pay the rest with a credit card. When we told her no such thing had happened and asked if she could try manually importing the number or calling she again restated that we had probably used the cards. We were told that we could take the cards back and get the credit later. We knew we hadn't used the cards and getting a Disney credit later wouldn't really be helpful as we would have left the area. The clerk finally agreed to keep the cards and try them later through a computer link. Everything did finally work out and the clerk left a message on our room's phone to apologize for the problem . Later someone told us that they always have difficulties with gift cards because the cards get demagnetized and people shouldn't use them. If this is the case, then they should have told us this when we first inquired. The clerk told us we would be called later to let us know when the room was available. This never happened, so once again we had to wait in the check-in lane to get our room assignment. The clerk who helped us this time was very friendly and helpful. Lobby & Room - The lobby of this hotel is beautiful. It might seem a little dark during the daytime, however, it's real beauty shines through at night when it is lit in a soft glow. Our room was clean and had a microwave, toaster, refrigerator, coffee maker, and paper goods for eating. Ample towels were provided for our stay. The room was average in size when compared to other hotels, however, it's the detail given to decorating and bedding that make it exceptional. Disney is great with the details at their resorts! Savannah Views - Not all Savannah view rooms are the same. I'n not sure of it's name, but I would recommend the rooms on the back end of Jambo house. We had a room facing the \"feeding area\" of a savannah but did not see many animals, instead we saw more people performing maintenance. However, it was a thrill to my children to walk out and see the animals from the back of the resort. The people stationed there were always helpful and tried to answer any questions we had. Ammenities - There are so many activities and amenities at this resort! The kids loved the night goggle vision, crayon rubbing, and pool. You could easily spend several days just at the resort and never touch the parks. Dining - Bomas was our favorite restaurant from all of the places we ate. The servers were friendly and all of their recommendations were excellent choices. My children loved the food at this restaurant, howvever it's not your typical fare. If you have picky eaters or like traditional American food then this restaurant may not be for you. We also dined at their quick service counter and found the food here to be good too. The quick service has menu items that appeall to young children (pizza, chicken nuggets) as well as adults. You can visit a website (I think its www. allears.net) to pull up the menus and pricing at various Disney restaurants. This might be helpful in finding restaurants that will appeal to the people in your group. Transportation - Can't comment as we used our car to get around. When you stay at a Disney resort you also get free parking at the theme parks. It did appear that the shuttle came around every 20-30 minutes. Check Out/Bell Service - At the end of our stay we asked for bell service to take our luggage and souvenirs to the car. After waiting almost 30 minutes we called again to see how long it would be. They said they didn't have our name on the list and it would be another 20 minutes. At this point we said to just forget it and we would do it ourself and asked if we could come get a luggage cart. We were told no, carts are only for bell service. However, this time the girl at bell service would be there within 5 minutes. The gentleman who showed up was very helpful and apologized for the wait. It turned out he orginally lived 30 minutes away from us and we had a nice discussion as he got the luggage to the car.

Arrival - Typical Disney style. Hopped on a bus at the airport and was driven to the resort. About an hour drive in a comfortable air-conditioned bus. Check-in - Went very fast. From the time we entered the resort to the time we were in our room was only about 30 minutes and that was only because we had lots of questions that got answered while checking in. Room - Very clean and again was typical Disney but not cheesy. The room had subtle hints of Disney all around but some of it blended in very well to where you almost didn't notice it. We had 2 queen beds that were very comfortable. Either that or we were just to tired at the end of the day to notice. The bathroom was divided with the sink and mirrors outside of the bath/shower and toilet part. The best part for me was the balcony watching the animals. Pool - I'm not a pool person so I didn't spend any time in it but it looked very nice and a lot of people seemed to enjoy it. There were tons of chairs to lounge in and a bar next to it. (not a swim up bar though) Food - We ate at the buffet restaurant most nights and it was very good, but the variety didn't change much. Luckily there were lots of choices. (try the amarula ball desert - incredible!) The small cafeteria area by the pool was good and served stuff like pizza, french fries, chicken sticks. My recommendation would be to purchase the meal and quick meal options before you go. You can save a lot in the long run, especially in the parks. Activities - Lots to choose from! We were out late most nights at the theme parks but the ones we participated in were the nightvision animal viewing and story telling by the firepit. Kind of cheesy but fun and family safe. Animals - Best part of the lodge for me! I was very disappointed the first night we got in cause I sat out and waited to see some of the animals and didn't see a single one. But the next day and all the days after we always had Giraffes, Greater Kuku's, and Ankole Cattle outside our balcony with an occasional visit from other animals. The zebras tended to stay in the middle part of the resort and the impalas and nyalas stayed on the pool side, but all were visible from different spots at the resort. The animals seemed to be well taken care of and the grounds keepers did a fantastic job at \"picking up after them\". Complaints - I'm going to have to pick a little here just to find something to gripe about. Prices were high in the gift shop, but what else can you expect from Disney. The only person we had a problem with was the lady at the Disney Cruise booth. We were trying to change our cruise information and she wouldn't help us and told us to contact their phone number. (minor detail) And the family staying next to us had a very \"excited\" young boy that was very loud. There were other minor little details here and there but nothing to write about.

It is an artistic rendering of Africa, clearly not meant to be Africa, with the exception of the Savannah, but the salute is lovely. The art work is all authentic and a pleasure to behold. It was fun to talk with the employees from Africa who were all very friendly and open to our questions about their homeland and culture. On this visit we had four adults, three children 9,7 and 4 and two teenagers 15 and 13 in our group. CHECK IN: We were immediately greeted by valet and bell services upon arrival. Our items were put in storage until our room was ready. I utilized their new online check in and was able to go to a special queue upon arrival but since the lobby was empty it didn't make much of a difference to my check-in. I still had to go through the routine of verifying my address, etc so I didn't see much point. The only thing different was that they already had my credit card number. I was able to add my dining plan at the check in desk but I had to go to concierge to add my park passes. I don't recall ever having to do that before. I wish we could do that in the online check in process, now that would make a difference! Our room was also not ready until after 5 p.m. which was rather inconvenient as it made us late for our dinner reservations because we wanted to freshen up (We ended up missing the dinner entirely, read below) THE HOTEL : The Jambo House lobby is far more impressive than the small but beautiful Kidani Village lobby. Following a theme which are true to their roots, Jambo is more akin to a large ceremonial house and Kidani is more like a home or small village. They each exhibit traditional African architectural styles. Kidani still looks a bit barren at the moment, but that is because the Village has only just opened and the plants have not had a chance to really take root and flourish whereas on the Jambo side, well, we often commented that we felt like we were really in a jungle. What an experience to walk out on to our balcony at any time, day or night and see magnificent giraffes, zebras, pelicans, cranes, wildebeests, ostriches, emus, flamingos, well lets just say there were plenty of animals to watch. The Savannah has feeding stations set near the rooms so the animals will definitely stop by, but even when they weren't eating they had no problem hanging out near the people, screaming kids, whistling grown-ups, whatever the humans were doing didn't seem to make them run off. We even had the chance to watch them weather a severe lightning and rain storm at 2 a.m.. They just stood there nonchalantly chewing, I was a wreck. Turns out there were almost 19,000 lightning strikes during the storm (thanks Doppler radar, some things I don't actually need to know LOL). The point is it was interesting to learn that their reaction was not what I had expected. THE ROOMS: We are DVC members and rented a studio and a two bedroom suite in the Jambo House. I cannot imagine paying the 'asking' price of nearly $13,000 for the seven nights we had these accommodations but I guess someone does. The rooms were a few doors away from each other. Both were Savannah View rentals. Rooms without a Savannah view looked over gardens, the pool, or had a distant view of the parking lot. Everyone has access to the Savannah in the halls and the lobby. Guests not staying at the resort are not permitted to use this resort's pools or attend it's activities. They may dine at it's restaurants. Having said that, I'm not sure how they would know you weren't a guest as they don't police it like they do at the Yacht and Beach Club. The studio room and two bedroom suite are nicely decorated, as expected, better than the average hotel, with cute Lion King carvings, tile decor and not so hidden Mickey's on the bed, carpet, shower curtain and even the furniture. They studio is of average size for a hotel room, and the two bedroom was a studio attached to a one bedroom suite. ** TIP: I would check with members of your party to see if anyone has an issue with sleeping on a sofa bed. Big teens may not find it any more comfortable than an adult would. My 13 year old son is taller than I am and found it uncomfortable. Our 15 year old slightly built daughter ended up sleeping there and said it was OK but was glad she only weighs 100 because the mattress was thin. I am 5'6\" and weigh 200lbs and found it uncomfortable. ** The regular beds were VERY comfortable and all the pillows and sheets felt luscious and soft and were pleasingly white. The blankets were nice, but we had to remove the comforter because it felt so heavy on our tired feet! We had everything we needed in the kitchen except dishwasher soap which was supplied to us for free when we tried to buy some in the store. **TIP: I suggest you seriously think about your needs before arriving and shop at the local Publix or Winn Dixie. The on site store is very expensive. Water in the park is $2.50 a bottle. We buy a few cases freeze them the night before and drink them as they melt while in the park. We had two a piece this trip but it was convenient because we had a stroller, normally we only carry one a piece. Yes there are water fountains in the park-but FL water is a bit unpleasant to the palette and Disney does not make any effort to keep the fountains cold. ** I really liked the square plates and animal print on the coffee cups. Yes I'm a nerd. My only real difficulty was with the lighting in the bathroom. The interior lighting of the resort and rooms is rather dim. The resort is dedicated to energy conservation and uses fluorescent bulbs, and I think in view of the African theme maybe we were supposed to be in \"fire light\", and maybe they needed it dim on the balconies (because there was no light at all) to minimize disturbing the animals, but the light in the bathroom made it impossible to apply make up without holding a mirror. I think this problem could be fixed by attaching a make-up mirror on an expendable arm to the wall that either lights up itself or reaches the light illuminating the sink. I assume though that older guests or guests with partial blindness may find this 'feature' rather difficult to deal with. WHAT TO DO: There is a huge list of activities to attend at this resort. If you can it is worth it to build a day into your schedule to spend at the resort attending these activities. Almost all of them are free. They are like participating in a National Geographic show. The little ones in our group loved it. Our teenagers, not so much, but they happen to be avid readers so they knew a lot of the info offered. For casual observers not interested in 'signing up' for an activity there is night viewing of the animals with night vision binoculars, story telling by a fire, and lots of employees on hand to tell you whatever you wanted to know about the animals on the Savannah. The Jambo Pool and slide are lovely with beautiful plants shading many areas from the harsh sun. We never had any trouble getting a lounge chair. The flamingos which hang out in their own area are a must see. The new Kidani pool was a blast, in particular the \"Uwanja Camp\" kid's area which feature water falls, spray guns, rope bridges and a mini slide for the kids to play in. We had a blast squirting each other 'defending' the fort. Yes the teens got into this activity with the little ones. Smiles all around. DINING: On our first night we had 5:15 reservations for Sanaa, Kidani's table service restaurant. Unfortunately after making sure we got on the correct bus (DownTown Disney) we were taken to DownTown Disney (DTD) instead of the Kidani Village which was supposed to be the next stop before heading to DTD. The bus driver admitted he had gone to Kidani first instead of Jambo. We ended up not being able to eat for another 2 1/2 hours which was not an impressive way to start our first night of vacation. We ate at the counter service Mara's three nights. The veggie pizza, African stew, fallafel, chicken pita and bacon double cheeseburger were all very good. The employees were all very nice as well. In the past we have eaten at Boma's, a buffet with African and American food. It is always booked and always loud. The atmosphere, food and service are very good, definitely a family friendly restaurant and worth the table service coupon on the dining plan. When we missed eating at Sanaa we decided to give up a reservation at EPCOT and use two table service vouchers at Jikos instead. We felt guilty about bringing three little kids to this fine dining establishment but were immediately made comfortable when they put us in a room with other kids separate from the adult diners. Our waiter was quick and efficient, friendly and very knowledgeable about the wine. We were very happy with his advice and enjoyed what we were served. The food was absolutely delicious, in particular the ostrich appetizer, lamb, scallop and steak entrees and the pistachio brulee dessert. I have stayed at almost all of Disney's Resorts, the Animal Kingdom Lodge is a jewel in Disney's crown. I never expect everything to go absolutely perfect, so the few inconveniences (late room, bus driver who went to the wrong location) we experienced did not mar this lovely resort's reputation for me. Besides, as soon a I spoke with anyone about these problems we were apologized to and given a perk (Fast Passes, I know they're free, but we could use them anywhere, didn't have to rush to get them so they were much appreciated). I think given their volume of guests Disney does a fantastic job and handles glitches well. I have never actually spent $8000 on a room for a week so I don't know how to compare it's value with another $8000 resort, but I definitely felt I got my \"points\" worth from my DVC membership.

We didn't try the two main restaurants as my son is very picky & probably wouldn't have liked the African food served there - but we went to the Mara daily and it was better than average for what they had available (and we NEVER waited in long lines). The bus rides were not that long even to the Magic Kingdom - only approximately 17 minutes. My biggest complaint - the extremely rude - other tourists.

One of the biggest complaints about the buses is how long it takes to get anywhere. I will say it is not the closest hotel to the Magic Kingdom but what others fail to mention is that because the hotel is somewhat secluded, you don't have to share the bus with other hotels. The AKL buses only make one stop. Your destination. After a long day and tired kids, how would you like to make two stops at other hotels before getting to yours? By the way, did I mention the buses are FREE? Honestly folks, the bus system for the AKL is beyond excellent for the price. The only other knock on the hotel would be the room size for the price.

We had booked a Savanah room and the kids were absolutly amazed when we got into our room and looked over the balcony to Giraffes, Bongos and other such creatures. The room was a reasonable size, but not massive. However once we had emptied cases etc into the wardrobes and chest of draws there was enough room for the children to run up and down in. The hotel itself was decorated as you would expect from an African themed hotel. The staff were helpful and polite all the time, the room was cleaned everyday. The pool was excellent and there was always somewhere to leave your towels etc. The children spent most of the time on the water slide but there was plenty of room within the pool for swimming in. There was lots going on in and around the hotel, to much for us to take in even in 13 days and we did not find the kiddies park until a couple of days before the end of our holiday. We only ate in the main resturant once and found plenty to choose from. All in all probably the best hotel we have stayed in in our 4 visits to Orlando, Disney is for some once in a life time holiday and if you can stretch the budget this far its worth every penny just for the reaction on the childrens faces when they see the animals.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "derbyshire england", "Title": "\u201cfantastic\u201d", "Author": "memphiswheels", "ReviewID": "UR31283862", "Content": "Amazing having read some reviews some people must be hard to please or just unlucky we went for our 10th wedding anniversary and we were not dissapointed although not in dearer savanahh room we had a view over a waterhole at the end of Sunset.

The architecture of the hotel is amazing and there is so much to look at including displays of African artwork that it would take another two days to look at all this. the Lobby is well thought out and beutiful with plenty of seating, the bar and restraunt areas fantastic apart from the fast food area Mara which could do with a little TLC.

For the more interested there is a program for adults based on wildlife and the Wanyama Safari Game drive and dinner (extra cost) although expensive is fantastic. the observation points for animal wathcing are great our room was clean and tidy and well cared for, bad points If all you want is Mickey mouse and the theme parks go somewhere cheaper as the charm of this hotel can be found in enjoying the building, the animals and the pool area (stop and smell the roses) For some people we spoke to15 minutes on a coach to Magic kindom This was the furthest away)was to far (but Hey Did you see the wildebeast from your bedroom window) and is'nt holiday about relaxing The only uncleanliness we saw in 2 weeks was that it seemed to take a while for room service items to be removed from hallways Our room although beutiful and well kitted out (best wheel in shower i ever used) was a little small for a manual wheelchair and would be no good for a larger powered chair The food is fantastic but if you do not like spicy or are not adventurous then your choice could be limited the lighting systems in the bedrooms could be better as the initial light inside our door took ages to come brighter The themed music can get annoying especially when animal watching would you really have pounding drums out on a safari?

My girls (9 &14) have been begging to stay here for a few years. This year our travel party included myself, my 2 girls, my friend with her 2 kids (9 yr old son& 14 yr old daughter). We stayed for 7 nights, 4th floor, savannah view. I simply cannot tell you the feeling of waking up every morning and sitting on the little balcony and drinking my coffee in the peace and quiet with a giraffe or two, ot a sebra or 2 or 3. If you are an animal lover, this is the absolute perfect place for you. There are so many places to view and watch the animals, the overlooks, the quiet places with rocking chairs, the night vision spot, and many more. My 9 year old simply loved the kids activities and actually preferred that to swimming! The swimming pool is very cool itself as well. It's designed to look like a \"watering hole\" so it's zero entry & just fun. While there my kids made bead neckklaces, t-shirts, windchimes, and did the animal tracking. I was able to enjoy the poolside and indoor bar for some tasty cocktails. Boma and Jiko the 2 onsite restraunts, are just awesome. Jiko is probably now my very favorite place to eat in all of Disney and Boma has the best breakfast buffet I've ever had. The staff was wonderful and friendly. I don't think I walked past a staff member ever who didn't greet me or tell me to have a nice day. If it seems that I am completely in love with this resort, that's because it's true.

We ate breakfast at Boma every morning, like our last holiday, didn't have reservations for any morning but never waited more than 15 minutes. The staff at Boma are very pleasant and the food exceptional and very good value for money. My only comment regarding Boma is that their evening buffet does not have enough choice for children. The bedrooms at the lodge are very nicely appointed and quiet, however, are a bit dim in the evening, but this in a way does add to the ambience of the place. My comment regarding the rooms is that they do need to have way more storage space for clothing. Room service was always delivered quickly. Transportation to the parks is by bus and they are very frequent and we never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus. I spoke to quite a lot of people at the Lodge who had stayed at other resorts at Disney and they said that Animal Kingdom Lodge was by far the best. I would say that meals at Boma are very good value and the food is plentiful and cooked to a high standard, the Mara food is not to my taste and Jiko is gorgeous.

I can't imagine staying at another property. We had a great view of animals 24 hours a day, the pool is amazing, and the lobby is beautiful. The one thing I would recommend when staying at Disney is renting a car. It saves so much time instead of waiting for buses. This is my first trip driving in which I drove to all the theme parks instead of using Disney transportation. The AKL buses now have to stop at the new vacation club first. I got so used to being the only hotel stop on the buses. Many of the other properties usually share their buses with another hotel or have other stops on the way (ex: Blizzard Beach). Someone had mentioned that staying at a monorail resort would eliminate this wait. Well, it will elminate the wait to the Magic Kingdom, but not to other theme parks, where you will have to stand in line like the other properties. Also, when taking a bus to any theme park, there will always be a walk to the theme park entrance. You can't have buses dropping off people in middle of a crowd trying to enter the park. So, be expected to wait for buses and walk to entrances no matter what property you are staying at. If you plan on eating at any of the Disney dining, definately make reservations far in advance, especially for Boma. Everyone in the staff was very friendly. If you want to know more about the animals, make sure to visit the night vision viewing area. The animal staff was amazing and told us great stories of the animals.

All I can say is \"how amazingly cool\" to sit on your (smallish) deck looking out at Zebras and Giraffes, among other animals. The kids couldn't get enough. In another review someone talks about the animals being caged up at night. I am not sure what they're talking about because I saw them every time I looked out. There are some berms constructed, I presume to allow the animals some down-time... maybe some of them were asleep back there for that person. But I can promise you that I saw no less than 6 exotic animals each time I looked out. The staff there is over-the-top wonderful. No one does customer service better than Disney. We didn't have dining reservations when we arrived and the Concierge worked very hard to get us some great reservations... he was 50/50 successful, but that's certainly more than what I would have expected in a busy weekend. There are several places to eat. The two best restaurants are incredibly great. Jiko is the nicest tableside service restaurant there. I'd say my meal quality was comparable to the top 20% of restaurants. The wine list focuses on Africa, mostly South Africa. I'm comfortable with \"traditional\" fine dining wine lists but am completely unfamiliar with South African wines. The waiter was rather knowledgeable regarding the wines and we had a very pleasant discussion about our likes and dislikes in various, more familiar, wines and he brought us a mid-range bottle that fit our tastes to a T. There are plenty of kids there and it's one of the first times I've felt comfortable having a great meal with my kids eating plain kid food. Boma is a buffet. In my mind, buffet = bland food, overcooked, and people confusing quantity with quality. Oh, how wrong was I. Absolutely delicious! The food had a variety of flavor and spices like I've never seen in a buffet. The quality of the food was top notch. There were several selections of meats, vegetables, breads, salads, and soups, and desserts. The wine list is similar (identical?) to Jiko. The service was excellent. It was a little pricey, but totally worth it for breakfast and dinner. The only 2 complaints/cautions I have are this: 1) They recently opened up the Kidanni lodge and bus service to/from the various parks stops there first. The signage and announcements aren't up to snuff yet. Hopefully WDW addresses this soon. 2) Some of the hallways are exceptionally long. We were in one of the end rooms, which was great because you were able to see 2 different savannas (and 2 different sets of animals). But if you have difficulty walking distances, then you might want to request a room close to the front desk. Yes, the rooms are a little small-ish given what you pay, but they are comparably sized to the Polynesian for the same level of room.", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples", "Title": "\u201cSpoiled our \"Fun Weekend Getaway\"\u201d", "Author": "TravelingAnnNaples", "ReviewID": "UR30292669", "Content": "My husband and I travel frequently and we choose to pay for the comfort and amenities of a 4 to 5 star resort.

The room was so small that we kept bumping in to the sharp wooden corners of the beds several times and I suffered huge bruises on my legs. The room was dirty and we discovered cleaned drinking glass, had someone's cigarette ashes stuck to the bottom of it. Apparently it was used as an ashtray. The worst disappointment was that we were unable to have dinner on the first evening or any other evening at the Boma restaurant. We settled in our room by 5:30 PM and called down to Boma, but all we got is a recording that they are not taking reservations. At 6:00 PM we went down to Boma and when I said to the Host - \"Two for Dinner\", he asked if I had reservations and I said \"No, I couldn't get through but I'd like to make reservation for this evening\" he replied with a very sarcastic smile and said, \"Nope, we're not taking reservations and you're not eating here tonight\". We were surprised with his attitude. Apparently the resort is so busy that customer courtesy goes out the window. We were too mad to order room service.

There are two resorts at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. The only thing about it that I did not like is that you have to take a bus to get to the parks because it is the farthest away from them. It took about 20 to 25 minutes on the bus to get to Magic Kingdom. The bus does not drop you off near the park entrance so you have to be prepared to walk a lot to get to the main entrance. We will be going again soon but I would recommend staying at a resort that has the monorail so that you don't have to do as much walking before you get in the parks. We spent most of our time traveling by Disney bus to get to our destinations which sucked up most of our fun time in the parks. Another thing that will save time if you have small kids.....bring your own stroller. When you get off the bus if you don't have a stroller you will have to carry your child to the main entrance of the park so that you can rent a stroller. Also you must park your stroller at designated areas in the park or the park staff will take them. There is no stroller parking areas near all the rides so most of the time you are dropping off your child with family and one parent is searching for a stroller parking area. To me they should have a stroller parking area near every ride. So my opinion is that the Animal Kingdom Lodge is nice but not close enough to the parks. We were so tired of waiting in lines for buses and then walking so far from the bus drop off areas to the main entrance of the parks. Stay at a resort that has monorail access. It is more money but very much worth it. Also, purchase the Deluxe Dining Plan. You can make reservations ahead of time to eat at all the popular Disney resteraunts.

I called housekeeping, and the housekeeping manager did call to apologize...and assured me that there wouldn't be any more issues...but we waited another 25minutes (now 11pm) for a sheet change.

We absolutely enjoyed the hotel. Because we were club level we had a savanna view room on the fourth floor. Everyone was very friendly. I would have given the service a very good if our housekeeper had not been so stingy with shampoo and lotion. I had to request more twice. Other than that annoyance the service was very good. We had a long walk from the lobby to our room but we had a good location on the savanna and were close to the pool and restaurants. The hotel is gorgeous. There is so much detail involved in the hotel design. I enjoyed just walking around looking at the art and fixtures. Words really cannot capture how beautiful it is. We took advantage of many of the hotel's activities - especially the \"bead\" activities geared toward kids. They offer a lesson about flamingos and pelicans, animal tracking, and habitats and one with various mucial instruments. Our daughter liked doing them and getting a bead at the completion of them. She enjoyed getting her face painted with an African design and of course seeing all the animals. Besides taking advantage of the activities we dined at all three restaurants at the hotel, used the pool and its slide, played in the arcade, shopped in the gift shop, went to the club level lounge daily and had our child go to Simba's Clubhouse (the kid center) one evening while we dined. We also used both resort buses and drove. The room was well-appointed. Very pretty but not huge. It was fine for us because we have one child and we not in the room a lot but if you have 2 kids esp teen-aged it could feel a bit tight. The room had teh 2 queen beds, table and 2 chairs, dresser with large flat screen TV, closet, ipod dock, safe, small frig, coffee pot, double sinks and of course the balcony. We rarely heard any noise except when extreme (example - baby next door screamed for a few minutes our first evening and we could hear it but not as if in the room). The beds are very high but I think they provided guard rails for kids because I saw something in the closet which looked like those. Our daughter althou just 5 did not need them. We really found the beds comfortable. In fact we tried to find out what they were. If I could change anything besides size about the room I would add another towel bar somewhere because the rack by the tub and the one outside my the sinks is not enough. I would also increase teh wattage of the lighting in the tub part of the bathroom. Just too dim. Before going I read the lighting in the room was inadequate and I disagree. The lighting in the room is fine with the exception of the tub room and the entry way light of the room. The pool was great. Don't think it is dirty when you see it. It is very clean but the bottom was painted greys and browns to resemble a watering hole in Africa and fir with the theme. Plenty of chairs and towels. The pool was cool not cold and so refreshing given the warm/hot days we had. The pool slide is not as good as the one at Disney's Coronado Springs Resort but still a good slide for the kids. The pool has a zero entry and gets no deeper than say 4.5 ft about. We liked the drinks from the pool bar esp the pina colava. The restaurants: Mara offers counter service. We mostly bought snacks, ice cream, kids pizza and burgers there. All were good and the prices were reasonabel for a resort. We ate at the buffet Boma for dinner one night. I really liked it for all the different foods they offered. My husband prefers more meat and potatos so it did not fly his kite by he found plenty to eat. The soups were really good as well as the salads. I read breakfast is wonderful but since we'd eaten so much this vacation and continentla breakfast was provided as part of the club level we decided to skip it. My DH and I also dined at Jiko. We shared the briout and filet mignon. Both were excellent. The service was wonderful and the restaurant design beautiful. Our DD went to the Simba Clubhouse that night. She had a good time and even asked to go back. We used the bus service offered to go to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. It works well and was great because no other stops - just direct to the parks. We also rode to the parks since we had a car. I prefer that method only because I hate waiting at all for buses. But the bus worked for those days we really needed it. We liked the location of AKL - did not think it seemed too far away. We visited the Grand Floridian, Contemporary and Polynesian while at WDW and were so glad we chose AKL. We also stayed at the Coronado Springs Resort for 4 nights which we very much enjoyed too. The expereince was very different but equally enjoyable. We think we made 2 great picks for our stay at WDW. AKL's Club level was super too. I rated the value as very good because we got a great deal with recent promotions. I would not have paid rack rate but having said that I cannot imagine paying rack rate for any hotel. The club level was really worth it. We stocked up on fruit and sodas as weel has had our breakfast, evening appetizers and sometimes our dessrt there. One night we skipped dinner althogether and just foraged at the lounge. The club lounge had some great fruit in the am plus cereals, breads, juices, coffee and espressos. I liked the afternoon snacks esp the cookies and spiced nuts. The 5-7p offerings were good too - both hot and cold offerings from Boma as well as cheeses, fruit, African wines, beer, sodas and an African smoothie drink. The desserts from 8-10pm were a nice touch too with several liquers provided and coffee. I loved waking up each morning and sitting out on the balconey watching the animals. We were on the Zebra trail/Arusha savanna. We had zebra, giraffe, roan antelope, ankole cattle, crested cranes, guinea fowl, blesbok, kuda and eland out our window. I enjoyed all the sounds of the night and even the guniea fowls' calls in the morning. I also spent sunset on the balconey a number of evenings too.

Rooms , not huge , but more than adequate for a holiday of this type , disney is not the sort of place where you chill in the room all day is it ? Beds very comfortable indeed.

They may not have had the main savanna view but they still got to see animals in the grassland behind them (including giraffe). so that was a real bonus. The theming is overwhelming when you firat walk through the doors. People \"welome\" you \"home\" as you walk in and the sheer size and detail of the lobby are amazing. Check in was swift and painless. First impressions of the room were very good. Some of the other deluxe hotels have bigger rooms, there is no denying that, but it was plenty big enough. The bathroom is a little small but more than acceptable and clean. A mini bar would have been good too but you can buy alcohol in the shop or Mara and put it in the fridge. It probably saved us money! We ate in all 3 restaurants. Jiko is beautiful...try the coffee rubbed beef short rib...it's divine, as were the pulled beef naans. Boma offers a fantastic biffuet for breakfast and dinner. Don't miss it. The Mara serves basic food when you are on the go, but it is fine. Room serive was prompt when delivering our dinner one eve and the choice of food is varied. The shop is fairly large and offers something for everyone including essentials if you leave anything at home. The pool area is fantastic and there are always sun longers free no matter when you use the pool area. The hot tubs are, erm, very hot! There are animal view points from all around the pool which is a lovely touch. I cannot believe people on here who have complained about the smell of the animals!!!! It's barely noticeable the majority of time and surely you wouldn't expect to smell sweet frangrances while watching a whole variety of animals! And for those people who had a 5 minute walk to their room which they consider a long way, do your homework better and maybe a 5 minute walk would do you some good! As if that's far!! If you have a disability then tell them on booking!! Common sense? The bus system was surprisingly good. Rarely waited more than 5 to 10 mins. No problems. The longest wait was about 15 minutes. Buses were rarely full unlike when I stayed at Port Orleans and the All Star resorts, even when coming back from parks. Bonus! Some people have complained that this hotel is too far removed from the other theme parks. Here's the reality check. Animal Kingom is 5 mins away. Blizzard Beach = 7 minutes. Studios = 10 mins. Epcot = 14 mins. Magic Kingom = 18 mins. Typhoon Lagoon = 18 mins. Downtown = 20 mins-25 mins (depending which part you are getting off at). I can't see how any of those journeys are too long.

For the extra cost for the Villas, I didn't want anyone being on a pull out couch so I asked to be moved to the lodge (which is just a few floors below) so we could have 2 queens (as I had requested at booking). They accommodated us and refunded the difference. I also had dropped my credit card on the floor and the concierge was very accommodating in helping me by giving me access to a computer so I could check to see that no unauthorized activity occurred. Luckily, a guest picked it up and returned it to the concierge (no harm done). I couldn't thank them enough for helping me during the time my card was lost. A few negatives. There was a fellow at the concierge desk who was not all that accommodating when I was trying to straighten out the room issue (not the same people that helped me with the credit card debacle). He lacked the friendly demeanor that all other staff had and wasn't all that helpful. The beds are comfortable but not the best. I've had more comfortable beds in the newer Hampton Inns so I was a little disappointed in this area. Also, the buses don't come all that often so give plenty of time if you have to make a dinner engagement.

The rooms, although a little small, were very clean and comforatable for a family of four (2 adults, a 10 yr old & a 4 yr old). You really aren't in the rooms that much to be concerned about space. My kids enjoyed waking up in the morning and sitting on the balcony to watch the many animals that grazed nearby. There are numerous activities at the lodge that are planned through out the day for the kids to do. Most people arent at the lodge during the day and miss them. If you plan to have a leisure day and not do the parks, check into the activities. There is a childrens' parade in the evenings where they get to play African instruments and march around the hotel. I absolutely reccomend this for the kids, just to see the smiles on their faces as they play, march, and chant along with the guide! The pool is great! The restaurants are very good, too. Definite reservations needed for dinner at Bomas, however for their breakfast, we were able to walk right up and be seated within 5 minutes. Mara is your quick service restaurant with (depending on the time of day) items like mickey waffles, eggs, burgers, african stew, pita's, chicken sandwiches, salads...all very good. The AKL staff was always very helpful, and answered any questions that we had. The buses ran every 15 minutes to the parks, and made no other stops at other resorts, which was nice. Yes, AKL is the farthest away, but after walking all day, we enjoyed the 15 minute ride!! The only thing that some may not like is that there is no *free* wi-fi access in the rooms. In order to have internet access (if you brought your laptop) was to pay $9.95 per 24 hour access. What we chose to do was pay for one 24 hour period during the middle of our trip so that we could email family and friends with some pictures.

It felt like we were in a cave. The rooms were very small. We had 1 queen and 1 set of bunk beds for 3 people. I can't imaging having 4 people in that room. We were already tripping over each other. The quick-service restaurant, The Mara, had sticky floors, dirty tables and chairs, slow service and cold, unappealing food. The full service buffet restaurant was average. Some raved hot, basic food seems like a baseline expectation vs. something with which to be impressed. Room service never answered our call, and it was during an off-peak time. Could they have been severly understaffed? The service was exceptionally poor. For example, we called the bell service to see if our bags had arrived. They said no, but when my husband went down to the lobby he found them sitting there. At one point we were misinformed by one of the staff members. When we called the error to their attention it was if they couldn't have cared less. We did appreciate seeing animals from our room - daily views of giraffes, birds, etc. We also liked the pool area. It was fairly small but had zero entry, which our daughter loved. Because this was a deluxe resort with a deluxe price, we expected deluxe service, food and amenities.

The pool was a dream, it was a busy week but I never felt the pool was too crowded because it was so big. The water slide was just right for our girls and they loved it. Every afternoon we would come back from the park just in time to do the crafts and hang out at the pool. There is also an arcade that is right next to the pool so they could play with there arcade card which they load with cash and use. We also bought the cups so the girls could get free refills on drinks from Mara which they loved. We had dinner at the Boma and really was not impressed. I think the issue was our server...he was just not interested in providing any help and you really need to understand what the food is you are getting ready to eat. He just wanted us in and out.

I really do not have any negative comments to make about the trip. We had a great time but since it was our first time, I would definitely do a few things differently next time around. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are absolutely spectacular. We opted for the Savannha-view room and the Park Hopper option with the Disney Deluxe Dining plan. The room was a bit far way from the lobby but was clean and well-stocked with towels and shampoo, etc. We honestly spent very little time in our hotel room so we didn't spend much time watching animals from our hotel room. While it was pretty cool - there are plenty of other places to view the animals from public spaces so if you are looking to save a few dollars you can certainly opt for a standard room. My parents also stayed in the Animal Kingdom with us. I had no problem with our reservations. I called Guest Services and provided both reservations numbers and requested adjoining rooms or rooms in close proximity to each other. Although the rooms were not adjoining, they were right next to each other so I have no complaints about that. I am very happy that I chose the Park Hopper option as we returned to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom multiple times during our stay - I couldn't imagine having to tell my son that we couldn't go back to a particular park to ride his favorite again. The Deluxe Dining Plan was also a good choice - we used all of our meals but did have a number of snacks left over. The Dining plan is very convenient because you've already paid for your meals and just present your Key to the World whenever you purchase a meal or snack. Only one person in your party needs to present the card as they are all linked. With respect to dining, I would definitely make all my reservations well in advance. I only made one character breakfast reservation in advance so we did have to make some concessions with respect to our restaurant options. Jiko is a Signature Dining Restaurant. Our meal was nice and they had a great selection of wines. We only had breakfast at Boma but it too was very nice. The breakfast buffet had some unusual choices but had the old standards as well so it was not difficult to find something a 5-yr old will eat. We had one meal at The Mara which was ok. It's a bit like a cafeteria so it is not a place I would choose to eat all my meals but it's fine for a snack or quick bite by the pool. Definitely plan your days and make breakfast and dinner reservations well in advance. Lunch was spent in the parks and we just grabbed a quick service meal so we could minimize our meal time and maximize our fun time. The one time we did go to the pool, it was closed for maintenance. I'm still not sure what that was all about because we really didn't get any information from the pool staff about when it would open - they would only tell us that it would open when their boss gave them the go-ahead. Just when I was about to go back to our room, they opened the pool. The resort is the farthest from all the theme parks so allow extra time to reach your destination especially if you have dinner reservations. One evening, we had made plans to have dinner at Magic Kingdom and waited at least 30 minutes for a bus at which point most of the other people on the bus were already late for their dinner reservations.

We paid for a savanna view room and we were given room 4309 which has a great view of the main savanna. We did book a room with a queen bed and bunk beds but were given a room with two queen beds. It wasn't a huge deal but we also had to call and remind the front desk that we had requested bed rails and a pack and play also. As it turns out, most rooms have a pack and play in the closet but they sent someone quickly to install the requested bed rails. Our room was on the fourth floor; the lobby and hotel entrance are on the third floor so we had to walk a little ways and then take an elevator up to our floor and walk a little more. I would recommend requesting a third floor room - no elevator ride required and a great height for viewing the animals (if you get the savanna view room.) The room was small but I think it's b/c they give you a balcony which a lot of hotel rooms do not have so you have to deal with that sacrifice. There isn't a lot of storage besides the closet so you will have to adjust accordingly. I've heard others complaining that the rooms were a bit on the dark side. There were five lamps inside our room that made it plenty bright if you chose to have them all on at the same time. The bathroom was well lit and the room also had a ceiling fan which was a nice touch. The Boma restaurant was very busy the night we visited. We had made prior reservations which I highly recommend because it was very busy as soon as it opened at 4:30. Our reservations were at 5:10 and were seated right as we checked in. The food was quite varied in options and everything I tried was tasty. I highly recommend the spiced rotisserie chicken. Our server was great about our children's needs and requests and also about replenishing drinks and clearing dirty plates and utensils. We did not visit the more upscale Jiko during our visit but it looked lovely from the outside. The menu was a bit more \"acquired taste\" than Boma and even though Jiko appeared to offer a kid's menu, I would not feel comfortable taking children into Jiko's white tablecloth atmosphere. We also used room service for breakfast and dinner and they were both delivered with quick, gracious service. The pool was decent sized with a water slide. lifeguards and private hot tubs hidden around the perimeter. The water isn't a typical chlorinated pool, it looks like clear river water. I'm sure it was to coordinate with the outdoorsy/nature feel of the resort. There is also a nice playground area just off the pool which was a nice touch. The playground also served as a convenient place for parents to let their kids burn off energy while waiting to be called for their dinner seating at Boma or Jiko. Even if you don't have a savanna view room, there are a few animal viewing spots around the resort. Check your resort map for locations. I would highly recommend asking when feeding times are during the day because that seems to bring out the animals in droves. It was awesome to watch giraffes, zebras, and antelope run and eat just fifteen or twenty feet away. We had rented a car so we did not use the bus transportation service but there always seemed to be buses coming and going so I doubt the wait was ever very long. We also utilized a grocery delivery service called the Garden Grocer. I highly recommend their service if you want to pay for the convenience of not having to stop at a grocery store to stock up on your needs. They even have baby staples like formula, baby food and diapers. Our delivery came right to the hotel bell service before we even checked in and all our items had been stored perfectly (some needed to be refrigerated) and they were brought to us once we were in our room. Overall, I loved the Animal Kingdom Lodge - the service was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Even the lobby looks like a large living room. The little extra touches like towel animals and turn down service makes you feel like you are special. You do pay for all of this of course, it is Disney after all.

If you can't get a room that overlooks the \"Savannah\" the hotel is probably not worth the extra cost. The pool is nice, but in summers it is crowded. The buffet restaurant, Boma, is probably the second best hotel restaurant in Disney (behind the very expensive Victoria and Albert's). On a weekend expect to wait for your table, even if you have reservations. Unfortunately check-in is extremely time consuming if there is any line at all. This is the case at pretty much every Disney resort. Trying to get adjoining rooms if your party isn't checking in at the same time is nearly impossible.

I had heard and read so many wonderful things about this property, I was eager to experience it with my young (animal loving) children and was sorely disappointed. We choose this hotel over all the other more expensive Disney properties because our young sons LOVE wild animals and they too were very sad with our experience. Our arrival was great, with a personal guide to our small one bedroom suite. Our conceive assured us we would see lots of animals grazing and roaming in the yards. We did see a few very distant cattle the first night and saw NOTHING for the remainder of our five day trip. Other than our initial greeter, the staff was hard to communicate with and even at one point very rude. There is an \"Animal Information\" button on the phone, when my inquisitive seven year old called down to ask questions about the animals the \"animal expert\" told him he was very busy and to stop playing with the phone. It's Disney for Heaven's Sake!! Most of the people using that line will be young people. I considered this behavior unacceptable, rude and very out of line. Our maid service was very shabby, with the staff only doing the bare minimum each day. Never were our towels arranged in characters of anything interesting or out of the ordinary as they have been at other properties. Even when my husband left a detailed note about something, it was completely ignored. The beds were made and new towels given and that is it. Trash was often left and things left in thrown about. The food was also another huge disappointment. It is either very basic kid fare or very heavily influenced African fare for adults. The food itself was not bad but it did get old very quickly. The bottom of the pool is a dirty brown and makes the water look nasty but the pool is open late. No Disney movies in the rooms either, just 17 channels of Disney World property promotions. To top it off, my children left an item on the desk when as we left. We called three times within 24 hours our departure. We never received a call back or any information at all about the item. This property sounds wonderful for children but it is NOT worth the price. We will not stay there again. This property sounds so great for children who love animals but you will be better off going on the Animal Kingdom Safari. I realize the staff cannot control when the animals will appear but since they bill themselves as \"the\" property to see the animals they need to at the very least ,be friendly when the young children ask about them.

The front desk said that the hotel was busy but by Tuesday we could change rooms if we wanted too. We decided to stay where we were. There were plenty of viewing areas to go to if we wanted to see the animals. We had a room with two queen beds. Very nice and clean. There were only two of us so I didn't think the room was too small. We didn't spend too much time at the resort or in our room. I did think that the beds and especially the pillows were very comfortable. After a long day at the parks, the bed was very comfortable. The only thing I could complain about was the remote control of the TV. It didn't work very well. We used one of the hot tubs one night and sat at the pool one day. The pool was heated and actually open 24 hours . We didn't have reservations to get into Boma but we went down 15 minutes before they opened and were at a table within the half hour. So worth it!! The food was wonderful!!! The coconut curry seafood stew was delicious as was the butternut squash soup! The staff was very friendly. We did eat at the quick service place called Mara. The vegetable flat bread was tasty. The night before we left, a sheet of paper was left on our door, explaining what time to come down to the airport desk to get your boarding pass and to get your luggage tagged for the return trip and also what time your bus would take you to the airport.

We didn't get upgraded, as I think the hotel was probably full, but there were lots of areas to view the animals, including one right across from our room that we had all to ourselves whenever we were out there.

You can also buy fruit and snacks at Mara to take with you into the parks, which would be a more convenient and healthier option than waiting in a line to eat lunch at the park. The room was big enough, the bathroom clean and nice, with granite countertops in the sink area, and a nice shelf over the sinks to put your stuff.

I spent a lot of time deciding where to stay for our trip, and I'm very glad we picked this hotel - we actually would have had fun spending a day away from the parks and just hanging out at the pool, viewing the animals, and having a rest day. I think for the money (we paid $220 through hotels.com) it was worth it to stay on Disney property, close to the parks, and take advantage of the Disney Extra Magic Hours available only to Disney hotel guests - on our day at the Animal Kingdom the park was open 3 hours later, until 8, and around 4 the crowd really thinned out, and we were able to ride all the rides again with no wait at all.

The one bedroom was such a great experience that we took advantage of the offer in our room, to return at 40% off the regular rate, if booked before we checked out. However, we booked a studio due to the high cost of a one bedroom. With the 40% reduction, it works out to a price similar to the buy four nights, get three free.

I would recommend staying at this resort, to anyone who is thinking of planning a trip to Disneyworld. We had a totally enjoyable and stress free vacation. The meals at Mara were reasonably priced and great tasting. The buffet at Boma was fantastic. The free bus service was a bonus, as we had no long waits (we went to the parks 5 days out of 7); and found it much more convenient, than driving our own vehicle.

Our flight arrived in the morning and because check-in is at 3pm, we were 'homeless' for a few hours. We were able to keep our luggage locked in Bell Service at the lodge until check-in which allowed us to explore the resort and get some lunch in the meantime. We decided to spend the extra money for a savannah view and when our room was finally ready and we went up to check it out I almost started sobbing. We must have been given the room with the WORST view in the resort!! It was on the savannah SIDE of the hotel, but with a view blocked by a HUGE rock covered in bird poop, a very large steel pole, and some dead plants.....not even sunlight was getting through our doorwall! Now...if you leaned WAAAAAY over the balcony railing you might catch a glimpse of an animal off to the left in the distance but for the price...that was completely unacceptable and I requested a new room. I have to admit that I was extremely angry that they would even attempt to represent that room as a 'savannah view'. For future travellers...it was room #2211. If you are assigned that room at the front desk don't even bother walking all the way there, just hand the key back. Better yet, when booking a savannah view room...tell them you want an 'unobstructed view' since I'm told there are several along that rock formation which share the same shameful view of the rocks. Our new room on the 3rd floor (#3565) had an amazing view and the animals were right there to greet us every time we stepped out onto the balcony. THAT room was well worth the price. Yes, the rooms are small but we did fine with 2 adults and a 7-year-old....(we had 2 queen beds). The TV channels are scarce...mostly Disney promotional programming and a few select news, weather, and Lifetime channels so don't plan on catching many of your favorite shows while you're there. Also, cleaning & towel service is not provided daily. We were given 4 bath towels, 4 wash cloths, & 2 hand towels in the room and those were not replaced until the 4th day so I suggest that if you have more than 2 or 3 people in your group, bring some additional towels...or pay the extra $6 and request early towel service at the resort. The pool is perfect for kids...not too deep and the water is delightfully warm so it worked out well on our cool February evenings. The hotel and grounds are incredibly clean and the staff was friendly and helpful throughout our entire stay....many of them extending extra attention to making my daughter's experience there wonderful. Many, if not most, of the staff are from Africa and are more than happy to share all about their homes and culture! They have crafts and activities all day long for the kids and we participated in many of them. The bus transportation to and from the parks is easy and convenient and we never waited more than 15 minutes for a ride. The Mara quick service restaurant serves good food but pretty much the same thing every day so if you can grab a few meals out at the parks for variety, do it. The travel mugs they provide allow for free refills of soda, coffee, & tea at the resort (not the parks) and is very nice to have since a 20oz bottle of soda would otherwise cost $2.75. NOTE: Bring a little bottle of dishwashing liquid with you so you can wash your mugs up in the room. After a few days, just rinsing with water just doesn't seem CLEAN. Oh! Make sure you take your kids down to the pool area after dark so they can view the animals through night-vision goggles!

We had the queen with bunks and the room, although a little small, was very clean and well kept. We had plenty of room for the three of us, though it could be a problem if you have older kids- as far as space.

There is a large flat screen TV with limited channels, but who watched TV on vacation anyway. The temperature in the room was well controlled and comfortable. We saw animals every day we were there. They were so close to our room- our son was absolutely thrilled (we were too)! There was also a variety of animals, not just the same ones all the time. Part of the package was a refillable mug that could be used only in the hotel, but it was great! The Mara (counter service-fast food) was open until 11:30 at night and you had access to all the drinks you wanted (coke products, tea, coffee etc) while in the hotel. The pool was large (though not as large as the picture looks) and there were two hot spas, and a wading pool as well. The whole thing is surrounded by the savannahs and animals of all kinds (none predatory)- zebra, giraffe, impalas, kudu, flamingos, crowned cranes, anoke cattle, antelope, eland, wildebeast, gazelle, ---well, all kinds of animals. (also you see people frequently out cleaning up after them so there are no unplesant smells anywhere!) The walk to the room was a bit of a distance, but the quality of the lodge and the amenities, make it well worth it. It was so quiet! After a long day in the crowds at the parks, it was nice to return to the room and the wonderful silence. There were animal calls at times, but that was nice to hear. There are two \"table service\" resturants in the lodge, the Boma and the Jiko. We did not eat at the Jiko, but the Boma was a wonderful buffet for breakfast and dinner with foods with an African flair! The service was great, but it could be a bit noisy at times. The Mara was the fast-food-snack place, really quick and the food (burgers, sandwiches, cereal, breakfast items-mickey waffles-snacks) was good as well. There are many activities at the hotel for all ages so just check the activity schedule if you plan to stay around the hotel for a day. The bus service to the parks was great. We had virtually no waiting time from the hotel to any of the parks. The lodge is the farthest from the Magic Kingdom, but closest to the Animal Kindgom park so the bus ride to Magic Kingdom is of course about 20 minutes or more. The only wait we had for a bus was returning from EPCOT after fireworks, but it wasn't that bad. We were extremely pleased with the Animal Kingdom Lodge. There is really nothing negative we can say about it.

This is the 2nd Disney property we have stayed at and I would return with my family again without any second thought.", "Date": "February 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cVery pleased after reading many negative reviews\u201d", "Author": "WanderingGypsyMama", "ReviewID": "UR24403829", "Content": "After recently reading many negative reviews, my husband and I were wondering if we would regret choosing AKL for our family's first stay on Disney property. We were very pleased to have an overall wonderful experience. Our family includes two children, ages just-turned-6 and 3 1/2. We picked up a free birthday buttonfor my daughter at City Hall at Magic Kingdom, and she received birthday wishes and a free goodies all week. We took advantage of the Disney Magical Express. As we approached the Magical Express counter at the airport, we were dismayed to see a VERY long, slow-moving line. In Disney's defense, the line was long and slow because most people had forgotten their Magical Express documentation and the Disney reps had to do research and reprint paperwork. I had my documentation, and it took the rep less than 1 minute to scan my booklet and send me to the AKL line. Not having to get our luggage ourselves was worth it!!! The luggage arrived in our room shorlty after we checked in. Once in our bus line, we waited about 10 minutes for the bus to appear and begin loading. There was one other resort on the bus with us, and we were dropped off last. We landed at 9:30 and were at the hotel by 11:30. Our friends who landed after us said they had no wait in the M.E. express line. The hotel is very nice by Disney standards. The grounds are lush and the aesthetics pleasing. From the lobby to the pool area, attention to detail was obvious. Our check in was quick and smooth. The rep was polite and professional. He clearly explained everything we needed to know. We were thrilled that our room was ready and went there immediately to unpack. My friend who lives in Orlando had dropped off some groceries for us at the bell hop station at AKL. She had the Disney cast member's name and a confirmation number. When we stopped by to pick up our packages, there was some confusion and the packages could not be found. We've found, in all our dealings with Disney cast members, that if you ask 3 different people the same question, you generally get 3 different answers. So, we asked another bell hop where our packages were and she found them and had them sent to our room quickly. Everyone with whom we dealt in the bell hop and check-in area was friendly and helpful. Our room was not as small as we had expected after reading the reviews. We had savannah room 3425 on the zebra trail. We liked it b/c it was on the same floor as the lobby and only one building away, so our walk wasn't long at all. There was little noise, even though many people use that hallway. We were never awakened at night by passers-by. Upon entering the room, our kids ran right to the balcony and were excited to see giraffe, zebra, and other animals. They were not at our balcony, so if you expect them to be very close, you might be disappointed. My husband and I decided that we would not pay the extra for the view next time; it was very nice but not exceptional. There were not always animals out and our kids, although they loved it at first, had more fun playing with the hotel phone and fridge. I'm glad we did savannah view this time but would spend that money somewhere else next time. The room was very nice and spotlessly clean and we appreciated the jungle motif. It was an adjoining room, so we parked our stroller in the space by the adjoining door. I saw a room across the hall that was not adjoining, and they had a dresser in that spot. We wish we had an extra dresser, as there was very little storage. We had a t.v. armoire with two small drawers below it and a closet. We could not fit all the clothes for our family of four (with two small children) in the drawers, so more space would have been nice. There was a narrow shelf on the bathroom sink area that was not wide enough to fit my cosmetic bag. Aside from space issues, there were a few more things that made us check \"above average\" instead of \"excellent\" for our stay. We had a great time, but I want to be as thorough as possible, so here are the negatives: -little storage -LG brand t.v. remote didn't work well. A few people we met at the pool complained about the same thing. Trying to change channels was frustrating. -Disney offers very few channels. We were out of the room most of the day, but, for $300+ a night, I expect to be able to find a Law & Order rerun to watch when I'm in bed! Ironically, they offered the TV Japan channel but not USA network!! -We had a passive-aggressive relationship with our maid. There were animal towels left on our bed after the first night there. My kids left a thank you note. No more animal towels. On our 3rd night, I left a nice note asking for animal towels the next day. No animal towels. The maid unplugged our clock, which is not easy to do b/c of its placement, so it was not illuminated. We thought it was broken. We called housekeeping. The guy said to check the plug. My husband and I joked that the maid was trying to irritate us by ignoring our requests or not doing basic things, such as replacing the hotel shampoo. The room was very clean, however, so we didn't complain. These were minor issues that didn't ruin anything for us. We understood, though, how many people complained about housekeeping on tripadvisor. -The beds are VERY high off the ground. If you have young kids, request railings. We called housekeeping, The nice man came and installed us for them. He said he had given out seven that day and we got the last pair. Reserve them early if you need them. I couldn't sleep the first night b/c I thought the kids would roll out of bed. Because it was very cold during the week we were there, only a few brave souls were in the pool. We enjoyed the pool area and its surroundings. We had our pick of chairs, and we appreciated the life vest for the kids. The slide and outdoor bar were great. I'm wondering how noisy it would be for pool-side rooms when it's crowded??? My kids loved the few hotel activities in which they participated: the parade, story telling and night vision binocular viewing. They wanted their caricatures done. The artist is there from about 6-11 or something like that-- evening hours only and late for little kids. We ate dinner at Boma; the buffet was fine and the kids tried some African foods. There was enough to fill us up, but nothing extraordinary. We don't have advanced palates, so maybe a gourmand would love the selection more than we did. We ate at the quick-service Mara restaurant a few times. Breakfast was adequate. We liked the lunch/dinner selections better. Something for everyone. We had the meal plan, which worked really well for us. Be sure to use up all your snacks to get your money's worth. We received a 30-minute game card w/ our package, and the kids liked the arcade. It was family -friendly. I'm a control freak and was concerned about not renting a car and having to use Disney transportation. Mostly the buses ran very smoothly. Once, at AKL, we had to wait 40 minutes for a bus. People were understandably angry. I agree w/ other reviewers-- don't expect to get on the bus first if you're there first. Everyone moves en masse toward the bus doors. I found myself organzing the crowd to ensure the early arrivers got on first. Overall we waited anywhere from 5-15 minutes for buses. Sometimes the ride was pleasant, and sometimes we were packed too tightly-- people standing. With strollers, packages, etc., they needed to run more buses. We used the express check out, which was perfectly smooth. We had no issues. We were spending more time in Florida, so we rented a car from Alamo (they and National rent cars at the Disney car care center) so we didn't use the return to airport service. The car care center requires at least an hour and a half to pick you up after you call, so plan accordingly. Aside from minor negative issues, we really had a great week. I checked out the Wilderness Lodge where our friends stayed, and I preferred AKL. It's a beautiful resort; it's clean; The frenetic pace you'd experience at other resorts is not present here. It's a very nice place to stay while visiting Disney World.

I found both Mara and Boma surprisingly good ( I am usually not a fan of Disney restaurants) which lots of different food options and something to please everyone. I particularly like the African food options at Boma. What I like most about the hotel was that it had a very calming atmosphere. I was a great place to unwind after a hectic day at the parks. They keep the hotel quite dark (apparently it's for the animals), and that combined with the African vibe was very serene.

Travellers were myself, my husband, our 3-year-old son and our 6-year-old daughter. We had a WONDERFUL experience at this hotel. Rooms: the rooms were a fair size. Not as big as the Polynesian (but the rooms there are enormous, so not really a fair comparison). There was plenty of room for the 4 of us. I had booked just a standard view, so we were expecting the parking lot, but upon check-in we were pleasantly surprised with a Savannah room! Across the green space, and beyond all the wonderful animals we got to look at, we could see the construction of the new Disney Vacation Club Villas (which is probably why we got that room). This did not bother us AT ALL. We were never kept awake, and we did know there was construction going on, because we did our homework BEFORE we booked. The room was always clean. The mini refrigerator was nice, although quite loud (don't put items in the door overnight - they tend to rattle). The only real complaint about the room is that the beds were rather uncomfortable. Still, we were so tried at the end of every day it didn't really hinder our sleep at all. All in all, I probably wouldn't pay extra for the Savannah room, as there are so many wonderful animal viewing areas around the hotel. But it was certainly enjoyed by all of us! Housekeeping: wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Our room was SPOTLESS everyday, and we always had plenty of towels and soaps, etc. We left a tip everyday in appreciation of this. We didn't get towel animals everyday, but we knew that wasn't a given, so we weren't terribly disappointed. A word of advice to those complaining about how disappointed your children were - DON'T PROMISE THEM TOWEL ANIMALS! I read a lot of reviews before booking this hotel and MANY of them said no towel animals. So we didn't tell the children there would be any. Problem solved. These housekeepers work hard. They clean a lot of rooms. I'd rather my room be clean with fancy towel art than dirty with towel animals all over the place. And no, no one filled the ice buket for me. I don't think, no matter how much I paid, I have ever stayed in a hotel where housekeeping filled the ice bucket for me. It's not really so hard to do it yourself. Really not hard at all. Buses: never had a problem. Once the Magic Kingdom bus broke down and we had to wait a little longer than usual, but no big deal. It really isn't such a long ride anywhere either. I know other reviewers complained about the long bus rides, and I was prepared for that, but was NOT long at all! I think the longest trip was about 20 minutes, and really, it takes me longer than that to drive my daughter to her ballet class, AND I have to battle rush hour traffic on the way home. So much easier to let someone else handle the driving while I enjoy the scenery. Don't worry about long bus rides. They're not that long and they're really no big deal. We don't ride the bus at home, so my children thought it was really cool! Service: terrific! Everyone we encountered at this hotel was SUPER friendly, and always ready to help out. We wanted for nothing. Restaurants: We were on the Quick-Service Dining plan (which I do recommend!) so we only ate at The Mara. It was good food. Quite a bit of variety, even for the children. We never went hungry, and the staff was SO helpful in deciphering the dining plan. The made sure you got everything you paid for! Pool: LARGE! Lots of room, lots of chairs, and a pretty neat little waterslide. The only problem we had was that the waterslide was one person at a time - NO expceptions, so my 3-year-old didn't get to go on it like he wanted. He was a little scared to go on his own. HOWEVER, it was SO nice to see them enforcing their own pool rules, unlike other vacations we have been on (i.e., Disney cruise line). Other things: the hotel itself is really neat. The decor is beautiful. There's also a playground for the kids if you need something to do. All in all, a great hotel. I would definately stay here again!

There are big differences between the updated rooms and the older wings of the hotel. Although it is a newer disney property - the updated rooms are much nicer. We even tried to upgrade to the concierge level - but it was all sold out. (Definately spend the money to do this if it is available!) But a simple request for an updated room when checking in put us in the perfect room from day one. We had fantastic views of the animals in the morning and late afternoon. There was quite a bit of construction going on at the adjacent villas - but we never lost a wink of sleep from the noise. Good: Animals & updated rooms. All staff with the exception of our room attendant. She was not very friendly and we never got the fun towel animals that everyone else got. My kids were disappointed. After the first day- we never had ice in our bucket. We have been to several of the deluxe resorts - and this one paled in comparasion. Fitness Center: LOVED IT! I worked out here every morning prior to the race. They opened the center early every morning to accomodate the race participants prior to the race. Staff was great and so were the spa treatments. Jiko & Boma : Both EXECELLENT dining experiences! I LOVED the extensive wine selection at Jiko! Golf: After 2pm rates at the golf courses dropped to $70 per round! My husband and I had mid 70's weather and a great time golfing. No issues with getting T times either! They also pay your cab fare to/from the golf courses! Bad: You can hear the start of the circle of life race from your room. No chairs available on nice days at the pool. Pool is very small but well maintained. The pool in the villas area will be a nice compliment when it is finished. Bus transportation everywhere. We were actually passed by twice (different times) at the ticket and transportation center. You can't take advange of all of the concierge perks even if they are sold out. Ugly: The older rooms in the resort. A little dusty and in need of updates (we saw a friend's room). Don't book a breakfast at 1500 Park Fare before 9am! There is no way to get there via Disney Transportation and it costs $25 for a cab ride! I was exceptionally disappointed! Disney gives you a cab voucher for $70 round of golf - but not for a $150 breakfast! Go figure! The adjacent construction. Goofy Challenge .... My family and I stayed here for the marathon weekend. Disney did a great job with transportation to/from the expo and marathon start. We did have tons of people who were not runners getting on the buses as early as 4 am. It was difficult to weigh the late hours in the parks with my family against getting up at 3:30 am two mornings in a row to make sure I get to the start line in time. UUUGGHHH! Boma did offer some snacks for sale as early as 3am - but I didn't venture down there as I have a specific pre-race diet. The shuttles from the marathon to the hotel were equally as pleasant. My family boarded the post race shuttle with me and had received no negative feedback from the other riders or drivers. Everyone was exceptionally nice and very helpful! I book the race retreat - and it wasn't worth the price. The food was nasty and nothing you wanted to eat after a marathon! The only plus was the lack of lines at the porta potty! I tried to get a \"$10\" massage and they only took cash. No credit cards! So I asked the \"concierge\" in the tent to book me a spa appointment back at animal kingdom lodge and after 15 minutes of waiting for her to find the number - I left and used my treo phone to do it in 5 minutes (about the same amount of time it took the shuttle to get me from the tent to the animal kingdom lodge)! I would say skip the massage at the race and go right for the spa at the lodge! The therapist I had was a certified PT and did wonders for my legs. After 39.3 miles she got all of the knots out and left me in a fabulous position to spend the rest of the afternoon at Blizzard Beach and the remainder of the evening in Epot! NO KIDDING! Don't get me wrong - I didn't walk as fast as usual - but I had very little soreness and really enjoyed the remainder of the day with my family!", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cEscape to the Animal Kingdom Lodge\u201d", "Author": "Brav3Heart", "ReviewID": "UR24224899", "Content": "We transferred to the Animal Kingdom Lodge from the Polynesian Resort and stayed for 10 nights. In short it was awesome. We had a Savannah view room on the zebra trail (all the way at the back) and it was (small criticism) quite a hike! (Like I imagine it would be in Africa). The view was breathtaking and especially great as any time my 10 month old daughter was feeling cranky, we'd walk her to the balcony so she could watch the parade of zebras, giraffes, ankole cattle, etc. parading passed our room, which made us happy too! Finding the room was a lot easier than at the polynesian and slightly smaller but that's where the comparison ends as they are 2 different resorts. The lobby is a sight to see as well as the entire resort (by that I mean where there are animal viewing spots (pretty much everywhere). Check in was a breeze - could've just been due to the fact we spent the day at cape canaveral and checked in at around 6 in the evening. All the staff were friendly and greeted as we walked by. The room wasn't huge but big enough for the 3 of us but even if we had 2 fully grown children with us I think it would still have been big enough to be comfortable. Again the towel animal on welcome was a great touch and housekeeping did a great job in maintaining the room as well as creating a new towel animal each day. The only complaint I have with housekeeping was that we had bathers hanging on the line in the shower in the morning but upon returning in the evening they were gone. Can only summise that they must have fallen down and were mistakenly taken down to the laundry with the towels. Not a huge deal but couldn't go back out to the pool the next day as we wanted. Climate control in the room is good, but needs an on/off switch - my wife and daughter had developed a cold and trying to get the temperature right was too hard. Easily overcome with a call to housekeeping who turned it off for us but if we wanted to turn it back on, we would have had to call again (luckily we didn't need to). Bathroom was a little small as the toilet right in between the door and the bath made it seem a little crowded. (Again not a huge deal). The pool wasn't huge but not small either. My daughter enjoyed it and if she were tall enough would have enjoyed the slide too! She really enjoyed the playground next to where the pink flamingos gather as if she got tired she could look at the birds for a while and then go back and play. No shortage of viewing areas all around the resort during the day but the night viewing while enjoyable can prove frustrating when standing in a queue for a short glimpse through the nightvision. Only dined at 2 of the 3 restaurants on offer, Mara which is really convenient and cheapest of the 3 and Boma (which I think is the buffet one). Buffet's not really to my liking but even I enjoyed this restaurant. Buses around disney were never a problem and never waited more than 20 mins for one to arrive to take us where we wanted to go. The rides can take a long time though to the magic kingdom and downtown disney. The other's aren't too far away. Checkout was easy due to the convenience of express checkout and magical express made it even easier to get to the airport. If flying domestically, I recommend using the resort airline check-in as it takes away the hustle and bustle of putting up with the long queues at the airport. Overall it was a great experience and would stay there again, just so I could see my daughter's reaction every time she saw the animals go by. Worth the price?

The first 2 weeks were in a Pool View room, and the last 4 nights in a club level room. We arrived quite late in the evening and check in was quick and efficient. I loved the decor of the hotel common areas and our room. The lobby is truly breathtaking, and our room was clean, reasonably spacious and decorated in keeping with the african theme. The only criticism I have of the room is that although it faced the pool, the view was incredibly limited due to the tree right in front of our balcony. We ate at The Mara a few times which was a good quick service option, and Boma and Jiko both of which were excellent. Boma was loud and crowded, but we enjoyed the food selections, whereas Jiko had a much quieter atmosphere, fantastic food and service. We also ordered room service a couple of times, and it was always good, with big portions and delivered quickly. The bus transportation to the parks was excellent with only one unacceptable wait in over two weeks. After 2 weeks here, we re-checked in for our club level reservation. We were escorted up to the lounge for a private check in, which was very pleasant and were told our rooms would be ready by 3. One of the draws of a club level stay was the savannah view, and when we got into our room I was incredibly disappointed to see construction (painting and sawing) going on right outside of our balcony, effectively making the balcony (and thus the savannah view) unusable. Our complaint was dealt with quickly and we were moved to a room not affected by the construction, but I felt the hotel staff should have informed us of the construction while checking in. After this inital disruption we had a great view of the savannah, and watched zebra and giraffe from our balcony.

I really thought I'd be disappointed not having a Savannah view, but was not. There are so many viewing spots to watch the animals, so in my opinion to pay for the Savannah view isn't worth it. We saw giraffe, zebra, and much more. We couldn't hear anything from the rooms around us. Our room was newly renovated and had some upgrades, like a flat screen TV. There are two dressers,and a large closet. As for the room size, it isn't huge, but we were comfortable. It was my husband, myself, and our three children: ages 12, 3, and 18mnths. POOL: The pool is heated, and we were able to enjoy it even with the cold temps Orlando was having that week. The hot tub was great also, and both were open 24 hrs. They have life vests for the kids right where you get your towels. The kiddie pool is a little secluded, and we didn't see it right away. It was great for our 18 mnth old, however the bottom is very rough. There is so much to hold the children's interest, like the game room, looking at the animals, the pool and the playground. They even have face painting for the kids, and they do scheduled arts and crafts. My 3 year old loved making wooden animals. In the evenings, they have the children play with musical instruments (drums and such) and they listened to a woman educate them about African culture and then danced around the hotel lobby playing their instruments. VERY CUTE! The hotel is large, so yes there is a lot of walking. But, after the meals you will eat at Disney, the walking won't hurt! I read some negatives about hotel staff, but we had all positive experiences with staff, from maids to hotel desk, and even cashiers in the food court. Everyone was very friendly and courteous. The lobby is gorgeous, and you just have to look around. There is a firepit inside, as well as one outside. FOOD: The restaurant, Boma was great.It's a buffet with many African dishes as well as chicken and macaroni and cheese for the kids. Jiko's looked amazing, however with two toddlers, we never had a chance to dine there. Its not a \"kid place\". We were on Disney's dining plan, and let me say its well worth it! We had 4 people eating,and our youngest eating off our plates. Our average bill was $90-$100. I definitely recommend the dining plan. The only thing not included is tips. Make reservations for all your sit-down dinners, because they book up. Ohana's at the Polynesian is outstanding, and Yik & Yaks at Animal Kingdom. Hollywood Studios has a (Fifties Diner) not sure of name, that is great for families, and they have great malts. The MARA, at AKL is very convenient, you can dine in or outside, or at times we took our tray back to room because the kids were tired. Its cafeteria style. The (dessert) Zebra Domes are delicious. The African stew and flat bread chicken pizza is great. PARKS: We saw the finale show of the American Idol experience and it was just like being at the show. Everyone enjoyed that. TRANSPORTATION: The buses were ok. Wait time wasn't too bad, however stand near curb because people will come at last minute,and walk right up, as there is no real order to waiting for bus.They fill up pretty quick.

The restaurants were easy to get into, pool was never crowded and the bus line was easy to use, even though we had a rental car the Disney bus service was quicker.

We didn't have to wait around at baggage claim after our flight. We just boarded our Magical Express bus and we were on our way. Our bags were taken to our Hotel and we were told that our bags would be delivered to our room upon our arrival, which they were with no problems. We ended up renting a car our second day which gave us a little more freedom rather than relying on Disney transportation from the AKL to the different Disney Parks. We noticed quite a long wait (approx 20 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 40 minutes) going from the AKL to the parks. AKL is the furthest resort from the parks. I booked a Kilimanjaro Club Level room as a surprise for my new bride. We were told that a Concierge Cast member would be available to meet us at the Concierge Kiosk in valet once we arrived. We arrived at the AKL approx 1100am and no one was available to meet us at the kiosk. I was told that a Club level cast member would be down to assist us within a few minutes. I waited approx 20 minutes and was escorted up to the club level (6th floor) by a valet cast member...again there were no club level cast members available to assist us. The Kilimanjaro Club was very nice and very crowded. My wife and I decided to grab a quick snack (fruit and water) and wait for a concierge cast member to check us in. There were only two cast members assisting other guests. After waiting approx 90 minutes (we were a little upset at this point) we were assisted by cast member Jack. Jack was extremely apologetic and offered to get us a private car for our trip that was planned to DTD later in the week. I appreciated him doing that and before we left the concierge lounge he gave us some tips on the AKL signature restaurant (Jiko) and we were then on our way to our room. Our room was a Savannah view room overlooking the Arusha Savannah. We had a Giraffe and several Zebras just off of our balcony and they were frequent visitors throughout our stay. The other animals along our trail seemed to stay more to the back of our Savannah and out of view. The beds in our room had been made, but the bathroom hadn't been cleaned. We called and spoke to housekeeping and they said someone would be right up to clean the bathroom. Approx 5 minutes later a Housekeeping Manager was at our door with a housekeeping cast member and she (Manager) asked to see the bathroom. She was very apologetic and gave us her business card and told us to call her if we needed anything during our stay. After a few hours of rest, we decided to take a stroll around the AKL and check out the different guest areas and dining options. The main pool looked very comfortable and relaxing. The firepit outside the main lobby was great. It was very romantic and the storytelling by AKL cast members was great. These \"storytellers\" were from Africa and it was great to hear stories about their life while growing up in Africa. We decided to take the advice of Jack and try out Jiko. Jiko is an amazing restaurant with a beautiful decor and wonderful food. Jack had recommended the Filet Mignon on top of Mac and Cheese. Wow!!!! The meat was very good and seasoned just right and this wasn't your every day Kraft Mac n Cheese. My Wife ordered the Scallops and she kept raving about how good the food was. After Dinner we decided to check out the Savannah with night vision binoculars that were available at a viewing station near the main pool. That was awesome and we were able to see many animals on the savannah. When we arrived back at our room we were shocked to see Chocolate covered strawberries had been delivered to our room. It was such a beautiful display with the chocolate elephant and AKL sign that was also in chocolate. The strawberries were also very good. I wasn't sure if this was because it was our honeymoon and housekeeping's way of apologizing for the bathroom not being cleaned. A great surprise none the less. A benefit of booking a club level room was the opportunity to take a morning Safari. We got up early on Thursday morning and proceeded to the Concierge lounge for our breakfast safari (approx $55 per person) check in. It was very cold at 645am and my wife and I were given blankets (that had to be returned) for our Safari. We were taken by bus (50 people/2 buses) to the Animal Kingdom Park where we boarded the Kilimanjaro Safari attraction. Our guide throughout the morning was cast member Greg (AKL Curator for animals) and he was extremely knowledgeable regarding all the animals. The Safari Attraction normally lasts approx 15 minutes when taken as a park guest with no stopping on along the way, however the breakfast Safari was approx 1 hour with many stops along the way throughout the Savannah's. My wife and I were able to get many pictures. After the Safari was over, we were escorted to Pizzafari for a buffet breakfast prepared special for our safari group. The food was very good and since this was our honeymoon...we were given special attention from the Pizzafari cast members. We received a certificate of congratulations for our honeymoon. Upon our initial check in several days before, we were given \"Just Married Buttons\" to wear during our stay. I can't tell you how many cast members offered us congratulations throughout our entire stay. It was an amazing honeymoon and booking the Kilimanjaro club was definitely worth it. We were able to get a quick breakfast or other snacks throughout the day and Disney's attention to detail during our stay was incredible.

We've stayed at other disney deluxe hotels and wanted to try this one to see what it was like. Overall, we had a very nice stay. Keep in mind that what disney calls deluxe, it is not the type of deluxe you might find in 5-star hotels. Disney's deluxe hotels are VERY, VERY nice, but the rooms are not always as plush as some might expect them to be from the prices charged. I think what makes them deluxe is the fact that the hotels have beautiful grounds for viewing and walking though, good facilities and services, extensive recreation options (pools, boating, etc.), close proximity to the disney parks and entertainment areas, and other disney perks. Frankly, when I compare the prices to many of the hotels I've stayed at for business travel, disney hotels are truly worth the price paid - especially if you are able to travel in the off season or are able to take advantage of some other discount offered. What we liked: Hotel grounds, lobby, halls, and room are beautiful. Though dark, the hotel has a very rich feeling and is keeping with the African theme. We actually found it very relaxing. The room was smaller then what we had remembered from other disney deluxe hotels (for example, the contemporary or grand floridian), but since it was just the two of us, we felt we had plenty of room. Our room had a balcony that was overlooking the pool area. The balcony was very nice, felt large and was comfortable. The room was very comfortable as well - even the beds! I did not find hotel noise to be a problem at all. Rooms were quiet, very clean, nice towels and bath ammenities. The shower/toilet area was in a separate room from the vanity. The pool area was fantastic - plenty of shady areas if you need one. There is also one or two whirlpool spas as well. What we didn't like: Since disney was still busy for the holiday season, my mother and I were really looking forward to a drink in the lounge after a day at the park. The hotel lounge could have been nice, but there were a couple of problems. 1) Nobody came to our table to take drink orders, I had to order from the bar. Not a huge problem, but I would expect a deluxe resort to offer the service. 2. There was a family of about 5 kids hanging out at one table. they were noisy, bouncing a ball in the lounge - it escalated into running circles through the lounge/lobby area. Where were the parents??? Where were the disney staff to say something about this??? Very disappointing. Other notes: We had a car and drove to the parks on our own for the first day. However, I'm not yet convinced using your own transportation gets you to where you are going that much faster than the disney transportaion. The second day, we used the disney transportaion to get where we wanted to go. It was more relaxing for me to let someone else do the driving! If I were visiting disney for a week, I would forgo a rental car and just use the disney transportation. I don't think the disney transportation has direct hotel to hotel service either. For example, you cannot take a bus from the Animal Kingdom lodge to the Boardwalk hotel. If you want to go from hotel to hotel, and need to get there fast, consider taking a taxi. Still a lot cheaper than keeping a rental car for a week. If you plan to have a late night snack back at the hotel after an evening at the parks beware - I don't think the AKL has any food service available after 11:30 or 12AM. Check the times of the restaurants or room service (or bar) if you think you want a snack or drink after returning from the parks so that you can plan accordingly. Or consider staying at another disney resort (like the grand floridian)that has 24 hour food service. Also, take advantage of the Disney Photo Pass! I really like this service. At the disney parks, they have photographers available to take your pictures. The service is free. You can view your pictures online, and purchase any that you are interested in (or none at all). Overall, I think this was a really good stay and I would definitely stay at AKL again. I would recommend it for both families as well as for couples.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it!\u201d", "Author": "JellybabyCheshire", "ReviewID": "UR23561223", "Content": "We spent 7 nights at Animal Kingdom Lodge in January - we are a party of 5 ((2 Ad, 2 Ch (7 + 3), 1 Infant 7mnths)). I am going to start with a very general - we loved the whole experience here. The lodge is very very beautiful, welcoming and felt like 'home'. I will try now to be a little more specific. Many reviews indicate that the Hotel is very dark, it is true that when I first entered the Hotel i thought it was quite dark, but upon having a good look around, it is very much about the theme of the Hotel - 'Africa'. As many have stated the Lobby is stunning - it is also buzzing, has much atmosphere, feels very luxurious whilst also maintaining an air of informality. Bedrooms The Hotel rooms - were beautiful - the furniture very substantial and had little extras that would be expected of Deluxe Resort e.g. Fridge, I-Pod docking station, LCD TV. True the rooms are not huge - but we managed perfectly well as a party of 5 - they are typical of Orlando Hotels - if you are looking for a sitting area perhaps a Disney Villa would be more appropriate. The rooms were spotlessly clean - and all carpets / decoration was very new. Views We had a Savannah room (this was a huge bonus as we had booked a standard room) on Kudu Trail overlooking Ostrich savannah - we had veiews every day of Ostrich & Antelope, and some days of Giraffes & Zebras - we were not disappointed. If I was staying again I would ask for a view overlooking Zebra Trail or Giraffe Trail just primarily because these animals are located there every day. If your budget won't stretch to a Savannah room - no problem, there are so many viewing stations around the resort. They even provide night vision goggles for evening viewing. There is usually a cast member at the viewing points to discuss the animals with you. Pools / Facs Pool area was beautiful, had plenty of loungers, towels, sunshades and had lifeguards on until 9pm - 10pm (i think). The pool was used by all ages until late into the evening and had a real hoilday atmosphere. The Hot tubs were a real bonus too. Hotel has a good fitness centre, Arcade room & also Childcare drop-in centre all which were very well maintained. We felt that this Hotel was family friendly and there were many children staying at the resort with their families. Eating Boma is fantastic - we found that it was suitable for our children. There was always plenty of selections for them to choose from if your children do not eat Adult fare. I would agree the cuisine is African inspired but that adds to the interest. This restaurant is very popular and always busy - so reservations are advised. Mara - Quick Service Restaurant was absolutely fine, we generally only used it for breakfast which was typical cooked breakfast / mickey waffles / Cereals / Bagels / Pastries / Muffins. (It is not a Buffet). Also sold botttles of wine / snacks / at reasonable prices. Jiko - A signature Restaurant - we did not eat in there due to make up of our party. In summary - I have read many of the reviews about AKL and this web is about personal opinion - I have stayed in many 4* + 5* Hotels and found this to be worthy of its rating. We were not disappointed in the least - in fact we would go again.", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "CourtneyR", "ReviewID": "UR23561855", "Content": "We stayed here just after the hotel opened but visited for the great food the next year!

We had an excellent overall experience. The lobby is outstanding. We wanted a king bed, but when we booked our room in September, we were told they only had a room with a queen and 2 bunk beds. It was fine, and we got lots of extra pillows because of the extra beds. The size of the room was also fine, and the bed was very comfortable. Large towels, and lots of them. The refrigerator came in handy, because we were on the meal plan and there was always too much food for us to finish. We had a savanna room, #3521 on the Zebra Trail, and we constantly saw animals. Giraffes, zebras, gazelles, kudus, elands, cattle, all kinds of birds. The housekeeping was fine...no problems. Also the airline check-in and Magical Express worked pretty much as advertised. Ate at Boma's. LOVED it! Very different flavors, but excellent. The soups, salads and the Zebra Domes for dessert were my favorite. The other reviewers are correct when they say you need reservations. You MUST have reservations for every sit-down restaurant on the property. We were there at a very slow time (never waited for any attraction) and the restaurants were still crowded. The bus system works just fine. Sure, I wish the time between the lodge and the parks was shorter, but it was never that big a deal. Cons: The cable TV was pretty basic. They have HD sets and HD channels, but if you take out the various Disney channels, the sports channels, the news channels and the religious channels, all you have are the networks. The soundproofing is terrible. You can hear the people in the rooms next to you urinating in their bathrooms. Gross! And the frequently unhappy small child in the room next door might as well have been having her tantrums while sitting in our laps, it was so loud. Our bags took over 5 hours to get to our room from the Magical Express. It says 3 hours on their literature. You have to walk right past the smoking area to get to and from the bus stop.

I just wanted to add two small caveats. First, if you went to Disney when you were small and had great memories and think that you can relive those fantasies as an adult with your own child and reluctant husband beware if you decide to do it at this resort. This place is way over priced. If you do not mind spending $300 plus dollars to stay at a Days Inn collocated on a zoo then the AKL is for you. The lobby is truly amazing but that only lasts 1 day before you say...there goes that nice lobby but the room sucks. Maybe I should have had my family sleep in the lobby. The rooms are very very small. Internet is not free. Towels are small. It is like it was built for a little mouse. Hmmmm!!!!!!! Second, they snare you with the savannah room as opposed to the ones facing the parking lot. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a spouse saying \"you do not want to spend two pay checks on a Jlo diamond wedding ring. Are you too cheap for your family\"? Don't fall for it. The savannah view is a BFR (Big Fat Rip Off). You see the same old zoo animals again and again. Why? Because, in order for them to eat they have to parade their happy butts outside your window to pick up the food. They are NOT running around in nature. This is not a wild kingdom voyeur site. It is a zoo!!!!! You will see the same big horned ox shaking his head back and forth. Save up your cash, learn another language and go to Africa. If the motherland is not in your near future, you could instead stay at a hotel closer to the action and do a day trip to the AKL and see the same animals that the $300 guys are seeing but closer. The animals do not come up to your window. There are metal devices that protrude towards the animals so they can not roam freely. Also if you decide to ignore my warning, watch out for the lip of the balcony sliding door in your room. Definite trip hazard. We had to lay a towel down on top of it so my daughter would not crack her skull. I will end on a good note. The bathroom had really cool African wall paper.

The consierge staff were very accomodating - we asked for a can opener and also a cork screw - they were in our room when we returned later in the day. They changed dinner reservations for us. They phoned a restaurant for us to find out what they had going for New Year's Eve and left us a message in our room, as we were on our way out to meet family and couldn't wait. They deleted a tip that I had added to a lunch bill (I didn't know that the tip had already been included). The housekeeping staff left plenty of towels. Every day they gave us shampoo, conditioner and soap. We didn't have a savannah room, but we saw animals everyday from our room. There are viewing areas around the hotel, but we didn't have to go to them as we saw animals daily. I went to the bar 1 evening and requested an empty wine glass, and tom collins glass to take back to our room, not a problem. There didn't seem to be as many small children at this resort. The rest of our family were staying at the Polyenisian Resort. (10 of them). Hubby and I don't have kids, so the travel agent suggested AKL for us. Keep in mind that it is the furthest away from the Magic Kingdom. We ate dinner at Boma the first night. Excellent. African buffet. Would highly recommend it. (My parents have travelled to Africa, they came over to Boma themselves 1 evening and said it was what they remembered from Aftrica. We got breakfast from Mara 1 morning, otherwise we ate our breakfast's elsewhere (just out of convience). The decor of the hotel again was African. Amazing decorations, pictures, the music, carpeting... right down to the bedspreads, and vent covers in the hall ways. The staff dressed in African costume as well. All staff (valet, consierge, housekeepers, and the animal keepers, bartenders etc...) Lovely. All staff were helpful, polite and friendly. Can't say enought about any of the Disney staff. All wonderful. I am going to write a review on Walt Disney Workd itself - as I can't say enough about it. I only have 1 negative thing to say, and it's about the dining time. If you want a relaxed sit down and enjoy meal (1 1/2 to 2 hours in length) you've got to book signature dining that's the 3 $$$'s. Otherwise, it's all about turning the tables and you're in and out in no time. If you're with kids I guess that's expected. I myself would go back to the AKL.

We were extremely excited for the trip as it was our first to Disney in seven years -- and because of the promotional videos and pictures we saw about the Animal Kingdom Lodge. While the hotel is gorgeous, it was not worth the price or the hype. A striking lobby means nothing when you wait in line for 30-45 minutes for a concierge, have a room with two drawers for a family of four, and towels that would barely wrap around a 6-year-old, let alone a normal-sized adult. We found most of the staff to be \"in training.\" I needed tickets that I had pre-purchased for Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party, and was directed by Disney to simply visit our hotel concierge, who could print out the tickets for us. The concierge at AKL took 20 minutes with me, continually asking me to be patient as he was trying to figure it out, and I walked away WITHOUT TICKETS. He couldn't figure it out and didn't have anyone to help him. When I went back to get the tickets later, I waited in line for 45 minutes before I found a capable concierge to execute the task. If I'm paying more than $200 a night for a hotel, I'm expecting more than two drawers in my hotel room. Is that crazy? As a result of the scant storage room for clothes in the room, our room was cluttered and messy for the duration of the trip as we lived out of suitcases on suitcase stands in our rooms. The other big issue that I had with AKL was the bus system. While it's awesome that there are dedicated buses for AKL that preclude you from stopping at other hotels for pickup, the buses came every 15-20 minutes, and there was no system for bus boarding. While I appreciate Disney betting that the everyday human will be in good spirits on his/her vacation and therefore not have the nerve to board a bus before a load of people who waited the entire 15-minute duration, they underestimate the gall of many, many a guest. I cannot tell you how many times we'd get to the bus stop and be the first to wait for a bus, only to watch someone stroll up right as the bus arrived and right in front of us as we loaded our small children. Disney is asking for Tyson-like fights to erupt with this \"every Mouse for himself\" system. Everyone channels their inner Grumpy as they board (and often, stand on a moving bus for the 15 minute ride to the parks). AKL is an investment. And when you make an investment in a nice hotel, you expect a return. AKL was a losing investment for us. Check out Port Orleans, Key West, Saratoga or any of the economy resorts. There ALWAYS seemed to be buses for them waiting outside the parks!

We had actually booked 2 rooms for 6 adults the the Caribbean Beach resort, but they had overbooked the Value resorts so we got bumped to the Animal Kingdom lodge, while the other Value guests were bumped to the Caribbean Resort. Not only that but when we checked in we weren't exactly ecstatic about the view of the parking lot so they bumped us up to a Savannah View room on Kudu Trail. It was quite the hike to our room, but really is absolutely NO different than staying at any of the Deluxe Resorts. At least at this resort you are attached inside. Also, our room faced the construction that is going on where they are building the Villas, and honestly IT DID NOT BOTHER US AT ALL. And it certainly did not bother the animals, there was always a giraffe or Zebra hanging out right in front of the balcony. People complaining that the rooms and resort are dark may not be aware that this is actually done on purpose for the animals for their benefit and ours! It also so we can see the nocturnal animals who come out night. The resort also has night vision so you can see them around the resort! After hearing complaints about the bus service here, I didn't find that we waited longer than at any other resort. The most we waited was 20 minutes and this was near the end of the night when they weren't running as frequently. The housekeeping was the only small complaint. And I mean small. It wasn't as thorough as at the Polynesian, but the beds were made and everything was replenished. Mara, the quick service restaurant was wonderful for a quick bite with Burgers, Chicken Tenders, Wraps, Sandwiches, Roast Chicken and African Stew. We used the Dining Plan which I strongly recommend, it is a great deal and saves the hassle of worrying about food all the time. The staff is really friendly! The lady who works at the bar near the pool is awesome, she remembered all our names every day. It was just that little extra Disney attitude that really makes the trip amazing. I witnessed some picky and rude customers complaining to the concierge one morning and I can't believe how well they handled them, honestly I would not have been so pleasant... Advice: ~ Request any of the rooms on Giraffe or Kudu Trail, each side faces a Savannah. We looked the opposite direction of the main inner Savannah and had more animals than the main one almost all of the time ~We found that it wasn't really necessary to reserve breakfast at Boma as long as you were there before 8:00. The buffet at breakfast is amazing. ~EAT AT JIKO. We ate at Narcoosees, California Grill, Ohana's and The Brown Derby and this restaurant had the best atmosphere and menu. Not to mention our server was above and beyond with the wine list knowledge. This will most likely require reservations in advance. ~We recommend making your room requests when you book your trip but then call again a few days before you arrive. They will usually know when you are gonna be and then they can perhaps make adjustments before you get there. ~Just ask. They will go out of their way to assist you. We were a forgetful bunch and lost jewelry, a wallet, Key card and sunglasses and all were either returned to us or are being shipped home free of charge.

We were checked in by Carlos after arriving early (12:30pm) and he not only got us into a room right away, but he had upgraded us to a Sunset Savannah room (one of the 3280s). We had gotten an amazing rate as a Disney Passholder (159 per night). The room was GREAT (not small like everyone states on here). We had an amazing view of giraffes, zebra, antelope, ostrich, and other animals on the \"Sunset Savannah\". There was construction going on across the way but it didn't bother us. We did not eat in the hotel restaurants...Jiko was too pricey and Boma had disappointed me once previously. We did eat at the counter service MARA and that was fine. Pool and whirlpools were amazing, as were the \"night vision\" goggles to watch to animals at night! One thing the reviews have pegged right, the Disney Bus transportation was AWFUL. This lodge is very far out and it often seemed like we were the lone waiters as scores of buses for the cheaper hotels passed by us. One driver even got lost on our way home from Magic Kingdom, and we were halfway up 192 at 11pm at night before he realized it. I definitely would NOT recommend staying here WITHOUT renting a car. Otherwise it was great...lobby was beautiful with Christmas decorations. I do wish they had food options available after midnight.

The afternoon offerings were a bit sparse but breakfast and evening hor d'overes were excellent. Loved having the espresso maker. The staff at concierge level were incredibly helpful and knowledgable. They were also friendly and professional, contrary to many reviews I have read. I would encourage any who stay at concierge level to take advantage of the Sunrise Safari. It was one of the trip higlights. The cast share so much information and lots of time to observe all of the many animals - just wonderful. ROOM - we stayed in RM 4503, on the Zebra Trail. It was a bit of a walk but nothing compared to other Disney resorts we have stayed at. The room itself accomodated three adult women with all of our luggage and shopping, with ample room. Wehad a lovely savannah view and observed many animals over the course of our stay, particularly in the morning. The room itself was kept very clean and staff left us towel animals which was good fun and a nice added touch. Turn down service and room ammenities also above par. HOTEL - loved the lobby and the amazing drumming we frequently heard. The theming is outstanding and many artifacts on display. Had supper at Boma which although good was not worth the price - wished we would have gone to Jiko instead. The pool area was great, with a huge pool, and excellent service from the pool side lounge. Loved the gift shop and the staff again professional and helpful. We had a car so only had to use Disney transit once but then had only a short wait.

If you are interested in the African theme, this is a great place to stay. It is unique and something you won't find anywhere in the US. Veiwing animals is okay, some zebra, watusi cows, maybe a gazelle or impala, possibly a giraffe or two in the distance. Pros: b/c it is farther away from Magic Kingdom it is not nearly as chaotic in the Lobby, and lounges etc. as Polynesian and the others. It was a welcomed break after a day of crowds. Incredible themed decor Many activities for children to do if you are not going to a park Nice pool view from the Zebra trail rooms, 4th floor. Great overlook areas, including public balconies with rocking chairs for a quiet and relaxing evening. They were never occupied whenever we used them. Good food at Boma, did not eat at Jiko. I'd save your money if you are dining with kids and choose Boma. $25 for some sweets, a few chicken nuggets, and one or two other items seems a bit much. Take a water taxi to the Grand Floridian or Polynesian instead for some variety, and a free boat ride the kids might enjoy. Cons: Rooms are small, I would guess they are 2-3 ft shorter in width than a typical Marriott room. Limited to the property for restaurant choices, but then again, if you are hitting the parks, that may not matter anyway. Shuttles needed, even to Animal Kingdom Park - (we never waited more than 10 minutes for a shuttle. $20 cab ride to the Grand Floridian) Other: If you want a Savannah room, know that the Lodge is not physically connected to Animal Kingdom Park.

Room was average (#1028) with pool view on the 1st floor down a quite hallway. While the room was small, it was not as small as I had expected. Reviewers saying the rooms were as small as those in Europe must have been in tiny-tiny rooms. I have been in rooms in the U.K. that are much smaller and higher priced for example. So yes, the room was a bit small but we had plenty of room for the 6yr old twins and all our bags. Housekeeping left a lot to be desired and we did tip $5 per day. On some days, we found the \"mouse\"keeper had not taken the tip and this was a bit odd. We had zero towel animals - VERY disappointing as my twins were hoping for some.

We booked a savannah view room w/ bunkbeds. I knew the hotel was out of the way, but my youngest daughter is obsessed with giraffes so we thought we'd stay at AK so she could wake up, look out the window and see giraffes. The rooms are very small compared to the GF. Although, the bunkbeds were a bit hit with the kids and they do have rails all the way around on the top bed. Housekeeping was a bit of a disappointment. After check-in we went to our room and found a pair of dirty mens underwear behind the bathroom door...how housekeeping could have missed it is beyond me. We were there for 5 days and not once did housekeeping make anything with the towels, even though we left generous tips each day. The view, the main reason we stayed here, was not worth the money. The first 24 hours all we saw were birds. We then saw some gazelles and random animals, but never saw a zebra and only saw 2 giraffes far off in the distance. The thought that you will open your curtains and see animals in close proximity is just not accurate, at least not in the 5 days we were there. We tried early morning, during the day, dusk, before bedtime. They were never that close. You see more animals at a much closer range on the safari at Animal Kindgom (a giraffe was licking a passenger in our jeep!), so just do that and skip the Animal Kingdom Lodge. As far as food - Jaiko is a great Disney restaurant - better than Citricos and Narcoosee at GF. Even if you don't stay at AK Lodge, I would recommend going to Jaiko for a meal. We did the breakfast buffet at Boma each morning and we were disappointed. Very expensive for what it was and much preferred eating breakfast at the Grand Floridan Cafe at GF. Last but not least bus service - yes it's true we never waited more than 20 minutes for a bus, but sometimes there were so many people waiting you couldn't get on and then had to wait again for the next bus. What we loved about GF is you had the monorail & the boat launch to MK, making it very easy to get back and forth. With kids our age, MK is where you'll be spending most of your time. For the price, I would just stay at GF. As a side note, we did the Magical Express to the hotel and it was two hours from landing at Orlando to arriving at the hotel.

After reserving and paying the premium six months in advance to get a savannah room where we could view the wild animals from our balcony, we got a view of an outside stairwell and a fenced in area where guests go in case of fire. You needed a telescope to see any animals. Apparently if you can see one blade of grass, that's a savannah room. When we asked to change rooms, we got no help. There are animal viewing areas around the hotel but you have to hunt for them and the animals may or may not be there when you want to see them. We had good luck around 4 in the afternoon when there was some feeding but they post no feeding schedule so it's just luck. If you want to see the animals, a better bet is to stay at a nearby hotel on International Drive and buy your Disney ticket, then take the free resort shuttle to the Safari Lodge and watch them from the public areas. It will cost you $300 less per night for the same views as the guests get. If you stay at the lodge, the third floor hallway sounds like a herd of stampeding elephants all day and night so if you do decide to go, avoid rooms there like the plague. The room itself was large enough and clean, but poorly lighted. The TV remote control barely worked and the TV itself would cut off unexpectedly. Incredibly the hotel has no wi-fi, only a phone line connection that was so slow I could not access my email and cost $9.95 per day. For 400 bucks a night, you'd think they could afford free wi-fi. Even the family hotels in Paris had free wi-fi as did $60 a night hotels around Disney. Staff was friendly, but I have some doubt they even knew their own names. When I asked for the location of the buses to theme parks, the guy at the desk had to go look for them, saying he had no idea. Even worse, neither the concierge nor anyone else knew the times of the various special events at the theme parks. These holiday parades and fireworks shows occur at the same time every day, but to find out when, you had to take the bus to each park and pick up their schedule. How hard can it be to deliver a schedule to the concierge desk by email every day so guests know when the special events are going to be? A stack of schedules so guests could have one would be nice, but at least they should have one so the concierge knew what was going and can answer questions. Or even better, put a sign in the lobby.

Well, we didn't get the adjoining rooms. I know they can't honor all the requests but, the hotel wasn't booked to capacity and I asked 11 months prior. We DID NOT get savanna view rooms. I didn't think it was worth the $$$$. We wouldn't be spending too much time in the rooms so why pay the extra money? When we checked in, the woman was unapologetic and told us we could have adjoining rooms if we upgraded to Consierge Level (of course, we'd have to pay for the upgrade). No thanks. She told us we didn't have adjoining rooms b/c of the construction going on. The rooms were fine. Nicely decorated. The pack and play was in the closet, as requested. We just had to call down to the desk and have someone come up and remove the table and chairs so we could have a spot to set up the pack and play. The man came up in less than 5 minutes and was in and out very quickly. We had a pool view room. We couldn't see the pool at all because of all the foliage. No biggie since we were only in the room late at night putting the kids to bed and early in the morning when we were getting ready to head out. We walked to the viewing spots twice a day. We could see most of the animals but they were @ quite a distance away. My kids couldnt' even spot them. I'm REALLY glad I didn't get a Savanna view room. Even one of the employees told us that it's hit or miss if you get one of those rooms. We did go to Boma twice. Once for dinner and once for brunch. It was fantastic. Great service and great food. We utilized the hotel service to check our bags and get our boarding passes on our last morning. What a time saver that was. We were able to board the Magical Express back to the airport with all the kids without having to worry about all the luggage. Speaking of busses, we used the Disney bus service to get to and from the parks. We didn't have one single problem. We had a very minimal wait for the busses...never more than 5 minutes. The furthest bus ride was to Downtown Disney, I think. It was a solid 15-20 minute bus ride. All the other parks were relatively close and no more than a 5-10 minute ride. The kids are at an age that they think busses are fantastic so it was like another attraction for them! So, all in all, I liked the AKL but for the money I had to spend to stay there....I wouldn't stay there again. It was expensive and the animal viewing was hit or miss, like I said. It was nice to stay there that one time to try it out.

I'm going to stick to facts initially, then give some opinions at closing. The Room: Is simply overpriced. Your view is hit or miss. Our first room had no view, we asked to be moved and our second room had a partial Savannah view. The room is small and only different from a holiday inn due to nicer furniture. There is nothing about the room that makes it stand out to the caliber I expect from staying at Disney Property. None of the little things that similarly priced hotels go out of their way to provide. The Resort Is nice overall. We saw some animals, the lobby is well done with plenty of detail. Most of the property is impressive inside. The exterior is \"OK\". I did not get the feel I was in a \"Savannah\". And honestly that supposed to be the draw. The Staff: This is most disappointing. Disney take note. Another hit or miss. I expect 5 star service at a Disney Resort. Not here. They ranked from \"above average\" to \"apathetic\". The Pool: Nice, plenty of lifeguards, and nice slide if your have kids. The Gym: Above average. The treads are great but the rest of the cardio is outdated and in need of repair or just updating. Those steppers are 20 year old 1st generation steppers. The free weights and strength equipment is just right. Those who shined and meet what I expected to be Disney standards: The security guard at the front gate was a short older guy always in a good mood and made a great impression. He was the only person that gave me that Disney feel. The valet service was terrific. ....That's it. Tips: Get a room close to the lobby unless you like to walk alot. There are lots of kids running around and the rooms are not sound proof. There is some construction going on so beware where they room you.

This year we decided to invite my mom and her husband to come down for 8 days with us. They had been down to Disney a couple times in the past few years as well, so everyone pretty well knew what to expect. The other two times my wife and I stayed at the Port Orleans Riverside (which was a decent place to stay - here's a link to my review http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d125310-r6343413-Disney_s_Port_Orleans_Resort_Riverside-Orlando_Florida.html) and at the Polynesian (which was amazing, here's a link to my review http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d85990-r10320339-Disney_s_Polynesian_Resort-Orlando_Florida.html). My parents stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge the last time they went down and fell in love with it, so despite our desire to stay at a resort with a monorail stop, we booked pool view connecting rooms at AKL. When we checked in we were given the keys to our rooms on the pool level and were told they connected. We went to our rooms; however, the rooms didn't connect. This really wasn't that big of a deal for us, but decided to ask the front desk if we could get connecting rooms. The front desk was very polite and helpful. They said that they didn't have any connecting rooms by the pool, but said they could get us connecting rooms in a couple savannah view rooms with no extra charge - free upgrade! We jumped at the opportunity because we actually wanted a savannah view anyhow, just didn't want to spend that much. Our rooms were very clean and new (see pictures), although a little smaller than the Polynesian rooms. But, the view was outstanding! Every morning, each time we returned to our room during the day, and each night there were all kinds of animals right outside of our balcony to watch, including giraffes and zebras! It would have been worth it to pay the extra for the view anyhow! We didn't use the pool while we were there, used the counter service restaurant once (which was clean and nice for a quick lunch), and bought a couple of necessities at the store/ gift shop (which was also clean and neat). Also, if you are buying souvenirs in the parks I highly recommend taking advantage of the free delivery service - you items are sent to your hotel's gift shop for pick up the next day or so. Really nice not to have to carry anything around the parks! The only real downsides that we saw to the AKL were the lack of monorail and the distance away from all of the other parks besides AK. My wife and I try to spend as much time in the parks each day and having your resort close by with a monorail stop is very handy. Our average bus wait at AKL was around 20-25 minutes, and on one occasion when we had a tour booked that we had to be on time for we waited for the bus for close to an hour, then the bus broke down on the way there and we had to get on to another in the middle of the road! LOL! But, because we planned for enough time, we still just barely made it in time for our tour (Keys of the Kingdom - highly recommend for adults! No Children because they show you the \"back stage\" of Disney. So, all in all, the hotel was very clean and well appointed. The only real downside for us was the lack of a monorail stop. I would recommend this resort for older adults without children who don't mind a casual pace and enjoy watching animals while they have their morning coffee. The next time my wife and I stay on property we'll probably either stay at the Polynesian again, or give the Grand Floridian a try - both have the monorail stops, but the Polynesian is also within easy walking distance to the Transportation and Ticket Center, which is real handy for hopping a monorail to Epcot. Although we still had way too much food on the dining plan, I was disappointed to find out that gratuity and appetizers for table service meals are no longer included with the standard plan. We weren't really that disappointed that appetizers weren't included, but having the gratuity included was very nice because we didn't have to carry any cash with us in the parks. It would also be nice if you could swap a dessert for an appetizer. The meal plan is still worth it though. The last point I'll make is that each year we go down in October not only for our anniversary, but also for the Food and Wine Festival at Epcot! We are never disappointed with the booths set up from all kinds of countries serving their local food and alcohol. And, this year, we stuck around for a couple free concerts at the American Pavilion where we saw Starship (Jefferson Airplane, Jefferson Starship)! Awesome show!

For us the visit breaks down into two experiences; the hotel and the centres. We enjoyed all the parks and found the travel facilities between each of them first class and easy to follow. Each centre could easily be a holiday in itself and to experience them all you really need to be on the move the whole time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fast passes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will help you to plan your day, but it is only possible to use them for one attraction at a time. Whilst some of the rides are scary and you need to think before using them, there are plenty of gentle features for all ages. Within every centre there are plenty of places to relax and watch the world go by and to buy refreshments. Whilst there are good facilities for disabled travellers, we were disappointed to find many overweight people hiring electric scooters in the parks and receiving preferential treatment that should only be reserved genuine disabled guests. Some exercise would be more beneficial for them and the scooters be reserved for disabled people who need them. Whilst we had a great holiday, we were not so happy with the hotel and probably would not stay there again. The bedrooms were excellent and serviced daily to a high standard; however, we saw a total of five animals from our room, in contrast to what the advertising promises. The main problem for us was the dining and the delays in waiting for a table. When you book a table for dinner it is reasonable to accept that you will get it, but we quickly learned that in fact you reserve a place in the queue and have to wait for a table, we waited between 20 and 40 minutes each time we used the restaurant. Further long delays were experienced at reception where queues were the norm. This resulted in us dining elsewhere in the evening and never had the same problem. The cost of everything at Disney is high and visitors need to be ready for prices that they will probably not experience elsewhere.

Everyday, plenty of fresh towels, etc. There are major building works going on on the resort. Its an eyesore, but not too disruptive. I did not notice any overbearing noise.

The wait for the bus to and from the parks was unbearable in the heat. particularly when you were ready to leave the parks mid day or late in the afternoon. In the end, I rented a car and paid $12 a day to park my own car at the theme parks. The biggest frustration, however, was not being able to get a reservation in the main restaurant for dinner. I was able to get a reservation late in the evening in the more pricey (about double the price) restaurant which too late with a young one. I resorted to the self service restaurant or room service until I checked out.

I had never been to Disney before, and my husband hadn't been since he was a kid. We only have one son, who is six, and we wanted this to be a special week for him. When looking for a hotel, I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of information and choices available. When we finally settle on Animal Kingdom we felt that it was a dream hotel for us- although a little pricey for what we are used to. We booked the hotel for a week, and compromised by paying for the basic view. By the time our vacation arrived, I was sure that the hotel would not live up to our overblown expectations. My biggest fear would be that it would be loud, dirty, and the staff would be rude. Nothing could have been further from the truth. When we arrived in Orlando we took the Magical Express to the hotel. This process went very smoothly and it was actually an enjoyable part of our first day. We pulled up to the hotel and could smell wood burning from the fire pit. Check in was quick and easy and SURPRISE we were upgraded to a Savannah view room which connected to my in-law's room. This made such a difference and when we got to the room and pulled back the shades we had giraffe eating right outside our balcony! Throughout the entire week we saw such awesome animal events (wildebeasts chasing antelope, giraffe galloping across the savannah...) and truly felt that if we didn't leave the hotel the entire week we would have still been happy. However, when we did leave the transportation was phenomenal. Perhaps it was because we were there in October, but we never had to wait for a bus- even when we left the Magic Kingdom on night during a thunderstorm. Also, because Animal Kingdom is away from the rest of the resorts, the bus only went to the lodge and did not stop at any other resorts along the way. The buses were never crowed- many times we were the only family on the bus! We ate twice at Boma and had a fantastic experience both times. We also found the staff to be extremely professional and polite...even our housekeeper went above and beyond and left towel animals everyday- my son would write notes back to her and tell her how much he loved them!

Therefore its hard to be critical. However I will review it as if we paid for it. The hotel itself is magnificent. The lobby is spectacular and they have done a great job making you feel like you have just started an African safari. The pool is nice, maybe too warm after walking around the parks all day. We ate at 2 restaurants which were both great and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. I asked if we could get a complimentary upgrade to a savanah view room as we had booked a standard room. The clerk asked if we would be willing to spend $60 per night to upgrade and I said I was more or less looking for a favour and would keep the room originally booked if the upgrade couldn't be done. After 10 minutes in the back office she came out to say they there were no complimentary upgrades available. OK. So we arrived to a room on the 3rd floor which had a view of the employee parking lot. Disappointed but hey, we kept telling ourselves it was free. After a day at the park we returned to basically realize there hardly room to open our luggage. The rooms are nice but very small. We had luggage on our table, on the cabinet above the TV in the closet on the floor. With 2 queen beds, there is essentially 2 feet of space to walk around them. Its a tight fit for four people. I called the desk to see if there were any bigger rooms available and was promptly told that all 1000 rooms were exactly the same. I doubt it. Even though it might have seemed like a ploy, the following morning our coffee maker and built in fridge and the area around it were covered with ants. For every 10 I killed, another 20 would show up. I alerted the desk and they offered to spray and or move us to a different room. We switched rooms and ended up with a partial savanah view and had a wonderful view of giraffes and zebras and other assorted animals. The new room also had bunk beds which provided a little more floor space. We were in a much better mood at this point. The toilet and shower and in a different room than the sinks which is convenient if several people are trying to get ready for the day at the same time. The cafeteria is just as good as the buffet restaurant so don't stress if you can't get a reservation. The store in the hotel is handy but like with every other Disney store, it is overpriced.

The lobby is gorgeous. Fine art! At Disney! The place has a very good \"vibe\".

The Coffee was surprisingly good! So were the African wines we tried. Our favorite part was the African story telling bonfire at sunset! Pool wass a little small (and COLD). I would absolutely recomend this hotel. Our main complaint, besides no visible recycling program, is that the \"African\" items in the gift shop are mostly Made in China and Asia, not Africa. Hey Disney, if you are going to build a whole hotel with an African theme, and profit from Africa's rich culture and history, don't you think it's fair to at least carry authentic African gifts? You buy genuine African wine, why not genuine African drums??? Had I seen African Fair Trade items I would have bought them, but didn't buy as we would have been embarrassed to give somebody an African drum or something stamped MADE IN CHINA (especially at $15 a pop for stuff you see at Pier One for $3). They had a few African items, but only a few. What gives Walt? The Animal Kingdom park is great, don't miss A BUGS LIFE and the Himalaya rollercoaster!!! BIG disapointment: we found the \"Rainforest Caf\"e a laughable disgrace, food service nightmare, nothing Eco Friendly, Recycled, Organic or Shade Grown about it. Actually HORRIBLE food too. No better than the Frozen junk I nuke at home for the kids. Our 6 year olds thought the gift shop was fun, but again, MADE IN CHINA. Tell me: just HOW does a fake plastic frog fit into the rainforest eco system? We would ask the Rainforest Cafe the same question as Disney: If your gimmick is the Rainforest, how about some respect for the Rainforest? Shouldn't you not EXPLOIT the rainforest? When we asked for Shade Grown coffee our server told us that we should be fine with the maxwell house.

I would recommend this hotel whole heartedly and we would return as a family without any hesitations. The only advice I would give would be that it is definately worth signing up for the Disney Dining Plan and also get a list of restaurants on Disney property and book meals in advance, as we found that we couldn't get a decent meal anywhere as the Americans book tables about 6 months in advance and over our 2 week stay we only managed to get one booking that we requested. You can only eat so many burgers, pizzas, hotdogs etc. We also has a Savannagh room and this was superb, the kids loved opening the curtains every morning to see which animals were waiting.

The pool is good for all ages and well supervised, but does get busy in the afternoon. My only criticism is based around the food, there is no doubt it is quite expensive and does not vary much. There are three restaurants, the flag ship restaurant Jiko is excellent and should be visited, Boma is an African themed all you can eat buffet style restaurant and if you have a large appetite this may be good value but you will be eating the same every night. Finally there is the cafe style Mara, very popular with jet lagged europeans for breakfast as it opens at 6.00am, the food is simpler but good and can be eaten outside.

To get to The Mara (the quick service option) from the lobby area of the hotel, you have to go down to the check in area for Boma & Jiko to exit which during crowded times can be tough to naviagate.

I booked this trip fifteen months ago & reckon we were looking forward to it more than our two children aged seven and four. The lobby is amazing. The scale is fantastic & there is so much to look at. Check-in was relatively easy although our room was not ready when we arrived. This was not a problem as our bags were stored for us, allowing us to get on the bus to Animal Kingdom Park. By 1230 we were eating in the Rainforest Cafe. Having driven daily to Disney from hotel number one at the bottom of I-Drive, it was just so nice for Disney to take the strain, especially when we returned from the SpectroMagic Parade & fireworks late at night. No boats or monorails were required! We were able to establish our room number via Guest services, handy as I was running low on mobile credit. Our room had a Savannah view & our children were constantly on the balcony looking at the animals. Admittedly, it was a hike to our room which was on the same level as Reception. Our son loved the Night Vision sessions run by the experts in the hotel. He was also delighted to use the pool, something we had not found time for in the first week at hotel one, being so busy at all the parks. We ate at Jiko on our first night there as a bit of a treat for our anniversary. The food was delicious and the service attentive. Thanks to the strength of Sterling against the Dollar it did not seem overly pricey at all. They didn't bat an eyelid as our daughter sparked out on two chairs pushed together. We breakfasted at Boma once quite early just to have the Big Breakfast experience. That was very tasty and again the service was smashing. I was impressed that Disney does provide food at prices to suit all pockets. I also noticed that healthy food is now heavily promoted, unlike on our last visit nine years ago. The Mara provides quality fare at value for money prices. On our last day we chose to spend the day at Typhoon Lagoon rather than rush off to St Pete's. Checkout was a breeze-no need to visit the front desk. Our bags were then stored for us until we came back from the park in the late afternoon. During our stay we clocked quite a few non residents who had clearly come for a nosy. All those I could hear were impressed with what they found. The room was themed to a high standard, although we did find it a bit small for four after having a suite.We had two weeks' stuff with us, so didn't bother to unpack for just three days.

She also set them out one day for a pool party on the bed, and one day we found them all (and daughters cuddly toys) around the remote control watching TV...nice touches).

We stayed 3 nights at the Contemporary Resort, and the last 2 nights of our stay was at the Animal Kingdom lodge. First, let me say that the Animal Kingdom lodge is more expensive than the Contemporary. We changed hotels because we wanted to see the animals and experience the resort. We were surprised that the Animal Kingdom Lodge's rooms were VERY small next to the comtemporary. Not only that, but the decorations and furnishings looked a bit shoddy when compared to the contemporary. Internet service was supplied by a free inroom computer at the contemporary. At Animal Kingdom Lodge, you needed to have your own computer, plus pay about $10 a day. After the initial disappointment with the size and looks of our room, we decided to check out the animals from our safari view window. There were 2 ducks and an ox. That was it. Each morning we woke to find vultures in our field of view, and nothing else. There was a brief period of time when a few giraffes came into view. That lasted about 20 minutes out of our entire stay. We found out that a bird had nested mid field that kept most of the animals away from our viewing area. I know these things can't be helped, but we felt that we should not have been charged the extra money for a safari view room when a nesting bird was keeping most of the animals away. We did love the lobby. And the fast food court by the pool. The pool itself was very nifty as it resembled a pond. There was something strange about the inpool lighting which made the water always appear as though it was a pond. Skip Bomas. The food was good enough, but they have the carving station in the middle of the buffet, which really slows things down. The wait to go through line was about 20 minutes. We believe that this could have been intentional so that people wouldn't get a 2nd plate full. Cost of the buffet was high for only one pass through the line. An 18% tip was automatically added to our bill. High for a buffet. My suggestion: visit the hotel. Check out the lobby and the gift shop. Eat at the food court (interesting food!).

We had never stayed there before, but we were very happy we did. We had 3 generations staying in our 2BR lockoff. It was our 2 year old son and 6 month old daughter's 1st WDW trip. Our room overlooked the savanna and my son would have been happy just sitting on the deck watching the animals. Every morning he would go on the deck and have his breakfast and end the day on the deck as well. Yes, our room overlooked the new Kidani Village being built, and yes there was some noise early in the morning, but when we spoke to the manager they were more than willing to make up for it. (in typical Disney fashion!) In fact, my son LOVED the fact he got to see animals AND bulldozers! There were only 2 drawbacks - 1 being that the hotel is only accessed through the lobby and when you are all the way out, it is quite a walk-BUT, a nice CM told us of a better & easier route to go. The 2nd was that I wish there were trails you could walk around. Maybe once Kidani Village is built, there will be. All in all, I would highly recommend AKL. The CM's are great, the food is awesome (especially on the food plan!) and the pool, fitness center and accommodations were typical Disney. BTW don't let the thought of \"African\" food scare you from Boma. I thought I would hate it, but I absolutely loved it! In fact, we went there 2x. The transportation system worked flawlessly as well and there were no long waits. BIGGEST TIPS- Take advantage of the free activities for the kids and adults. Also, MAKE RESERVATIONS FOR DINNER! Do not leave the dinners up to chance. We had a real hard time getting reservations at any restaurants the day of. AND DO THE DINING PLAN! (the basic is more than enough for anyone!)

We had never stayed at a true Disney resort before, so we thought we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay here for a night to treat the kids to a true \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDisney resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience. We had looked at the Contemporary, Polynesian, Grand Floridian, etc., and I have to say that the AK Lodge is a much nicer looking resort. The main building is a great site to see. We were a little disappointed at the lack of viewable animals in the Savannah and Outlook viewing areas. A few giraffes, a couple of zebras, some random African cows, birds, etc., but nothing like what we were expecting after seeing resort pics online. Our room with 2 queen beds was nice, and while we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay a lot of extra money for a balcony with a great view, we could still see part of the pool area nearby. In general, our room was clean; however, there was a massive bloodstain on the sheets of one of the beds that couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been missed by housekeeping when they changed the sheets. Also, there was a beetle (or some other bug) that had been crushed into the netting above the other bed. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice it until later in the evening, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there before we checked in to the resort, but either way, it caused our kids (who slept in that bed instead of the one with the bloodstain) some anxiety until they fell asleep. We had breakfast the next morning at the Boma buffet, which was a fantastic meal with plenty of different selections for the entire family. All of the resort staff were helpful, and having the ability to check our airline luggage at the resort instead of having to take it all with us to the airport was nice as well. Our only other complaint had to do with the free Disney shuttle service, which of course had nothing to do with the AK Lodge themselves. Trying to get to Epcot, we hopped a shuttle bus displaying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEpcot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on the front. Instead of going there, it went to Blizzard Beach and then to Hollywood Studios. We asked the driver when he was going to Epcot, and he said that he first had to go back to the Lodge and then would be going to Epcot. After leaving Hollywood Studios, he drove back to Blizzard Beach and then to the Lodge before finally going to Epcot. What should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been a 10-minute ride lasted almost an hour. I will say, however, that the shuttle ride back to the Lodge was much better. My advice on this topic is that if you take a shuttle, be sure to ask the driver where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going b/c what it says on the front of the bus isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always what the driver has pop up on his screen telling him which route to take. Our room without a view cost us $310 for the night. If this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like a lot to spend to you, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend this resort over some of the others that are even pricier. Otherwise, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d look into a timeshare, which is how we spent the first week of our vacation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and overall, was a more pleasant value than staying at this Disney resort.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Excellent Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "brandaniell", "ReviewID": "UR17002529", "Content": "We Stayed at the Animal Kingdom from June 11 -16.

I believe the negative reviews regarding this resort on this website are a bit misleading. There are some things you need to know before you book this hotel and some can be a deal breaker, but if plan ahead and ask the right questions (which you should) then you will be fine. I'll try to address all items one at a time. Hotel Atmosphere including lighitng: The hotel is wonderfully themed. It is a real treat to go from the theme of the parks to this resort which contrasts so nicely. The funiture, background music and adult feel make it a nice stay. The main areas of the hotel and hotel rooms are dark. This is a dark resort. It is meant to bring you the feel of sleeping in the wilds of Africa so the lighting is essential to the atmosphere. If you like lots of light stay elsewhere. Hotel Rooms Too Small: All hotel rooms are smal, but the AKL has some of the smallest. If you are traveling for an extended period of time or really require a lot of space then stay elsewhere. Bus Service: I have never had a problem with bus service at this resort, but I have at others I have stayed at. We have stayed at all the Deluxe resorts so I know. I think it's luck of the draw. Rude Staff: We have never come across this. I have stayed all levels (value, standard, savanah, deluxe savanah, pool, concierge) and all the check in's, check out's, requests, etc... have been made with a smile. Dinning Reservations: When you call central booking they tell you to make your priority seating arrangements months in advance. If you book a week before you come don't expect to get the resturant or time you like. Be smart! Disney is busy all year round. I can't stand when people complain about not getting reservations and then I come to find out they didn't plan correclty. GET A CLUE! No animals in the savanahs: Hit or miss. Sometimes they are loaded with animals other times there not. Too Adult: This is the main reason we like this resort. The adult feeling is nice aftering being in the kiddy parks all day. We love the bar and the fire pits. Long Walk to everything: Every booking we have done we have been told that there are long walks to and from places at this resort. This is true also at the Grand Floridian and Saratoga Springs. You can request rooms closer to the bus station, pool, etc... but they may not be able to honor that request. If you really feel that the walk will be too much don't book here. The wilderness lodge is around the same price and has shorter walks. Conclusion: We love this resort, but it suits our lives nicely. Like all speciality places you want to make sure it is the best fit for you . If you can't handle the items I listed above your better to stay at another resort.", "Date": "June 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cNice visit\u201d", "Author": "sjxray", "ReviewID": "UR16929458", "Content": "Just returned home from 5 nights at AKL.

We had a Savannah View room with a bunk bed and a Queen for my husband, my two daughters (ages 14 and 7) and me. While the decor was beautiful I have to say that the whole experience wasn't quite \"Disney\" enough for us. We don't expect...nor desire...there to be characters around at all times but there is a certain level of care that is expected when staying at a Disney resort. Especially one at this level. The rooms were a bit on the small side...and yes, they were too dark as many people have said before. I understand that you can't have light glaring out of the windows for the animals sake. Why, however, can't the bathrooms be better lit? They're nowhere near the animals. Both the sink area and the tub/toilet area were very dimly lit. We found housekeeping throughout the entire hotel to not be quite up to the standards that we had hoped for and seen in the past in other Disney resorts. Our room's housekeeping didn't really do much more than make the bed and change the towels. I don't believe the floors were ever vaccuumed, the ceiling fan needed dusting and we even had some left over debris from the previous guests. The lobby was guaranteed to have a glass or beer bottle left on one of the tables or African display cases. The attention to these little details from the staff seemed to be lacking. I also think the staff wasn't overly friendly. If approached with a question they were helpful but they didn't go out of their way to even say hello or see how you were doing. Other than the front desk and the animal staff, I don't think many of the others spoke English very well. Okay, all of this being said...the hotel was beautiful. Our room had wonderful views of giraffes, zebras, watusi, and other animals. My girls loved the pool and the slide. We ate often at The Mara and found their food to be tasty with adequate selections. My daughters and I loved the food at Boma (although it wasn't quite the cup of tea of my somewhat pickier husband!). The setup of the Boma buffet, however, I think needs some revision. I felt like everyone was tripping over each other and getting in the way of the servers when trying to wait in line to get their food. One of the lines is setup to go right in front of the entry to the kitchen where the waitstaff had to go with large trays. The entire restaurant had a somewhat crowded, dare I say chaotic, feel to it that I wouldn't exactly say made me feel relaxed. Part of the blame of this, though, needs to go to some of the patrons that were there the same night as us that pretty much let their children run wild. This wasn't the best place for this. The food there was slightly exotic and incredibly delicious. After all is said and done, would I stay here again? Probably not. Do I think everyone should try Animal Kingdom Lodge once in their life?

We were lucky enough to be able to book a savannah view room, which has a balcony that overlooks the lodge's manmade savannah. We're both animal lovers and nature enthusiasts, so we were very excited! We also frequently travel to Walt Disney World (we go about 3 times a year) and love it there. However, our stay at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge didn't go as well as we expected. Our first room (I'll explain why we changed rooms later) overlooked the Sunset Savannah, which was supposed to have giraffes and other African wildlife. All we saw were a kind of cattle that really wasn't too different than the common cattle you see in on an American farm. At least half of the savannah, if not more, was closed off due to construction. Most of our view was of cranes (not the animal-- the machinery!) and other building equipment. We were told that there would be some construction, but we were also told that the savannahs would not be affected. Again, the savannah was half closed off. I assume this is why the other kinds of animals were nowhere to be seen. We tried to make the best of it, but had a hard time sleeping our first night due to our air conditioning not working to it's potential. I usually like to keep the room around 68-70 degrees at night (my husband and I sleep better when it's cool) and couldn't get it lower than the mid 70's. With Florida's humidity, it felt much hotter, too. The hotel concierge was more than happy to move us the next day. I have a feeling they were used to people wanting to switch from the rooms with the construction view, because my husband barely uttered what the problem was before they offered to switch us. Our new room had a view of the Arusha Rock savannah, which really was breathtaking. We were happy to actually see animals like giraffes and zebra. We were also happy to be away from the construction. For two days, we often sat on our balcony, day and night, taking in the peaceful scenery. After those two days, we were not able to go onto our balcony due to a paper wasp infestation. I'm an entomology enthusiast and have worked in the field as an assistant, and believe me-- paper wasps are aggressive, even unprovoked. To top it off, my husband is allergic to bee and wasp stings. We called the front desk the minute we saw the wasps swarming and crawling all over our balcony, and they sent pest control. A man representing pest control came up after a few minutes and sprayed some Raid near the wasps. I knew that a little bit of Raid would never take care of the problem, and said so. The man assured me it would. Of course, the wasps did not die or leave and remained for the next 3 remaining nights of our stay. We coudln't even take video or pictures from behind our glass doors, because it ended up looking like something out of a 1950's sci-fi movie with unintentional close-ups of giant wasps. I know that it seems like this was a rare, unfortunate occurrence, and usually I would not completely blame the resort. However, upon checkout, after responding to how our stay was, two of the concierge staff cheerfully told us how they \"battle those wasps everyday\" at the resort. Not only was their pest control either incompetent or unequipped to deal with the problem, but the resort had had this problem before, and often! I asked how they usually dealt with it, since spraying a couple squirts of generic Raid could never fix the problem, but was answered in shrugs and \"I don't know\". We really didn't feel as if the staff cared how our stay was or about our safety. We were never offered another room after the first change or anything to compensate for all of the problems we had. We still were charged in full for a savannah view. Other than the problems we had, the grounds are pretty and interesting. The lobby, although intricate and detailed, is entirely too dark and a bit depressing. Another con is that the resort is pretty far away from everything but Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park. If you don't have a savannah view room, your only option for seeing the animals are the overlooks and after staying at the resort for six days, I can honestly say that it's kind of hit-or-miss that any animals will be in view. If you make an effort to go to the viewing areas at feeding time you'll almost definitely see animals, however. The animals are taken off of the savannahs for two hours everyday so that their habitat can be cleaned. Unfortunately, that time was when we woke up. I really think they should alternate what times they clean the savannahs so that people who wake up later than 8 or 9 AM can see them before they head out to the theme parks. The food at Mara, the quick service restaurant, is up to par with Disney's standards and was tasty. Boma, the hotel's buffet, was okay and offered a large variety of choices Most of the staff were cheerful and friendly. The pool is pretty and even has a slide. I really don't think my husband and I will be staying here again. If we could somehow be magically guaranteed that we wouldn't face the same problems or that said problems would be taken care of properly, perhaps we'd give it another try.

We got breakfast at the quick-service restaurant and were very impressed with the food. My favorite part of staying at Disney hotels is the airport check-in. We have a lot of luggage since we have a toddler and it's so nice to leave it at the hotel.

We were so excited pulling up to the hotel as the building looks amazing when you turn the corner and enter the grounds. At check-in the receptionist told us we had been allocated a room overlooking the car-park but as there was a room available overlooking the Impala Savannah we could have that if we didn't mind the construction work, we agreed. We got to our room which was nicely decorated and we did not find it too dark as other reviews have suggested. The receptionist had not really explained how much construction was going on and I was really disappointed with the view. The construction totally spoiled our view and throughout the stay the animals kept away from the area. A couple of times in the early evening when we had managed to get back, we did see a few animals and it was facinating to watch them so close. I love animals so for me it was a real treat, I just wish I could have seen them more often. Loved being able to swim in the pool/use the jacuzzi when we got back each night and often stayed until about midnight. The pool was a nice temperature and there were always towels available at the poolside. Went to use the night-vision goggles once and found that there are actually only one pair available. You have to queue and then have a quick look before passing them onto the next family. We ate at the Mara a couple of times and the food was really nice for a quick bite. Ate at Boma once for an evening meal and thought the food was delicious. However, did think the restaurant looked a little dirty with food, napkins on the floor and it felt rushed. The layout of the hotel was so confusing and we needed to go such a long way out of our way to get to the pool, that was the most annoying thing about the hotel. We had not been given any advice when checking in so there could have been a quicker way but we didn't find it. Was happy with the location of the hotel, it did not feel too remote as we had a car and used the buses to get to Disney. Never had to wait too long for a bus going to the parks but did have a 45min wait one night returning from MK. This is a real chore when you have been walking all day/night and your feet hurt standing for 10secs! Needed to get a taxi to Universal one evening and paid $40, on the way back though it only cost us $31 - we realised the next day that the driver there had taken us on a longer route. Check at the hotel booking station how much the journey should be before leaving. Though we enjoyed our holiday very much, I can't say the hotel played a very big part in that. Disney think that the theming is the the only thing they need to make the hotel a success. There was no 'magic' or extra special service to make you think 'Wow, this is what I paid for'. I think the bus service, charge card and package delivery service are really useful and for this I would book a Disney hotel again, just not this one.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGood to very good option for family\u201d", "Author": "vacationer71", "ReviewID": "UR16388502", "Content": "My family of four was at the Animal Kingdom Lodge for just under a week. We stayed, as ordinary hotel guests, in one of the \"Vacation Club\" suites -- ours overlooked the giraffe savanna -- with one comfortable but modestly-sized bedroom, one large bathroom, and a main area consisting of a sitting area with couch convertible to bed for the kids, a dining area, and a full kitchen. The value proposition here was about B+/A-. The rate was very expensive but for the space we got, it was pretty reasonable, particularly given that it was in an overall rate with a premium dining plan (a real necessity at Disney if one is to really enjoy it) and park ticket plan. The suite's fit and finish was a solid A- to A -- nicely done kitchen, very well done bathroom, and decent bedroom and living room furniture. I could see how people could use this space for longer-term stays. Housekeeping, room noise, appliance and fixture functionality, were all fine. The hotel was able to accommodate an engineering request that in my experience many hotels won't accommodate (moving a DVD player from the living room to the bedroom). The check-in and check- out experiences were wholly adequate. While we did not use the hotel's airport baggage pick-up and shuttle, we did use the system for on- hotel baggage check and shuttle back at the end of our stay, and it worked fine. We didn't use room service even once due to the confiscatory way that Disney prices room service on its dining plans. We greatly enjoyed the \"fine dining\" restaurant Jiko; it is one of the highlights of the entire Disney World dining offering (and we tried at least half of the top-rated restaurants during our stay). The \"Boma\" buffet restaurant had a perfectly competent breakfast, although I can't imagine paying cash for it -- terribly overpriced. We never tried Boma's lunch or dinner menu. The pool area is nicely done, but nothing special, as far as I'm concerned. You pay a real price in terms of convenience with the location. There were occasionally long waits and long walks to and from the AKL buses. There is no bus service whatever to the other resorts or non-theme park destinations other than Downtown Disney, which require a trip of one or two connections. People who enjoy golf, or dining at the other resorts, or are on a trip with people staying at other resorts, can easily encounter door-to-door trips exceeding one hour if using Disney transportation. We found ourselves using cabs quite often.

This time around we stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. The hotel was really cool in the African theme with dark woods. The lobby though kinda reminded me of a casino because it's so dark, ...but still very cool. Let me first say I love the Disney resorts. I'm an advocate to stay there to everyone I talk to that might be going to Disney. This is my 4th resort stay at Disney. I've been to Caribbean, Coronado (x2), and now Animal Kingdom. Here's the run down: 1) Animals: What you see on TV and the expectations really set the bar too high. There are animals there, but it's basically (as another reviewer said) a very small zoo. Most of the animals you can see are African cattle and flamingos. They do have a giraffe and a couple other cool animals, but that's about it at the resort. 2) Price: The price of what you get really wasn't worth it to me. Not only for the rooms / resort amenities, etc.. Rooms were much smaller than i expected. 3) Food / Cost of Food: Wow, if you come to Disney, be prepared to spend a lot on food. I've been to Disney about 3 times in the last 10 years. I never remembered having such an issue with Disney food. You'll be lucky to find a meal under $12 (even for breakfast) per person. Even at the Quick service restaurant, the Mara, a burger and fries will cost you $10 + another $2-3 for a drink. Which, by the way, the Mara has a decent selection but the food feel is definitely more toward a cafeteria. The buffet restaurant Boma was too expensive in my opinion. Dinner is $26 per person. The selection is pretty good, but $26 for a buffet? I think the breakfast buffet is $16. The pool bar was pretty good for drinks, although again a frozen rum drink will cost you $7.50 each. My brother and I went to the Victoria Falls \"bar\" to catch a baseball game one night and have a few drinks. They have a full bar but no beer on tap. Everything is bottled. 4) Pool: The pool I liked. It's concrete and has a very natural look & feel to it. It claims to be heated, but didn't really feel like it. There are 2 hot tubs hidden away around the pool which were always packed with people / kids. One cool thing about the pool is that it's open 24/7. 5) Bus rides: I really like the resorts because you can catch a bus to everywhere in Disney without the worry of a car or parking. But be aware that staying at Animal Kingdom lodge, you are the furtherest out from everything else at Disney. So unless you are going to Animal Kingdom park, you're at least 25 minutes away from everything. 6) Someone else said this as well, but the balcony is very small. There's basically two seats and a table and not much else for room. 7) Layout: Layout of the lobby and restaurants is kinda confusing. It's situated on about 2.5 floors and it's very easy to get turned around. 8) Desk service: I had a bad experience here x2. Our check in hostess basically told us nothing at check in. She would walk off to this back room and come back several times. Finally one trip she came back with keys. This was after playing on the computer for about 15 minutes. I think she might have said 2 words to us the whole time we stood there. It was disappointing because the folks checking in beside me had a great guy who gave a ton of great tips on getting around, the restaurants, some of the hotel features, etc.. Additionally, I had requested a fridge & microwave for our infant daughter. The fridge was there no problem, but we had asked about the microwave. I mentioned it to our check in hostess and she gave me no response. I asked her again and she nodded, but never really did anything about it. Someone else stepped up and said we'll check on that for you. Time goes by... no microwave shows up. So i head back down about 2 hours later and ask again. The desk attendant this time was very rude and didn't really listen. She kept explaining that standard rooms don't get microwaves. I told her 3 times that i understood and every time she said the same thing back to me. She picked up the phone to take a call like she was going about her business and was giving me that line once again. Feeling like she wasn't listening I turned around and walked off. 3 hours later, the microwave shows up... while my daughter had already gone down for the night. This wakes my daughter up and was a whole ordeal as you can imagine. 9) WiFi: Internet access costs $10 per day. Luckily i have a verizon card supplied by work, but i would think at the price paid for everything Disney could at least throw in wi-fi. 10) Magical Express: This was a nice service. We didn't have to get our bags at the airport. Disney folks got them and about 2 hours later they show up in our room. Different story going back though as it's sorta up to you to handle things. All in all it was a good stay, but i definitely won't go back to Animal Kingdom Lodge.

This was my first trip to Disney but I did get to visit most of the other hotels as I booked lots of other hotels for dining (something I would strongly suggest you research and book before you go to save being disappointed at eating quick service meals only), and have to say that AKL is a very impressive hotel on first impressions....However...I agree with a previous reviewer that it is just the same as 'a very small zoo' and once you have seen the animals, you have seen them. I was also not able to have a Savannah view room due to popularity, even though I had booked one and they wanted an extra $500 per night to be upgraded to a suite (which I declined). I soon got over my disappointment at not having a Savannah room and wasnt there enough to benefit from a savannah view room anyway. If you plan on sitting on your balcony all day every day then maybe you would!!! The food was a bit spicy for my husband but should have thought about that before booking an African themed hotel!! One person has commented on the colour of the pool water - it is supposed to look like that. It is supposed to be a tropical oasis so the floor is coloured green to give the impression of swimming in a lake or river. As above, if you want a proper sit down breakfast in the morning you will need to book Boma for every day to avoid disappointment as the walk in wait can be about 90 mins otherwise. Shop is quite big and sells all the little bits and bobs you forget like toothpaste and sun cream etc. Never had a problem getting a lounger by the pool. Even had waiter service by the pool. Try the blue glowtinis!!! Travelling around can be a bit time consuming by bus service as its so far away but after all...you are on holiday...whats the rush! I am not a snob but due to the price of the accommodation you do tend to get nice refined families there as opposed to the large families with screaming kids. Concierge services were all very good at reception. Very knowledgeable. Check in fairly fast and gave me all the information i needed. Room was cleaned daily. Towels and toiletries refreshed every day. House keeping very friendly. Came home one afternoon to find the tv on and the childrens bears propped up at the end of one of the beds with the remote control to look as if they had been watching tv whilst we were out. Very effective. My daughter loved it! Arline in the Mara very helpful to 1st time guests with dining plan. Lovely lady. Be nice to her she only gets 1 day off per week. Most of the staff are of African origin. Can sometimes be a bit of a language barrier but never had a problem that couldnt be resolved. Lifeguards at the pool all very vigilant. Several times saw one jump in to rescue little kiddies. Towels always stocked up and available at pool side (take these to water parks with you else you'll have to pay $1 for your towels there)...Life jackets in short supply by the pool side though. People seem to bag them in the morning and hide them next to their sun loungers even when their kids are not using them! Look out for the resident duck who has just had ducklings and takes them for a swim in the pool every morning! All in all lovely location, quiet and relaxing.

Obviously the animal kingdom park buses were plentiful as it takes 5 minutes to get there. 40 minutes to wait for Magic Kindgom Epcot and MGM was not necessary. By the time the buses arrived some people had to wait for another bus which could potentially have been another 20-40 minutes. One evening we waited at MGM for almost an hour while we watched 4 pop century buses come by to do pickups for that hotel before 1 came for us.

We wish we could have stayed longer but we were switching to another resort for my Mom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business trip the next day. Check-in was quick and painless and the staff was very helpful and friendly. We booked a Savannah view room with two queen beds. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what everyone is complaining about the rooms being too small, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the case. We had three adults sharing one room and we were perfectly fine. The room is nicely the themed and the beds were comfortable. We absolutely loved the Savannah view and the balcony. It was so peaceful and relaxing. It is worth it if you can reserve it. We went to the pool in the afternoon and we able to get a seat with no problem. This pool is a kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream because it has a waterslide but there is also a hot tub for the adults too. And a bar. The bartender we had was so friendly and quick. Frozen drinks by the pool are a must. Yes, the pool does look like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dirty but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really not, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s painted that way. Disney is all about themes and some people forget that. We had lunch and breakfast at the Mara, which is the quick-service restaurant. We had no problems with lines or waiting and we went at what most people would think would be busy times. Everything at Disney is expensive, but eating at quick service restaurants can save money in the long run. For dinner that night we ate at Jiko. You must go here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wonderful. We all had a really great experience eating here and the food was terrific. Definitely make a reservation (or as Disney calls it, a priority seating arrangement). If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a reservation, you will probably be waiting for a while. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was beautiful and it features an open kitchen. This hotel is beautiful, especially the lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was just stunning. We were in awe of how gorgeous this hotel is. At night, there is a fireplace that is lit in the lobby and a firepit outside right down the stairs in the lobby. The one problem we had with the resort was the shuttle system. The morning we checked out we needed to take a bus to Epcot and then take the monorail to the resort we were checking into. We waited for 30 minutes for a bus and one never showed, so we ended up taking a cab to the resort we were checking into. This is such a pain. The shuttles should run more frequently. The other minor problem we had was the confusing layout. But after trial and error we were able to figure it out. Just remember all the restaurants are pretty much right next to each and the pool. Other than that one major problem, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe what everyone else says, the Animal Kingdom Lodge is wonderful and we all want to go back.

Got two rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one \u00e2\u20ac\u0153villa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a Savannah view (495 per night) and one a partial Savannah view (309 per night). The Savannah room was for our in-laws and two nieces who are major animal lovers. The Savannah \u00e2\u20ac\u0153villa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room was a major disappointment. It is a tiny (did I say tiny) room with a queen bed and a pull out sofa-bed. What we thought we booked (based on the description by Disney Reservation) and what we got were like night-and-day. To say that we were disappointed would be an understatement. After my wife complained about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153villa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we were basically told that this is what we booked and tough luck. We can leave the hotel if we wanted to as they were fully booked. I was ready to walk out and check into the Ritz Carlton. The club level at the Ritz is cheaper than AKL. My nieces wanted the animal view so we were stuck. My wife had a mini-breakdown at the reception. She worked so hard to make this a perfect vacation for our nieces and a major part of the Disney experience was a disaster. Our other room was ok. It is in the same league as a Hampton Inn without the view. Our room at AKL had an excellent view of the animals. We woke up every morning to see Giraffes, Zebras and other animals just outside. This was a pleasant surprise since we were expecting a parking lot view when we checked in. The lodging part of the vacation went from bad to worse. The toilet in the Villa \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Savannah\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room started to backup from day 1. A previous guest apparently flushed a bar of soap and this caused the toilet to malfunction. The engineers came three times but could not fix it. It would be ok for a couple of flushes and then malfunction. After the fourth time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I had enough and threw a fit at the front desk around 10 PM. It was unacceptable that a 4-star hotel charging $495 per night could not provide a functioning toilet for guests, especially old disabled guests. Four days without a working toilet is not acceptable. They immediately sent engineering to yank the toilet out and replace it with a new one. Unfortunately after engineering did this they forgot to tell housekeeping to clean up the mess. We had to live with a stinky messy toilet till the next day as it 12 PM and we were exhausted after visiting the parks all day. The concierge desk at AKL were pretty unhelpful. Some were nice but a majority of them seemed to be unprepared. Make sure you plan carefully if you need wheelchairs at AKL or theme parks. Double check the information given as it is often inconsistent. We were going to the Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue at the Wilderness Lodge. It was raining and was a cars-trains-boats-bus type journey before it was over. Nobody seemed to know exactly where to park and which mode of transportation would result in the least amount of walking for my mother in-law. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother asking concierges about restaurants outside of Disney or even directions outside Disney. They were pretty clueless. Other than our hotel room fiasco\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the Disney experience was pretty amazing. Despite the crowds we were able to get on most rides without much of a wait by using the FAST pass and some planning. We did four Disney parks and two Universal parks in six days. The Universal parks are a must do if you like more adventurous rides. Make sure you get the Express pass at Universal it will save you 30-45 minutes in line at each ride. Bottomline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in Disney Animal Kingdom Lodge if you can avoid it.

The kids loved the pool area and water slide the most. The bus service was perfect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus to any of the parks or downtown Disney.

After doing research online, we requested an Arusha view room with bunk beds for our two boys (11 and 9). Upon arrival, I mentioned the Concierge level, and the desk clerk called a manager over. For only a $30 upcharge per night, they offered to move us to the Concierge level. As we were on the standard Disney Dining Plan, we figured the cost savings of breakfast alone would pay for the upgrade. This trip marks the 4th time we have stayed on a Concierge level at a Disney Resort, and by far, this was the most disappointing experience. To explain, I will categorize my disappointments. First, the service was substandard. Frequently, we would visit the concierge room well within posted times of operation only to find that there was nothing available there (food & refreshments). We rose early one morning to take advantage of an early opening in the Magic Kingdom. We ended up missing the early hours because the staff was so late in putting out a breakfast. Although there were exceptions, we mostly felt we were an intrusion into the day of the staff\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6definitely not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Disney\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experience. Second, the transportation was a disappointment. I realize that we were there during peak times, but the promised bus every 15 minutes frequently turned into 30 and 40 minutes. Once, after waiting over 30 minutes, we took a bus to Epcot and rode the monorail to the Magic Kingdom. In my opinion, it would have been faster to stay off property and rent a car. Finally, the facilities were quite a disappointment. Although it was nice to occasionally see an animal from our balcony, and the property was nicely themed, I was very surprised at the mistakes that were very \u00e2\u20ac\u0153un-Disney.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I have always appreciated Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge and ability to handle large groups efficiently. However, I can only guess that the designers of this property were Marriott people. The food court was designed so that the smallest of crowds created traffic jams and impasses. Food lines end into walls and corners with no exit other than walking through the line waiting to move forward. The building was laid out to make reaching the rooms difficult. Even the concierge setup was designed so the entire food line had to stop while someone used a toaster. We took the cruise following this, and I honestly think our stateroom was larger than our hotel room. Even the swimming pool missed the mark, made from stained concrete to give the appearance of a watering hole. Although a nice \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imagineer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd idea on paper, but in practice, who wants to spend time around a pool with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dirty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd water? After our visit, we understand why Disney is pushing so hard to sell units of this facility to the Vacation Club. I am confident that if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already prepaid, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back to this place.

The hotel came highly recommended, and did not disappoint in any way. We booked two interconnecting rooms with a Savannah view on the Zebra Trail. We took this option over a suite, because it gave us an additional bathroom, and actual beds, rather than a sofa bed which gets a little old for a week. It was interesting that on some days there would be very few animals, and on others they were everywhere. There are many observation areas for guests who don't have the view, but we all enjoyed relaxing on our balconies and watching the animals. The hotel's pool is huge! The hotel is beautiful, and the lobby is unusually quiet. We stay at the Grand Californian regularly, and the noise level there is deafening. I believe it is because non-guests in California wander into the hotel for a look-see, while the Animal Kingdom Lodge is heck-n-gone from anywhere, so you find only hotel guests hanging around. Housekeeping was prompt, and even my picky wife had no complaints about the room or housekeeping. The rooms are a little small, as others have said, and Disney has the same 15 watt bulbs in the bathrooms, so reading there is out, unless you bring a flashlight. The LG plasma TV's with HD Service were a nice surprise. Be sure to watch the \"Stacy\" video about the top 7 attractions. It's addicting! We used room service twice. Food was good, delivered on time. Others have complained about the \"darkness\" in hallways and common areas. I found the subdued lighting relaxing after a long day of rides, lights, noise and fireworks. We signed up for the Kilimanjaro Club. The lounge was comfortable, and well stocked, but the main feature was that were were guaranteed a view room, and they were of great assistance in booking premium seats at Cirque du Soleil, and other shows. We used the Mickey's Magic Express. For me, this was the highlight of the trip. You skip baggage claim on arrival at MCO, and take a bus to the hotel. Your baggage is delivered about three hours later. (If you're going somewhere right after you check in, make sure you have what you're going to wear with you)! Departure and check out was amazing. We used the express checkout feauture where we just left the room, bypassing a long line at the front desk. The hotel has an airline check-in right in the lobby. They take your luggage, and print out your boarding passes right there. You just get on the bus, and go to the terminal, collecting your bags at baggage claim when you arrive home. A major time saver! The bus service in the park is well run, but for those of you going for the first time, be advised that you can't get from one hotel to another by bus. You have to go to a park from your hotel, then catch a bus to the other hotel. The bus stops are clearly marked, so no problem there. One warning: The Downtown Disney bus makes two stops, which we didn't know. If you're going to Cirque du Soleil (fantastic), make sure you get off at the second stop, otherwise you'll have a long, long walk.

We saw a giraffe and many other animals during our stay. The room was very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was spacious with the sink on the outside, the toilet and tub/shower in a separate room. This made so much more sense when you get ready, more than one person can be getting ready with ample privacy. We enjoyed this resort as access for food and shopping is within the resort.

The bus service was great, never a long wait and the buses ran about 5 to 10 minutes apart.

We had been on International Drive the week previous and then moved to Animal Kingdom Lodge to do Disney. We couldnt ask for anything else, from the moment we drove up the driveway to leaving to go to the airport, everything we wanted was catered for. The staff were brilliant, from checking us in to booking dinner reservations to cleaning the room. Everywhere was spotless, well cared for. Everyday the beds would be made up and the room cleaned. We ordered breakfast in the room the night before and when it came it was brought into the room, everything shown to us and made us feel valued. We loved the room, we had a savannah view so the animals were right outside our room all the time. To be so close to Giraffes and Zebras, etc was amazing. They were so close you could touch them (but this wasnt allowed so pictures had to do) The hotel does a safari where you are picked up and shown around the park, the animals and have dinner Bomas or Jikos. We did this, it was a little bit expensive, but the money we paid was to go back to the park and the conservation of the animals so we didnt mind to much and with the safari you get to be even closer and the guide tells you lots of facts about the animals and the park. We had breakfast and dinner in the hotel and we loved it. The service is amazing, you are looked after very well. The food is on an African theme, but there is still plenty to choose from. I am a little picky with my food, but I managed to find dishes from the menu. I would recommend giving this a try. Beware though, try to make reservations early as we were told people were booking upto 6 months in advance, so your chances of getting a table at your preferred time might be slim, but as only two of us, we managed to get in, with a slight wait. The hotel offers a shuttle service to the parks and this is free for Disney guests. Everywhere is signposted so no getting lost. The buses to the parks run regularly and we had no trouble getting to and from the parks. We went to Downtown Disney late on night and got the late bus back. Everything is secure and you dont feel threatened at all. We used this hotel as a base to go to the parks, but used it a lot also as it has a excellent swimming pool with lifeguards, a gym and also offers massages, manicures, etc. If you want to relax away from the parks one day, there is plenty to do at the hotel. Overall, this is one hotel that I would definately stay at again. Both of us didnt want to leave as we had enjoyed our stay so much, but there is plenty of reminders to take away also.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterford, CT", "Title": "\u201cGo, Go, Go\u201d", "Author": "dewisun", "ReviewID": "UR14352289", "Content": "For my 30th birthday my dad and I were going to do a safari in Africa but after finding out my dad's vacation time we decided it wasn't worth it. So we decided to do the Disney version of Africa! We also brought my 11 year old niece for her first real visit (1st visit she doesn't remember) to Disney World. We normally stay at the all-star resorts which is basic and covers all our needs. We don't end up spending that much time at the hotel anyway but this time we wanted to try something new. We were able to book our room overlooking the Savannah and also got spots on the sunrise safari (you have to be conceirge level to go on the safari). The disney express transportation was great and since we were on the concierge level check in was fast with no lines! The hotel lobby was beautiful and educational too. Our room was spacious and the bedding and decorations were tastefully done in African motif. I was a bit worried about noise because we had a connecting room but we heard nothing! We checked in at night so we were not able to see anything off the balcony. The next morning we woke up at the crack of dawn to get ready for the sunrise safari. My dad got up before my niece and I and missed my niece screaming...\"auntie there's a zebra and a giraffe outside!\" It was a great way to start the trip! if you can afford the concierge level I highly recommended it. They serve a cold breakfast everyday that has cereal, pastries, hot coffee and tea, fresh fruit, an assortment of juices and regular milk and chocolate milk. If we had to pay separately for what we ate just for breakfast the bill would have been an easy $50. I can not say enough about how wonderful the sunrise safari was! The curator of the Animal Kingdom Lodge animals was our guide for the tour and gave lots of information about all of the animals. I learned a lot about the genealogy of breading the endangered animals and the eating habits as well. The sunrise safari is the same as the ride however its early in the morning when the animals are just getting out onto the savannah and are wide awake and the safari is close to an hour as opposed to the 20 min ride. The best part was the lions! The male lion was up on his pride rock and roared for well over a minute! It was amazing. After leaving the safari you get a full spread breakfast and its yummy! I won't give a review of the park because its always great. Back to the hotel...While we were there the parks closed between 8-10 at night so we did spend a great deal of time at night at the hotel. Every night we would go to the savannah near the pool to do the night vision goggles. We never saw anything more than vultures but it was still really cool. We had an amazing dinner at Jiko but if you have young kids that aren't very adventures I wouldn't recommend eating there. We would also spend some time up at the concierge lounge relaxing and eating. They have snacks and hot appetizers out through out the day as well as soda, water, juice and beer/alcohol. The hotel also has a parade through the lobby at night were they teach you how to play african musical instruments. They have presentations from the interns from Africa teaching you about where they are from in Africa. Needless to say there is a lot to do! It's the first time that I was at Disney where I wish we had a few days to spend just at the hotel because we didn't see half of the place. I went to school for hospitality and I work in the industry so I'm pretty picky about the level of service when we go on vacation and I honestly do not have one bad thing to say about the animal kingdom lodge!!!", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shreveport, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cA grand stay at Animal Kingdom Lodge!\u201d", "Author": "Nora1999", "ReviewID": "UR14303139", "Content": "Our family stayed a week at Animal Kingdom Lodge March 6 - 13, 2008. We'd been to Disney four months earlier (we stayed last time at Westgate Towers - see my other reviews) but decided to try Disney accomodations this trip. I'd seen Animal Kingdom Lodge (AKL) on Samantha Brown's Great Hotels show on the Travel Channel and was intrigued by the idea of staying at a African style lodge with views of African animals from the room. We booked a Savannah view room for our trip and also paid for the Disney dining plan as well. As we approached the hotel site, the normally well groomed Disney property began to take on a wild, unkempt look...as though we were passing from one world into another. Our first reaction to the lobby was nothing short of amazement and awe. By and large, this is the most dazzling hotel lobby I have ever seen. The dark, atmospheric ambience felt other-worldly and foreign, yet also inviting and comforting. Our first contact with AKL staff was the receiptionist, who - according to her nametag - hailed from Ghana. \"Welcome home\" were her first words to us, and indeed this friendly \"Hakuna Matata\" attitude was prevelant with all \"cast members\" we encountered during our delightful stay. We had a bit of a walk to our room and my first impulse upon walking in was to throw back the curtains and gaze upon the savannah. To my delight our first view was of giraffes, two zebra, several antelope, and a large, shadowy Bongo stepping about in the early evening light. The menagerie was constantly changing as different animals were apparently herded about the premises and this ever-changing view of wildlife was never boring. My five year old son was constantly enchanted with the animals during our week long stay. The room was more than adequate. The African furnishings were charming and the beds were five star comfortable...the lodge was perfectly silent at night...sleep always came quickly at AKL as walking around the Disney theme parks does have a tiring effect. The food ranged from ordinary to sublime. The Mara was great for a quick meal. Room service meals were better fare. There was a large and noisy buffet restaurant that I think others enjoyed more than I did. And yes, you must pop at least once for a meal at the incredible four diamond \"Jiko: The Cooking Place.\" The sturgeon and filet mignon were out of this world and I may say it's possible I have never dined so well in my life. The pool was great, too. I was concerned that it was only heated to 82 degrees - this was March, after all - but the water temperature was fine. My son LOVED the slide. The hot tubs got a little crowded in the afternoons but were lightly used before noon. Oh, and did I mention the poolside bar with the darling thatched roof? Those frozen mango margaritas are WONDERFUL. I had no complaint about the bus service to the parks, either. This was much better than driving to the parks and walking, as we did last time. All and all, we had an enchanting and thoroughly delightful stay at the grand but somewhat unconventional AKL. Since Disney is all about escaping the ordinary, I can attest that the \"illusion\" of staying at a grande African lodge was a thorough and convincing experience - and no worry there of contracting dengue fever. :) Though not cheap by any means, if you're really looking to get away from it all, forget your troubles and escape to another world...AKL is just the ticket.

We decided to splurge and upgrade to the concierge level, figuring that would provide some extra benefits. We used Disney's luggage option where they will pick your luggage up from the airport and deliver the bags to your room within 3 - 4 hours. DO NOT use this service. The service is supposed to scan your luggage, using the tags that Disney provides you, so that they can track your bags throughout the delivery process. Well after 3 1/2 hours, our bags still had not been delivered so we inquired at the desk. They had no record of our bags and could not tell us whether the airline had them or the baggage service had them. We were told they would look into it. An hour later we once again went to front desk to inquire. Again, no idea where our bags were. And no apologies. An hour later, same thing. No one would even call our room to update us - we had to go to the desk to get an update. When I did call from my room and ask to speak to the manager (at this point it was 10:00 p.m.) I was told the manager was away from the desk and would call back in 5 minute. 15 minutes later - still no call. So back down to the desk...Eventually we got our bags that night, but the complete lack of concern/apologies from the staff was EXTREMELY disappointing. Our room was consistently not cleaned until late in the afternoon (3:30 - 4:00) even though we left our room each morning by 9:00 a.m. One day we returned to our room while it was being cleaned (at 3:30) - another day we told the maid to not even bother as we were trying to get some rest before dinner and she came in at 4:00 to clean. We asked the concierge to look into a couple of things for us, and they did not follow-up. Given that we paid extra for concierge service and it is a Disney lodge, we expected much better service Now the good things: 1) Lodge was beautiful and we had a wonderful view of all the animals throughout the day. 2) Food was delicious 3) We did the sunset safari, which was great.

Of course not, it would have meant another trip down to the lobby which was 3 wings out, one floor down and 2 more wings over. Otherwise, the amenities were fine with a nice balcony. The hotel is quite dark due to the dark furnishing and colors to represent Africa (or so we think). A giraffe carcasse must have been left in the hallway one day because the smell was quite horrible (probably water leak on the carpet). The restaurant (The Boma) served excellent food with good choices for the kids. the other cafeteria style restaurant was also quite good. Did not try the classier restaurant since I don't think the kids would have enjoyed. The pool area was great with a zero-entry pool and water-slide (too bad kids can go down with adults). 2 hot tubs, kiddie pool and playground. Too bad that the pool was way at the other end.

There were also plenty of nooks of extreme quiet throughout the grounds- this is by far the most serene of all the disney properties. Room itself was on the small side but well appointed. Bus service to the parks was excellent all five days and at all times of day.

Instead of the usual 5 to 10 minutes on the normal safari at the Animal Kingdom we were out for an hour seeing numerous animals close up and for a much longer time. This was then followed by a buffet breakfast at Pizzafari which left us fit to burst. This is only available to guests staying concierge level at the lodge.

This is a low week for WDW so the rate was only $240. The Lodge is gorgeous, with an amazing lobby (decorated for Christmas when we were there) and areas for viewing the animals. The theming is amazing. The pool area is gorgeous, lots of nooks and crannies for sitting, and a pleasant pool bar. The landscaping is just lovely. There are two fire pits which make for relaxing sitting. Throughout the hotel there are areas where you can sit on a balcony and watch the animals. We had a pool view room which was very pleasant. Savannah rooms were all booked but this room had a pretty view of trees and pool area. There are many opportunties to view the animals so we didn't feel deprived, but I would definteily avoid a parking lot view. The room itself is like every Holiday Inn you've ever stayed in, but with theming. It was a bit small, the bath was OK but definitely not luxury. Toiletries were minimal and not brand named. Bed was OK, ugly cheesy bedspreads. They charge $9.95 per day for hi-speed internet. This drives me nuts, I feel I am being nickel and dimed to death. The housekeeping service was terrible. We had trouble getting clean glasses and coffee cups, even after calling more than once.. The sink was not clean when we arrived and was never cleaned. One sink did not drain properly, and the shower dripped. On our fourth day, we returned to our room at 4 PM after being out all day and the room had not been serviced. I called housekeeping, very upset because every time we had complained about something we had been assured it would be OK from then on. Ultimately they comped us half a night's rate. Overall I think Disney is really wrong to call this a luxury hotel, because it just isn't. It is absolutely a lovely environment, and we totally enjoyed the animals, the theming, the pool area, the lobby. The Mara, a food court, is a food court - noisy, smells like greasy fries, screaming kids, etc. There is no place to get a quiet coffee or adult breakfast. At Jika, a so-called fine dining restaurant, food was good but service was rude and hurried, they were clearly eager to turn the tables quickly. The bars and restaurants serve only South African wines, and only African wines are sold in the convenience store - overpriced, and not that great. If I had paid a high week price for this stay, I would have been foaming at the mouth over the housekeeping issues, the size of the room, the quality of the room. I have stayed at Port Orleans and at Riverside, and they are just as \"magical\" for the money. This is a Holiday Inn with an awesome lobby and setting.

In the past, anytime we had failed to get a Savannah room, we simply stayed somewhere else, not wanting to have a view of a parking lot at Disney prices. We were traveling a child that was 2.5 years old and really wanted to stay in the animal viewing rooms for him. We checked in quite late and the check-in took a bit, even though we were the only ones in line. I would think that Disney would have the check-in down to a science by now, but that still needs some work. Our hotel room was all the way at the end of the hotel, which meant that we had to walk through very darkened corridors for a hotel. While I understand that this fits the ambience, my son was quite disturbed by the general darkness and the spooky masks. Our room was good, but was very cramped for a room that cost so much. We were pleased that room service delivers quite late, but the food is incredibly expensive. The beds were only mediocre and Disney really should think about investing in some beds like at Holiday Inn Express. These mattresses were unfortunately not very comfortable. Despite our relative so-so attitude toward the experience, in the morning, the room earned its value. At about 5 am, we looked up to see giraffes, antelope, and a slew of random birds outside our balcony. We were hard pressed to keep our son inside after he saw what was just right outside our sliding glass door. It is wonderful to wake up with these creatures 50 feet from you and it made the trip. That being said, I probably would not spend the money or the booking time for the Savannah room again because the Animal Kingdom Lodge has several viewing areas with rocking chairs and such that you can go watch the wildlife from.

My husband booked a standard view room for the Thanksgiving wknd so we drove up to Orlando from Fort Lauderdale on Friday afternoon right after our lunch with our 2yo son. At checkin, I was not in the best mood as due to carsickness, our son had thrown up in the back seat 5 minutes before arrival. We did have a bit of a wait but considering it was the day after Thanksgiving, it wasn't bad at all. The checkin agent took our info, looked at the screen, and said \"I'll be right back.\" After a few seconds, he came back and told us that he had gotten approval to upgrade us to a Savannah view room. That made me feel better. :) The last time we were there we got a great view of the parking lot!!! So, off we went to the room and sure enough, open the windows and there were giraffes, water birds, and african deer. It was great. My son liked it for a while but my husband was even more excited. i was pleased to see that the bathroom amenities were much higher quality than at our last visit. Spa quality toiletries in good variety and amounts. We soon headed off to the buffet restaurant, which is still the best restaurant I've been to at Disney. The variety and quality is excellent. Our son chose two bowls of mac and cheese but hey, he's allowed. We revelled in chicken and beef, all kinds of side dishes, and of course, lovely bite-sized desserts of fruit tarts and chocolates. Great job with the Boma restaurant!!! We did have one maintenance issue but it was quicky resolved. On Saturday, the A/C display was flickering when we got back from Magic Kingdom but a serviceman was there within 20 minutes and it turned out an entire section of the hotel had the problem. It was fixed and due to the cool weather, we had no issues with that. My only complaint is that for a resort, they could have better beds and sheets. I write this review on my last day at a business conference hosted in a Westin resort and the Heavenly Bed is exactly that. Disney should upgrade the bedding and beds at their Deluxe resorts and keep pace with the Westins and Marriotts in the hotel circuit. Otherwise it was a great stay.

(Even in cases when rooms were not ready early I noticed that the staff did a good job of accomodating people and making sure they were taken care of until their rooms were ready.) Even though we had a heavily discounted rate to begin with, we still received an upgrade ato a Savannah view at the front desk for no additional cost -- simply by asking. We saw a large variety of animals from our balcony on a daily basis. The decor of the hotel is simply stunning in its design and detail; you notice new things the whole time you stay there. Truly one of the most asthetically pleasing hotels I've ever stayed in. Everyone was extremely friendly, constantly saying hi in the hallways or offering information on the different animals and culture around the resort. People hustled to help you out with anything you might need and everyone always had a smile. We do not have children but there seemed to be plenty of fun activities for them to take part in around the resort (making bracelets, storytelling, drumming, etc). The pool area was also filled with kids, but I liked that there were plenty of chairs available and some were located slightly farther away from the pool, so you could still get some sun if you didn't want to be right next to the hustle and bustle of the pool. Never had a problem getting a seat at any time. We spent most of our time at the parks during the day, and used the buses to get almost everywhere. I found it very convenient; our longest wait was probably 10-15 minutes for a bus, and we rarely had to stop at other resorts on the way to the park (as I gather other resort's buses do). As for the food, we ate at the Mara for breakfast often (which was absolutely teeming with children and very chaotic; the food was generally serviceable buffet-style stuff). We ate at Boma once, which was also buffet-style. We walked right up without a reservation and got a table. (in fact, we did not make a reservation for any restaurant the entire week we stayed at WDW, and were only turned away once.) The room service menu was somewhat limited compared to other hotels but the food they did have was very good. A lot of the ease we had with getting into restuarants, quick bus service, finding room at the pool, etc may have been due to going in November. I cannot imagine what this place must be like in the summer months... but fall is definitely a great time to go (80 degrees, not a cloud in the sky the whole trip). My only real issue? While the quality of the room was fine (think of every standard hotel you've stayed in, then imagine it with heavy African theming), it seemed slightly overpriced considering the overall expense of a Disney vacation. While service, etc was good, the full price of this resort seemed a bit much. With the discount we got, I didn't personally have a problem with the rate... but while seeing animals up-close from the balcony daily was very cool, the price would definitely be an issue (especially if I had children)!

It does not share them with any other resorts so it's a straight shot to the parks and back. The kiddie pool was great and never busy and the main pool had the wonderful zero gravity entrance like a beach which is good for smaller children so they can play without being in over their heads. We ate at the food court alot which i found to be a tad small but the prices and food were good. I'm not a HUGE fan of the themed resturaunts in this hotel though i am a picky eater so i'm not too suprised.

It was a lovely resort. Upon booking there were no rooms with bunkbeds available, but got one on check-in. We were also upgraded to a Savannah room free. It is a big hotel, but seems that the majority of rooms are Savannah view except those looking over the pool. We could also see some construction to the left of our view, but no noise was heard. I never heard any noise from any other rooms and found it to be a very quiet day and night. Mara quick service was similar to other quick service restaurants in the park. I especially liked the Chicken pita. Boma was also good. My only complaint about the food was true to everywhere i ate. It was good food, but noisy and busy. But I didn't expect to find peace and quiet in a location such as disney. The pool was nice, but the weather was a bit chilly and we were so busy in the parks, we only swam once. The rooms were small. We only did 4 nights so didn't really affect us. The bathrooms were especially small. We were treated very well at AKL, but that held true throught our whole disney experience. We did stop and buy a few breakfest items and did a quick cereal, yogurt in the morning. It saved time and money. I can't compare this resort to any others as it was my first time to disney. It was about 20 minutes on the bus to MK but buses were regular and we never really waited.

There was a hot jacuzzi tub just opposite the balcony, which came on around eight in the morning, and was delightfully deserted at that time. There are several places around the hotel where you can sit and look at the animals. There are huge wooden rocking chairs, outside 'fires' to relax around and the heated pool was popular until late - the lifeguards go off duty at eight but the pool was still available, warm and well lit, and not crowded at all. Trees with flowers and beautiful butterflies and birds are just part of the scenery. Little lizards/geckos scuttle away under the bushes. It is an nature and animal lovers paradise but with all the pampers and comforts of a luxury hotel. Food in all of the restaurants was great, the African restaurant was amazing, and the buffet style food in the main eating area was superb too.

Where else in America can you look out your balcony and see giraffes, zebras, and other African animals a few yards away. We arrived via the Disney shuttle around 5:00 pm. Our plan was to check in and head to one of the parks for a few hours. Their computer system crashed as we were waiting to check in. This made checking in impossible for about two hours. We had requested adjoining rooms with the other family. Once we checked in, we realized that we were actually on different floors! It took about one more hour to get this problem fixed. By the time we finally got into our rooms, everyone was so aggravated that no one wanted to go out to the park. Our room keys were also supposed to be our park passes. The next morning, we waited for twenty minutes to catch the shuttle to the Magic Kingdom. We tried to get in the park only to find that our room keys were not coded with our park tickets. We ended up having to go all the way back to the hotel to have the problem fixed. It was one problem after another. The hotel had a representative form Disney Cruise Lines at a counter. She called our room and asked us to come down and fill out some paperwork. We went down and spent 30 minutes filling out all of the forms and gave them to her. The next day, we got the same call. We said that we filled them out yesterday. She said that she had no record of it. We had to go back down and repeat the exercise.

We found the reception cast members to always be polite & helpful, if sometimes a bit robotic! Something we did find frustrating - there are 3 restaurants in the hotel. Two of which are VERY popular with guest staying from all over the Disney resorts, so we always had a hard time getting seated for breakfast & dinner. When you did reach the end of the queue, the food was good & lots of it - if you have the buffet at Boma. But the poor servers were always so rushed off their feet they didn't have time to give us any individual attention - which we certainly paid for (18% graituity on the disney dining plan!) Also than darn drum music was also carried through to the restaurant - ok if you like to 'eat to the beat', but not for me! The pool & spa was nothing special & the slide was closed for most of the time we were there. It would also become quite crowded at times with little space for sun lounging & relaxing.

This hotel is quite possibly the best place I have ever been and I have stayed at some wonderful hotels. When you book Animal Kingdom lodge, you are booking a 'African Safari stay'. The rooms are dark and small, quaint understated, homely and perfectly practical (apart from the lack of storage). To sum the rooms up in one word, I would say - 'lovely'. Nothing exciting, just lovely. Just what we wanted and expected!!! If like we did, you are staying in a Savannah view room, then you will not be bothered about the room anyway. The view from your balcony is stunning. The animals can get up to about 20/30 feet away from your balcony. Waking up to giraffes was just the best! If you are not in a Savannah view room, don't worry. There are animal viewing points all over the hotel and the pool views are really nice! Put it this way, i would rather stay in a room without a view than stay in another hotel with a great view! A few tips from our stay. The valet service is NOT FREE. I expected it to be free seeing as its a 5* hotel, but its definitely not. Its 10 dollars a day, and I was not willing to pay for two weeks of valet when the car park is literally one minute walk away. In fact, you could probably walk to the car park in 30 seconds. Just bear that in mind when and if you arrive for the first time (if you have a car). There are three restaurants in AKL. Boma, Jiko and Maha. Boma and Jiko being more expensive. If we wanted to eat cheaply, we either went to Maha or we went to the shops and restaurants that are literally a five minute drive away (staff will give you directions). There is a long strip of restaurants, supermarkets, a Subway sandwich bar etc, this was really handy. However, you must do 'do breakfast' in Boma and book yourself a table at Jiko (that opens early evening), they are both amazing restaurants. Book it when you first arrive to avoid disappointment. I would advise you to go to the concierge when you have arrived and have unpacked and just explain to them all the things you want to do, they will give you hints and tips and will check availabilities for you with things like character dining - something you HAVE TO DO! (I would highly recommend breakfast with Lilo and Stitch at the Polynesian resort, they sing and dance and do a little parade around the restaurant). You might not even know what you want to do... Even better to go to speak to them, they will advise you. There is a laundry room for anyone to use, with huge washers and dryers that we find really useful. There is also a kids club for four years to 12 years (I think), it opens from 4pm til midnight. Its very pricey at 12 dollars per child per hour, but if you are only going to go out once or twice without kiddies (if you have them) it will be worth it. Even for the most paranoid parents who don't like to leave their children anywhere, I had no fears here. There are loads of things to do for the children and best of all, they give you a pager that they will beep if there is a problem. I really felt at ease! AKL is probably the park furthest away from the 'hub' of Disney, but at the same time is still only about a 10 minute drive to the furthest point. There is no traffic on Disneys roads. The set-up is brilliant. Buses are fantastic and you REALLY DO NOT NEED TO SPEND EXTRA MONEY ON A HIRE CAR. Everything about Disney and its practicalities are brilliant. My advise for your stay at AKL. Just go there expecting little rooms and a real homely relaxing stay and you will enjoy your stay. I would NOT hesitate to go back/recommend this hotel. So much so, we joined the vacation club with AKL as our home resort.

Hotel amenities excellent - very clean, service oriented and great links to the parks.

They do have talks at 8.30pm each evening from various wardens talking about their home countries. Quite interesting. We had a savannah room which was nice - to be honest I'm not sure i would pay the extra GBP500 again for this - pleasant but I'd put the money towards other things. You can see the savannah from the viewing platform. Couple of tips for the hotel: a) make restaurant bookings before you go. Jiko and Boma were both booked out and we struggled to get in. Apparently you can book up to 180 days before your visit and many people had done this. Of the two would prefer Boma which is buffet style. There is also a place called the Mara which always had spaces and a broad selection- if you have hyper kids this is quick and easy. b) Avoid using the hotel room phone for overseas calls unless you are a lottery winner. we got caught out and were paying GBP 12.50 a minute for the privilege !

LONG review!\u201d", "Author": "rjsmom1117", "ReviewID": "UR8423059", "Content": "We stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge for 7 nights and were so glad that we chose this hotel. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 14 and 11). We initally chose this hotel because we love animals but after reading some reviews about the distance to the parks we switched to the Wilderness Lodge. About a week before we were supposed to leave we switched back the the AKL and also got the Dining plan. We are sooo glad we did both! Our arrival was very easy, I could not believe how many people were at the airport... I think everyone at the Orlando airport was going to Disney. You are herded through the airport like cattle to the Magical Express area. (For those of you who don't know what that is~ it is wonderful... Before you leave home they send you tags with a bar code, when you check your baggage they send it straight through and someone for Disney picks it up at the airport and it is waiting in your room after checking in. So much less hassle at the airport! When you checkout, you check your bags at the hotel and they arrive at your home airport for you. ) Once in the Magical Express area you are split up by resort. You get on a Disney bus and head to your resort. It seems these buses run about every 15 mins. Upon arriving at the hotel we loved the look. It really looked like you would imagine a hotel near a wildlife refuge. Check in was very quick and they explained everything. We booked a room with bunk beds and one queen bed. Our room was very nice. The only complaint I have is the sheets.... Very low thread count, kinda itchy. Yes, the rooms are a little small but it was fine for the 4 of us and we were just there to sleep. A lot of the employees there are from different places in Africa, take the time to talk to them. You can learn so much. The hotel has a buffet restaurant called BOMA. A lot of items are African, but for picky kids they also have chicken fingers and fries, etc. BOMA is a must. It is a wonderful experience to try another culture's food. We ate there our 3rd day (again 2 days later and again for breakfast) and the kids LOVED it! I made the comment to the waiter that I loved certain items and he then brought me a request card and told me to write down the items I wanted the recipes for and they would email it to me. (Amazingly they did about 3 weeks later!!!) The kids liked it so much I had to drag them to other places to try on the dining plan. (HINT if you are a guest call the hotel operator and asked to be DIRECTLY connected to BOMA and put your name on the waiting list and they will call your room when your table is ready...Such a nice bonus after a LONG EXHAUSTING day at the parks....) We also ate at the Kona Cafe at the Polynesian. We all had steak and it was surprisingly good. It was a circus to get there though... (We went there from the Magic Kingdom and had to make 2 other stops at other resorts before arriving there~at AKL you don't share a bus...) We also ate at the Rainforest Cafe at the Animal Kingdom don't do it. A must to see, it is very neat inside, maybe even have an appetizer but spend your money somewhere else, the food was awful. MGM~ the Hollywood Brown Derby. Oh my gosh~~sooo good. It uses more credits but so worth it. (HINT~ our youngest did not like a lot of food on the menu since 11 is considered an adult, so we would order off the kids menu and pay cash and use his credits to upgrade meals.) We also ate at the 50's Prime Time Cafe, ask to sit in Auntie Claire's section. She was the best, everyone around us wished they had her she was so much fun. At EPCOT~ the Rose and Crown was our favorite. Not only was the food great but our waitress Nikki was outstanding. (HINT~ make your reservation for 8:30 so you can have a front row viewing for the fireworks. Don't worry if you are not on the patio, your waitress will take you out to the patio to see them. They also dim the lights inside so you can see better. They will also make sure your food is not out until before or after the fireworks. They were the best there! As for the counter service you use for lunch, most all the same sutff, burgers, hotdogs, etc. (HINT~The best thing we figured out to do was jump on a bus and head to downtown disney and eat at Wolfgang Puck's Express for lunch (amazing lunch menu and wonderful food) and jump on the bus back to the parks. So much better than burgers and fries.) The counter service the MARA at our hotel was not bad either though. Nice variety. (By the way at MARA ask for a re-fillable mug $10 but can be refilled as much as you want for your stay.) Now the buses. They run about every 10 minutes to the resorts and parks. The best part about being at the AKL was we did not share a bus with any other resort, so that means one stop. The longest ride was a little over 10 mins to the farthest park (Magic Kingdom). On the way back when it's dark they turn off the lights and you can relax on your way back. I think people that complain are the type that are never satisfied. One last HINT~ if you have left over snack credits from the dining plan (you will, more than half the time in the parks we were charged ONE credit total for all of us) you can use the remaining credits for Diney cookies, crackers, pretzels, candies in the hotels gift shop. We had 44 and used them all for gifts for friends and family. Our hotel was amazing. From the minute you enter the lobby to seeing all the animals and even the rooms had wonderful details. (HINT~ on the back side of the pool at night they have free night vision to see the animals, I think until about 10pm. If you can't find it ask someone, there is always an employee there to help!) If you can afford it upgrade to the Savannah room. Overall we loved our choice and would stay there again. Our friends who were there at the same time stayed at the Wilderness Lodge and that seemed like a circus because of it's sheer size. Our hotel was huge but spread out, we really feel we made a great choice.

With the GBP being so strong against the dollar (nearly $2.10 to the \u00c2\u00a3) when we were there even the slightly inflated hotel prices seemed ok. We tended to drive to the parks ourselves in the morning which was easier and quicker and you get free parking and used the buses at night, longest we waited was 15mins. As for the construction I heard a bit of drilling when I walked through the lobby a couple of times but that was it, I think Virgin have insured their clients are well away from it and are being upgraded where possible so don't pay the extra for a savannah room if you're with virgin you'll probably get one anyway. If you want to eat off the Hotel/parks take the first right when you leave the Hotel (Sherbaton Rd) then go left at the junction and theres ample restaurants, shops and supermarkets.

Breezed through the reception - resonably friendly. Got to our room - Very poor. Wasnt happy - made 1 phone call to reception and we were moved - upgraded to Savanah view. Room 3211. Great view - lots to see - animals great. Very dark hotel - but gave the ambience - the whole point. There was building noise that was very annoying and we didnt know about it when were booked it - didnt make to much problem as we were out all day at the parks. Was bad though whilst chilling and nursing my poor feet after treking around Disney all day. This place was not Disney (Fied) at all. But that was cool. The maid only did our room properly if we left a tip!! - Really. The face cloth animals were great. My daughter looked forward to them allday - never mind Mickey!!. The food was overpriced and repetitive - but wasnt a problem. MAKE NOTE - there is no point in dressing up for dinner. Really - we made the effort as we like to dress up a bit for a nice meal at Boma or Jiko - bit sitting next to people wearing shorts and string vests was a bit silly. We would have bought and took more stuff home in our cases and left our dresses at home. I still took myu dress!!! Anyway - i digress. The SIMBA CUB house - for youger children was rubbish. Amelia was bored to death - the staff were very rude and said to me - no room key - no kid when I came to collect her!! Security consious im sure. Amelia didnt want to go back either. Be ready to evacuate the pool if the sky turns a bit - 7 occasions we had to evacuate the pool and deck due to stormy weather. Again not an issue really - I dont want to come accross as negative. A trip to Wallmart to stock up on beer and put in the fridge for chilling on the balcony to stare at rangers raking poo was great. Better than $5 per bottle when you can drink 24 buds for $8.!! The Disney busses were great - we didnt have to wait long for any of them EXCEPT Downtown Disney!! for some reason. We had a fab time - the hotel was great - dont read too much into the negative stuff - thats just a personal experience - you make your own holiday. Looks like the AKL villas will be nice. = The building work isnt intrusive - just a bit noisey - I didnt see 1 crane or any builders - it may just be a tape they are playing - along with the other african music gently playing in the background.!!!!! Please contact me if you want anything answered. Just got back. Planet Hollywood is under refit!! Just the outside. Raglan Road - the best resturant we went too - Irish nite - fantastic. The Guinness is great. All the best. Isnt it great to have 30 days leave a year - not like you poor American chaps - 15!!! outrageous. No wonder you are all a bit stressed.

The kids, 4 and 2, loved everything about the hotel. We paid the extra for a savannah room, and it was worth it. We were on the end of the trail and could see the constrution out the corner of our balcony, but it wasn't bothersome. We were on the second floor, and there were some animal pens below us that were a little smelly in the mornings, but not offensive at all. Glad we brought the umbrella strollers with us. It was 480 steps from our room to the front door, too many for the kids to walk when we got back from a day at the parks. they loved being pushed around the hotel. the second floor was a great view of the animals. We had elands and zebras out our room everyday. The giraffes never came down our way, but there are so many places to view all the animals it was okay. The beds were a little high so the kids needed help getting into bed (we got the 2 queen beds). The room was a little smallish, but we weren't spending the vacation in the room! We were only there for a nap in the afternoons, a dip in the pool, or to go to bed. We did the Magical Express service, it was great with the kids. No car seats, no car rental or taxi to worry about. Just get in line and get on a bus. The return was a little different, we had an early flight and the airline desk didn't open till it was time for our departing bus had to leave (next time we'll just book a later departing flight, not an 8am flight).We did have to wait to get into our room, but we checked our carry on bags at the check in, and took the kids to Downtown disney to start our Disney experience. We did put our swim stuff in our carry on bags in case we wanted to hang out at the pool. But by the time we got back from Downtown Disney our room was ready and our bags were waiting for us. The zero entry pool was great for our 2 year old. My husband and I liked the water slide, and the kids liked us using the water slide. The souviner cup at Mara was the way to go. For $11 we got the travel mug with unlimited refills of soda, coffee, tea. We really got our money's worth with the two cups we bought. I got my coffee for the bus trip to the parks in the morning, my husband supplied his soda kick nicely for the week and the kids got their iced tea and lemonade for the pool trips. Well worth the money--plus inside the parks we could fill it with tap water and add a cystal light pack to give the kids flavored water and not spend $2 for a bottle of water or soda! Once home the cups have served me well in getting the kids to preschool in the morning and still feeding my caffeine habit! My husband had his birthday while we were there and Disney out did our expections. We had already scheduled a breakfast at the Animal Kingdom with Donald and I mentioned his birthday to our server when he went to the rest room. The charaters all signed a card for him, and the wait staff did a round of Happy Birthday. I had pre-ordered a \"cake\" made of chocolat bars and snacks through my travel agent and a Diseny Florist and it was wonderful. The snacks were great and the kids loved it as much as Dad did! When I asked the front desk in the morning about it being delivered, they asked me his favorite character and the cake was delivered with a card from Goofy with a picture in front of Cinderella's castle!!! It was a Magical vacation 100%!! I'm surprised by the bad reviews I've read. I think a lot of them come from poor planning on the part of the writer. We had read a few guide books and focused on the tips for traveling to the parks and hotels with kids so we knew to bring the strollers with us (and we got to save the rental money for a stroller in the parks by having our own....check them as plane side carry on at the gate and they are ready when you get off our plane at the gate when you get off). My in-laws meet us at the hotel for the last 2 nights. They loved the hotel as well. The kids had a great time with them there for 2 days, and even though we weren't able to get rooms near each other (they made a last minute decision to join us) it was fine. The were only one flight of stairs up from us.

The toilet broke. All the issues were addressed and taken care of as much as they could be but for a deluxe hotel it was a bummer. They also took off 1/2 a nights stay, also a nice gesture. The grounds and hotel are amazing. We had a pool view room and that was ideal. Savannah view is not necessary IMO as you can see the animals from everywhere in the hotel. The bus service was annoying after a while...just a long ride everywhere, and if you miss a bus by a minute you can wait another 10-15 for the next one and then have a 20+ minute ride to whatever park you are going to. Gets to be a drag, especially coming back afer a long day. Also, the meal plan was not a fit for us...limited options for our picky eating kids and not great food for adults. Jiko was really, really good and fun. Loved it, best meal of the week by far. The rest of the fod that week was subpar. Lots of activities and things to explore in the hotel - great pool w/ slide, night vision goggles are cool...would have enjoyed the stay if our room did not have so many issues and was so small. We will go back to Disney, of course, but we won't stay at AKL. I can see AKL being a good fit for small families (one kid maybe) or couples IF you don't mind being pretty remote.

We booked a Concierge Level room and have zero regrets. The extra money we paid for the room had its perks. On arrival, we were greeted with a bellhop from South Africa which led to the authentic charm of our trip. He was extremely pleasant and seemed to enjoy pointing out details as we made our way to our room. We were advised that due to availability our room was upgraded to a Junior Suite. When we entered even the bellhop's jaw dropped. He said \"Wow. This is amazing. I've never seen this room before.\" And, amazing it was. All thick, ebony framed furnishings with velvet coverings. The bathroom with separate vanity/make-up area was beautiful. There was a small eating space with wetbar and microwave as well. Then, on to the view. The only noticable problem with our room was that the insulated glass of the patio sliding doors had lost its seal allowing moisture to build within the panes and somewhat obstruct the view. However, once the doors were open we had an uninterupted (well, save for some fencing and barb-wire) view of an african-esque Seregetti complete with zebra and giraffes. On our first, and each consecutive morning, we enjoyed complimentary continental breakfast in the concierge lounge (free to conceirge level guests only) which was well stocked with cereals, pastries, fruit, amazing juice blends, milk, juice boxes, bottled water, coffee, and tea. We would also return for an afternoon snack (cookies, fruit, beverages) and again for a nightcap (cordials and luscious desserts). Since it's next to impossible to find juice boxes and water in the parks we took advantage of the concierge lounge offerings at the and kept an extra juice box or bottle of water in the kids' packs as well as in our room. The food savings were probably greater than the cost of the upgrade and I would not hesitate to upgrade during future stays. Wow, I haven't even commented on the architecture or staff yet. Five Stars. Seriously. This is the most beautiful hotel we have ever stayed in and the staff was trained to serve with a smile. I did not have one single regret and will certainly pay a little extra to stay at this amazing hotel in the future. Also good to know: the hotel provides transportation to all of the Disney parks and Concierge will assist you with reservations and tickets (even when you think getting into a show is impossible).", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london uk", "Title": "\u201cAnimal heaven Human earth\u201d", "Author": "nitsy", "ReviewID": "UR8071332", "Content": "Myself hubby and a 2yr old stayed here for our 1st trip to Disney In Jan this year We read the reviews and booked a savannah view room which is well worth the extra Every morning our 2yr old jumped out of bed to go watch the animals from the balcony!

Then one day during the summer of '04, my mother received an offer from Disney to stay in one of their Deluxex resorts for $180 a night, starting on July 1st through August 31st. So after a little consideration, my mom and I decided to try the new hotel Animal Kingdom Lodge. So during the last week of July, we headed for Orlando. We left on a Wednesday night and were delayed at the airport for two hours. Combined with a three hour flight, we didn't get the resort until 2am!! But the staff there were totally friendly and sympathetic for our delay and gave us a room upgrade on the spot. We went from a room with no view, to a room with a view of the savannah. It was really cool, waking up in the morning and seeing all the animals out there roaming around. Room service was ordered and arrived 15 minutes later. 15 minutes!!!! Steaming hot food and a wonderfully funny delivery woman and we were off for the first of five wonderful days. We loved the atmosphere of this hotel. The food was a little pricey, but was very good. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. This basically was a dream vacation, nothing other than the flight delay arriving, went wrong. The only real downside to this hotel is it's size. We were fortunate to have a room very close to the lobby, restaurants and pool. But from what I saw on the map, it could be a very long walk from some of the rooms. My advice to people considering this hotel or any other Disney hotel is to plan ahead. Pick out a hotel and begin to figure out your costs. Do not be surprised by how expensive it can get. So plan at least a year in advance and start a vacation fund. Once you have this figured out, decide on what parks you want to visit. Now this is where it really gets tricky for a lot of people, so I recommend picking put one or two parks to visit. Unless you have two weeks to spend, and most of us do not, you WILL NOT have enough time to see everything and ENJOY it. Let me repeat, you WILL NOT see everything and ENJOY it. Sure, some of you will scoff and say that you can see everything there is in, say five days or however long you're going to be there. But you will not enjoy it. You will find youself racing from 6am to 12am, trying to get in as much as possible. You will feel rushed and irritated by the amount of people at the parks. You will begin to despise the people working at the park, thinking them to be lazy because you had to wait in line for a ride, hot dog, or the bathrooms. Remember these are the people who are trying to entertain you and your family. They do not have to do this, but they chose to do it. Be respectful of their choice and of them, and you will free yourself of a lot of stress. Think of the people you are with and how they want to enjoy ther parks, because let's face it, you are going to get stuck in a line for the rides. FastPass is a great innovation for stream-lining the more popular rides, but remember that you can only use it once every 90 minutes (I think it's 90, could be longer). So where do you think everyone is going after they too use the FastPass? So, do not get upset or stressed out, take this time to talk to your kids, spouse or whoever is there with you. Do not let this opportunity get away. This is supposed to be your vacation, a time of relaxation and rest. Time to spend with your family outside the daily grind of life. Just enjoy the short amount of time you have away from the stress of work, commuting to work, and worrying about work. Look at the smiles on the faces of your kids or other kids as they experience Disney for the first time, and remember your first time and how happy it made you to be there. And smile as you think about those kids will one day in the future experience the same joy as you're when they take their kids to Disney for the first time.

My husband and I are in our 20's- I'm a disney nut, he had never been. Be sure to find out if you are in the wing of the hotel under renovation. We moved twice because the construction noise was unbearable. If you have kids and you're out the door at the crack of dawn, its probably fine, but we did the pool in the mornings and the parks at night, so we needed the room to be peaceful in the mornings. The disney dining plan was fantastic. I made reservations before we left and had great choices every night. If you're having too much fun and don't want to go, just cancel, no big deal. The cafe by the pool at the resort was great! I had awesome salads, wraps, fruit, etc by the pool each day. The pool bar and other hotel bars were very nice and very sophisticated. *Note that many disney resorts do not have pool bars. I really loved the pool. Always had fresh towels, plenty of chairs, etc. I'm not really into the african decor, but for the pool and \"deluxe\" quality without paying the price of the other resorts, we were thrilled. Also, because it is a \"remote\" hotel, the buses are generally only for your resort, so I thought travel between parks would take longer, but it was actually much shorter because you never have to stop at another resort. Tip: The gym has a nice shower facility that is free. We booked a late flight on check out day so that we could lounge by the pool, then showered in the gym/spa. It was nice and added a day to our trip. We wish we had eatten at Jiko the restaurant on site, but ran out of time.

Eat late and watch MK's fireworks on the beach beforehand. Brown Derby (MGM- not worth the price but got priority seating to the fireworks at fantasmic which is limited seating- great idea.)

We were disappointed and aggravated by the whole experience. The lobby staff were incompetent and unfriendly. Our concierge room for which we paid a significant amount more for was on a different level than the concierge lounge b/c of construction that we were not previously told was going on. (PS - the room was small and bland). This resulted in a 10 minute walk to the concierge lounge from our room. The construction was LOUD! Jackhammering in the lobby at all times of day and no apologies about this also. (I immediately called my travel agent about this on check in who swore she knew nothing about this) Our luggage took 4 hours to get from the airport to the hotel. I called several times to the concierge (bathing suits and my husband's medication was in the luggage -- kids finally swam in their shorts begrudgingly b/c we were told the luggage was lost-- lots of tears there). The concierge receptionist put me on hold for 10 minutes and then disconnected me. When I called back she claimed she had just gotten a new phone and didn't know how to operate it. She then told me to wait for a call from the manager of the hotel IN MY ROOM. Finally I got a hotel manager to speak to on the phone who promised she would go over to the luggage area to look for our luggage... After I hung up, I left my room, found the luggage area downstairs, located someone in charge there who brought me out to a truck where they were unloading bags and picked through the bags until I found my own luggage... (not exactly a Magical Experience) As I was leaving the baggage \"depot\" area, the manager was just coming in (a full 35 minutes after we had talked). The lifegaurds at the pool seemed militant and unfriendly patrolling the pool area like a swat team. The staff in general (other than the people working with the animals or acting as animal guides who were mostly friendly and eager to tell us about the animals) gave off the impression that they were not happy to be there or to help and anything they did was as some great favor to us... At night they had something called \"Night Viewing\" of the animals, an event advertised to be a lot of fun b/c they \"provided\" night vision goggles to see the animals with. My kids looked forward to it and to our utter amazement ONE nervous looking staff member came to the meeting space with ONE set of goggles to be shared by 20 kids who had to wait in line, hold the goggles up for 2 seconds and were then told (again militantly) to pass them on and share them. It was the most pathetic thing I have seen, topped only by the \"poolside kids games.\" One day they had (I am not kidding about this) a bucket of rubber duckies TIED to the side of the pool and two sand pails with shovels also tied to the side of the pool. That was a \"pool game.\" The next day they set up a basketball net in the pool, threw about 10 miniature basketballs in and let the 25 or so kids throw the balls in the net. This would have also been qualified as fun especially by my 8 year old son, IF THEY HAD NOT ABRUPTLY AFTER 10 MINUTES removed the net and balls from the pool! There was no supervision required for this game and my husband and I watched in amazement as the staff worker packed it all away as the kids looked on in disappointment. I was really, really surprised by this experience. For the amount of money we paid for this hotel we were shocked at how bad it was. Our conversations with other guests also proved that we were not just being picky or sensitive. EVERYONE we talked to here had complaints ranging from lost reservations upon check in, rude staff to lost luggage Last year we stayed at Universal Hard Rock on the concierge level and had possibly the best vacation ever. The Hard Rock definitely spoiled us and created expectations of a hotel that Animal Kingdom Lodge didn't even come close to meeting.

Our room was ready upon our arrival, nearly 3 hours early. The room was clean, smelled fresh and was stocked with plenty of towels, toiletries and extra bedding. Our pool view was slightly obstructed by a closed wall as opposed to a railing because we were on the 2nd floor and situated over a roof top.

The entire hotel is beautiful and filled with authentic African sounds and smells. The animals on the Savannah were gorgeous and always able to be seen from the public viewing areas. We ate in all three of AKL's restaurants and enjoyed them all. We loved the bugers at the quick service spot, the Mara. Boma was a wonderful buffet featuring exotic dishes along with standard American fare like chicken fingers for less adventurous diners. We also ate at the hotel's fine dining establishment, Jiko. The experience was wonderful beginning to end. The food was fantastic and the pace was relaxed (I've noticed that many Disney eateries tend to be rushed dining experiences).

One day they forgot to clean our room altogether. My husband had to call them at 6:00 at night, and we had to leave the room for a couple of hours so they could send someone to clean it. Not fun when you have two tired children who have been at the theme park all day. The pool is nice, and though there aren't a lot of animals, I did enjoy watching the giraffes and zebras around the resort. The food needs a major overhaul. The Mara \"cafeteria style\" is AWFUL, and if you want to eat at the other two restaurants be prepared to wait and pay a hefty sum. Room service is another option, and we resorted to this after being faced with a 2 1/2 hour wait at the Jiko. I found the bus transportation to operate without a hitch.

To be honest not what I had expected. The hotel is nice enough, but it's a 4 star because of the animals and lobby decor.. not for the service. Check in was slow process, & no-one would help you with your bags. You were given a map of the hotel & left to get on with finding your own room lugging your cases with you through a maze of corridors. Lobby is magnificent, with lovely views of the animals. Bongo drums beating all the time will drive you bonkers after 2 or 3 days though. Room was ok, spotlessly clean. Bathroom clean, but bath was tiny only 5ft long & and only around 12 inches deep, i think to accomodate for disabled guests. African themed room which was a bit dark for my liking, but nice none the less. Had a great king size bed. View from the tiny balcony was disappointing, we were on the Zebra trail on the 1st floor with a pool view (well if you are over 6ft tall you could see the pool over the large plants), god only knows how much it would cost to have a savannah view, but you have to book the savannah views in advance for an additional supplement. No minibar, but did have a fridge for own drinks etc Had an old TV with limited channels, but it worked so it served it's purpose. WARNING: Don't use the phone in the room. We made 10 5 mintue calls to UK & when we checked out discovered that they charge $14 per minute... our phone bill was $700 ... yes folks \u00c2\u00a37 per minute to the uk. There was no warning or tariff of charges. I wonder if they would ever have blocked the phone or informed us how much we were spending. Even the male receptionist was shocked & went to ask the manager if it was correct, but the manager came out to greet us and insinuted that more or less - tough luck, we should have known better, it's not the staffs job to monitor adults using room telephones!!! I also aksed about public transport to visit Busch gardens (which was rubbish incidently) & was told by the consierge that she was only there to inform us about disney products. She also said that she had no information on buses to the airport as that wasn't a disney either! (there's a free bus which runs from sea world but you have to book places info from sea world guest services) Restaurants & bar weren't all they are cracked up to be. The Mara self service menu never changes and is all very haphazard once you get to the service desk. Jiko & Boma very over rated only african cusine on the limited menu in Jiko which never changed. Had to make reservations in advance and even then you could not get a table to eat before 9pm. As for Disney parks & services. Everything as you would expect Disney bus service top class, we were never left waiting more than 5 or 10 mins. Saw building work going on, but I doubt that it would have dispruted anyones stay or enjoyment. In conclusion. Nice hotel. Brilliant holiday.

I was nervous about the construction going on, but I have to say that I heard only one saw one time and that was at the pool around 4PM. Nothing bothered us at all when we were in our room. I never SAW any construction. We stayed on the Zebra Trail room 4472 with a pool view. I know some people love the Savannah Views, but for us, we enjoyed the pool view just as much and enjoyed the animals as we walked to the elevators or the lobby area. This resort was wonderful and very unique. The rooms were very comfotable and if using the drawers provided rather than living out of luggage, there was plenty of room for my husband, myself and two children. Housekeeping was great. I did not expect my sheets to be CHANGED daily unless there was a real need, and since we were the only ones sleeping on them, it's a waste of water and energy. Our showerhead was brand new, which I'm sure that is due to the hard water that comes along with Florida. Transportion: Not a problem at all. During the whole visit we waitied no more than twice for a total of 10 minutes at the most. The buses just magically appeared it seemed the moment we walked up to the pick up point. The buses were never crowded and you never felt any angst in trying to get on the bus for fear of missing it and having to wait for the next one. If there had to be a downside, it would be the length of the bus ride - not as convenient as a monorail resort. A note to those with children. The resort is very animal conscious, so straws are not permitted on sight since they are a choking hazzard to the animals. Bring your sippy cups for the real little ones. Also, They do not allow balloons from the parks in your room, They will store them for you. So don't bother to buy a balloon if you planned for your child to enjoy it in the room.

I had heard that there was new construction and renovation going on in this hotel so I was a little worried that this might spoil our holiday. I needn't have worried, the only noise I heard was on one day throughout the two weeks and that was some drilling noise that could be heard in the hotel lobby. The new construction was out of sight-typical of Disney. We started off on the fifth floor in the Ostritch Trail. The room was very nice, clean, and quite recent decor. We were asked to move on our second week as this floor was being renovated for the Disney Vacation Club. We were moved and upgraded to a Savannah View room on the fourth floor of Kudu Trail for our inconvenience. I must say that if I had paid extra for this room I would have been disappointed. Although the room was clean the decor was very worn-bed covers faded and net curtains ripped on the patio door. Unless you are mad on having animals outside your window I wouldn't bother paying the extra. Other rooms having viewing windows on each floor. At the time of our holiday the Orlando area was suffering from swarms of black flies-must have been the mating season-and these were a pain. Unfortunately, the flies that were trapped in the hotel pool stayed there as the pool wasn't cleaned. The pool itself was ok but not huge, although it never got really crowded. There were plenty of sunbeds but if you wanted the ones nearest the pool or those that were in the sun all day you had to get there around 9-9.30am. The self service restaurant was ok but with the ususal junk food-burgers, fries, cakes, pizzas, crisps etc. There was some fresh fruit, side salads with Turkey and sandwiches with Turkey (everthing seemed to be with Turkey or cheese and everything same with some sort of dip). The menu for the cooked hot food didn't change at all and after 2 weeks it became very boring and unhealthy. There were no different sandwiches or salads and the cooked meal choice didn't change either. The two other restaurants Jiko and Boma were expensive for a family and we didn't like the menu anyway. The staff at the hotel were extremely friendly and welcoming, noticably different from the other Disney hotel. To sum up, the Animal Kingdom Lodge is a lovely hotel it has a beautiful lobby. I have stayed in a moderate Disney resort hotel and in my opinion there is not much difference in the standard of the rooms, the only difference is you have a balcony at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. I would stay there again purely because I felt it was quieter at night than the other Disney hotel that I have stayed in and although the food variety wasn't great they did have some healthy things to eat.

We had very hopes having read the reviews and seen the pictures of this place but were sadly disappointed. 25 minutes to speak to a receptionist, when we did get to speak to one it was hardly a warm welcome (i was particulalry upset as the receptionist was a fellow was a fellow Brit who couldn't even crack a smile). After an ordeal lugging our cases through endless corridors passing lots of porters that could have offered to help we get into our room. Having worked as a Duty manager myself in a hotel what i was presented with next simply beggars belief: Our room was placed on the ground floor thus offering very poor views but also had the added bonus of being in a corner of the block with rooms either side of us, in short it offered no privacy and one can only presume that the hotel had not been told the purpose of our stay. After moaning we were moved and full marks to the manager for his attitude and help, though the hotels gifts of manky srawberries, makny fruit and cheap champagne complete with card with incorrect name of bride and groom kinda made me feel their gestures was not so sincere. The next room was on the top floor with better views. \"There's building work going on but it won't affect you and as a result the animals like to move away from the noise and should migrate to outside your room\" was the promise both in person at the hotel and in a letter ONE WEEK prior to our stay. Hmm, there was building work going on and guess what, it was visible it was audable and yes it did affect what animals you saw and when. I was woken up to the sound of distant mechanical diggers more often than the sight of an african savannah that they promise in the videos but hey why should i worry it was honeymoon? Other things worth pointing out: I can't tell you what two of the restaurants are like as honeymoon or not it's very difficult to get a table. I can tell you that there's a fast-food restaurant there that has the same menu every night and i really do wonder what families with young kids must do. The lodge is poorly connected and we suffered arduous waits for buses to the various parks. Ever seen a reception desk completely unmanned in a four-star hotel? I have for several minutes and it wasn't a pretty sight. I was slightly confused at who this hotel is trying to appeal to. The four star four families with kids is a strange old mix and if your in the without child catagory then i doubt you'll be happy here. There's no place to get some quiet, even in the bar where the expensive cocktails go hand in hand with the sound of live african bongo's, interesting firs and e but not every night certainly not when you want to chill out after a days theme parking.

The Room: Very nice. We had 2 queen beds with a savannah view. the room was clean and comfortable. We loved the double sinks in the bathroom and the balcony overlooking the savannah was perfect - we saw lots and lots of animals. it seemed they were close enough to touch...almost. there were giraffes, warthogs, these oxen-like beast, vultures, ostriches and so many more i don't even know what they're called. I did have to ask housecleaning to change our sheets after the first night - they didn't do it on their own. Food: We dined at Jinko and the food was very good, the presentation excellent and the staff super friendly. The Environment: the lobby was fantastic. you just wanted to hang there because it was so cool with the vaulted ceilings, huge panoramic window and various carvings and exhibits to see within the huge lobby. Transportation: The shuttle service to and from various theme parks was so convenient. But beware, the drivers ask you to fold up your strollers before boarding. So, it becomes a drag. We just rented a stroller at the parks. Overall again: We got a good value for our money. We enjoyed our stay immensely and would definitely do it again! The Cons: ok, the shower head did have gunk on it, but i figured that was hard water stains or something. it wasn't fungus., tho. The pool was terrific, but beware if you're just lounging the love-bugs will swarm! they were everywhere, except in the pool.

The down side is that it is a far walk from the lobby (4-5 minutes), but we thought it was so worth it for the peace and quiet. The animals were amazing! We saw tons of animals from the balcony every day. I wouldn't recommend booking this hotel until construction is complete. However, if you were in the dark on the construction like we were and booked a room, this might be a good room request to make. I don't know how long this information is valid because the construction areas change, but I hope this helps someone going soon. Everyone was so wonderful to us and the front desk couldn't have been more helpful. Also, be sure to have a few drinks at the Victoria Falls lounge and try out Boma. We loved them both. The only reason this hotel didn't get a five is because of the construction.", "Date": "May 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel stayed in - ignore the petty bad reviews!!\u201d", "Author": "littlefluffy", "ReviewID": "UR7584090", "Content": "We have just come home from our honeymoon at the AKL and felt that I needed to write a review, after reading some of the reviews before we went I have to say I was a bit worried.

We checked in late evening and the reception staff were very helpful and found us the perfect room with a view looking out on to giraffes, red hogs, ostriches and many other animals. We saw these animals EVERY DAY, one day we even came back to find the giraffes (3 of them) lying down having a nap just a few feet away, it was amazing! We had excellent maid service, everyday they arranged our towels in a fun way and our room was cleaned to VERY high standards, we were topped up with soap, shower gel etc as soon as we needed it. I have seen alot of reviews saying that the rooms are small?! what?! They are definatly not small I have stayed in hotels with much smaller rooms, and the two queen sized beds we had in our room were the best hotel beds I have ever slept in! The decor of the hotel was fantastic It made you really feel that you were in an african hotel. The swimming pool was suprisingly warm and relaxing after a long day in the parks!

We used the Disney Magical Express option and just loved it. Disney give you special tags for your luggage, and when you depart for your flight to Orlando and check your luggage, you don't see it again until someone brings it directly to your room - usually three hours after you land. Ours showed up in under two! Some people have written complaining about the dark rooms. Yes, the rooms are dim, but not 'dark'. Bright glowing light from multiple rooms would light up the savanna, and disturb the animals rest. The animals are what makes this resort 'deluxe'. The room itself was quite nice. Small frig, TV, two sinks, nice balcony overlooking the savanna. Very peaceful. Well, until the construction started around 8ish each morning. They're working on much of the resort, and the vibrations do make they're way to your room. Didn't bother me much, personally. For the amount of work being done, it was quite discreet. I was a little upset that there was no shower cap or sewing kit available. One of my favorite pair of socks had a nice hole in the toe, and there's NO walking all day with THAT. After searching around, I found no sewing kit. Bit of a bummer, considering we did pay nicely for the room. Maybe it was from the incredible amount of walking you'll do at the resort AND the parks... but I found the beds just wonderful! The pillows just knocked me right out every night. The food is tasty provided you're not afraid to experience some different spices. You must try their special blend orange/mango juice. Yummy! If you're big coffee/tea/ice tea/soda drinker, it pays to invest in the $11.99 souviner mug with unlimited refills. Otherwise, they two dollar you to death every time you want a beverage. If you're staying at the AKL, be sure to remember what 'trail' you're on. This place is huge, and set up a bit like a bug, with the lobby being the 'body' and four long legs being the 'trails'. They have names like the Zebra Trail or the Giraffe Trail. When you check in, they will tell you which trail you are on. Do not forget it! There's no connection from one trail to the next except for the central lobby, so you'd having to walk all the way back where you started from to get to another trail. Everyone we spoke to from the hotel was very friendly and helpful. When my keycard wouldn't open the room door, my husband and I went to the lobby conceriege. The gentlemen working told me this happens all the time and that I must have put the card next to something with rechargeable batteries. I knew I shouldn't have put the camera in my handbag! Nonetheless, he reactivated and all was fine - fortunately, I noticed the card wasn't working when I was IN the hotel. Because this card is your pass to EVERYTHING, be sure not to deactivate YOURS and not find out until your already at a park.

We had high expectations -- perhaps too high. We had stayed at the Grand Floridian the last time we were at Disney and I think it gave us a false sense of reality. Pluses: The hotel is beautiful and unique. We had a Savannah view and seeing the animals right outside of the window was quite a treat. We booked the meal plan and that worked extremely well this visit. In fact, most dining locations were very accommodating and flexible in making the plan work for us. Also, we were concerned a bit that the distance to other parks would be an issue, but we never waited longer than 10 or 15 minutes for a bus, either to or from the hotel. The restaurants were extremely crowded --but not as fabulous as they were made out to be. It is clear that guests from other resorts come to AKL to sightsee and eat. We did enjoy Boma for dinner. Minuses: The room was pretty small. It also was not very clean. I will spare you the gory details, but we had to repeatedly request that housekeeping change the sheets on our beds and vacuum or sweep the floors. We also found the front desk staff/concierge staff to be short, curt and a bit condescending. Here are a few examples: Halfway through our stay, my \"key/admission ticket\" stopped working. Unfortunately, we found this out the hard way as I tried to enter one of the parks and was denied admission. To make a long story short, somehow our park admission was completely voided from our account, along with any charging privileges, etc. What a mess. They kept looking at us like we had done something to the card. Since they couldn't seem to figure out what happened in their systems, they chalked it up to a \"glitch\" in a computer software changeover that was taking place (during Spring Break??). They had to completely void our entire booking and re-book it into their computers -- twice -- before they could get it to work again. Also during our stay, we needed to mail some personal and business corresondence. We were directed to a mailbox just off the lobby. 9 days later, none of our mail has arrived at its destinations. We can't get any answers from the hotel other than \"the mail gets picked up everyday.\" Very frustrating.

The booking went smoothly and we received document packages in the mail with luggage tags and vouchers. Arrival: We flew on Delta/Song airlines to Orlando and got in around 10 am. We went to luch and then proceeded to the resort. On first impression the resort looked absolutely beautiful. The room: We were given the keys to the room and then we proceeded to walk a good 15 minutes to a room on the lobby level. Upon entering, we came to the quick realization that the room was definitely smaller than the master bedroom in the house. The closet was small and the beds were not very comfortable. There was dirt in the bed. There was no couch or anything. The carpet was unpadded. The bathroom had dirt on the sink with some sort of toothpast scum on the faucets. The toilet and shower are in the same room making it impossible for someone to use the toilet and take a shower. And there is no door separating the room from the sink area. At other hotels, the toilet is in a separate room which is nice. The AKL even ahs carpet in the sink area. If there was to have been a spill, I wish someone good luck trying to clean it. Our room was over the area where the animals are herded in the event of a hurricane. There were cigarettes dropped off the balcony too. There was an old tv. No LCD's here. There were no robes, no slippers, no mini bar. The decor was tacky. There was absolutely nothing about the resort that made it luxuious. It is a disney deluxe property. Housekeeping: Fresh toiletries and towels had to be asked for as housekeeping didn't leave them more often than not. The toiletries are not good at all. There is no conditioner/body wash, just shampoo and lotion, and a bar of soap, in paper with mickie mouse on it. Disney used to provide big toiletry sets with sewing kits. The sewing kits have been eliminated, and the toiletry sizes have been cut in half. The towels were industrial style too. The housekeeping was awful. Pool: The AKL has only one pool. Other disney hotels including the all stars have at least 2. There is a crappy slide, with a life guard yelling at poeople for going down headfirst down the slide that a 5 month old could even go down. The jacuzzis are not hot and the pool comes standard with floating hospital debris such as bandaids. Other: Turn down service had to be requested. They left you a small chocolate and a computer generated note. It did not feel personable at all. The staff weren't overly friendly and the gift shop does not open when the say they will. We managed to sneak up to the concierge level and all the crackers and food was gross looking andd just displayed on a table. Definitely not worth the upgrade. We called and complained about housekeeping when we got home and the manager was extremely rude blaming everything on us. He said that the housekeepers could not read notes because many were illiterate! I was appaled. A month later we received 3 one day ultimate park hopper tickets. They never expire, but we won't use them. They are going on ebay. I high suggest staying away from the AKL. Oh and the bus system is absolutely horrible. Stay at the Grand Floridian or the Polynesian. The Wilderness Lodge was much better. If you are going to stay at one of the lodges, stay at the Wilderness Lodge.", "Date": "April 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place To Stay\u201d", "Author": "Hollie3", "ReviewID": "UR7195775", "Content": "We went to disney on a 4 day land 3 day cruise package.

The grounds are beautiful. We had breakfast at Boma, their restaurant on the ground floor. Breakfast was amazing. It was a buffet with everything from fresh fruit, to pancakes, french toast, every pastry you could want and even cereal for the kids. The resort advertised that it had a health spa. And sure enough, it was a real gym!!! This gym was better than the gyms you see at most apartment complexes. It opened bright and early at 6 AM for those who wanted to get a workout in before starting the day. The provided towels on all the machines and the walls are lined with televisions. The hot tub was to die for. It was open past midnight and was amazing. We sat in it everyday, lol, sometimes more than once a day. Their is a bar by the pool and if you can sneak a drink to the hot tub, you will be in heaven! The animals are out playing and you are able to take pictures of them, even if you don't have a room with a view of the animals. I cannot say a single bad thing about this place. Check in was easy, check out was easy. Towels were brought immediately after calling about them. The room was cleaned spotless every day and fresh towels provided when we arrived back at the hotel everyday. I'm not sure about paying regular price for this hotel, because it is expensive. But the saying, \"you get what you pay for\" is extremely true when it comes to the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Everything was the absolute best. Even the gift shop located in the lobby.

We stayed on the club level in a \"deluxe\" room - which as far I could tell by was different from \"regular\" room in that it was about 2 foot longer. A standard two queen beds, 2 chairs, table, amoir- with-TV layout - but again, very nicely decorated. We had a good size balcony that overlooked the interior savannah. We could see giraffs, zebras, some other animals - but they were never very close. The club level offered breakfast, snacks during the day, hot snacks at night (enough for dinner for us light eaters), and desserts later in the evening. A great expresso machine, soft drinks, beer, wine, cordials, juice were available all the time. Finally, and best of all, was the staff of this hotel. Everyone was very friendly, helpful, and there when we needed assistance. We never saw the housekeepers, but they did a great job cleaning the room and turning down beds each day. The hotel has many staff from different African nations. The ones we encountered we ready to answer questions, talk about most anything, and generally gracious \"hosts\" to their hotel guests. They conducted several tours and classes (some specifically for children). We did not attend any of these, but there was a good variety listed. One thing that bothered my husband about this hotel was the location. It is located on the edge of the WDW property and there is nothing within walking distance. He prefers the hotels that have more options. On the other hand I liked the feeling of being secluded, away from the rest of the rush of WDW.

This was my first trip to Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge. I expected it to be much like my experiences at Disney's Wilderness Lodge. The hotel was easy to find with Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signage around the property. Granted many of the road signs you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not used to because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in purple and black, but the hotel is setback in a nice quiet portion of the Animal Kingdom complex. Gate security guided me to check-in parking. At check-in there was a five minute wait, and then I spent another 10 minutes waiting as they had misspelled my name on the reservation. Eventually I was off to my room. Since I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know much about the hotel I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to request as far as rooms go. Well, I come to find that many of the rooms border the safari where animals will actually come up to your guest room. The safari is a very cool experience that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very unique to this hotel this is an attraction designed especially for those traveling with children that love animals (and what kid doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t!). The room was on the fourth floor which is only one floor above the main entrance on level three. I found the room to be typical of Disney resorts. Very clean, neat and orderly. The room was decorated in typical Disney fashion holding to the theme of the hotel. I had a double room with a comfortable bed and found it was easy to work on business. Disney offers what they call High Speed Internet access, but after speaking with coworkers we all agreed that they need to reconsider use of the terms, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high speed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I apologize to those that desire actual upload/download test speeds. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a fan of the bathroom design that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open and without a closing door, but the toilet and shower are in a room with a locking door. I was a bit upset that Disney had seemingly switched toiletry products as I really like their sweet smelling personal care products that they had on prior visits. The only problem I encountered on the entire visit was with the shower head in the bathroom. he head had a bad build up of grime which locals tell me is typical in Florida after a few years. I then turned on the showerhead to find that the water flowed in dozens of directions. I quickly phoned the front desk for maintenance to replace the showerhead, which they did in less than half an hour. I walked throughout the safari game area and pool, but did not eat at this resort. Though I did check out the buffet, but decided not to eat there when I noticed very dirty glass on the sneeze guards (yuck). Overall I was pleased with this hotel, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely bring my family here again. Though if it were between the Animal Kingdom and Wilderness Lodges, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to choose the Wilderness Lodge, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a fan of their theme and food.", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rutland, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation\u201d", "Author": "shadowryter", "ReviewID": "UR6841637", "Content": "This is an abolutely beautiful hotel. You could probably spend a half a day or more just taking in the views and all the African themed artifacts. This is also a large hotel so if you have any reservations about walking after walking the parks all day, you might want to request a room closer to the lobby. We had a lovely Savannah view room and we did see some animals. The problem here is if you are going to be at the parks all day you may not have optimal viewing time. So, if you don't have a room with a view there are still plenty of places to see the animals but again it would seem that timing is of the essence here. On our last day we went to Arusha Rock but were told they would not be back until 11:30. We were checking out by 10. That aside, we had an unforgettbale stay.

We could not have asked for a better trip! If you are having doubts about staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge because of other reviews, don't!!!! It is great! We travel all over the country, and this was one of the most unique, and fun places we have stayed. We have stayed on Disney World property 2 times prior to this at the Port Orleans Riverside and the All Star Movies Resort. If you can afford it, the Animal Kingdom Lodge is worth the money and has far more things to do on property that the other 2 that I mentioned. For a couple, who enjoy animals, we loved it! We booked a Standard view room in October of 2007 because of budget constraints, but still wanted to stay at AKL. When we checked in, we were automatically upgraded to a Savannah view room. We looked onto the Sunset Savannah on the west wing of one of the trails. I can't remember what the trail was called. Our room was almost at the farthest end of the wing, and although it was a little walk, it was not any farther than what you walk at the other resorts to your room. Our room was amazing for two people. Being on the same floor as the lobby, we had great views of the animals. As soon as we opened the door to our room we were greeted by 2 giraffes right outside our balcony. They were there every night when we returned from the parks and slept outside our balcony at night. It was so cool! The other animals were around most of the time as well. It was fantastic! The pool and jacuzzis on the property are great, as are the restaurants. We ate at Jiko the first night we were there. The service was great and the food fantastic. We ate at Boma for breakfast and dinner. Both times the food was really good. A little noisy, but oh well, no big deal. The location of the resort is not a problem , because the bus system runs so smoothly. We never waited more the 5 minutes for a bus to the parks. The furthest park is Magic Kingdom and it only took about 10 minutes to get there and it drops you off right in front of the turnstiles. So, you can't beat that. Animal Kingdom park is only about a 3 minute ride. We went to Disney World purposely in January because the crowds are supposed to be thin...and they were, as were the crowds at the resort. This made the experience all the better. We walked on all the rides. No more than a 5 minute wait and that was for Soar'in; a new ride at Epcot. The only negative about the whole experience was the cold weather while we where there. It was unseasonably cold...no shorts, but no lines! The trade off was worth it! We enjoy the whole Disney experience, both at Disney World and Disneyland. If you don't; then please don't go with a bad attitude, write negative reviews because you hated having to go, and make others dought thier decision. If you are wanting to have a great Disney vacation, and have the money to spend, and you want to stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge because of the animals and the Afican themeing; then go for it, you will like it! Also, if you are looking for good guide books to help organize your trip, the Passporter is awesome and the Unofficial Guide to Disney World is great.

Had healthful selections as well as regular fare. Great for families with small kids..no waiting! The pool and hot tubs were great too. The hotel offers life vests for little ones which was a nice touch. The kids loved coming home from Disney and jumping in the pool which is kept quite warm and has a beach type entrance. The lobby is breathtaking and has couches and tvs with cartoons playing for the little ones. All in all..it was a fantastic hotel..my first time at a Disney hotel.

Our previous visit was in the inaugural year - 2001. On our first visit we were totally blown away by the resort and loved it.We came back and i was a little worried that a second visit wouldnt measure up.We were totally wrong!It was just as lovely as the first time. First i'd like to correct some misconceptions about the lodge.The only time a bus will stop at another loation is if you are going to either downtown disney,or the MGM bus which makes infrequent stops at the 2 water parks. Every other bus is direct to the location and NOT shared with any other resort. If you are trying to get to any other resort, it is a bit lengthier, but not hours like some people said.The first time we were there we didnt visit other resorts.This time we went to -the Grand Floridian, The Polynesian, The Contemporary,The Wilderness Lodge and the Yacht Club. Never once did it take more than 1 hour, and that was because we stopped at the park for a souvenir. The only way you are going to get resort to resort transportation is if you stay at the monorail resorts - which run $200 a night more than the AKL. Another misconception - the dark factor.Yes it is subdued but i wouldnt classify it as dark. I'm curious as to what people were expecting - don't you look at photos of a hotel before you stay there? I know i sure do.Anyone who looked at a picture of the hotel would have clearly seen its decor. One thing i will admit - your room location can make or break your experience. Ther eare some really bad views -like the wall which is classified as a pool view or the savannah view that overlooks the restaurant exhaust fans. When reserving a room here i would note it on your reservation (if booking with Disney direct - and trust its always the best way) that you do not want any room with either a partially obstructed view, or near the restuarants. Another valid complaint is that the rooms are small for a family.They are 341 sq. feet, the same size as the Wilderness Lodge, but smaller than any other Disney Deluxe resort. The resort is basically a sub deluxe resort, and the price reflects that... the Grand Floridian or the Contemporary will cost hundreds more per night. We are a family of four and we did it for 8 nights, but we live in a small home and are used to being on top of each other all the time.. another family might not be able to. We had a room on the 3rd floor lobby level this time - last time we had a 2nd floor view. It's pretty much equal, but i personally like the second floor as we are avid photographers and like the close up photo possibilities. I didn't really find the lobby level more noisy. We were on th Arusha Savannah again (this is the big one in the center) but on the Kudu trail this time (last time we were on the opposite side, the Zebra Trail) We had lovely views of the Arusha Rock, a watering hole with lots of birds, and trees.We saw giraffe, and Bongos, and Elands.We also saw zebra but they werent as close this time. There are lots more kids activities this time.Last time it was still a new hotel and they hadnt developed a kids program yet.This time they had crafts at the pool every day, as well as cookie decorating at Boma, and lobby activities like scavenger hunts and art. They also had a table in the lobby during the afternoon with objects that the kids could touch and 2 guides from Africa who answered questions and joked with the kids. I have never eaten at Jiko, but if you are a fan of exotic foods and fine wines, i'd say you'd enjoy it. We visited Boma for breakfast and enjoyed it. The Mara is good, but if your staying for more than 5 days, you do start to get tired of it, they need to offer more variety. The Zawadi marketplace is wonderful and they have a \"Primal Parade \" at night where the kids pick instruments and march around the store and lobby making music. My 2 kids (7&2) loved it. The store is HUGE (it is the largest on any Disney resort) and has lots of standard Disney stuff as well as items unique to AKL.

I complained to the front desk and they immediately switched us to room 4457. No hassles, just an apology and an immediate fix. Priceless! The view from the new room was fantastic. We saw giraffe, antelope, kudu, ankole cattle and a wide variety of birds each day. Jiko and Boma were excellent - make reservations early! The Mara is very cafeteria-like with burgers, pre-made salads, pizza, chips, etc. It's an okay alternative if you're in a hurry but don't expect much in the \"taste\" category. Prices are super high at Jiko and Boma. We paid $50 for the breakfast buffet each morning for a family of 3. But the food was excellent and the service and atmosphere top notch. I think each staff member throughout the hotel surpassed my expectations. Even the cafeteria (Mara) clean up crew had smiles and warm greetings for everyone! The pool is a bit small for such a large hotel but we didn't swim very often as our main objective was to see the parks. The Disney bus system was perfect - even the long hike to Magic Kingdom seemed effortless with a new bus arriving/departing every 10 minutes or so. Very convenient if you have little ones. This place is low-key and less centered around the kids. Yes, they were everywhere - it is Disney after all - but you never felt crowded or stressed by crying babies or screaming tikes (Mara excluded). For some reason this hotel does a better job at crowd placement. Maybe it's the design...very spread out and that means a long walk to restaurants, pool, game room, etc...but in my opinion, that's a good thing.

We like to hear a fan noise to drown out other unpleasant noises such as people talking in the halls or kids running down the hallways. Secondly, and probably due to the quiet air system, you could hear the people above and beside your rooms. All walking, water running, toilet flushing, and other noises could be heard clearly...all night long. Thirdly, the pool claimed to be heated, but it was almost unbearably cold. We stayed at a Courtyard by Marriott for 2 days before going to the Lodge...the pool at the Courtyard was heated like a hot tub almost....it was wonderful. If the pool at Animal Kingdom had been even close to warm, our whole stay would have been much better. I do think that Animal Kingdom Lodge was a great place.

Excellent greeting and our room was ready! Our room, although clean, was a bit depressing for me. I'm not sure what I expected but everthing was so dark! Very dark wood furniture, dark curtains, and dark golden walls. Lighting was woefully inadequate for reading. However, our view of the savannah was spectacular.

Day 3-I called and requested early housekeeping service as we were to return to the room around 1pm because of an anticipated late night. When we returned at 1:30pm, the room wasn't done up yet.

Got up to the room and before entering the room we could tell that somone was smoking in there - completely smelt like an ashtray in there. Not very happy but before we could even call the desk somone knocked on the door and said somone complained of the smell and after a few hours it was gone.

The shower head was all scummy i didnt even want to touch it because it was so gross looking. on the 3rd or 4th day somone put a stinky diaper in the hall way and somone must of accidently stepped on it because it was all over the floor- that was there all night and in the morning i finally had to call somone to remove it because i got sick of smelling it - I know people had to see it because room service came by that night to drop off dinner to us and also in the morning somone delivered the paper to us. The lighting is very very dim there as a lot of others have mentioned i would compare it to candlelight. Food - very very expensive. There are 2 restuaraunts here and a marketplace. There is also room service. We tried room service twice, very very very expensive. I had an omlet with a bottle of water my wife had a waffle both were very small but for the 2 items it was $46 = rip-off. There isnt many selections in the marketplace area. The restuarant Boma was always packed we got in there for a morning breakfast and that was $16.99/person - I wasnt too impressed with that either. Sights- the sights out of the savanna view were pretty good - one day we saw a giraffe go by - other then that i think most the animals pretty much stay put. In our area we saw mostly these ankhole cattle things and ostrich.

Yes it is a bit pricey but where else in the U.S. can you see giraffe and other animals from your room balcony? Plus since it is a Disney resort you get all the added Walt Disney World perks that come from staying in a Disney hotel. This includes free transportation to all of their theme parks and also gives you access to extra magic hours in the park (certain hours the parks are open exclusively to those staying in a Disney hotel). It has 3 great restaurants from casual to elegant plus tons of activities for the kiddies. I like it better than Disney's much pricier Grand Floridian which is nice but not as warm and comfortable. Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge is much newer and nicer than Disney's Contemporary and Polynesian resorts which are much older and about the same price. Though its a 4.0 star hotel, its very casual and comfortable too, most people walk around in shorts and t-shirts so its not stuffy at all. The employees at the resort are great too, very nice and friendly and knowledgeable but not snooty like at other 4.0 star resorts. This resort is the closest one to Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park but a bit away from the Magic Kingdom.

Our experience was excellent from start to finish, but I believe traveling during the off season made a huge difference. The reservation process was smooth through Travelocity, and when we arrived to check in early on our arrival day it was no problem as plenty of rooms were ready. We were asked about room preferences as far as location in the hotel, high/low floor, etc. and were very pleased with the room we received. We had a savanna view room on the 4th floor overlooking the Uzima Savanna. It was incredible being able to sit on our balcony and view the many different animals. There were 5 giraffes, one of them young, that were fun to watch. I would only recommend a savanna view room if you can plan to spend at least a couple of hours of your day relaxing in your room/on the balcony watching the animals. It's a very relaxing break from the parks, especially when the weather is nice. If you don't have a savanna view room there are many nice places at the hotel where you can view the animals. This is not a hotel where you can overdose on Disney characters, but it definitely has a Disney feel to it. Only at Disney World can you find a hotel such as this that makes you feel like you have entered another country. The hotel has a lodge theme, but it is very elegant. The hotel is a mix of light/bright and dark/warm. There are large windows all around the hotel that allow you to see animals on the savannas as you walk down the corridors. The lobby is incredible, as are the hotel grounds. I was afraid I had built up huge expectations, so much that I might only be disappointed upon arrival. AKL managed to far exceed all expectations I had developed. I was very nervous about cleanliness as some reviews mention dirty rooms. Our room was very clean and everything in the room was in very good condition. The room was also nicely lit. It was not the bright sterile light you might find at many hotels, but the room had a very warm feel. The theme is African safari, so don't stay here if you can't get into that. AKL has been very well maintained all around and it still looks new to me. It is not as far from the parks as many seem to think. It may seem that way if your only means of transportation is the Disney bus system. If you rent a car you can self park at the hotel for free, and you also get free parking at the parks which otherwise would cost $10 per day. If renting a car, I would recommend trying Dollar. Go to Mousesavers web site and you can find discount codes. I was able to reserve a mid size car for $108 per week. At Dollar's web site you can sign up for Dollar Express for free. There is a special line at the Dollar desk in the airport for Express members. I was able to get through the rental process in less than 5 minutes, then you go right out the door to the parking garage to get your car. In the past we have stayed off Disney property and it seemed fine. To stay on site has changed things. Not having to leave Disney property is a great as the area immediately outside of Disney is not all that attractive. Staying at the AKL provides a secluded feel, but it is no more than a 10 minute drive to the furthest park, Magic Kingdom. Animal Kingdom is about 2 minutes from the hotel. This hotel is large, but it is laid out in a U shape so even the furthest rooms are not that far out. Our room was about 3/4 of the way towards then end of the Zebra Trail, but it was not a long walk to the lobby. We walked a lot during the trip, but it's Disney and you're going to do a lot of walking. If you're not into walking, I don't recommend a trip to Disney at all! I would try to avoid rooms on the Sunset Savanna. This part of the hotel has rooms on either side with a smaller savanna in the middle. From the Sunset Overlook in the lobby it just didn't look that great. On that side of the hotel you are also very far away from the pool and restaurants. The pool area is nice and the pool is quite large. There are lots of trees, creating the feel of being at a lake on the savanna. There is also an area close to the pool where you can look out on to the Uzima Savanna. At night there are guides at this overlook that have night vision binoculars for guests to use. There are not a lot of animals out to see at night but it is still a fun experience. The pool area also has 2 separate spa areas that are very nice. We did not eat at the hotel restaurants, but ate most meals in the parks. I highly recommend the Brown Derby (get the Cobb salad) and Mama Melrose's in MGM. At Epcot we ate at the Teppenyaki restaurant in Japan which was fun as they cook at your table. The food was expensive at these restaurants but very good. The counter service restaurants at most parks pretty much serve the same types of food, burgers, chicken, etc. and it is just Ok. If you go to Downtown Disney, try The House of Blues. We have always had good experiences there with the food and service. Next time we would consider the Disney Dining Plan as it would have saved us some money. I thought we would end up eating more meals off Disney property, but didn't want to enter the outside world again until we had to. Disney is a fun and relaxing place to be when it's not crowded. If you can travel during off peak weeks you can have an incredible experience. AKL would lose some of it's charm when packed to capacity, but the same can be said for other Disney hotels, parks, restaurants, etc. By using web sites such as disboards, allearsnet, mousesavers and especially the services of tourguidemike we found a great week to visit. Tour Guide Mike's web site access will cost you $20 but it is money well spent as it helps you avoid crowds and enhances your overall Disney experience. Sign up when you are trying to decide when to go as this is where TGM's expertise really helps point you in the right direction. Sorry for the long review, but I feel many of the negative reviews come from people who had a bad experience or two during their trip and came home with an axe to grind. Disney can be frustrating if you expect everything to go exactly as you have planned. If you go with the flow and don't sweat the small stuff you will have a great experience.", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Animal Kingdom Lodge\u201d", "Author": "travelgirl2005", "ReviewID": "UR6148605", "Content": "We just got back from a week at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge.

Unfortunately the view was somewhat lacking. This is the hit or miss part. We were directly above a concrete paved area that extended a good 100 feet out into the savannah, which kept any animals from getting anywhere near our balcony. Beyond that, we barely saw any animals, but that's hard to fault as we were only there for 1 night. Boma was a rare treat with some interesting and tasty dishes, but at $25/pp seemed a bit steep for a pretty casual meal. Forget the Morrocan beers that we $7 or 8 a piece!!!

As Sarah checked us in, I mentioned that this was my son's 16th birthday trip, and she presented him with a birthday button - a very nice gesture. We have travelled extensively and found our room on the Giraffe Trail to be very clean, well lit, of comfortable size, and appropriately decorated in the African theme. Knowing that we were not going to be spending a great deal of time in our room, we did not chose to spend an extra $200 to have a savannah view room, and that proved to be a wise choice. The gift shop was a great place to pick up souvenirs and the Mara was a good option for a quick bite. We appreciated the large coin-operated laundry rooms as well. We will definitely return to the Animal Kingdom Lodge in the future and highly recommend it to others. It is off the beaten path, but that was a plus in our opinion.

We arrived at the hotel late at night after a delayed flight and a misdirected road journey and found the front desk staff helpful and friendly, we were efficiently and accurately directed to our room which we reached after a reasonable walk. The rooms reflect Africa - if you are expecting the bright shiny offerings of Marriot, Hilton or Radisson look elsewhere, the lighting and decor attempt to offer authenticity and so can appear gloomy, get in the mood you will soon appreciate it! Open the drapes to be confronted by zebras grazing in the simulated moonlight about 25 yards from your window -the effect was to cause us to speak in whispers to each other to avoid scaring the animals. The beds were comfortable, the plumbing was efficient, housekeeping was efficient and friendly, the hotyel staff were very helpful and efficient. The restaurants were excellent, try Boma, the buffet meal may seem initially expensive but look around Orlando for similar value and you can certainly find cheaper meals but add in the quality factor and you will find this restaurant is a secret bargain. Try new things, enjoy the steak, fill up on your favourite. Mara offers a canteen type service, my wife fell in love with the butternut squash soup ( takes all sorts), if you are staying longer than a weekend it is worth purchasing refillable cups from here at a cost of $11.99 each as refills of coffee and soda are free for the duration of your stay. The African stew served in a bread loaf is well worth a try too. The Victoria Falls bar on the mezzanine floor is largely forgetable, there are no draught beers and the place has little atmosphere, with barflies watching TV sport above the bar and tables being arranged cafeteria style in the remaining space. Would I recommend it to you? Yes but bear in mind it has a strong theme which you can't escape. Would I go there again? Based on this experience 100% yes. What could be better? This hotel attracts a lot of people who are full of their own importance and sadly their precious children too - the sound of whinging kids is never far away but I have no suggestions to offer to improve this. The valet parking costs $7 a day and attracts people who delight in parking and loading/unloading directly in front of the hotel entrance, might not seem a big deal as you read this before your visit but believe me at the end of a long day trekking through the parks with sore tootsies diverting around a VIP SUV can seem a step (or two) too far. This is easily cured though - go to your room look at the animals, be they zebras, cows, gazelles or pelicans send the kis to fetch coffee from Mara and you will soon chill.

If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to 'do' Disney, however, you might as well do it properly, and therefore stay on the property. I'd guess that this is one of the better places to do so. On the plus side, it's rather intriguing in design and setting, offers accommodation of a high standard, and has pretty good facilities (pool, gym and so on). On the other hand, you have to accept that you are 'a number not a name': there is an efficient system which generally works, but it's on a fairly impersonal scale, and the staff's friendly demeanour cannot disguise the fact that this is effectively some sort of Stalinist state. Your room still not made up at 6pm? Housekeeping says they can schedule 10.30 (in a family hotel). Only when you hint you might make a bit of a fuss does it get done sooner. It's on the food and drink side that the place really falls down. There are only three options (which is not many in a place with a thousand-odd rooms). There is a fast-food caf\u00c3\u00a9 (in a style which the snobbier sort of Europeans will find odd in any hotel) plus two restaurants. The cheaper of theses actually does quite interesting African-themed food, but charm in a 400-seater buffet is necessarily elusive. Even when you book, you'll be given a bleeper to come back when a table is actually available. The 'fine dining' restaurant is more civilsed (even if you do still have to wait for the bleep) but not much more characterful and the food seems much less interesting. The under-sized bar, to end on a flat note, is a disgrace. Understaffed, undermanaged, under-cleaned, and with sometimes quite rude staff who seemed to have not the slightest understanding of what the job really entails, it is a travesty of what a hotel bar should be.

I suppose we are Disney \"veterans\" since we've stayed at many Disney properties including the Beach Club, the Grand Floridian, the Polynesian and now, the Animal Kingdom Lodge. We spent 3 nights at Disney, then two more at Universal's Portofino Hotel. When planning our prevous Disney trips, we often considered AKL, but we always chose another property because we were afraid that the Lodge was too far removed from the Disney theme parks (other than Animal Kingdom, of course). Our experience with the Disney bus system has been mixed. We like to get to the parks early, ride everything, then spend the crowded afternoon hours by the pool. Waiting for the bus can put a crimp in those plans, as waits of 30-40 minutes are not uncommon. In addition, the buses seldom take you straight from your hotel to the park of your choice. Usually there are several stops along the way. We typically avoid these problems by staying at one of the hotels on disney's monorail route (Grand Floridian, Contemporary or the Polynesian). Of these, we prefer the Polynesian, because it is located at the transportation hub, where you can get direct monorail or boat service to Magic Kingdom or Epcot, and the buses seem to come more frequently to the other parks (for MGM, it's better to monorail to Epcot, the take a boat). However, for this trip, these hotels were booked, so we decided to take a chance on AKL. Overall, our experience was quite pleasant. The hotel was exotically decorated, and the animal show outside your own window did not disappoint. Zebra, giraffe, wildebeast, and many animals I could not identify (though Disney provides a key in each room). Very nice. The biggest problem we had was the water pressure. both the shower and sink were awful. It was extremely difficult to shave or brush my teeth under the puny trickle that came out of the faucet. The shower had a unique low-flow head which made it impossible to wash the shampoo out of your hair. I called the front desk to see if the problem was resort-wide or limited to our room, and they fed me some cheery palaver about saving water. The room was small, and the outdoor deck was tiny. My wife assures me that the shampoo and soap were of very poor quality. The towels were tiny and thin. So it's not the Four Seasons, but I didn't expect it would be. The service was generally good, and the room was quiet. We always request a room on a high floor away from the elevators. At Disney, this can mean quite a hike to the elevators from your room, but it generally assures you of a quiet night's rest. Room service messed up our order, but the food they brought was ok. we were on the 4th floor with a savannah view, one floor below the Concierge floor, which is the top floor. This seemed to provide the best view of animals without obstructions like trees and fences. The third floor was the lobby floor, and it seemed to be quite a bit noisier than the other floors. Every time we go to Disney, we learn a new trick. Mastering the fastpass system, going during the few (relatively) uncrowded times, and learning to ride everything in the morning or late evening to avoid crowds are all key components of enjoying your Disney vacation. This time, we learned that resort guests who rent a car do not need to pay for parking at the theme parks. This innovation took all the guesswork out of getting around Walt Disney World. We didn't have to wait for the bus, and we were able to come and go as we pleased. Definitely worth the cost of renting a car. Also, since we were heading to Universal anyway, renting a car saved us at least four expensive taxi trips. Note also that AKL did not charge for guest parking, though there was a smal valet fee if you chose not to self-park. We did not eat at Jiko, the fancy restaurant at AKL, but we had breakfast every day at Boma, which is a very good buffet. We also ate at the Japanese restaurant at Epcot, which my son loved (they cook the food in front of you Benihana-style), and at the All Star Cafe at the Sport Complex -- AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. Painfully slow service and the worst food I've ever paid for. Just stay away. We found the parks to be more crowded than we expected in October. Disney has developed a strategy where, during certain seasons (Christmas, Halloween, etc), they close the Magic Kingdom early and make you pay about $30 per person to get back in for a \"party\" which typically includes a parade plus some giveaway food items (candy for halloween, hot chocolate for Christmas). in past years ,we enjoyed these parties, because we could ride popular rides without long lines. This year, however, the party was just as crowded as the regular park attendance. We felt ripped off, having already paid for a park hopper pass to get into all the parks for the length of our stay. I hate to dwell on the negative because we really had a grest time. The new Yeti rollercoaster at Animal Kingdom is not to be missed (get a fastpass). Mission Space was awesome (though it made me really sick), and the rental car made staying at the remote AKL hassle-free.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Graham, NC", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "GrahamCrackerMom", "ReviewID": "UR6005707", "Content": "My husband and I and our 2 children, ages 6 and 9 stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge for a week in October. I was intriqued by the idea of being able to see wild animals from the balcony of my room and thought the kids would too. The hotel itself is gorgeous! Lots of native African art, very spacious. The staff was outstanding. Our room was very small. 1 queen bed, set of bunk beds for the kids. There was a small table and 2 chairs. Fortunately the sink/vanity area was seperate from the toilet/shower. Trying to get dressed and out in the morning was a horror! There was simply no room to manuver. The view was very nice from the balcony, but again, there was barely room for a small table and 2 chairs. We were in a Savannah View room and the walk to the lobby about wore us out before we started. I suggest you request a room as close to the lobby as possible. There are viewing sites all over the place where you can relax comfortably to see the animals. Be prepared for another long walk to the bus stops. And once you get to the park, you will face another hike, the buses don't drop you off at the ticket area but in the transportation section. Other than that, everything was great! Try the 2 restaurants at least once, but for quick, easy dining opt for the Mara, located near the pool. They are open from 6 a.m. until 11:30 p.m. and serve quick, tasty meals. You can also purchase beer, wine and snacks here.

I read the trip advisor reports avidly before I go and if you are considering a stay here it's worthwhile doing but try to stay objective as some reports are misleading. Firstly, the rooms are not dark. They are not neon sparkling but very cool and restful. They are also immaculate as are all the public areas. I booked a pool view (which our family had one night in and it was fine) in the hope that we would get an upgrade to a savanna view. There are vastly more savanna views than pool or standard view (parking lot) so the chances are even if you go when it's busy with a pleasant request to the front desk you may be accommodated. The savannas all vary with certain ones having a more compelling view but you will see animals of some sort in all of them . A high floor, 4 or above will ensure you see it as a panorama and can appreciate it better. One of my daughters was enchanted with the animals the other I reckon was on the balcony once to look at them in the 2 weeks! The bus shuttles to the park were very good. Its rubbish to suggest its hours to get anywhere. About 20 minutes was the longest wait (we did that twice) when we had clearly just missed a bus. The furthest park was Magic Kingdom which was still a very reasonable 15-20 minutes away. No travelling by car and parking etc can beat that. The pool water as other guests have mentioned is not refreshing it is rather warm. This might be because it is shallow, which suits if you are travelling with children and do not want them out of their depth. My children did love the pool and it certainly didn't put them off. All in all my family enjoyed their stay. It's a lovely place to enjoy your Disney holiday.", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!\u201d", "Author": "Traveler1923", "ReviewID": "UR5912738", "Content": "We spent a few days at the Animal Kingdom Lodge in mid September.

So after a long day at Disney World, it was hard to find something to eat when we returned. The hotel offers several wildlife viewing stations throughout the property. We were able to see several giraffes and zebras. They even provided nightvision goggles to view the animals at night. Transportation to and from the theme parks was very easy. There were several shuttle buses that would stop at the property and take you to the parks. We hardly ever had to wait for very long.

This was our third time staying here and I wouldn't stay anywhere else! We were here for 9 nights and could have stayed longer! My husband and my 3 and 8 year old sons loved looking out over our balcony to see animals just wandering by. The property has a lot of acreage so there weren't a lot of animals all the time, but there was always a wildebeast, giraffe, zebra or watusi nearby. There are also ostriches and other birds too. Because we love the theme parks, we didn't get to spend too much time at the resort but when we were there we participated in the kids activities. They have learning centers where the kids learn about African cultures, animals, etc. Since my son was out of school I loved that he was learning something new and be able to share it with his classmates. We love good ethnic food so we couldn't wait to go back to Boma. The African buffet was awesome once again. My kids love it and my husband and I decided to go back once again, so we went back for our last dinner there. Jiko was just fabulous. The African wine was amazing and the service impeccable. We grabbed food from Mara when we were rushing and trying to get out the door for the parks in the am. We were usually up pretty early so we didn't have to wait in long lines to grab food at Mara. Our last morning when we had a late start there was a huge line and I decided to forego eating there and eat at the Magic Kingdom instead. One thing to be aware of. Disney is really pushing the Disney Dining Plan. We were there at a time when the park was pretty much empty and we were able to get right on the rides without lines, BUT since more people are using the dining plan, it was really hard to get into sit down restaurants. I always make reservations ahead of time and this time my husband said \"let's play it by ear,\" so I only had a few reservations. What a mistake that was. The places we wanted to visit were completely sold out. Even Boma was sold out a few nights. A few restaurants will take you but after 8pm and my kids were too tired to stay up. I highly recommend that you make reservations for dining ahead of time. This is for any sit down meal, lunch, bfast or dinner, at the parks or the resort. You can always cancel them but at least you will have an option to a sit down meal if you want one. The room was cleaned every day. The room was nice. The boys had a bunk bed which they loved and we had a double which was fine. The only drawback, which was not too bad for us is that since the Animal Kingdom Lodge is far from the theme parks, it took a while to get to and fro from the lodge, but we knew that ahead of time so we were prepared. If we had a car we would still have to park in the parking lots which some were a distance from the parks so either way it would take a little longer than if you were staying at some of the closer resorts. The reason we continue to stay the the Animal Kingdom (we have stayed also at the Beach Club Resort) is that there is a feeling that you are away from a lot of people and I feel relaxed at this hotel. AFter being in theme parks day in day out, it was great to come back and relax in our room with the peacefulness of the savanah in our balcony. The kids loved the pool with the slide and the lobby is very inviting, open and friendly. One thing to note, if your key gets demagnetized, you can easily get a replacement key. My husband got his demagnitized and they replaced it right away. Mine got demagnitized and I was told that all the keys had to be replaced they had to get reprogrammed, etc. It took 25 minutes and it erases everything that was on the original card which caused a mess. It was eventually fixed but keep that in mind. NO need to reprogram keys. Overall, the hotel was excellent, service was great.

Check in was hassle free, we had a Savannah room on the 4th floor quite near to lobby. As soon as we got into the room, about 6pm I ran straight to the window to see the animals and was not disappointed. I could see Giraffe's about 20 - 30 feet from the balcony along with Zebra's and Bongo's. The room itself had 2 queen size beds in it and was sizeable. Bigger than expected after reading other reviews. Places to Eat Boma and Jiko are both fantastic if you like to try different foods, all african themed. Although the breakfast buffet at Boma has both classic american and african food, suits all tastes. My husband and I ate in both and loved them, Once you have an idea of what you are doing on your holiday then try and book in advance as they are both popular, at this time of year no need to book before you leave for your holiday. If you are unsure then the hotel does a culinary tour in the afternoons (free) so you can have a taster of the kind of food they serve. Mara is just a self serve, all american snack place which serves a purpose but it neither good nor bad. Tips There is a lot to see and do within the hotel and it is easy to miss. Just down by check in and also on the ground floor by Boma there is an activity board that tells you what is going on. Lots of stuff for kids but also talks about the animals and also times in the evening where you can view the animals with night vision goggles. All the activites and the staff by the savannah viewing points all come from various countries within Africa and have a wealth of info about the animals and can tell you a great deal about the culture of their country, these guys are definately worth talking to. Tip the maid in the room a couple of dollars every other day and if you want something you haven't got then leave a note and you will pretty much always get it. I guess this also tells the maid that you appreciate them and they are not working for nothing (they really do not get paid much) Talk to the staff they can tell you interesting things that will make your stay in Orlando better, the bugs that people mention are called lovebugs and they are harmless but annoying but come out for 2 weeks in May and 2 weeks in September and then die off. There is a lady by the name of Laura who works at the pool bar and she is especially helpful. It is quite normal to have a thunderstorm in the afternoon about 3pm (does not last long) and the pool bar may close for a short time as understandabley they do not want you to be struck by lightning so will get you inside. Most people go to the pool in the afternoon after the park so it can be quite busy about 5pm, but if you have a morning free then the pool is nice and quiet Sorry for the long review but hopefully the tips will help make it an amazing stay.

I booked it without really looking into it and was quite worried by reading some of the reviews at the time. On arrival at the hotel I found that there was no need to have worried. It was really well themed, all staff during the 2 weeks did everything possible to make it the magical experience that the brochure said it would be. Our room was on the third floor and was a good size with 2 queen beds and hand carved furniture and an amazing view of the savannah. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was all African themed and looked really good. The only complaint I could have of it is that even with all lights in it was quite dark as only had lights on the walls which had thick frosted glass around them but this was really a minor thing in an other wise perfect room. It also had the benefit of a fridge, which saved us a fortune on food and drink in the hotel. There are 3 restaurants inside the hotel THE MARA - fast service food. We ate there twice when in a rush and found it to be expensive for what we got and both of us agreed it would have been cheaper and better quality to have eaten in a theme park. BOMA - buffet breakfast and evening meal. The buffet was a mix of African and regular food and had a great select. The servers were all very friendly and helpful seeming to take a real interest in what you had planned for the day and how you were enjoying it. We were served by one of them on the first day and then didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see him for over a week yet he remembered my name and what drinks and food I liked, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never had anywhere else. The priced were excellent for what we got at $34 for breakfast and around $50 for evening meals for 2. JIKO - High quality restaurant for higher prices. First impressions were excellent it looked stunning and felt like a quality restaurant there were awards it had won on the wall when you entered so expectations were high. Unfortunately the meal I had didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet expectations meal for two was $110 with one of us drinking coke and the other having just a couple of beers and sharing a starter. I have a steak which I asked for medium to well done and arrived blood red and cold through most of the middle. I struggled to eat most of it as felt like it was rare. My girlfriend had salmon, which is her favourite meal yet ate very little of it. We both had a dessert which was a type of chocolate cake and was a large serving and very nice. Staff were friendly but both of us were left a little disappointed as we had left this restaurant till the last night thinking it would be the best. As far as for the rest of the hotel it was one of the best I have stayed in anywhere. I was extremely upset to have to leave and have every intention of going back soon. I would suggest to anyone to explore the hotel, we did this on the last day and found loads of great look out spots and seating places that we wish we would have found earlier. I would also suggest that if you are staying there that you get the savannah view its well worth it. + points Great theme and d\u00c3\u00a9cor Excellent staff great service The animals BOMA restaurant Very good fitness suit and health suit Nice pool Great location Free Disney Bus service Room key can be used in most shops around Disney world (saves carrying large amounts of cash) - Points Hotel is quite dark in places particularly on the stairs by the Bar and restaurants saw a few people trip on them. - there were millions of mating fly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outside of the hotel and pool area.

It doesn't add anything of value to the room, they all seemed the same. But, you do get access to the lounge on the top floor. This was quite nice.

You also can go on the Sunrise Safari at Animal Kingdom if you are a concierge guest. That was a real treat. Get up at 7 AM and enter the AK before it opens and take a very in-depth look at the Safari ride and the animals before anyone else enters. Lots of rhino, hippo, lion, gazelle, zebra, etc.. Also get breakfast at Tusker House, which was very pleasant. Definitely worth the $ to do this one. We also went on Wayanama sunset safari, also only available to concierge guests. This cost $150 each. Safari is around the 33 acres of the AKL and you get to see many animals. This is much more like Africa, except better. Can get very close to the animals: giraffe and zebra mainly. No lions or rhinos because of danger issues. Still quite interesting. Even serve snacks. Then afterwards includes dinner at Jiko. This was a huge disappointment. The quality of the food is poor. Much of it was cold. Speaks of bad service and bad kithcen expediting. They do have a very high opinion of themselves, however.

This was our 6th trip to Disney but our first lodging experience with Disney. First off, pulling up to the lodge is amazing. We were immediately greeted by someone that unloaded our luggage. We were given a card and told to take it to the desk right inside the door to the left after we check in. The check-in process was a breeze. The gentleman was very nice. We asked for an upgrade from a pool view but the guy smiled and said he didn't think they could accommodate that request (didn't even check). All of our meals, park tickets, and the door key was loaded onto cards for each of us and we were off to get our luggage. We were on the 3rd floor (which is where the lobby is). We were just down the hall from the lobby and right by an elevator that took us to the pool, Mara, laundry facility, arcade, etc. That was super convenient! The Mara was our favorite I think in all of Disney (for quick service). We ate at Boma...it was ok. As far as the $11.99 mugs, I read the reviews and raced down to get them on our first night. I'm sure it makes sense for some but for us it wasn't worth it. We were in the parks from morning to night and usually had dinner at the Mara. Since we were on the meal plan, we chose bottles of soda for our drink. They give you paper cups at the counter so you can divide drinks for the little ones. We always had a couple extra bottles to take to put in our fridge for later -- and bottled soda tastes so much better than fountain soda!! My husband filled his mug up a couple times but it wasn't worth it for us (note: soda in the vending machines is $2.50). Our daughter quickly tired of the same kid's meals. On our 2nd day, we asked about getting something different and learned that they really don't care if you order off of the kid's menu or not. From there on out, she chose whatever she wanted - usually the cheese pizza at Mara! She could still choose a side and a dessert.....needless to say, she had lots of snacks for later. On the meal plan, I read where some people buy their kid's meals and then they have extra meals left over for the adults. This could be easily done but we didn't do it. As far as the room, it was ok. I expected it to be small and dark so no big deal. I thought the noise was annoying, it usually died down by 11:30 or so. There is so much vegitation there, our room view was severely obstructed. We could only see small glimpses of the pool! In retrospect, I would have opted for the the cheaper view and saved the $. The halls did have tattered and stained carpet in some areas, which surprised me, (Note: I read this in another review so I was purposely looking for it. Had I not known to look, maybe I wouldn't have noticed it) Bus transportation was pretty good. The bus stop is just down the hill from the entrance. I'm sure if somebody had a room on the other side of the resort, all of the walking got old! We didn't have to wait too long for buses. Downtown Disney was the longest trip. You pretty much have to allow for an hour of travel time by the time you walk to the bus stop, wait for a bus, and then travel time. But especially with Magic Kingdom, I think the bus system is more efficient than driving yourself. The pool was ok. It had a nice water slide in it. They also had a small round baby pool that was a few inches deep. There were 2 hot tubs around the pool (find them on the map because they are kind of hidden!). They also have a small playground for kids tucked in behind the pool (I heard several kids wondering where the swings were). Laundry facilities were ok. It was $2.00 to wash and $2.00 to dry. Soap was another $1.00 (we took soap with us). I do want to put plug in for the Disney staff - they were all wonderful from the lodge, to the bus drivers, to the park staff. Always friendly and helpful!. All-in-all, I'm glad we stayed at the AKL but we are the type of people that have precious vacation dollars and vacation days from work allocated. When we are on vacation we are on the go from morning to night and don't spend alot of \"down time\" just relaxing. To be very honest, we stayed at a Holiday Inn Express in Milwaukee before we flew out and that was one of the highlights of our 4 year old's vacation!! It had a little water park and that's all she needed! Actually, the room was much bigger and had a microwave in it too, which was great for bottles.

The lobby is jaw-dropping, the giraffes and zebras and elands outside our window (4th floor, inward facing, second bldg on zebra trail) every morning and evening were truly magical to behold, and the service was outstanding. Housekeeping was very good too (a few dollars tip each day may have helped). On our trip, I made sure to check out the Grand Floridian and the Polynesian, and was so happy to know the Animal Kingdom Lodge beats them hands down in the fantasy factor, in interesting design, and sorry to say, even smell (the Polynesian lobby smells of smoke!) I am glad I ignored the warnings against the AKL here, and stuck with our plan. The only thing I can see the Grand Floridian or Polynsesian have over AKL is the MUCH SHORTER COMMUTE times to Magic Kingdom and Epcot. But just walking into the cool, exotic vibe after being out in the \"World\" each night makes it all worth the extra 20 minutes each way. FYI - In addition to tripadvisor, I used the \"Unofficial Guide to Disney World\" as a great research tool. Other pluses: My kids loved Simba's Cubhouse--the hotel's very well-run kid's club, the huge pool is nicely designed, fun and full of kids (as you'd expect), the amazing animals are all around, the grounds are fun to explore, you'll hear live drums beating in the lobby at any given moment (so cool!), Boma is a GREAT buffet restaurant full of yummy exotic foods you've probably never tasted before (try the fufu!), the African exchange students that work there add a lot to the experience, there are tons of kids' activities every day, even though we ended up missing most of them while in the parks.

Jiko gets rave reviews and when we ate there the food was good, but not award winning. My chicken was tough and chewy. Boma is good value for a Disney buffet, but again it is good quality rather than outstanding as certain reviewers lead you to believe. You get a nice size fridge in your room as standard, which enables you to have more reasonably priced breakfast and alcholic drinks if you wish. Soft drinks are great value. Buy a souvenir mug on your arrival from Boma and get free soft drinks for the duration of you stay!

AKL is beautiful and the food really good, but I was not impressed with housekeeping. We saved for 2 years for this big trip. At close to $450.00 a night Canadian, I expected a lot more. The first night when I bathed my son, I noticed the plastic bolt cover for the base of the toilet, on the floor beside the toilet. It never moved for 4 days. That means the housekeeper never cleaned the floor around the toilet. When we got back to our room the eve of day 2 you could smell urine in the bathroom (i've 2 young boys!) so I dont know why the maid could not. On day 3, we decided if the bathroom floor wasnt cleaned, we would complain upon our return to the room in the evening.....except we forgot to remove the do not disturb sign from the door! So we couldnt very well complain at that point. The 4th morning we had a character breakfast at the Contemporary Hotel and decided to tour the Polynesian and the Grand Floridian too. When my oldesty son saw how beautiful the GF was he begged us to stay there. It didnt take much begging as we had stayed there on our honeymoon and loved it. The GF cost $50 more a night for the cheapest room but we went for it. It was the best decision we made! I now feel if you are going to spend a fortune on a room, might as well go all the way and stay at the GF. There is absolutely no comparison. Guests are treated royally! The beds turned down every night, and chocolates and a poem on the pillow! The rooms are stunning, fresh flowers everywhere in the lobby and hallways. Back to the AKL......some other minor annoyances. The walls around the bathroom sinks were covered in toothpaste splatters along with the wooden front of the vanity and wooden frame of the mirror. I dont know how many weeks it would take for that much to accumulate, but I've never seen a quarter of that in my own bathroom with 4 of us, and I probably wipe the walls around the sink area once a week. It was the first thing I noticed while unpacking. The taps actually had a layer of dust further up the handles where the hands dont touch! And trust me, I am not a clean freak. Is it too much to ask to have your bathroom cleaned fully, not partially, for $450.00 a night? We have stayed at probably 8 different Disney hotels and I have never had a housekeeping problem. Regarding booking a Savannah room, I paid aprox $1000.00 extra for this view for the week. Definately not worth it unless all you plan to do is sit on your balcony and try to look at the animals. I say \"try to\" because of the time we spent in the room during daylight hours, I would say the animals were in sight about 25% of the time. A lot of money for what you get if you ask me. Unfortunately, you dont really figure this out until you're in the room. I had read other review saying how you can go to the viewing areas and see the animals instead of booking a savanna view, but it sounded so cool to wake up and watch the animals eat breakfast! The only animals we saw in the morning the whole time was 2 zebras, one morning. Regarding the walk....didnt really bother us. We were 3 rooms from the very end of the Zebra Trail too! As long as you are in reasonable shape you can do it. It will not be good if your children are too tired to walk and you dont have your own stroller as you will have to carry them all the way from the bus to the room! The food was really good at all 3 restaurants. We enjoyed Boma as it is a buffet and a great way to try a variety of African foods and not commite to a whole entree. We did the dining plan which we recommend. We figure it saved us aprox $500.00 over the course of the week. Most sit down meals at Disney ended up being about $150.00 for us (2 adults, a 12 year old and 4 year old) and the dining plan cost us about $115.00 CDN a day. If we paid for what we ate , on average it would have cost about $225-$250 a day. All in all, we felt ripped off and somewhat disappointed about the Animal Kingdom.

I had read some reviews saying that even though you have booked a savanna view room you rarely see animals. So first thing I did was go out on the balcony and right in front of me was a giraffe, so that was nice. We actually had giraffes outside our window almost the entire stay! That was a real treat for the kids. We were on the 4th floor not far from the lobby, room 4236. The only thing that needs improvement is housekeeping. I have to agree with a previous post in that we would split our day in half and go back to the hotel after 2 or 3pm and our room still wasn't done, our houskeeper sometimes wouldn't get to our room until about 4pm! All the other staff was great. We requested a refrigerator in the room, which we did get. I have an 18 month old and she drinks whole milk. We took ice packs to keep the milk cool while at the parks. FYI: these refrigerators do not have a freezer. When I asked at the front desk if they had fridges with freezer I was told no, but the front desk agent said that they have a freezer in the back and they would keep our ice packs overinight every night of our stay. I really liked that detail. So every night after we'd get back from the parks we would hand over or packs and pick them up in the morining. It is not an uncommon thing. We liked the pool. The only time we found it closed was when it was raining. The pool is open 24 hours, weather permitting, of course. Because of the rain on some afternoons the kids didn't get to use the playground (wet slides after the rain). The Mara is their quick service restaurant, I really liked it because of the convinience and their quick service. For breakfast they have an $8 breakfast platter, waffles, cereals, bagels ect. For lunch they have chicken strips, burgers, and you can get a large pepperoni pizza for $18, pretty good. Boma offers buffet for breakfast and dinner. Tried both and both were good. Reservations recomended. Tried Jiko once for dinner, I enyoyed the Hallibut bot not the appetizer or salad. You have to really be open to those different flavors. Again, reservations are recommended. Did the character breakfast at the Beach club, good buffet. And the highlight of the trip was dinner at Cinderella's Royal Table. Dinner is pre-paid with a 24hr cancel policy. Included is a 3 course meal and icludes soft drinks. You get your picture taken with Cinderella before dinner. The photographs are complimentary! 4 people plus an infant was $174. Everyone really had a good time. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Never waited long for any bus to any of the parks. Also, for those interested, We used Disneys Magical Express and it was the best! Our bags got to our room about 2 hours after we did.

Being tired and hungry, though in a feverpitch state of excitement to explore the lush surroundings we thought we'd tour the hotel and get some food. Spotting one zebra and then queuing KFC style for deep fried food amongst screaming youngsters was not what we imagined on a romantic getaway, but as there was an hour delay for a table at Boma (the normal food buffet), and similar for Jiko (very nice food that we tried later in the week, but very expensive), our options were Mara, or in room dining. Opting not to be hermits on our first night, left us feeling very disappointed with the place, the food and service was quite frankly awful. The hotel whilst not small, in terms of public space is much smaller than expected from the brochures, and the bar area whilst not essential to a great holiday is very small indeed. In general the staff whilst polite, were not helpful, leaving almost all the discovering of useful information to ourselves -- even trying to organise some surprise flowers for my girlfriends birthday later in the week was beyond the capabilities of the front desk - in a supposedly deluxe hotel I was very disappointed, It seemed even beyond them to supply me with the numbers for a florist. As it happened, they would have struggled to help, as the disney florist is closed on the 4th July -- the number for central disney guest services (who were helpful) was on the in-room telephone (which had no manual, as did so little else!) Apart from that, we encountered exceptionally grumpy security men on the front gate, a total lack of instructions on pretty much all facilities, buses that seem to turn up when they feel like it, and then are crowded and not guaranteed to go exactly where you intended - for example - again on my girlfriends birthday we'd booked a restaurant at MGM, and started queueing for a bus a good 1hr15 mins before we needed to arrive -- needless to save we were 20 minutes late, after a few no show buses, and then a bus that decided rather helpfully to go via animal kingdom on the off-chance there were some stragglers there. Fortunately, the restaurant were good enough to understand, though we had to literally sprint from the main car park to the other end of mgm studios to make it, meaning that despite being really hot, sweaty and stressed we did not have time to grab a birthday badge from guest services, and to be honest the food when we got there was cold and disappointing (sci fi diner) -- mama melroses later in the week was worlds beter! The 4th July fireworks were really good. Other room niggles, it took 2 days to get more clothes-hangers for the wardrobe area, there was no pay per view tv, a missed opportunity when you have the entire disney back catalog that could be picked from. Towels were not collected from the bathroom floor when they needed refreshing, and the bed itself was considerably less comfortable on one side than the other. As a further note, for some reason the bar person in the waiting area for Jiko ignore us for a good 20 minutes whilst we watched one gent try his way through samples of at least 10 different wines to take back to his room!! In the end we decided to not drink wine, as it would have meant having to tip such awful service. Despite all that we've had a really amazing holiday, the imagination in the parks is amazing, though we both would not recommend this hotel to others. Overall, for the money we paid, we'd rather have stayed at the Gaylord Palms (where we had a fabulous lunch on the way back to the airport, and encountered far better service fom restaurant staff and concierges), or at some other luxury hotel than this supposedly 'Deluxe' disney resort, it is not worth the premium, and as one other person on here put so succinctly, it felt as if we were staying at a souped up holiday inn.", "Date": "July 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bermuda", "Title": "\u201cOur favorite Disney resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5466469", "Content": "My husband and I have been to Disney every year since we got married, and we're getting ready to go again this year.

The only thing I'd say wasn't perfect was that we found the rooms to be a little dark because of the way the lighting was set up, but the rooms were beautiful nonetheless and offered great views (we've stayed in rooms with both savannah and pool views). We especially enjoyed exploring the resort and finding quaint viewing spots - some with handmade rocking chairs - that overlook the savannah and the animals. There's nothing more relaxing after a day of touring the parks than coming back to the cozy Lodge. We especially love eating at Boma (an African buffet) and Jiko, both right inside the resort. The gift shop also sells lovely African things as well as all the usual Disney stuff. The main drawback to the resort is that it's a bit off the beaten path, so you have to take buses to get to any of the parks. The Animal Kingdom is, of course, nearby but it takes a little while to get to the other parks. But for this reason we found that we never had to wait long to catch a bus from the resort because there were so many coming and going.

It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't Disney. We have stayed at Wilderness Lodge, Grand Floridian, Polynesian, Contemporary and Caribbean and this hotel just does not stack up against those. I am not a \"hotel snob\" by any means, and I do know that in a resort of this size, somethings are a hit or miss. I am just giving you the good, the bad and the ugly. The room is not large by any means for two adults and three children, the bathroom door opens unto the toilet (so if you are trying to save time, and let your kids take a shower while you are \"doing big business\", your knees get a good whacking). Housekeeping was NON EXISTANT. For two days, we left by 10:00 AM, came back around 3:00 for naps or swim, and then they knocked on the door. And it is true, our housekeeper spoke absolutely no english and the little spanish I know could not seem to make her understand to come back later since we were taking naps. Also, on our first night, I kept feeling something sharp on my side of the bed, and when I turned on the light, and took off the sheets, there is a spring coming through the fabric of the mattress. I had to sleep on a pillow. We flipped the mattress ourselves the next day. We had a Savannah View, and although it was nice to see giraffes and zebras from our patio, the constant fighting with large army ants really became a challenge. Maybe our room was on their nest, I really don't know, but if you went out on the patio, prepare for war. They also made their way into our room, but it was hard to see them due to the dark carpeting. I spent a few nights on my belly searching these little guys out so I would not have to worry about my 3 year old getting bit by one of these. I would love to say that the pool was great, but on both occasions that we tried to use the pool, after about 10 minutes it had to be closed due to a child who had \"left\" a little package. Very unpleasant, and especially to have it happen to us both times. The second time, I didn't even get to take off my shoes and the kids were just getting ready to go down the slide for the first time. Maybe I'm unlucky, but I have never gone through that, and the idea to swim in the pool after that just did not seem too appealing. The restaurants are fine...not fine dining by any means, but acceptable for a large resort. Overall, it is a fine place to try ONCE. After that, save your money and go to a real four star hotel, because this one is more like a fancy holiday inn. Our 13 year old said it was neat, but lets stay somewhere else next time. That pretty much sums up how the rest of us felt. I truly hope an executive of Disney reads these reviews, because as Florida residents, we go to a Disney Property about 3 times a year, but I really don't know if will continue to do so if this is what I am faced with.

Usually we are terribly critical of hotels, but we LOVE Animal Kingdom. It is a \"deluxe\" hotel, but is the cheapest and sleeps up to 5, so it saves us money. This is our 3rd time staying here and this time we got the really cool bunk beds. At every hotel, Disney pays attention to details. There are gorgeous decorations all throughout the hotel, authentic masks, tribal jewelry, clothes in displays. The doors have shapes of shields on them, the floor carpets look like giraffes and have hidden mickeys. THE BEST: The animals are always out and there are tons of different locations to see them from. They have great spots with rocking chairs, indoor areas, your own balcony from your room. It is so different from a zoo where there are tons of people and you feel rushed. Here you wander out and have coffee and see different things come and go. The workers even feed them several times throughout the day to ensure they come to your area for you to see. There are about 10 activities throughout the day for you to do. Plus, there are 7 activities for kids to earn beads at to make like a necklace/keychain at, not cheesy at all. Some included storyteller time at the firepit, night vision goggles for animal tracking, a hidden mickey hunt, how to get food like a flamingo. They have workers all over that are from different nations in Africa that do presentations and answer kids questions. They do medallion rubbings in the lobby. They have cookie decorating in the afternoon. All free. It is a treat to hang around the hotel and have the kids do all these fun activities while here. So-So: I will agree that the front registration staff are not helpful at all. In fact, last summer when we stayed there, our 5 year old fell out of the bed onto the edge of a nightstand (made of heavy dark wood) and was bleeding PROFUSELY in the middle of the night. When we called the front desk with the emergency, etc. there was no care at all given, even by the time we got to the lobby to go to the hospital we couldn't find anyone to help get directions to the hospital until we went outside by valet. Let's say I was very upset about that. You can't judge a hotel by one or two bad workers. I will say, we got all the beds a special bedrail and put pillows around the nightstands this time around. The pool is also so-so. Other disney hotels are so fabulous, with outrageous themes, etc. that this one is not that exciting. Plus there are a ton of people smoking everywhere for some reason, especially around the bar which is where a lot of the shaded spots are if you have kids. NOTE: There is a cool kids camp on Wednesdays I think as an enrichment, but it's not known about much. It's several hours long and very educational. We weren't able to try it. NOte: There are tons of walmarts, targets, restaurants, etc. once you drive 1 mile off disney property. It makes a ton of sense to grab milk, yogurt, fruit, snacks, drinks and save a ton of money, even if you have to take a cab.

We have stayed at many other Disney properties (including the Grand Californian, Disney Hotel, Wilderness Lodge, Swan and Dolphin). This place is way below Disney's excellent standards: 1) The first room assigned to us had a horrible smell of cigerette smoke, even though it was labelled non-smoking. The view was \"marginal\" if that. We had a view of lots of steel and pavement, with a direct view of a small pen where the animals apparently go in the morning if they choose. We swapped and got a worse room and then swapped and got one that did not stink and had a slightly better view. 2) Our $330 per night Savannah view room turned out to be a view of trees and the hot tub. If you looked really hard, you could almost see a giraffe patternn through the leaves of the tree. When we arrived in this room, there was trash between the bed and the nightstand. (an empty water bottle and some wrappers). We complained about that 3 times over the next 4 days and nobody cleaned it up. Just to be spiteful, I added to the trash pile on my way out hoping that if there was enough trash there...someone would clean it up. The entrance to our room also had some cotton squares and a qtip dropped in front. THat was picked up by the maids the next day however. There were also bits of paper and crumbs on the floor in our room that were there when we arrived and never got cleaned up. 3) The room was so dark, we could barely see what we were doing. We had read about this before beginning our trip and brought our own supply of 100 watt lightbulbs. (we left them behind for the next guest) 4) The room also needed some repairs. The knobs on the drawer handles fell off in my hand and the shower continually leaked water. 5) And the worst part of all about Animal Kingdom Lodge...it was a LONG way from the parks. I mean it could be like a 20 minute drive + a 10 minute wait for the bus. You might as well stay someplace cheaper that is not part of the Disney property! 6) When checking in the person at the desk was a Trainee. Should could not help us with our room concerns. We asked for a supervisor who was surly and inattentive. They eventually wore us down and we just gave up. 7) The pool was FILTHY!!!! I've stayed in numerous 5 Star resorts with way too many kids peeing in the pool. In each of those cases, you can still see into the pool. This one was so dirty that you could not see *anything* underwater. So imagine if you will, your kid goes under for a little swim. You totally lose track of them until they come up (or if they came up...sorry to be morose!). The lifeguard is almost useless if he cannot see into the pool!

We left our room at 5:15, thinking we were giving ourselves enough time. We were wrong. Because of a traffic jam near the Magic Kingdom, we didn't arrive at the restaurant until 6:15. At least they still honored our reservation. Unbelievably, you must even take a bus from the Animal Kingdom Lodge to the Animal Kingom itself. Previously, we'd stayed at Disney hotels in California and Paris that are located just outside theme park gates, and we assumed it was the same with the AKL and that we would be able to walk into the park. Wrong again! In a major blunder on Disney's part, the hotel has NO easy access to the Animal Kingdom park. In an earlier trip to WDW, we had stayed at the Wilderness Lodge, and in my opinion, its more central location makes it far superior to the AKL. Also, I wonder if the walls are thinner at the AKL.

This is our second trip to DisneyWorld in the last 5 years. The first stay was at Wilderness Lodge which was excellent. We wanted to try a new resort. AK Lodge was a good fit for us with children ages, 7 and 10. We utilized the Magical Express which worked out well. The bus delivered us to our resort after a less than 5 minute wait to board. We were warned ahead of time about bringing our necessities in our carry on bags and were prepared. It does take 2-3 hours for your checked bags to arrive. We had requested a savanna view room close to the lobby and all was as expected. Check in was quick and contrary to other reviews I found the front desk and concierge staff very helpful. Our room was small but similar in size to Wilderness Lodge. It had a queen bed and bunk beds. We honestly were not in the room except to sleep. I think the price is somewhat high and you are paying for the savanna view so make sure you get it. My children enjoyed seeing the animals every morning before we got going. Having said that, if I did not have children I would stay elsewhere as it probably isnt worth the $$. In our situation, we wanted to try something new and the kids loved it. The food options are good but expensive. We didnt try Jikos but ate at Bomas for breakfast twice and dinner once. Make sure you have reservations because the lines were long even at 9 am. We watied 30 minutes for dinner even with priority seating. There were several couples without reservations who waited 90 minutes. The food was good but nothing spectacular and I didnt feel worth the cost. However, I havent felt many of the restaurant options at Disney are woth the cost. In fact the best meal we had was at the Hoop Di Du Review which I strongly recommend. Buffet BBQ and a really great show. The bus service at AKL was quite good. Never had to wait more than 10 minutes except for one glaring exception, MGM park. We waited 30-45 minutes for that bus. As I found it, even though the bus looks the same as the other Disney buses, it is run by MGM and I believe they have less buses. The buses to Epcot, and Magic kingdom were plentiful. In summary, AKL was a nice hotel with a great pool, lobby, and savanna. The rooms are small but nice.

I made a request to change the room to one that looked out toward the arusha savannah, and the staff was very accomodating with the request...so we moved after a day. The savannah facing room was great in that you saw animals on and off during the day. However, my husband thought there should have been more animals kept on the property......they move around a lot, so sometimes you may not see any. Still, it was a treat to watch them when they were there. As far as the staff, I have to agree with some of the previous reviews. They will try to accomodate your needs (sometimes), but they are not very friendly or very helpful. We went to the concierge a couple of times for restaurant reservations and directions around Orlando, and they were not helpful at all. They will only do the bare minimum if they have to. They will not go above and beyond and give you more information than you need, and you're lucky if you have someone smile at you.

Past experience with staying on property, I recall VERY small rooms, and just an all in all feeling of chaos throught the resort. The Animal Kingdom Lodge was a pleasant surprise. The lobby was beautiful with plenty of seating available, and I felt a sense of peaceful excitement in the air. We got 2 rooms, separating the boys and the girls, and the man at the front desk worked very hard to ensure that we had ajoining rooms. I have a handicap which affords me little comfortable walking, so we were also given a set of rooms that were central to the lobby, pool, and restaurants. I was also given a wheelchair, courtesy of the Lodge to use for our stay..Check-in went well...then off to the rooms. Again, a pleasant surprise...the rooms were quite spacious, and beautifully decorated (even the bathrooms!) There was a refridgerator, iron&board,coffee pot,hairdryer, and a porta-crib. What else could we ask for? The balcony, as promised, allowed us to see so many animals up close and in their environment...it was cool! I was a tad disappointed in the pool...I thought it looked better in the pictures than it really was, but it was ok. Dining was also not my cup of tea. Thank God for the burgers, salads...at Mara, cuz the other two restaurants srved food with an African twist that I just did not enjoy.

We always stay on Disney property and decided to splurge for my husband's 41st Birthday. We made reservations at the Rose & Crowne Pub in England (Epcot) and then reserved a savannah room at the AKL. We had previously toured the AKL at Christmastime and thought the resort is the most magnificent of all Disney hotels. We have always wanted to go to Africa and until then, we were willing to settle for the next best thing. The theming of the hotel is amazing. Tribal shields for chandeliers and the thatched roof are just some of the awe-inspiring details of the hotel. We upgraded to a savannah view room and though we had views of the savannah, the animals we saw were only bongos, an okapi and ducks. Now, I know that we should be impressed by bongos and okapis and we know that they are from Africa, but we were hoping for the \"biggies\" (giraffes, zebras, etc). The publicity photos and in-room commercials make it seem like the animals are all over the hotel grounds, but in reality, they hang out mostly in the center (by the lobby and viewing area). We could have saved a lot of money by getting a regular room and then heading down to the lobby area for viewing and photo opportunities (which we did anyway). One thing that was totally unexpected was the restaurant Jiko. My husband made reservations for what he thought was Boma, but we ate at Jiko instead. What a great mistake! The food was the best I've eaten at Disneyworld. We really splurged for appetizers, main course and desert plus after dinner tea and loved every minute of it. Our 3-year-old daughter ordered a pb&j sandwich which came with rainbow-colored bread. The beautiful decorations (a flock of birds) hang above the seating area and the wall changes color to imitate an African suset. Don't miss Jiko when you stay here! It was the highlight of our trip. The AKL was the first deluxe Disney resort that we have stayed at. While it was a nice stay and the hotel is simply magnificent, we would not have made a savannah view reservation. It didn't seem worth the significantly extra money when we had to go to the lobby to see the giraffes and zebras anyway. If you have the extra money and you can afford one of the centrally located savannah view rooms, then you should do it.

We asked for a later check out, and they told us we could extend by an hour (noon) but then the lady on the phone told us to call back the next day to see if they could extend another hour. So we called back on the day of our check out and the person who answered said \"We don't do late check outs. CLICK.

Deluxe has its own meaning at Disney and people should get used to it. Deluxe at Disney relates to the price and convenience to attractions.

Although the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cast members\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who work at the resorts may have went out of their way in the past to make a visit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153magical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, today they are just run of the mill resort hotel employees. The Animal Kingdom lodge delivers what it promises. We saw plenty of animals from our balcony and the viewing points around the sprawling hotel. Our room was clean and in good condition, a typical Marriott or Hilton hotel room with two queen beds, television, small table and balcony. It was the kids delight in watching giraffes and antelope from the balcony while they ate breakfast that made the Animal Kingdom Lodge worth the price of admission. They also enjoyed the pool and the modest water slide at the pool. It was a unique experience to watch flamingos being fed while taking a break from swimming in the pool. I have read comments about lighting in the rooms and foul odors. The rooms are darker than average but not so much so that it bothered us or inhibited any normal activity. We did not notice any foul odors in our room. However, this is a hotel that is smack in the middle of what amounts to a zoo. There, of course, are going to be animal odors. The only place I took note of them was by the flamingo pond near the pool. You might want to pick a chaise on the other side of the pool from the flamingos. I would not recommend the Animal Kingdom as the place to stay if you plan to visit the other parks at Disney. The Lodge is just too far away from everything else. Although Disney and the true believers tout the bus system, the truth is that I waited 25 minutes for an Animal Kingdom bus at the end of a long day at the Magic Kingdom with the 5 year old and then the trip took an additional 15 minutes. This is not the same as jumping on the monorail or one of the ferries and being back at the Polynesian or the Floridian in 10 minutes. This amount of travel time inhibits your flexibility to leave and return during the course of the day. However, if you are going to take full advantage of the Lodge and the nearby Animal Kingdom Park, this could be a good place to stay. Be prepared to walk a long distance to your room and to wait 10 to 15 minutes for registration. Also, the pool area seems to fill up quickly, so get a family member there early to reserve some of those chaises (far from the flamingo pond).", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pullman, WA", "Title": "\u201cAKL is excellent!!!!\u201d", "Author": "ssbbcc", "ReviewID": "UR4691122", "Content": "We booked this hotel as the \"land\" part of our 3 night land/4 night sea package w/ Disney.

We have stayed at off site and the All-Star Movies resort on previous visits. Here, we stayed for 3 nights during the Spring Break period. First and foremost, I highly recommend getting a savannah view room. There are common overlook areas near the lobby, however we had our best viewing experiences from the balcony on our second floor room. I must confess we were fortunate to be at the very end of the \"Zebra Trail\" corridor. Even though it was a long walk to get there, we found ourselves with a view of TWO savannahs. Our room was on the very end, so one side of the balcony offered a view to the end of one savannah while the main lookout extended towards the \"Uzima\" savannah. We saw many animals, especially in the afternoon. The grounds are well kept and the animals are closely monitored by the staff at various times. The rooms were not so brightly lit, but were adequate for reading. There was a mini-fridge in there for our drinks. The room size was not large, but it did not concern me as I preferred to spend time either on the balcony or in the theme parks with my wife and nephew. We all enjoyed the Mara cafeteria setup (one of three places to eat at the AKL), which is where we chose to eat on property. Those who enjoy full service would like the Jiko restaurant. The Boma is a buffet setup. The pool is outstanding, and towels are provided for the guests there. The pool has a zero depth entry, a water slide, and 1 adjacent wading pool and 2 spas. There is also a savannah overlook behind the pool--likely one will see the flamingos. The lobby is as amazing as the others have stated. Service was good, and the staff is ready to assist guests with questions that they may have. There are many people who can give information about the animals as well. For transportation, we used the Disney Magical Express from Orlando Airport. We did not have to wait long to leave the airport, however I do recommend bringing things you want in the next 5-6 hours (swimsuits?) in your carry-on luggage. Bus transportation is very frequent to the theme parks and Downtown Disney. Indeed the hotel is expensive, however I do not regret the decision to try it. In my opinion, the ability to view animals outside your private balcony is the number one reason why people come here. The hotel is appropriate for people of all ages, however those who enjoy viewing animals such as giraffes, zebras, and bongos would most enjoy this unique opportunity.", "Date": "March 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA Taste of Africa\u201d", "Author": "adrianhobson", "ReviewID": "UR4625880", "Content": "We stayed at the AK Lodge for a few days in March after a Disney Cruise. Its a destination hotel rather than a place to stay while visiting the parks. We stayed in a standard room with a pool view. If you're fascinated by the \"wildlife\", as we were, the Savannah rooms are probably worth the extra. However, even with a standard view its easy enough to walk to the end of the corridor early in the morning to watch giraffe and zebra feed at dawn. Its also possible to walk down to various overlooks to get an even closer view. I was told that at night there are staff at the overlooks with Night Vision Goggles but didn't test this out. What was very pleasant was the outdoor \"campfire\" around which guests could sit and relax. First impressions of the hotel are good with an imposing African themed lobby. Check in was quick and painless although some rooms are a long walk from the lobby. Our family room for 2 adults and 2 kids had a bunk and queen. Decor could be considered a little dark but is entirely in keeping with the theme. Kids are kept happy by the range of educational activities on offer. Its a great place to inform kids about conservation issues - despite the obvious contradictions of energy and resource consumption during international travel and tourism! There is a good choice of restaurants. Theres also the Mara foodcourt which can help keep your budget on track. The pool is a good size with a small slide to entertain the kids. Towels and changing rooms are provided poolside and there are several spas. The area is very attractive with the thatched roof of the hotel on one side and the Savannah on the other. A perfect place to spend the afternoon sunbathing and hot tubbing. Disney bus transportation to other parks is excellent with short rides to AK theme park and Blizzard Beach. Since AKL is to the far West of Disneyworld some of the other parks and Downtown Disney can be a longish ride but we never had to wait more than 10 mins to travel in either direction. This is an excellent destination hotel.

The lodge is very large with lots of things to do. The architecture is amazing and the whole place is themed to the max. This hotel has four \"extensions\" which spread out from the main lobby area and then each of these extensions has \"blocks\" of rooms which seem to go on endlessly. We reserved a deluxe savannah view room, which I understand are slightly larger than regular savannah view and are located on the 5th or 6th floors. We requested that the room be near the pool if possible, and our request was met. The room was on the Zebra Trail portion of the hotel and was immaculately clean, with a breathtaking view of one of the savannahs right from our balcony (there are 3 different savannahs at the hotel, each having some animals unique to them). The savannahs can also be viewed from many spots around the lodge, but why not have your own private viewing spot from your balcony. Some people have commented that the rooms are small, but they did not seem too bad to me - a typical hotel room size. There are loads of things to do at this hotel including activities for the kids during the day and evenings (get an event schedule near the front desk), viewing the animals and learning about them from the knowledgeable staff, swimming, arcade, and a nice lounge for the adults. The hotel has a very large zero-depth pool with a fun but not-so-large water slide, a small playground, and plenty of places to relax in the sun. There are two on-site restaurants, Jiko and Boma, and a large well-stocked food court. We did not eat at Jiko although we would have liked to - it looked very impressive. We did, however, eat at Boma, and it was quite an experience. Boma is a buffet-style, all-you-can-eat restaurant that is not noisy and bustling like most buffets. The food is African influenced and too varied to even begin to explain. Make sure you get Priority Seating (which I would suggest for all Disney restaurants). The only down-point of this lodge is the location, which is quite a distance from the parks. The buses run regularly, but it can take as long as 1/2 hour to get to the Magic Kingdom (wait time not included). There is no other form of transportation to the parks from this resort other than buses, so I would assume that having a car would be an advantage. This lodge is closest to the Animal Kingdom and Blizzard Beach. If you plan on spending most of your time at the Magic Kingdom you may want to consider my #1 pick at Disney so far--the Polynesian. I would rank the Animal Kingdom Lodge a close second to the Poly, and will soon experience the Beach Club and Port Orleans Riverside. We have visited the Grand Floridian, Contemporary, Wilderness Lodge, and Boardwalk and so far like the Polynesian and Animal Kingdom Lodge best. I always suggest to anyone planning a trip to Disney....do your research. This is a very large place and it is immensely helpful to know as much you can about it before arriving.

The atmosphere made our trip even more exotic. The lobby is beautifully appointed and the African background music was wonderful. When we arrived a table was set up with a cast member discussing their home country of Botswana. And the week was filled with other such educational opportunities. Viewpoints and seats for viewing the animals are hidden all over the grounds with surprising opportunities to see the wildlife. And see we did--giraffes (lots, even a baby), hoof stock, zebras, and a wide variety of birds. The hotel staff were very knowledgeable on the wildlife and were genuinely pleased to answer questions and offer interesting information. Whether morning, afternoon or evening, searching for the animals was a must-do! Our room overlooked the swimming pool and was tidy and full of interesting things. The housekeeping staff did an exemplary job, and left a few little personal touches for us (a towel man, which my children--8 and 11-- loved and set up for her every morning). We received marvelous customer service from check in to check out. The concierge and bell staff were friendly and helpful. At check in, the staff provided us with all of the necessary information and few surprises that we were not aware of through booking our vacation through Walt Disney World resorts. The swimming pool area is nicely designed and the pool was well enjoyed! Towel service is available and the towels are placed all around the pool. There are 2 hot tubs and lots of place to explore around the pool area. The restaurants (Mara, Boma and Jiko) were very enjoyable. Even the picky eater tried a few new things and the adventurous one had a heyday with all of the interesting food! Mara (cafeteria style) provided us with a wide variety of breakfast food, which included pastries, cereal, fresh fruit, and hot food. In fact, we ate breakfast there every day! Boma (the African market buffet) was busy but very enjoyable. The variety of foods were visually appealing and delicious. The wait staff offered us a couple of \"must trys\" and they were well worth the adventure. We had reservations and arrived at a busy time, but were seated as soon as was possible. The atmosphere alone was enough to make the wait worth it! Jiko (sit down restaurant) was so wonderful that we ate there twice! We had reservations and were seated promptly! The food was delicious, widely varied and beautifully presented. What was even better is that the upscale menu provided a unique variety of options for the younger diners without compromising the enjoyment of a \"grown up\" restaurant. Along with the standard grilled cheese and macaroni and cheese was the option of salmon or steak. Both of which were well enjoyed by our children! The wait staff was friendly and helpful and introduced us to a few foods that we would not have considered trying but truly enjoyed!! We were very sad that we were out of vacation days as we had not exhausted their delicious menu. Animal Kingdom Lodge and our vacation through Walt Disney Resorts was far better that we could have even imagined and we will most definitely do it AGAIN!!! The perks involved with booking through Disney made our holiday effortless and one that we will talk and laugh about forever! In the words of the children: \"THe animals were COOL!\" \"Our room was so fun, so was the pool.\" \"That was the COOLEST vacation EVER!!!\" \"I want to eat at Jiko again!\" And Mom and Dad echo those same sentiments!

As soon as we got off the bus and started to scream for help-it looked like the staff was moving in slow motion to help him and that they had no plan of emergency in cases like this. It looked like they were taking there own sweet time to help him as he lay out cold on the cement. It felt like it took forever before we heard sirens from the ambulance. So from the beginning there was an apathetic feel in the air as we began our 4 day trip at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. As we checked in and told our saga to the woman at the front desk (we were physically shaking from the trauma of what we had just seen) the woman said, wow I didn't know that happened and proceeded to tell us what room we were in. No customer service or empathy was shown here, either! We stayed in a room overlooking the \"Giraffe\" area of the Savanna. The room was small and dark-for a very high price. The room was dirty and a plastic spoon that had been left from the last guest that was still sitting there on the carpet untouched by housekeeping. The shower was disgusting with nasty stuff on the walls that was also left untouched all week. Our beds were rapidly made up where there were wrinkles all through them like a child had run in and threw the sheets up and over the pillows. The food in the buffet (Boma's) was so expensive that we opted to go to the cafeteria the rest of the week for breakfast instead of paying $42 for two people to have a buffet breakfast and coffee! Our experience at their signature restaurant was good- the food was amazing-but the service suffered as it seemed that our waitress had no interest in the idea of chit chat or pleasantries with customers and breezed in and out throughout our dinner. We did see a little lone Giraffe each afternoon outside our balcony who was lured to a point where we could see him eat a snack and then would leave by 4:30. But that was the only giraffe we could see from our balcony. So needless to say, we will not be going there, I do not recommend the Animal Kingdom Lodge due the its severe lack of empathy, good judgement in an emergency situation, (which after asking other bus drivers and staff had no idea of the condition of the bus driver who had gotten hurt) awful housekeeping and terrible customer service.

Disney has done a wonderful job with the African theme. You truly forget you are still in Florida! The first thing we saw when we first walked in to the lobby was the huge Christmas tree! The Christmas decorations were beautiful as were the wood carvings and art pieces throughout the resort. Our check-in was relatively smooth and quick. When placing my reservation I had requested a savanna view with lots of birds for my son who is an avid ornithologist. At check-in we were assigned a room on the Arusha savanna...I was thrilled, but my son was less than ecstatic as he had been hoping for a Sunset Savanna view to see the vultures and marabou stork. Needless to say, when we got into our room the first animals he saw were Blue Cranes, Guineafowl and Pelicans, so he was more than pleased. It was certainly a treat to look out your window and see Zebra, Giraffe, Wildebeest, Kudu etc. Other reviewers had mentioned that the rooms are a bit dim and I have to agree, however I do believe it is purposely done to maintain the \"mood\" of the resort. Although the lights were not bright, they were sufficient. The room was quite comfortable with exotic carved wooden bed headboard, posts of the bunkbed, armoire for the TV, chairs and mirrors. The zebra motif chairs on the balcony are very novel as well. The double sinks in the vanity area were great, and it was nice having a refrigerator for juice and milk etc. I found the service to be excellent. The castmember who checked me in went out of his way to find out if my son was enjoying our room. Partway through our stay I caught a cold and stayed in bed for 2 days. The housekeeping staff did a wonderful job of keeping our room clean and freshly supplied. I even had the housekeeping manager stop by to ensure that his staff was doing everything possible to make our stay magical and see that I had everything that I needed. My son and I also enjoyed just spending time in the massive lobby and the hallways. All the hallways have windows where you can watch the animals on all of the savannas. Some even have a place to sit. The fireplace in the lobby was a popular place for people to sit and read a book or drink a beverage. The kids area with the tv playing disney cartoons was always filled with kids...my son included. There were tons of activities for the kids...African art rubbings, Ostrich egg ornament making, Night animal viewing, Cookie decorating etc. My favorite place in the lobby area was the Sunset Overlook Room. It was a lot calmer than the outer lobby and had lots of comfy seating, beautiful african artifacts and a balcony to view the animals. The restaurants Boma (breakfast & dinner buffet) and Jiko (upscale dinner only) were both wonderful. (Try the flatbreads and the Tilefish at Jiko!) We also received excellent service from every cast member we encountered in these restaurants. The Mara food court was like any other, less expensive than a sit down meal but definitely not cheap. It had an adequate menu and everything we ate there was decent. My son also spent a bit of time in the small video arcade. We didn't have an opportunity to spend time in the outdoor spas or the pool, but it looked like there were quite a few people taking advantage of this amenity, and enjoying it. AKL also has a fitness room, 2 self service laundry rooms, a playground, and a kid's activity room. This is not the fanciest of resorts, but it certainly is very comfortable and is the perfect place for someone who loves animals!", "Date": "January 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIf you have kids, you must go once\u201d", "Author": "ali1298", "ReviewID": "UR4347680", "Content": "We visited January 7th and 8th 2006. We reserved two savannah view rooms, my two children, husband, father in law and myself in my party. One room had bunk beds, a thrill for the kids, the second two double beds. We were in rooms 3352 and 3354. The rooms were unimpressive, small, dark, musty, typical hotel rooms. A fridge was provided, cheap soaps and shampoos, thin towels, and the worst, cheap motel bed spreads. The beds were comfortable though. No complimentary water bottles as in most deluxe hotels, no water in the vending machine down the hall either, only soda. Who drinks soda anymore? Water in the gift shop, quite a trek from the room, especially with kids. Gift shop well stocked with milk, beer, medicine, ect. but expensive. No special welcoming touches, i.e., chocolates on the pillow, face cloths folded in disney shapes as I remember from previous years, were provided. Cattle call mentality, mass production. The view was memorable, lots of giraffes frolicking about 60 feet from balcony, wildebeasts, and ostrich. You will not see anything wilder than tame animals. It is built like a typical motel surrounding the savannah. Rooms are crammed into every nook and cranny. It could easily be a holiday inn if you took away the animals. Animals very active in morning and at dusk. Other than the view of the animals, nothing to write home about. I think the kids will treasure the memory, but I would not elect to stay there again. If you go, request a room near the check in desk, rooms are wide spread. Actually, go further and search for a map of the hotel on the internet and consult it when making reservations. The Victoria Falls bar is horrible, incompetent bartenders, I ordered a coffee drink and was warned I would not like it because the coffee was hours old and they did not intend to make any more because the bar was closing in an hour(closes at 11:00). It was 30 degrees outside, and I needed coffee! It was undrinkable. Do try the Tusker African beer, available only at Mara. Very smooth and relaxing. The lobby itself is very dark, the fire pit so many rave about on this site is gas powered, unattended and unwelcoming. I found no one reading stories around it and the clerk at the desk had no idea what I was referring to, she directed me to Ft. Wilderness. It is at least a 30-40 minute commute to the M.K., including waiting for the shuttle. The first day, a marathon was in progress and we waited a solid hour for the bus. As we exited the M.K. at 9:15 p.m., we saw the shuttle pull away and waited 30 minutes for another bus. Best tip I gained from this site, if you are staying on Disney property with children, return mid afternoon for a nap. We left the M.K. at about 2:00, my five year old took a two hour nap and woke up with a giant smile, ready to return. Trust me, you are not missing anything by remaining in the park with a tired kid. All will be miserable and Disney wears out the best of us. Again, kids love seeing the animals, but how long are you in the room? If you are accustumed to luxury resorts, at this price, you will be disappointed. The food in Mara, the cafeteria style dining establishment is fresh, and healthy choices are available, but it is overpriced(4.75 for yogurt parfait, $4.50 for PB&J), although that is par for the course at Disney. All in all, I am glad my kids saw the place, but I would choose a place along the Boardwalk next time. This hotel should not be grouped among Disney's \"deluxe\" properties.

My parents decided not only to join my husband and I on our annual 'Christmas' trip, but actually paid for the trip! As a Florida resident, we always get deep discounts on AKL or Wilderness Lodge. We decided to say at AKL. I am so glad we did! The Hotel: AKL is so beautiful (especially the Christmas tree during the holidays)! When you walk into the hotel it looks OK, but once you step into the lobby, it takes your breath away. I can see why Disney won an award for overall theming at this resort. You actually feel like you've been transported to Kenya. The rooms: BEWARE!!!! If you check in after dark, your room will be pitch black (in the savannah view rooms). The switches for the lights are located well inside the room (none by the door), so it takes a minute to turn on the lights! It was really funny, but if you had small children, they may be frightened at first (???). As I mentioned, we had Savannah view rooms. Ours was located on the Giraffe Savannah (there are three different savannahs on property). No kidding, at all times of the day you could see some type of animal, usually giraffes. One night, my family and I came back to the hotel at 1:30am, and my husband said, \"I wonder if I can see any animals?\" He opened the curtains and jumped 5 feet. There was a huge giraffe right outside our balcony. Disney has little electrical spikes in the grass so the animals cannot get too close (and you can't get too close to them!), but this giraffe was RIGHT THERE. The theme in the rooms was continued with African inspired bedding, drapes, and wallpaper (in the bathroom area). There are even fake mosiquito nets over the beds. A note of caution: My parents had an oversize room with an extra little entry-way with console and pottery. My sister and her boyfriend had a regular room with 2 queen beds and a nice dresser for holding clothes. My husband and I had..... bunk beds! There was one queen bed and one set of bunk beds (no, I didn't try them out). And my room had no dresser :( My sister said our closet was bigger than hers, though. Also, some of the hallways on the way to our room smelled like... animal???? I can't explain the smell, but it wasn't pleasant, and I was happy that our hallway and rooms didn't smell. I don't know what the going rate is for these rooms, but with our discount we only paid $199 per room, definitely a steal! The grounds: There are three lookout points on the property with actual African cast members that will talk to you about the animals and also about their native country. It's pretty informative and cool. Also, the pool is HUGE. It has a waterslide and is heated during the 'winter' (for Florida) months. The restaurants: We only ate at Boma, once for lunch and once for dinner. The dinner had mixed reviews. Boma serves authentic African cuisine with American specialities. If you are a picky eater, you might not like Boma for dinner (neither did 3 of us). If you are an adventurous eater (my spouse, my dad, and my sister's boyfriend), you will really like it! Love it even! Boma's breakfast is a huge buffet with tons of options for all eaters. Disney is so huge, that it's possible to stay all week and only eat in your hotel once or twice. The other sit-down dinner place, Jiko, has won several 5-Star awards for their cuisine. There is also a counter service restaurant for quick bites on property. The staff: Orginally, we were told that we could check in to our hotel, even though my mom was paying and the rooms weren't in our name. My husband and I rushed to Orlando ahead of everyone else and guess what? We sat in the lobby until my parents got there. Also, the concierge was rude! Unbelievable. The refridgerator was not working in our room, and we asked for a replacement. We went to Downtown Disney at 8:00pm and returned at 1:30 am and we had a refridgerator by our bathroom, blocking the sink, and the same stinky broken fridge plugged in.

When we first arrived, I was bummed that we got put on the Ostrich trail, not in a room overlooking one of the main large savannah areas. HOWEVER, as soon as I entered my room, I didn't even have time to put my stuff down before three giraffes strolled right in front of our balcony, followed by a couple of watusi and there were already several very cool looking African birds that you don't normally see in the States, including one that looked like its legs were drinking straw wrappers. An ostrich pruned itself in the background. I decided that I really couldn't ask for much more. Also, even if you don't get a room right in the middle of it all, there is a whole series of viewing areas off the lobby where you can stroll around and see all of the animals you want to see. The lodge itself is beautiful, the lobby is gorgeous, the pool area wonderful and huge. I believe the brochure said the pool was like 6000 square feet. It has a sand-colored bottom to look like a watering hole and a water slide set in lush greenery. The decor is just great, all wood, dark, rocky, earth tones, with tons of real African art. The gift shop has a parade either every night or every other night for the children, where they let the kids choose an African instrument to play and march them around the lobby. The kids like it and they got certificates afterwards. There's an arcade and a kid's club, though we used neither. Also, this resort has tons of educational offerings for kids, the guides who are from Africa will explain all sorts of things, and they have storytelling around a fire pit, maskmaking, etc., etc. We didn't have time for much of these, but wished we did. Next time must be a week. This lodge has one of the best restaurants in Walt Disney World, BOMA, a lovely buffet style wonder with both American food and a lot of African specialties that are absolutely delicious. We went for dinner and again for breakfast on our last day. It is great to try out such different foods, and while they are definitely unique, they are not so highly spiced that you'll get sick or anything. My mouth still waters thinking of the delicious curried breakfast casserole with biscuits on top. Or the roasted chicken with the delicious spices you would have a hard time finding in the US. A lovely lounge upstairs from BOMA, Victoria Falls, has some awesome drinks, which they make strong. The lava smoothie is wonderful, pina colada swirled with a delicious raspberry concoction. Heavenly. The \"Hanging Out in Capetown\" martini drink will leave you reeling. They also make great margaritas at the poolside bar. Anyway, the night at VF and Boma was one of the best of the trip. So mellow, such delicious food. We felt lucky to have Boma right in our own resort. People come from other resorts to eat there, be sure to book in advance. On top of the lovely lodge itself, having the animals all around you is such a treat, and they are cool, several that you won't find in the U.S. While the resort is totally separate from the Animal Kingdom park, between the resort and the Animal Kingdom park safari ride, we saw some amazing African animals. When I think back on our vacation, this resort is the thing that makes me most nostalgic.

I read on a website that conceirge would contact you to make reservations, etc. No one contacted us. Additionally, with Disney now allowing dining reservations 180 days in advance, one cannot wait for Concierge to call as they do not have any \"ins\" to places, ie they cannot get you into a restaurant that is booked-up. However, the one perk of staying on the Concierge Level is that I read about a SUNSET safari that was for adults only (on the web) and included a chef designed meal with wine pairings. I called and booked that ahead of time and it was truly a once in a lifetime experience. In addition to having the chef cook for us personally, we also petted a giraffe on our own safari. THAT was worth the money. But I would not spend the money on concierge service again.

Jiko was excellent. Nice selection of African wines. Good selection of authentic foods. Steak that I had was one of the best and the flatbreads and sampler of dips is a must.

Although the Port Orleans is a Moderate hotel it had everything and i could not fault it at all. The staff at Port Orleans would do anything for you to make your stay run as smoothly as possible where as the staff at the AKL from the begin of our stay to the end took the attitude that everything was too much like hard work and I found them alot of the time damn right rude. None off the staff looked like they are enjoying working at the hotel apart from the South African Rangers who i thought were excellent. The staff in the Mara restaurant were terrible if you asked for anything a little diffrent the response was NO. And this kind of service for around $260 night. NOT GOOD.

As there was just the two of us the room was plenty big enough, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was very nice and always keep very clean and the vanity area was great. The room had a real romantic and relaxing feel to it - due to the low lighting which was not a problem to us. The vanity area had more light and therefore ideal for applying makeup. Our towels were replaced daily and the room was spotless the whole two weeks - housekeeping was very good! We ate at Jiko, Boma and Mara. Jiko is incredible - the food is just amazing - Jiko is a must to try. Boma is also the same - however was always very busy and requires advanced booking, so much choice at Boma's. Mara was great for a quick snack - they do great salads and have plenty of healthy options as well as the normal junk food. The pool was great - in the heat of the day it was a relief to jump into a refreshing cool pool! There were always plenty of sun beds and towels - every where was very clean.

We got an outstanding rate for Florida residents ($143 including tax) right from the Disney website, and were upgraded from a standard view to a savannah view room (likely because it was an off season time so there were many empty rooms). One month earlier we stayed at the Wilderness Lodge (WL), so in addition to giving information about AKL, I can also compare the two lodges. The AKL is newer than the WL, and I found the decor quality to be slightly more upscale, and in general there was less wear and tear at the AKL. AKL is MUCH bigger than the WL, and along with the larger size, there were longer walks to rooms (some of them were really, really far from the lobby) and the parking lot was pretty massive. You could wind up walking nearly a mile to the lodge from the parking lot, and then nearly another mile to your room from the lobby - I'm not kidding. The pool area was fabulous, and if you are an animal lover it is really exciting to get to see the many animals outside your window (if you have a savannah view room) or outside the resort windows. I found it a bit annoying that, as we were waiting on line to check in (there was only one person ahead of us) there was a staff member going up to people telling them to get out their credit cards and identification. There were only 2-3 people on line. Given that it takes around 10 minutes for staff to check people in, and given how few people were waiting, it seemed a bit annoying and unnecessary to insist that people get everything out immediately. Other staff were pretty nice and helpful. Like most of the Disney resort rooms, our room had 2 queen sized beds (actually, some resorts only offer 2 full sized beds). There are very, very few rooms on Disney property that have king-sized beds, and most of those are disabled accessible rooms. I have no idea why this is the case, but that is what we were told at the WL. Consequently, many couples, particularly honeymooners, are quite disappointed when they are not given a king room. The beds at the AKL, like at the WL were quite comfortable, with a generous amount of pillows. One thing that is really annoying, and this was the case at both the AKL and WL, is that the queen beds are not set up to have 2 people sleeping in them. There is a bedside table in the middle between the 2 beds, so whoever is sleeping on that side gets a bedside table, but the people sleeping on the outside of each bed are out of luck. At the WL I think that there was the ability for the person on each side of the bed to control his/her own light switch, but this was not the case at the AKL - only the person sleeping next to the bedside table could control the lights. This was a problem when I wanted to stay up and read and my husband wanted to go to sleep. The room had a small refrigerator, and it was convenient to purchase cereal, milk and fruit the night before so that we could have a quick morning breakfast. At the AKL if you have a savannah view room they have video surveillance of your balcony - there are small signs regarding this in the room, but I may not have noticed them if someone had not warned me prior to my visit. They do this to make sure that guests are not harrassing the animals, or doing anything that would be harmful to the animals. Just make sure to close your curtain for privacy if you have a savannah view room. My husband enjoyed the fitness room, which had nice looking equipment (I did not partake - I had enough fitness just walking to the room and around the parks). We did not eat at the restaurants at the AKL, but they looked really interesting. This seems as though it would be a great place to stay with kids: animals, fun activities, nice looking kids pool and playground, etc. In addition to the massiveness of the resort, the other negative is that it is pretty far from everything else in the Disney resort. We drove to Downtown Disney the night we were there, and it took around 25 minutes to get there!! Imagine how long it would take on the Disney shuttle bus, which probably stops at a few other places before getting there, not to mention the possible 30 minute wait for the bus to get to the AKL in the first place. The AKL is close to the Animal Kingdom, but it is not really within walking distance or set up for walking to the Animal Kingdom park, so you need to drive or take a bus. Although this was an enjoyable visit, and it is a unique and classy place to stay, I would probably not return. It was fun for the day, maybe even for 2 or 3, but I think that the resort could get tiresome for adults after awhile.

Our favorites are the Contemporary and the Polynesian, and we have also stayed at the Wilderness Lodge, the Grand Floridian, the Yacht Club, the Beach Club and the Boardwalk. In fairness, it is a very expansive hotel and the vistas of the animals is a wonderful sight. The hotel pool is okay, and the gift shop has come very nice one-of-a-kind ceramics that are handmade by African artists. My chief complaints were that the rooms were very poorly lit (in fact, the whole hotel was quite dim), the decor was drab and depressing. The level of service was distinctly lacking (I was on hold twice for more that 20 minutes just to reach the front desk, and staff seemed somewhat indifferent) Also, if you are planning to stay out late in the parks or elsewhere, do not plan on getting anything to eat at the hotel, as there are NO restaurants open after 11, and room service is also not available after that hour. In comparison to other Disney resorts mentioned above, the rooms at the Animal Kingdom Lodge are much smaller, and the bathrooms are closets. The bunk beds are a nice touch for the kids, but trying to get a family of 4 ready to get going using a bathroom where we had to stand in the shower to close the bathroom door was a bit of a challenge. We did go to the restaurants, and the self serve Mara was entirely adequate for the kids and the food quite palatable. The African Stew was a surpise hit for us. Boma is the buffet style restaurant, which had many food selections to choose from -- unfortunately, much of the food was of low quality and/or cooked to death. We did finaly manage to get a nice peice of medium rare prime rib which was excellent, as was the flat bread. The pool was fun, and finding chairs was not a problem. The kids loved the zero entry and the slide. We asked for rooms facing the pool, as the kids enjoy swimming after a long day in the parks. All in all, I suppose it comes down to a question of tastes. I did not enjoy this hotel, and will not be staying here again -- even if they offered $50 per night room rates.

We have been staying here once a year since it opened. The lobby is magnificent. The rooms are very spacious and clean with large balconies. The beds are comfortable. We loved watching the animals at all hours. I recommended being on the right hand side of the resort where the savannahs are larger. The savannahs on the left hand side of the lobby tend to be smaller with more views of fences and utility vehicles. The only problem I have with every single visit is getting the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd we like. Some savannah views are not as good as others.

I want to address some of the complaints I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read about this resort. I know there are a lot of complaints about the price of food. This goes for the entire Walt Disney World resort, not just the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Food is overpriced everywhere. I recommend renting a car and eating off site for an inexpensive meal. Unless you have a reservation, most restaurants have one hour or more wait times. The Mara has good food, and is less expensive than the other restaurants on site. The Lodge has one store, and yes, the items are expensive, but what other store on Disney property is not expensive? Disney does have a very good marketing team that ensures guests coming off of any attraction or key areas in hotels be paraded through a store so the kids will beg their parents to buy, yet, another over priced Disney item. Depending on the location of your room, the walk to the bus stops can be pretty long, but when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying at a larger resort, that is normal. Make sure to get the bus stops early because they usually come every 20 minutes or so and sometimes you may have more stops along the way. If you love animals, this is the place to be. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely breathtaking! We will never stay at a different Disney property.

I have been singing their praises to anyone who will listen, it's that good. Upon check-in, we asked nicely and were immediately upgraded at no extra charge from a parking-lot view to a Savanah room, overlooking the Sunset Savanah, one of three in the resort. This was a $1000.00 value from what I've read! My daughters and I enjoyed seeing three giraffe when we settled into our room. It was so serene and beautiful, the view from our balcony. Throughout our stay we saw zebras, wildebeast, African cattle, antelope, warthogs and pelicans FROM OUR ROOM. There are common viewing areas throughout the resort where many other animals can be viewed. Our room was decorated with authentic African artwork and remained immaculately clean during our stay, except for one night when we lingered till about 1 pm, and the room was never made up. When we returned at 7 pm, I called the housekeeping number, and they sent someone in 30 minutes, and chocolates were left on our pillow after turn-down that night. We had an issue with milk at the lodge, in that my twin daughters drink about a half gallon daily and the only milk available in the marketplace in the lobby was little pint cartons. We inquired about larger sizes at the concierge, and she said she'd find out. Later that evening, she called our room and informed us that the had sent a runner to the nearest Walgreens and purchased for us 6 half gallons, which they would store in the hotel fridge and give to us incrementally as we needed them in our mini-fridge. Now THAT's SERVICE with a smile! The hotel lobby is nothing I'd ever seen before, very austere and incredible. Lighting is dark and mysterious, and my husband and I enjoyed looking for the seven \"hidden Mickeys\" that are subtlely placed througout the decor. The staff members milling around were in African costumes and indeed they were on assignments for a year from African nations and were so lovely and informative to speak with. The restaurants: Unbelievable! Jiko is the signature restaurant and it was delicious. I had the Mahi Tuna and the Stuffed Halibut and everything melted in my mouth. Just as good as Daniel and Nobu in Manhttan, in my opinion. Except that Animal Kindom was family-friendly withought selling out their fine-restaurant integrity. Our waitress brought over comlimentary fruit dishes for the babies as we waited for our courses to arrive and she anticipated our every need. What a wonderful experience. And all the wines are African and quite good. We ate at Jiko our first night and chose to repeat our resevation our last night. A little pricey but worth it. Boma is a buffet restaurant with even more African influences in the preparation of the food, so you need to be more adventurous. It was all very tasty, though. For example, the breakfast buffet had a curried corned beef hash selection which was awesome. The swimming pool is great, with a water slide you can't get sick of, even after 50 times down. The pool is colored gray-ish and not your regular blue water to resemble an African watering hole. It was in keeping with a wonderful Safari theme. I was impressed with how many lifeguards they had on duty (4 or 5 at once) who took their jobs seriously, which is good, considering there were lots of kids. There seemed to be pllenty of international travellers at the resort which speaks to the fine reputation of this excellent resort. Their bus services to the theme parks were prompt and efficient. My husband and I have travelled all over the country and the Carribean and Greece and France and even Malaysia, and the Animal Kingdon Lodge was right up there with the Big Guns.

We used the spa for massages- which was great and the gym which also had state of the art equipment. The pool was nice - the complaints about it being dirty are silly - it's the coloring of the pool.

Even when there are people busy milling around the lobby, it is still surprisingly quiet. Compare that to the All Star sports complex where we have stayed before and you'll see what I mean. One feature that makes this huge hotel seem \"cozy\" is the fire pit. It is a ring of chairs that circle a fire( propane) that guest tend to congregate at the end of their days at the parks. It is fun to meet people from all over the world and chat about things you've done for the day. At 10PM they had a nightvision monocular that guest could use to watch the animals at night. Most if not all of the staff are from Africa so a conversation with them gives you a glimpse into their homeland.

This is our 14th trip to WDW and this resort just isn't up to the Disney standards we've become accustomed to expect. I don't see how it is classified as deluxe. My 7 yr old son wanted to come here so we figured we'd give it a try. I was afraid of the darkness complained about so I got some 60W bulbs at W@lm@rt and night lights on our way and found that the resort used the same (I can't stand low lighting). The place & pool weren't filthy. Its themed like Africa so the pool bottom and resort walls were painted to look brownish red. On the other hand the hallway carpets were worn and ripped in some places where the different styles were meshed together and I've never seen this before at WDW. The food selection was terrible...and we're not too picky, EVERYTHING seemed spicy with exotic flavors, ICK. After day 1 we ate in the parks. Customer service was the worst I've EVER seen at WDW. On 2 separate nights I tried to call the front desk and they just let it ring! Once for info about transportation and the other to retrive a message THE FRONT DESK LEFT FOR ME and I couldn't get the darn light to stop flashing so I called housekeeping to speck with a Mgr. and the girl I got at housekeeping turned off the light. Not a Huge deal but not expected at Disney! Our refrige wasn't cooling properly and they made us wait 2 nights...un-heard of at WDW! Our only plus was our free upgrade to a savannah room from standard AAA. The animals were nice. My kids LOVED to see what was walking around outside our room but my husband and I got bored with the giraffes after day 2, they should switch stuff around a little more. Overall I say Eh. I was at WDW and my time in the parks made the trip a blast. However, part of the thrill of being at on WDW property is the continuation of the park-like feel in the resorts.

You are more likely to get discounted accomodations here than at any of the other wdw deluxe hotels. When we check in we also ask for a free upgrade, which we have received each time!! The only drawback is it's distance from the magic kingdom. The 20 minute ride back late at night can be a drag with the little ones. My advice is never to pay full price for Disney hotels.

Normally we stay at a \"moderate\" resort. But this time, we decided to splurge with a more expensive resort, staying less days. Because we probably will not get to take an African safari, we chose to spend three nights at Animal Kingdom Lodge, splurging for a savannah view room. Right up until we arrived, we wondered if it would be worth it. After all, a hotel room is a hotel room, right? Wrong. This proved to be one of our best vacation decisions. The first time we opened our drapes and saw a zebra, we could not believe our eyes. Each night, we would stop in whatever park we were in and find a bakery, to buy something for breakfast. In the morning, we would brew a pot of coffee and take our cinnamon roll, danish or other treat out to our balcony, sit in our zebra chairs and watch the animals. When we stayed elsewhere, we would be up and out early to explore the parks. At Animal Kingdom Lodge, we discovered it was harder to leave the hotel than we ever imagined. At 10 a.m., when we would finally decide it was time to head to a park, we would see a pick-up truck drive through, throwing branches and some other food from the back. And suddenly there were giraffes, zebras and grass-eating varieties everywhere. It was like another, separate park. We actually took more photos in the hotel than in Animal Kingdom or Epcot. For those who cannot afford to spring for the more expensive Savannah rooms, there are public viewing areas everywhere. Since man cannot live by oggling animals alone, the hotel has a buffet (Boma) and a sit-down restaurant (Jiko), both offering African-influence food. We chose to celebrate our anniversary at Jiko and were able to sit at the cooking place, where the chef's prepared the appetizers. One was from South Africa and shared some thoughts on the differences between the cultures. The food is amazing (sitting at the cooking place, we were tempted to order appetizers only, and the chef's put together a tasting plate for us, but we were glad we didn't miss the short ribs in tamarind glaze, too). The next night, we came back for dessert, and ended up ordering a chicken barbecue flat bread instead. The restaurants all serve African wines and beers, which just adds to the experience. Even the \"fast-food\" restaurant, Mara, has some interesting choices, including a chicken tandoori pizza (which we split as our post-travel snack) and the zebra domes made famous in Boma. While Animal Kingdom Lodge is tucked into a corner of the Walt Disney World property (making for some long trips by Disney bus to get anywhere), it was more than outweighed by the experience of staying at this beautiful lodge and spending time looking at the animals.

When we came in, we found that our room rate was less than quoted ($215 rather than $239) and although the higher rate was charged to my credit card as a one-night's stay for deposit, I didn't complain. However, they said there were no microwaves available in the hotel. After stressing that I made the reservation only because a microwave was available, a manager was brought out and assured that a microwave would be there by 3pm. Because we arrived too early to use our rooms, we went to the parks and returned at 6pm to give my 3 year old kid some dinner. We found our rooms were not connecting (which we needed for babysitting purposes) and no microwave was available. We went to the front desk to complain (because we waited over 15 minutes on the phone for some help), and when the desk clerk said \"I'm sorry but there are no other available rooms\" many times, a manager finally helped us and gave us connecting rooms with an upgrade to Savannah view for all of our rooms available the next day, and said a microwave was going to be delivered from another resort (which it did). However, one of the rooms had a view of pipes, and when we brought this up, the desk clerk said \"We are doing you the favor by switching you, so don't complain\" (shocking from a Disney castmember!), but another talk with the manager got us what we needed.

UNless you come to the hotel for the resturaunts or the savannah view lounges, I'd try a different hotel. Standard view rooms are significantly cheaper than other deluxe Disney hotels, but the magic of this place is in the view, so I'd consider a moderate hotel if you can't spring for the savannah view room.

All of the employees were very friendly, never holding their hands out for a tip. The pool and hot tub were both clean and seemed well managed. There were 3 places to eat, and 2 bars. The cleaning people were honest. As an example: My daughter had left the $10 bill her Aunt gave her on the bed. Wouldn't you know the $10 was sitting on the side of freshly made bed when we returned. It was a good feeling. Bad side: It is a dark resort. I don't know why they keep it so dark, but it makes you feel like it's the middle of the night all the time. It really didn't bother me too much though. My allergies were a little wacked out because there was a constant smell of wood burning. Reservations were required for the restraunts, or you weren't getting in. We even got a reservation, and we still didn't eat until 9PM! We were sick and vomiting all night over the food, as well, but I tell you it was delicious food, maybe we just ate too late... There is no complimentry breakfast!!!!

Considering that we paid about $340 a night, I would have hoped they could give us a muffin or something. There was a resonable shop in the lobby that sold 1/2 gallon milk cartons, so that was nice, and there were fridges in the rooms. Don't order off the menu for room service! It would cost you $12 for some pancakes (not including some OJ)! How do you justify that? Transportation to and from the parks was wicked on the shuttle busses. We sat and sat for our bus to pick us up, usually seeing other parks come about 2 times before our bus would come for our resort. The rooms were overall smaller then I thought they would be for the price, but there was generally at least 2 animals outside of our room at all times. They fed them under out rooms, and the animals slept under our rooms with some simulated moon light so you can see them sleeping. All-in-all a great place to stay, but if you plan on being at the Disney parks for most of the time, it might be pointless to stay here, because you don't really have the time to enjoy it much. My daughter ran to the window as soon as she woke up to see \"Gina\" the girraffe (she named one), so I can justify us staying there when I saw that little face light up. They had drum parades for the little ones, but I didn't see any other activities, like story telling or the such.

We were greated every morning by 3 to 7 giraffees, zebra, ostrich and wildebeast. Housekeeping was perfect and our room was consistently cleaned prior to 11:00 am. All of the restaurants on site are great. A special kudo has to go to Jiko. The service and wines are top notch as well as the food quality. We ate at the restaurant on two occasions and both meals were perfect and the servers were able to guide us through the menu and wine list with perfect suggestions. Mara (the quick service restaurant) has a great selection of fruits, sandwiches and desserts available at any time. Room service was great and it was a unique experience to dine on the balcony as giraffee and eland grazed nearby. The pool area is wonderful. The pool is at first an off putting green but it perfectly clean. Upon closer examination you realize the color is due to the bottom coloration of the pool. A bright blue pool would be out of place on an African savannah. Poolside drinks are excellent especially the Mt. Kilamarita and Victoria Falls Mist. Bus service was quick and efficient.

I am currently in the process of planning a ten year anniversary vacation for my wife and I, and it seems that no matter how nice a place is, there are going to be at least twenty percent of people that hate it. I've gotten really discouraged, because I haven't been able to find any place that at least a few people have'nt written horrible reviews for. In order to give myself some reassurance (and be able to overlook the negative posts), I thought I would check reviews for the most enjoyable place I've ever stayed, and see what people had to say about the Animal Kingdom Lodge for review comparison purposes. I now feel better because although there are several people that hated the AKL, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would go to spend a few days just at the AKL without any thought of ever leaving it. My family and I spent one week at the Animal Kingdom Lodge in February of 2003. My biggest regret was not taking an entire day just to spend at the lodge. Contrary to the opinions of some earlier posts, it is a resort with plenty to do. There were many scheduled activities that we just didn't have time to do while we were there. We didn't even really have much time to enjoy the animals or the artwork, let alone the programs. The pool was clean, very large, and generally terrific (heated year round) and there were scheduled activities for kids around it at different times during the day. Animals were very interesting and there were programs (listed in the program guide) that you could attend that related to learning about the animals. Botany program also (missed that as well). There were other activities including African Storytelling by campfire that I also missed. One of the really interesting things was getting to talk to several of the employees (many of which are on two year terms from Africa). The architecture, authentic African artwork, overall lodge design, etc. were extremely interesting and very well done. Boma (buffet style restaurant) was very good. I enjoy gourmet cuisine and will have to say that most of the food at Boma was better than the entrees my wife and I both had at California Grill (bill for two at CG was twice as much as for three at Boma). Ate at several \"classy\" Disney restaurants during the week, and Boma beat them all. Due to the fact that the lodge was modeled after a merging of different African Lodge styles, it was somewhat dark and was layed out in an elongated fashion. I didn't mind the several minute walk to the lobby, it gave me a chance to stop and look at some of the animals (we didn't have a Savannah view room) and some of the artwork in the hallways. The room was large enough for three people (we pretty much only slept there), and was cleaned daily (the housekeepers took extra time to do something special for our child almost every day as well). Overall, if you want to stay in a place where you can be absorbed in the African Culture for a few days (without the bugs, poverty, and disease) in a very classy and fairly authentic way, then you will more than likely enjoy the Animal Kingdom Lodge.", "Date": "May 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, KY", "Title": "\u201cNot Up to Snuff\u201d", "Author": "HelpfulTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR3494398", "Content": "I enjoyed my Disney experience but AKL rooms don't compare well with others in the $300 - $400 range.

The plan was to take my 9 year old son for a whirlwind tour of 4 parks in three days. My husband has wanted to stay at this hotel ever since he learned that it was being built. We have stayed at the Yacht Club (in 2000) and he has also stayed at the carribbean beach resort about 14 years ago. The decor is amazing as always- I cannot complain about that. The ability to see the animals is a treat. HOWEVER: we had planned to use the \"magic your way\" express from the airport- but never received any documents or information prior to leaving home, so we instead decided to keep our rental car and drive to the resort. When we checked in at approximately 10:30 am (the first of our three days in the parks) we were given a DIRTY room. We were given absolutely no information about the resort, the park hours, or any type of welcome packet. All we were given was a map of the resort and the maps of the four parks. Since we didn't want to waste time, we dropped off our luggage, put on some sunscreen, and headed to Magic Kingdom, expecting the room to be cleaned when we returned. When we arrived back, tired and hungry, the beds had been made but the room still had the the dirty towels, used soap, used dental floss, and former room occupants trash in it. Needless to say, I had to make a request to have the room cleaned and to specify to have the sheets changed. I got no more than an apology for the misunderstanding. The next morning we took one look at the pool and almost became ill. It was green and cloudy. My son was hoping to get to go swimming, since it was still cold in New England, but even he didn't want to go in after looking at the condition of the water. Absolutely filthy and disgusting. The resort was also beginning to show some signs of wear. I would say- do not stay here! It was not worth the price- you are not getting anything better here than you would at any of the Disney hotels. The restaurants were outrageously overpriced. Buffet breakfast for the three of us was over $45.00, and there were no real special items available beyond omelets made to order. These are Hawaii prices, but not Hawaii quality. The appearance of the parks was also dissappointing. They are not as clean as they used to be, and the staff are not as helpful, or friendly as they used to be. The sight of McDonalds everywhere was also not what was expected in a Disney experience. We did have a good time, but this is the last time for us at Disney. When we arrived home, we found the information for our \"magical express\" package, including coupon for complimentary lanyard and trading pin for my son. I called customer service to voice my complaints about the resort and the delayed documentation and they really did not seem to care. The only response about the condition of the pool was \"did you speak to the hotel manager?\" and a promise to be called by him.

As stated in this list many times before, the hotel is very dark, and has murky smell. My request for upper floor was not honored and I was put on the first floor with the view of the walkway to the pool.

The room was murky, damp, and tiny, tiny, tiny. I found mosquitos in the room. 2 kids and 2 adults in that tiny and dark room for 6 days in a row was very tough. It is a very ill-designed hotel, as it took more than 10 minutes from the room to the front door. The pool was absolutely dirty. My kids refused to go back to the pool after the first jump-in. People save loungers with towels and do not remove them when they leave. They never enforce any policy about them, and I did not see any crew going around picking up those towels, so there are a lot of empty loungers with towels on, and many more people wandering about looking for place to sit. A lot of people complain about restaurants or lack of them, and I never attempted to eat at the hotel. The least amount of time spent at the hotel was better. The service was almost nonexistent. Immediately after I came home, I was e-mailed guest survey from Disney so I vented out everything, but I was never contacted back. I have been an avid Disney visitor for the last few years, and I sense quality changes in Disney hotels. They are getting older, and they charge enormously for those rooms.

It was our first stay at ALK. We enjoy Orlando very much (Disney, Universal, Sea World) and have visited over 12 times in the past 15 years. We have stayed at most of the Disney properties, from value to deluxe, and we would rate ALK as amoung the very best Disney has to offer. We would recommend this resort and we would stay there again without hesitancy. That said, we shop heavily for deluxe resorts on the web and pick the best priced resort we can find, this is how we came to ALK for this trip, but, our absolute favorite resort in Orlando continues to be the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress Resort. We read many of the Trip Advisor reader comments and we found most of them on target. The rooms at ALK are suitable for 4 people, but tight. The general room lighting is a bit low, but we found the lighting in the double sink and make up area to be good. The toilets DO flush loudly!! Our room #3366 was as far from the lobby as you can get, and it was a hike, but, with the distance brought a very quiet room--refreshing after the parks. Our room did not face the interior savannas, it faced an exterior savanna, but we found the animals were very often right in front of our room and our view was very private. The pool is large and the zero entry was really great for vey small kids, seniors, and handicapped people due to it's gradual slope into the water much like walking into the water at the beach. The hotel was at capacity when we visited, every room filled, and by 1:30 the pool was getting crowded. By 3PM not a chair was to be had with guests returning from the parks. We wondered, now that we have a \"grown up\" family, if we would have been better served at a more business focused property like the Swan or Dolphin, possibly some of the rooms would have been occupied by business guests reducing the demand on the facilities the resort offers?? The room we were in, and I suspect each room , had a mini refrigerator, and a fold up type bed for an infant that was stored in the closet. Housekeeping and hotel staff we found to be excellent, but as noted in another review, if you are used to the towel animals, mints, etc. of other Disney deluxe properties, they do not do that at ALK. The rooms, lobby, and whole resort are absolutely beautiful and are worthy of a full day to explore and enjoy. Without question this is a resort you need to stay at, even if it is only once. Generally, you feel really good about where you are staying. The Mara cafe was very good for morning quick breakfast and lunch around the pool. Boma (buffet) and Jiko (table service) are the restaurants at the site. These offer African themed foods and both are top notch, and not only for Orlando. The word is out on both these eatries as many many people from outside the resort were lined up to get into these two restaurants. Definately make priority seating arraingemnets well in advance for both these resaurants. I commute around NYC so I do not like buses on vacation, so we rent a car. Parking for the car was no problem and we saw buses pulling into the lodge very frequently so I do think the bus service was good even though we did not use it. We find with the car we are free to come and go as we like and we travel to Sea World and Universal as well. Last, a case of Budweiser at a supermarket in Orlando was $20, compared with $5.50/bottle at the ALK. Similar savings on wine for my wife. For the kids we bought the $12 mug when we checked in and it was refillable at the cafe for all their soft drinks for the length of our stay. That's it!!

Our first hotel for three nights was the Royal Pacific at Universal and our second was for five nights at the Residence Inn at Seaworld. (I have posted separate reviews for these hotels) This was the part of the holiday that I had booked as a treat for myself and I was very much looking forward to my stay here. I had got a good deal by telephoning from the uk for an offer that was on the USA but not the UK web site. Staying here was mid price between the Royal Pacific and the Residence Inn. We did not get off to a very good start. We were early but not that early for our check in and after waiting for some time to check in there were no rooms available and we had a further wait. We could ring the front desk to check if our room was ready in about half an hour, and had to hold for a while to get through. Finally we were given our non smoking room number, we had booked a poolview room and were offered a room on the second floor. This room clearly smelled of cigarette smoke even though it was non smoking and we rang the front desk to complain. Again there was a wait on the phone followed by a wait at the front desk as we were reallocated a room on the 5th floor. This was a much better room not only from the smoking point of view but also the noise from the pool was less and that there was a view over the treetops. The bell hop rang to say that there was a delay with our luggage, after a further twenty minutes we had to chase it up again. Time was marching on and it had taken us about two hours to check in. (from 1pm to 3pm) One further irritation of our check in was that the boys surnames were wrong on their keycard, the cast member who was checking us in originally was unable to change them after clearly not being ok with the computer system. Luckily the second checker in was much more competent and was easily able to change them. So, yes this is the most beautiful setting but completely undermined by the most painful check in ever. Mostly when uk guests read reviews by Americans regarding room size then we know to take them with a pinch of salt as Americans are used to much bigger rooms. It is not just that the rooms are small, but there is no where to put anything. Also the bedside lighting is badly designed, the choice being between sleeping in the middle and having two lights on (one of them shining on the other bed) but being near the switch or sleeping on the outside and not having a light switch or come to that a bedside table either. Luckily I had a torch with me. It was nice having the balcony, they are very small but I enjoyed the fresh air. Once we got over all of this, then we did actually enjoy our stay here. There are many places to view the animals if you dont have a savannah view room. It has to be said that it is the african guides who enhance the experience, they are very helpful and cheerful and clearly enjoy sharing their love of the animals and promoting their home country. We had previously stayed onsite at Disney's Dixie Landings and I would say that there was a definate lack of Disney service compared to our stay there. I know that people complain about the transport but we had no problem with that. The food and service at Mara were standard Disney foodcourt service. Sadly we did not have the opportunity to dine here. As the days went by we did relax and the children enjoyed the pool and slide. One very lovely added bonus was that Mickey and Minnie visited on Easter Sunday and we finally got a taste of Disney magic. So overall it was ok but I would try another onsite hotel before staying here again. It is a beautiful hotel and has the unique setting with the animals but we missed the space of the Residence Inn and the 'Fast track' of the Royal Pacific. p.s. if anyone from Disney reads these reviews, and they should. Please consider an added fast track system for onsite guests. Even if it is not feasable to do the all out universal system, then at least let onsite guests fastrack from their hotel under the existing rules instead of having to visit the actual ride.", "Date": "April 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LI, NY", "Title": "\u201cAmazing for everyone !!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3305335", "Content": "I stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge IN MARCH and it was great !!

We ate at the buffet restaurant one night and the food was very exotic and delicious, but the $25/head price was hard to swallow. They offer valet parking, but we didn't use it; the parking lot is right there. The pool is great, even by Disney standards; it has a zero entry and a water slide. I just wish I bought the soundtrack to the resort. Also, the bus system at Disney World is the best; so easy to use, especially for the Magic Kingdom, since it takes you right up front.

We found the staff to be helpful and polite, throughout the park. The free shuttles run on-time, so don't bother to use your car (if you brought one). We found this lodge to be absolutely beautiful and the wild animal theme was effective and tasteful, with employees playing the roll of safari guides and interacting with the children and adults. We fully recommend this resort, and it appears to be on \"par\" with any of the other upscale resorts in the park. A couple of items were true.....first, the lighting is low, not only in the rooms, but also in the other public areas. Perhaps this is by design? The Boma Restaurant was not my favorite, but my wife liked it.

I have read other reviews with complained about the \"darkness\", room size, and availability of animal viewing, but I have no complaints! Yes, it is dark, especially compared with other Disney properties, but the dim lighting is part of the atmosphere and African theming. I loved how intimate the lobby was, with clusters of seating, and a fire place. The bar continues this this \"feel\" by combining upholstered furniture with traditional bar seats. The rooms, though small, are beautifully decorated, and have ample drawer/ closet and vanity space. The hotel is shaped like a horseshoe, with the \"best rooms\" in the inner circle. Our room faced the outside, yet, from our balconey, we awoke each morning to see a variety of animals. Our favorites were the giraffes and little wild pigs! Even if you don't have the best view from your room, there are glass breezeways throughout the hotel, where you can spot the abundance of wildlife. We ate at the counter-service restaurant, which was ok for a quick bite, and also at Boma. We loved the buffet at Boma. The food was delicious and unique. The kids also enjoyed the pool and water slide. (There's a poolside bar as well.) There are many activites around the resort; from cookie decorating to educational experiences with the animals. There is an on-site spa where my friend received a GREAT massage! The staff was friendly and helpful. Maid service was unremarkable (They didn't even clean the coffee pot or replace coffee!) However, friends of ours who stayed on another floor at the same time had exceptional service, including the cute towel animals! Overall, this resort is a wonderful family resort.

We arrived about 7:00pm on Friday and after it took us almost two hours to check in and get our luggage we headed to our room (The room was very dark , had two queen beds and very hot ..the heat was on???) .....we had realized that they didn't give us our park tickets, so we had to head back to the front desk, stood in line again and after about 45 minutes they told us we had to go to the will call window to get our tickets the next day? We also reported that our heat was stuck on and were told that someone would be up to fix it.(you had to leave the door open to breathe) After another 15 minutes or so, we finally got our tickets and headed out to get dinner. I ran up to the room to grab a few thing and there was a girl leaving with our thermostat unit, she said she would repair and replace it before we got back ( she also had 5 other units from other rooms and told me they were having big problems with them that night). There are three restaurants in the hotel, one is upscale, one is a buffet and one is a cafeteria. The Buffet and Upscale restaurant had 1 1/2 - 2 hour waits, and the cafeteria was just that...a cafeteria. Due to the fact that it was very busy at check-in, you were NOT told much. Not where go to take a bus, not where special things where going on, where to get info, etc. It took us about another half an hour to get out of there to find dinner...we ended up grabbing a cab, rather than wait for a bus...we were starving. We went to downtown Disney for dinner, we arrived about a half an hour before the restaurants closed...but we made it! But then we couldn't figure out where the bus picked up to take us back (we had taken the cab, so we couldn't find the bus stop). Finally after walking around the entire place we found the bus stop (quite a walk to get to). We arrived back at our room around 2:00am, and we immediatley checked our thermostat, because it was now frezzing in our room. It was on 65 and blowing cold (it was 49 degree's outside that night)....so we turned it up to 68 degrees and it blew HOT air again....there is NO OFF button so we had to sleep with the patio door open and the heat basting to balance the air?? We were up all night either freezing or sweating...thank goodness for the extra bed, because we had to take all the blakets off it and use them! We actually held our blanket in front of the vent to warm them up because our room was so cold. We finally got up at seven, and just said forget this. We called down to tell them that our thermostat still was not working properly, we asked them to send someone up, as we were going to the park for the day and also to send up extra blankets, just in case! We got back around 8:00 and had planned to changed into our suits and relax in the Jacuzzi after all the walking, we couldn't wait to relax. We opened the door to our room and it was about 90 degree's! We called down to speak with a manager and were told that they would call him and have him call us right away....my husband hung up phone and it rang instantly!!! My husband said hello and the man at the desk that we just spoke with says to my husband in a sarcastic voice,\" Room # 1234 wants to speak with a manager right away, their heat is in and they just can't stand it any more...blah, blah, blah\", This is when my husband speaks up and says, Sir, this is room # 1234 and the guy just stops and says...oh, i must have hit redial, needless to say, my husband just hung up. So now the staff is being sarcastic and rude. So we wait for a call back and a half and hour later we have a knock at our door. Its two repair women, who tell us that the manager sent them instead, and that they were never sent to our room that day to repair it again. One tells us that she did what she could with ours last night, but that they couldn't get new one's until today. Now it 9:00, nobody came to fix or replace it while we were gone all day, and so we wait with them. After they make a phone call to the Head Repair man (on a radio) they ask him to come up, he says he is busy, she tells him it is an emergency and he tell her that she can do it....just check the such and such part. One leaves to get the new part and one stays with us. She returns and goes to replace the part...then a Pipe Burst and boiling hot water is shooting out all over the floor...and hitting the walls across the room....she is soaked and because the water is so hot they are scrambling to find towels or blankets to cover themselves, so they can shut it off and not get burned! It was beyond a nightmare! They now have to move us to another room. I packed everything up and we moved....our room was not on the same Savannah that we had in the beginning, but at this point, we don't care...we put our suits on and now its after 10:00pm and we go to the jacuzzi. I guess the part that really surprised me, is that we never got a phone call back from the manager. After the mess that just happened, I would have expected a manager to call us and apologize, and just check in on us at this point. But we got nothing, not a phone call, not a message on our room phone, not a note! We checked out the later on the next day. Things happen that are out of our control, but I am a business owner and can never imagine not approaching a customer to apologize for something like this. My husband and I get away once a year for a long weekend, as small business owners we work 6 days a week and so look forward to our little getaway, needless to say I would never recommend this property. I have stayed at other Disney deluxe Resorts and can tell you that the service at this Resort is unexceptable. Also, be aware that there are no mini-bars in the rooms, Room service food seems like it comes from the cafeteria restaurant, there is NO poolside service, and you cannot order food from the pool bar. The service level at this Hotel is very poor. As far as the animals go, they are hard to find and are far and few. Customer Service by far needs huge improvement, they just are not living up to what they sell you. I was also told that my package include a private safari for Hotel guest only, yet when we got there upon check-in were told we were not qualified, that this was for special guest at conceriege level only. I actually had another guest checking in directly beside me and overheard her telling her service check-in person the same thing...so when you are told that your package includes a special Safari...get it in writing.

The beach club has poor insulation, you can hear both hallway and room-next-door chatter).", "Date": "February 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, MI", "Title": "\u201cA highlight of our vacation\u201d", "Author": "michiganmand", "ReviewID": "UR3175762", "Content": "My wife and I stayed two nights here the week of January 31. As my wife is a fan of spotting animals in the wild, she adored this place, even though we only had a poolview room and we weren't exactly in the wild. The theming is magnificent as is the architecture and landscaping. I should add that this is our first stay at a Disney deluxe motel and I heard at least one guest say they preferred the Wilderness Lodge, also a Disney property. My only real complaint was with the size of the room, surprisingly tiny for the money spent. But there is a double vanity next to the bathroom which helped in the mornings. My regret is that I didn't interact more with the guides at the viewing area outside who are eager and willing to answer questions about animals, themselves, whatever. For example, the night vision goggles guests can borrow to look at animals cost around $2,000. And because of the hotel lights, guests can't spy on other guests, but some have apparently tried, according to one guide. We have stayed in most of the moderate resorts and the budget ones as well. They all have their pros and cons.

The AK Lodge is superbly themed and the food will knock your socks off, even my 4 year old nephew loved everything. Our room was always clean and the pool area is great. However, the staff perhaps needs to go back to 'Disney School'. Except for the front desk clerks, everything we asked was met with a sigh or a scowl. We are not the demanding type, I was amazed. As soon as we finished unpacking I asked an employee I met in the hall where to find the best view of the savannah animals and was told, \"you should have booked a room with a better view.\" Then she continued walking away. Great, thanks, but that's not what I asked! I simply wanted directions to the viewing area. The front desk was happy to oblige. The next mornig, my sister attempted to engage one of the staff members near the pool in conversation about the animals and was told,\"Look, I have work to do\".

My son who is 10 enjoyed seeing the animals from the room. Upon our arrival around 11:30 a.m., the rooms at the inner circle were not ready until after 3:00 p.m. and we got a room where most of the time we were only able to see the zebras very sporadically (about three times during our stay) and very far away. We only saw a giraffe once. The only animals we could see every day during our stay were the pink white pelicans! If our room rate had not been obtained during a special reduced rate period, I would not recommend a savannah view room. You can see the animals with the night vision binoculars from the first floor animal area asking one of the attendants much better than we could from our room. My son enjoyed watching them at night with the binoculars. I objected about the 4th floor after reading from several sources that rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floor are preferable because the tree tops interrupt your view of the animals. The lady that assigned our room indicated that in the area we were getting there were not as many trees. Not true and very misleading. I would not pay more than $160.00 for a savannah view unless you are actually assigned to the inner circle. I found the buffet breakfast reasonably priced and very good. You get croissants (chocolate and plain) other pastries, plenty of fresh fruit, cereals, scrambled eggs, bacon etc and also you can have an omelet made to your preference (ham, cheese, bacon, mushrooms, or veggies). There are some african entrees that I did not taste, but they looked appetizing. This breakfast is much better than the breakfast menu at the Wilderness Lodge (where we stayed for 4 nights) which we found much more expensive and not as good, even greasier. Also the Wilderness Lodge has a much smaller breakfast area than the AKL. At the Wilderness Lodge you have to wait sometimes a 1/2 hour or more to be seated. At the Wilderness Lodge the ambience is much lauder because the waiters make believe they are hillbilies and even though they make you laugh it gets very loud. The servers are better at the AKL than at the Wilderness Lodge where they are not as prompt. In terms of the rooms, the two Resorts are exactly the same in square feet and layout. The only difference is the decor. My only complaint about this resort (AKL) was the bus service. That prevented me from giving this resort a rating of \"Excellent\". I agree with another writer that you must plan for an hour to get to the parks and to a restaurant. In fact, we had priority seating planned for 6:30 for most nights and we found that we were better off if we had the seating for 8:00 or 8:30, otherwise we had to leave the parks too early. While we stayed at the Wilderness Lodge we enjoyed the proximity to the parks but hated the breakfast. If I had to choose between the two resorts (AKL or Wilderness Lodge) I would stay at the AKL because of breakfast and the animals.", "Date": "January 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Beach, Fl", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Vacation in awhile\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3005485", "Content": "This was an amazing hotel!

They were wonderful in accomodating me VERY early and sent us to a upgraded savannah room on the Ostrich Trail 3rd floor. The wait in the lobby was a little longer than I expected, but I was checking in when families were checking out...so that was so be expected. At 11AM (check out time) came, the lobby was dead...so that would have been much better! Upon arrival, we parked in the self park lot (FREE) but the valet parking is only 6$...good price for Disney. The self park lot is only a few feet further than the valet lot and it was quite a nice walk anyways. No one offered to take our baggage to the room, but again..there were lots of people leaving and since we didn't do valet, we really weren't important to them. At 300 a night...I guess they should pay a little more attention to us next time! Our room was wonderful. Great size for 2, but it may get crowded with kids or more adults. Keep in mind that Disney charges 25$ per adult over the allowed \"2\" per room. We only had 2, but I was interested to learn that! The decor of the room was great. Perfect viewing of all of the feeders and giraffee were outside our window at all hours! Comfortable beds, but it is a little loud when other guests take showers or flush the toliet. We heard no noise between walls or in the hallway. And I know there were people next to us on both sides! Did not hear any footsteps above us either...good sign of a well built building! Dinner was a BOMA the first night...and oh my god was it the best buffet I have ever eaten. HIGHLY recommend the punch that they make there. Desserts were wonderful...had thirds on most of everything! Salad dressings were creative, unique, and super tasty! Soups were to die for. Mara has wonderful salads and soups....which can also be found in BOMA. I did get desserts from BOMA at Mara a few times...and remember that it is cheaper walking to Mara than ordering it through room service! Mara food is really good and not very expensive. The 11$ mug deal for unlimited drinks is a good idea if you are going to be around for a few days! But I just refilled my cup while I was at the pool a few times and it was all the same...and 10 bucks cheaper lol. I recommend this hotel to a family who is planning on some relaxation during their stay. If you are going to be rushing around the parks, then this would be a major waste of money for you. You can see animals at Animal Kingdom. You need to sit outside on the balcony and *watch* them...go for a stroll on the savannah or even sit by the fire at night!

NEGATIVES: [Neg. Item 1] Reservation was for a King \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Non-smoking room. Upon check-in, no Kings are available. The reservation did not guarantee a King, however, we were shocked to not find a King available when arriving mid-week in the dead period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. After requesting to speak to a manager we were informed that there are 1293 rooms in the resort, however, ONLY 12 are kings. Of the 12, 2 of the kings are in the suites, 8 are handicap rooms, and 2 are regular king rooms. WHAT????? I know that Disney is a family resort, however, advertisements focus on romantic retreats\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6in what\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6double beds? [Neg. Item 2] Resort guests are just slobs. Broken glass aound rocking chairs outside. People are just pigs but shame on the resort for not keeping it clean. Pool area was also dirty too. For a resort of this price-range\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I expected a far cleaner resort. [Neg. Item 3] Room size is no better than lower priced resorts. [Neg. Item 4] Room living space is no better. We had stayed at the Wilderness lodge last year and found the walls to be paper thin. We could hear people in the adjacent rooms and hear the supersonic flush of toilets in the rooms all around us. The same occurred in this room. Very disappointing. It just goes to show that buildings need to be built to code and sometimes the minimum code is ordered. Soundproofing should really be a main consideration. We were awakened to crying babies as well. What can you do\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Disney. [Neg. Item 5] Based on our room assignment, we felt the best viewing of animals in the Savanah rooms were between the region of room numbers 430 through 530. Rooms too close to the Arusha Rock Savanna Overlook will not give you your moneys worth. During our stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it appeared that at various times of the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c animals would roam. A recommendation is to get close to the viewing tip of Arusha Rock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak. You'll have clear images of the animals as they place food/vegetation for the animals to eat. [Neg. Item 6] Insufficient porter service. Upon check-out, over a half-hour wait for them to come to the room. [Neg. Item 7] We found our check-in person to be so rude. Upon being handed our keys \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I looked at my wife and thought\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.are we in Disney? Customer service just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a priority anymore. Get ready if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been in a while. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a reason why they no longer say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Have a Magical Day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. POSITIVES: Fabulous viewing of wildlife. Zebras, Wilderbeasts, Giraffes, and other animals can be seen grazing pretty much all day long. Bring the cameras and enjoy. The resort does provide an opportunity to be in the thick of the animals from your room. We were on the second floor and enjoyed opening the curtains in the morning and viewing the giraffes eating within 30 yards of the window. The resort does have a responsibility to the safety of the animals and I can understand why they have a perimeter between the rooms and animals. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to see straws at this resort either\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6for the safety of the animals those just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist. The lobby design is similar to that of the Wilderness lodge. A huge hangar like structure with African d\u00c3\u00a9cor. Rooms were decorated well also. My first Disney room to have a complimentary refrigerator. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at the Port Orleans, Coronado Springs, Wilderness Lodge, and Dixie Landing. You really need to dine at the Boma Restaurant for dinner and breakfast at least once. Great Great food for the price. We really enjoyed it and recommend it. You should also try the Mara which is a cafeteria like eatery. Fair prices. The center lobby also had a tv playing round the clock with classic Disney cartoons. A fun place to gather \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcround. FINAL COMMENTARY: The hotel definitely had some positive things to enjoy, however, just not worth the money. Take a bus to the resort and enjoy the sites for free! We had similar feelings to a Dec-2004 Animal Kingdom lodge posting entitled \"Not a Deluxe Resort by any stretch - A Total Rip-Off\". Customer service really needs to improve. The staff just lacks that go-getter attitude. No exceptional service to be seen. Have the workers lost touch with the Disney ethos? I know I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be returning to this hotel for a room but definitely for a meal at Boma. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m ready for an off-site hotel, however, I have to admit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I find the moderate resorts just right.

So it's nice to get a lot of different viewpoints. I have 20 years in the travel industry, own an agency, and became a Certified Disney Specialist about 10 years ago. I no longer book leisure travel (corporate only), but I've \"done\" Disney about 12 times as a single parent. Sometimes single parents look for different things in our experiences and hotels (like our use of the Contemporary Tower so we could quickly and easily monorail back for afternoon naps when my child was younger). So I thought I'd add my two cents, as I refer to tripadvisor a lot, and think it is an excellent tool in decision making. For comparison's sake: I've stayed off-site (only if we're visiting a Disney park just for a day), Caribbean Beach, Dixie Landings (now it looks to be half of Port Oleans), the All Star type hotels, Wilderness Lodge, Contemporary (Tower room), the Swan, and taken a Disney Cruise. I booked AKL because it was going to be COLD on my 2 night trip. I didn't want a \"motel\" with exterior corridors, no jacuzzi, or to be stuck in a room with nothing to do if it was too cold for the parks. These are the reasons I chose to opt for one of Disney's Deluxe hotels. I'm not one for the \"home away from home\" properties...I don't have a big family, crave more \"action\", and am not about to cook a single meal or throw in a load of laundry! I want room service and laundry service...when needed. I was lucky to arrive on a not-to-busy-for-Disney day. Yes, folks... Disney is a busy place, especially during any school holiday, and you will spend money. No one should be surprised to find this. It's not worth complaining about. It is the number one vacation destination worldwide. There are lines and more lines, but...if you listen to tips, you can save yourself money, time, and a lot of frustration...and you won't be one of those screaming tired families you see. If your line at check in is LONG...plop your kids in front of the TV and be thankful you're not washing dishes instead. Valet parking was $6 day (great price). Self parking was not a terrible walk (if you were only doing it once). Valet was FAST, even when busy. We had reserved a Savannah view room, requesting Nonsmoking, bunk beds, near lobby. We got nonsmoking & bunkbeds, as requested. The bunk beds helped distribute kids as well as \"open up\" an otherwise small room. I feel it's important to note here that many complained their check in agents were \"rude\", or \"didn't honor our requests\". Requesting a specific area of the hotel, bedding type, etc...is just that...a REQUST. They'll either be available when you check in...or they won't. They do their best, but EVERYONE can't have the first room down any given hallway, or with a specific bed type or view. We were lucky. We got nonsmoking, only about halfway back through the complex, with bunk beds. I didn't think our animal view was spectacular. But none were really any better than any other. I read a lot of \"grass is greener\" comments on here about the viewing. But the animals DO roam from area to area. We had mostly birds, but one morning the giraffes all came over for breakfast. I read there were no coffeepots in room, or that people had to buy coffee refills. I did have a coffee pot, and empty fridge. I didn't use my coffee so I don't know if they would have refilled it. I would have liked to see our soap/shampoo refilled. We used ours, and I think they could have replenished it because, let's face it, that's a souvenir that people love to have. I used to line up hotel toiletries in my travel agency, and they're now on display in glass containers in my bathrooms at home. I think just one bar of soap or shampoo could easily be absorbed in the cost of each guest's stay. Towels were average in quantity and quality. Double sinks in bathroom was NICE! The opposite of the \"do not disturb\" sign was a \"please make up room\" sign. As a one time hotel maid...I LIKE that. It's nice to know when the room is free. Another \"aside\" to other posters who complain that they were \"gone all day and their room wasn't made up\". Again, the maids work all day 8am-5pm (or so). SOME rooms have to be tidied in the 3-5pm time frame, and SOME rooms must be tidied before 10am...or they just won't all get done. Toilets were the new, POWERFUL flush type (like a cruise ship). I heard flushing and showers and hallway noise constantly, as well as the crying baby next door through the connecting door (all the time, yikes!). I was disappointed at the overall noise level. It was hard to control the room temperature, even hard for me to understand the controls...but that's probably just me. The views were nice, but I personally would opt for the \"standard\" room next time (non Savannah view). For me, it wasn't worth the diffence in money. You can see the same views walking down the corridors, and at several viewing areas. And I've known too many people who were \"upgraded\" to Savannah view rooms anyway (too many Savannah rooms for the people willing to spend the money in them, I'm assuming). It was a fun \"extra\"....just not for me next time. There were a lot of kids activities going on at the hotel (night viewing, crafts, story telling). Too cold to swim (though some dared...in 40 degree weather with barely heated pools!), but the pool/spas looked very well kept and inviting. The grounds were beautiful. That is certainly something Disney excels at EVERYWHERE...all parks, all resorts..the grounds are fabulous. Lobby was...well, GORGEOUS. 3 stories high maybe? Stunning African inspired decor. The usual TV area to entertain the kids while you queue up at Guest services or check in. A relaxing lounge was just off the lobby ...conveniently on your way to dinner. Pit fires inside and outside were lined with rocking chairs. We were lucky to see the hotel as it was decorated for Christmas. It was just nice to get off the bus from the park and walk inside. You could feel your tired body go \"ahhhhh!\", peace again. Seemed like there were not as many sundry item choices for that forgotten toiletry in the gift shop...as there were at some other resorts. May be imagining that. I can recall having no car one my first trip, and not a single place in Disney sold \"pull - up\" diapers. I was amazed! We ate at Boma for 1 dinner and 2 breakfasts. Not outstanding. Serve yourself buffet, which I'm not fond of anyway. I love a big selection, just don't want picked over food or to queue up for it. It's been touched by kids with snotty fingers and tastes rather mass/cafeteria prepared. There were some \"fun\" choices at dinner, worth $25 for an adult easily, but $25 for a 12 year old to eat chicken fingers and mac & cheese? Breakfast was nothing special there either. We also ate at Mara (quick bite type dining) twice. Nothing special....served the purpose it was meant to. At least I never saw it \"crazy\" the way the Value Resort (All Star) food courts are. It's embarrasing to see people who looked like they hadn't eaten in weeks attacking those places. Blech, makes one lose their appetite. But Mara was kept clean and pretty well stocked. We ate at Jiko's once (table service). The best of the restaurants by far, nice selections, interesting appetizers. We tried the goat/sheep cheese appetizer tray and something (can't recall the name) cooked in corn husks (mmmm...tasted like hominy with the consistency of tofu in a hearty herb sauce...tasted much better than it sounds, great flavor). Good service. But, again, just nothing to write home about. Though I did get into every restaurant without reservations in less than 20 minutes each time. I must say I've never had a really GREAT meal at any Disney property or park. But we don't go there for the reknown food, after all. Walk to the hotel's bus transportation was not bad at all. Bus waits were normal (no matter what other reviewers say...they may have had a few bad wait times...it happens at every hotel sometimes). But the ride lengths and waits for buses was VERY normal, compared to other hotels. Bottom line. Loved the theme/decor/ambiance. I'd go back (except there are SO many other properties I want to try first). I would not pay the Savannah price (we paid $275 a night, plus we had to book an extra night just to meet their minimum requirement...and we didn't use the room that night). I would not plan on eating there as often (too many other choices abound). Liked the relaxed atmosphere.

We had reserved a Savannah view room and a few days before the trip I requested a inner savannah view. We arrived around midnight and were given a room as far as you can get from the main lobby. They told us it was a Savannah room but it was little more than a view of the parking lot and a small fenced in area where they said the animals feed. I called right away and asked to change rooms. They said they could not do it that night but to try in the morning. I called first thing at 6:30 am and they moved us to the inner Savannah view. It was a thousand times better. My question is why they didn't put us there in the first place as we were able to move right away the next morning. If we had not been given this new room our feelings about the hotel would have been terrible. A pool view would have been better. On our last stay to Disney World we stayed at the Grand Floridian and we really missed being by the monorail. The buses were pretty frequent but one morning we had a charater breakfast at the Contemporary for 7:00 a.m. and had to hire a taxi as the buses were not yet running. On a positve note, the main lobby was beautiful and the kids liked the bunk beds. Both restaurants, Boma and Jiko, were way above most of the restaurants we dined at in Disney.

The maid just cleaned, didn't even lay the girls animals on the beds, or anything. Didn't display my daughter's birthday cards. The hotel is huge and our room was in another state!

On my own trip, I chose to stay at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge and I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking about staying at a Disney Property in Orlando. Having stayed there before on an Educational trip, I found myself looking forward to staying at the hotel even more than the 7 night, five star caribbean cruise that I was going on before coming to Orlando. I was most impressed by the beauty of the hotel, the spectacular main lobby is similar to the Wilderness Lodge but the African elements offer something that no other Disney property can, genuine originality. The animals in the savannah are the main focus of the hotel, with numerous areas from which to view them even if you don't have a Savannah View room. The rooms are of average size for a Disney Property, which is not too big but also not at all cramped. The decor of the room is superior to many Disney properties barr the rather garish bed linen, the tied mosquito net behind the bed adds a little glamour while the artefacts on the walls as well as the TV cabinets, beds and mirror are all highly original, hand crafted and very pleasing to the eye. The balconies are a big bonus, they are very comfortable and quite large in size. Savannah Views are excellent, Waterview rooms are also very good and an excellent cheaper option. The level of service from the staff is that expected at a Disney property, excellent. The pool is very large with plenty of sun loungers that are always available and the restaurants are very popular, even with people not staying at the property. There can be a little bit to walk to get to your room from reception but it's not any worse than any other of the Disney hotels and its a lot less than some others for example, Port Orleans Riverside. Overall a very good standard and in addition if you leave anything in your room (as I did) the hotel will return it to you free of charge (even all the way to Scotland) provided that they have your address. A great touch as I hadn't even realised that I had left anything.

Good thing I had bought them disposable cameras because they loved taking pictures. The activities are wonderful. Obviously because of the confinement to the hotel it was packed with kids, but it was so fun. African singing, story telling dancing and playing along on authentic instruments was just a small part of the activities (all with disney characters stopping by). I agree that buying the cup for refills is a good deal. If I wouldn't have read about that on trip advisors I would never have even known that was an option.

When it first opened and so many people were so excited about it, my thoughts were \"What's the big deal?\" On paper, it seemed such an overpriced waste of time & money. I have now seen the light!! First let me say that I would NEVER pay full price for this or any of the deluxe resorts -- it just isn't worth $300/nt to stay at any of them. BUT, having said that, if you can get an AP or other special rate, it was really worthwhile. For less than we paid for the Wilderness Lodge (also at a special rate), we stayed here 4 nights in 6/04. While the Wilderness Lodge is still our family favorite, this comes close. Don't be put off by how far away from MK, Epcot, and MGM it seems -- it's not bad, and the buses for this resort were fabulous, even in this relatively busy time of year. Plus, you don't have to share with any other resort! It actually took us about the same amount of time to get to the Magic Kingdom from here as it did from any of the other 5 resorts we've stayed at (even the Wilderness Lodge with their direct boat -- however, we've not used a monorail resort yet). The housekeeping staff was efficient, though not as creative as we've had in the past, but just as friendly. We found the entire hotel to be relatively clean (difficult with all those hardwood floors), and room service trays left outside doors (one of my big pet peeves at WDW) were removed relatively promptly. The pool was wonderful -- it isn't one of the best at WDW, but is certainly above average with plenty of chairs even at crowded times and a nice shallow area for the not-toddlers-but-not-quite-swimming kids. The slide was fun for the pre-teens. The only issue I had with the hotel is that your room could potentially be 10-15 minutes walk away from anything -- the food court, the bus, whatever. We were lodged in one of the furthest away corridors (although we were upgraded for free to a Savannah view room). We didn't mind the walk but if our kids had been younger, it could have been a real problem. The food court is pretty much like all the other WDW food courts with the exception of the fresh salads they prepare there -- very good -- and the soups -- very spicy. The Savannah views are varied. They rotate the animals among the savannahs, so the chances are good for viewing almost anything from each savannah view at some point during the day. We looked out on a sort of circular pit that was fenced off, but just beyond it we saw giraffes, zebras, multiple other animals at various times.

Mistake!First thing is your reservation is basically no good. The best viewing rooms are first come first serve ifyou get there late forget about getting what you were promised. When we reserved a room a month ago we were promised a king size bed and perfect viewing. What we got was a room on the top floor on a outer wing that has no elevatore, 2 queen sized beds because they have no kings. Also one of the beds had sheets on it that were blood stained. I guess it matched the bathroom blood stain. The animal viewing is overated. We did see 3 zebras and that was about it,( if you do not count the wonderful dirt track outside your viewing balcony). The lobby is beautiful and the food at he Boma is wonderful but at $64.00 per couple hardly worth it. Also a fridge is a $10.00 a day rental Y8u are also pretty far from any of the parks except for animal kingdom. If you want to see animals up close and personal save your money and just go to the Animal Kingdom. We were booked for the week but I am writing you from another hotel on the resort. We stayed 2 nights at Animal Kingdom Lodge and cancelled our reservations. Another trick is thy tell you they are going to upgrade you to a deluxe i found out it is a marketing ploy they upgrade everyone tat stays there. I guess they think that that will ease you after they have just told you that you have gotten there toolate for the good rooms.

I have chosen to do our family vacation here every year, sometimes twice a year, for the past nine years. This time we chose the Animal Kingdom Lodge, concierge rooms. We have done concierge rooms at the Polynesian, Wilderness Lodge, Yacht Club and the Contemporary, (some more than once). We arrived and were escorted to the Bell Services desk first. My husband had spoken to Concierge two days before we left, we had to call them, no one contacted us!! He was making sure of our request to be on the 6th floor with a pool room view. Everything was repeated back to him as we requested, including the fact that my daughter's 15th birthday was during our stay. We were taken up to Concierge and told we had a fifth floor room with a savanah view. We were told that when the hotel was empty they didn't like to use the 6th floor rooms because the view wasn't that good. So, we went to the fifth floor room, and it was very, very clean and the view was great, decided to keep it. But, no robes in the room, which leads me to believe it really isn't used as a Concierge Room. First night and next two days at the Concierge was excellent. Quiet, good food, clean and efficient room service. But then our third and final day came. It was my daughters' birthday. Up to this point, we had kept a low profile, not bothering the Concierge desk, and pretty much coming and going silently. We paid for the Concierge extras! but, on the last day of our stay we felt really cheated of this. It was my daughter's 15th birthday, and my husband had arranged for a birtthday cake, nothing more, to be sent to the room as a surprise. We arrived back from a hot sweaty day to shower, compose and go from there, at about 2:30 pm. Our room had not been cleaned, so we asked the Concierge desk what happened, and she called housekeeping, got no respone, and didn't seem to care after that. Now my husband knew the cake was to come to the room as a surprise anytime after 3:oo pm. But we couldn't change and shower because the room needed towels, etc. So we waited and waited and no one seemed to give a hoot about it. Finally at 3:30 pm we got a clean room and towels. In the midst of showering and freshening up the cake was delivered. NOW IT WAS NOT A SURPRISE. And it was the wrong cake, which said \"Happy Birthday Michael\" my daughter's name is Kate!! Also, turn down service, which is included, had not been done at our room the night before, and didn't get done this night until 8:30 pm, after we had already come back from dinner and turned down some covers to sit a minute, before continuing our night. We paid alot of money, and didn't ask for much, but what little we did expect was ruined. No one really cared or apologized.. We felt because it was our last day and the hotel was getting crowded, we were just an afterthought. Very disappointed in that kind of service and attitude from a Concierge.

It was everything we expected, and it was wonderful. We took advantage of an August special and booked a pool view room for $149. I was under the impression that you could still see animals from some of the end rooms on the pool side. When I asked the front desk person about this, she said that the end rooms do have a view of the savannah, but the animals don't come that far down. I asked how much it would be to upgrade to a savannah view room and she said it would be $10 an night. We ended up with a fabulous view and saw lots of animals for only $159 a night. We thought it was a great deal. Disney transportation was wonderful. Buses run constantly from the Animal Kingdom Lodge to the parks. We did get stuck waiting 45 minutes at Magic Kingdom one night because the bus that came to pick us up tried to use the wheelchair lift to load a guest in a wheelchair. The lift broke and then they tried to fix it. A second bus came, but there were so many people that we couldn't get on until the third bus. It was annoying, but it was not a usual happening. Every other time we rode the bus, we didn't have any problems or long waits. The Disney Extra Magic Hour was the best feature. Every day one park opens an hour early for Disney resort guests. We got up super early, rode everything we wanted and then went back to the hotel when it started to get crowded. After lunch, a nap and a dip in the pool we would go back to the parks when everyone else was starting to get tired and stop for dinner. We never saw a parade because of this strategy, but we were very happy. We saw a lot of tired grumpy families. We enjoyed many of the hotel activities, but we couldn't possibly do them all. We spent time watching the animals, of course. We enjoyed the pool and especially the slide. At night we got to use night vision goggles to view the animals. We also got to hear the nightly storytelling. We enjoyed the free cookie decorating at Boma. One negative thing I did hear that you should consider is that the Animal Kingdom Lodge is not \"Disney enough.\" That is possibly true for some people. There is not a whole lot of Mickey Mouse stuff- not even Lion King. That was fine with us. We mainly wanted to stay there because of the animals.

It's the best value in Disney luxury resorts by far, and you won't find a hotel in Orlando with a nicer atmosphere or better restaurants. This property is not quite as sprawling as other Disney hotels- it doesn't take 10 minutes to walk to the restaurants or bus stops, like at Port Orleans or Coronado. Check-in was quick and simple, but check-out was more of a challenge. It was a 25-minute wait for a bellhop, which is apparently commonplace at AKL- not acceptable, in our view. The pool is busy but so large that it doesn't feel crowded, and there is a large and alert lifeguard staff, though they go off duty at 8pm. (the pool stays open 24 hours but the slide is closed when lifeguards aren't there- the slide is fabulous!) IMPORTANT TIPS BEFORE YOU GO: If you are getting a Savanna-view room (which IS worth the extra money!), request a view of the Arusha Savanna (that's the inner Savanna). It's the prettiest view, but don't be disappointed if you don't get it- there were just as many animals to be seen from our room on the Uzima Savanna. And ask for a 3rd or 4th floor room- that's the best view. If you can't afford a Savanna-view room, don't despair- there are plenty of overlooks for animal-viewing. If you expect to use the pool a lot, ask for a room on the Zebra Trail or Giraffe Trail- those are closest, though the Giraffe Trail doesn't have a Savanna view.

We had housekeeping come see the problem. They somehow then managed to place us in the room we requested originally -- at 11:30 at night -- dragging a sleeping child around, and one half asleep. Compensation for the literally hours of waiting on these two issues was two fast passes and a promise of turn-down service which never happened.

The pool is very cool, and themed accordingly. The best thing was while sitting on our small balcony one morning before getting started with another busy day of park hopping I was astounded to see a giraffe sauntering by. The way things are set up, he seemed to only be about 20 feet away but really, he was much further. It made my day. The only negative thing that I can think of to say is that the lodge is a fairly good distance away from all of the parks (except the Animal Kingdom Park) and the only Disney transportation is bus service, which is very efficient but adds to your time schedule. I would certainly reccomend it to anyone who's into the animals, but if your main goal is to just stay at a Disney luxury resort, I'd rather tell you to look at The Boardwalk Inn or The Wilderness Lodge.

We stayed in the concierge level rooms. Some of the benefits were that the 6th floor concierge level tv and table area was a nice place to take a break. The coffee from the automatic machines was surprisingly good and looked like a great place to park the kids (if we had any) for a breather and some free food (mostly snacks except at around 5 when they had some hors d'oeuvres). Also, it was nice to be able to make a reservation at the resturants the day you wanted to eat there... HOWEVER, even with the reservation, you had to wait (buffet resturant... I forget the name).... Finally, you can only get the sunrise tour if you are already booked into a concierge level room. You still have to pay the fee for the tour as well as admittance to AK, but without this tour, the room would not be worth it. But even with the tour, you may want to think twice. The tour only occurs twice a week (I think tuesdays and sat) so pretty much, the other nights, you are paying extra for a room that is exactly the same as a non-concierge room (in terms of size and view) for marginal benefit. Since the Lodge is not on the AK premises, unless you intend on staying at the lodge all day, the 6th floor really is not worth what you pay.

I read all the reviews on Trip Advisor before I went and now would like to add my own. Here's what I see as the problem: Yes, the resort is definitely \"above normal\" (Trip Advisor's rating) - but it's not above normal for a Disney resort. First, the good: the balcony of our \"Savannah Preferred\" room allowed us to watch a wonderful assortment of animals - like giraffes, antelope, ostrich. and other birds. Don't expect the \"savanah\" to be all that large. The work buildings are only a couple of hundred yards away. Plus, there's a dusty work road between your balcony and the fields of grass - quite necessary, I'm sure, to protect both animals and lodgers. Count me among those who prefer a lower balcony (2nd floor) as opposed to a higher one. We really were at eye level with the giraffes when they got to within 50 feet of us - about as close as the animals can come. When we went up to another observation platform, we really felt that we were no longer \"in\" the savannah. Another good aspect of the resort is the fact that you can view the animals from many observation points. It was really lovely to be walking along a corridor and to be presented suddenly with a view of African cattle at a watering hole. But the not-so-good things did cut in: First, I wondered what to make of those Trip Advisor comments about loud toilets. Yikes, I can't believe Disney was able to find a toilet that flushes this loudly. What's _that_ all about? It wouldn't be so bad if the walls were thicker - and that's the second bad thing. We had crying babies on either side of us and I was, unfortunately, reminded (at 3 a.m.) of how I used to have to get up and feed my little ones during the night. The rooms are a bit small, but not annoyingly so. The two of us managed quite well in it. We had the most delightful housekeeper who charmed us with little surprises each morning, all above and beyond the usual Disney \"have a magical day\" bromides. And yes, the food is expensive (surprise, surprise) - but it's not bad in quality. My personal tip is to try Jiko if you don't mind paying about $50 per person, including dessert. My 11-year-old (admittedly adventurous) daughter and I loved the gourmet dishes we tried. Boma, on the other hand, emphasizes that great American virtue: quantity - though the quality is really not bad. The swimming pool is a total disappointment, but I'm thinking that this is the direction that Disney is going: get people out of the hotel and into the parks, where money can be made. The hotel pool has a kiddie slide (what are those ads talking about: \"a huge slide\"?) which the 5-to-8 year-olds seemed to enjoy. So we ended up at Blizzard Beach, which we loved. In conclusion, the best thing about the hotel is its attempt to be a conservation-minded eco-lodge. I appreciate this aspect of it, though it truly was at the expense of spectacular design and architecture. Considering the fact that there are so many things to see in this world, I probably wouldn't go there again - though I don't regret having spent time there.", "Date": "April 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pinckney, Mi.", "Title": "\u201cWhat a wonderfull place!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1790022", "Content": "What a wonderfull place!

Don't stay in a room that you do not like. They are great about changing rooms. I like to see different rooms before I even bring my luggage there. By the way, I always keep my luggage with me.

The resort is quite large and some rooms are a significant distance from the lobby and bus stop to the parks. Rooms closer to the lobby suffer from (usually noisy) traffic passing by constantly. We were assigned a room in one of the buildings jutting off of the main arc of buildings facing the Sunset savannah. This did offer a good combination of proximity to the lobby yet being off of the main traffic flow. We were given a \"complimantary\" upgrade to a deluxe room. This translates into a few extra square feeet in the room and not much else. The downside is the deluxe rooms are on the 5th floor, so you are somewhat farther from the animals. I would have preferred a 2nd or 3rd floor room. The rooms are nicely decorated, a bit dark, with comfortable beds. The bathroom is too small and the door to the toilet awkward to close. And watch out when flushing the toilet...it scared the heck out of my little girl it's so loud and forceful. House keeping was adequate. If you would like a coffee maker you need to call housekeeping to have one delivered and it only includes the first day's supply of coffee.

The restaurants at the hotel include Jiko which is only open for dinner, Boma, a buffet open for breakfast and dinner and the Mara which is fast food serving all day. Jiko is an excellent dining experience, but rather expensive. We never did try Boma, so I can't comment on the quality. The Mara is decent, especially the \"grab and go\" fruit plates and wraps. Unfortunately, it's your only option for lunch if you stay at the resort. The pool area is quite large with sloped zero entry section and a small slide. The water is heated to the mid 80's so it's comfortable to swim even on cooler days. There are two hot tubs as well. There are many observation places scattered throughout the hotel to observe the animals and helpful guides at most places. Storytelling is done every evening around the fire just off of the lobby. I was disappointed in that they told the SAME story every night. Come on, isn't there more than one African story?? Activities are available for the children at scheduled times during the day including music, games, animal information, and night vision. Children can earn a bead for some activities and make a necklace or bracelet. The gift shop has a wide variety of unique African handicrafts as well as the usual Disney souveniers. Beer and wine are also sold and are much less expensive than from the restaurants or room service. Transportation to the parks is by bus. The buses run about every 15 - 20 minutes. Commute time varies from 5 minutes to the Animal Kingdom to almost 20 minutes to the Magic Kingdom. If you are going to another resort, your best bet is to rent a car and drive. Otherwise you have to switch buses at Downtown Disney. Guests staying at the resort park free at any other resort or park. Overall, it is a sophisticated resort which is still family friendly. The setting is it's best feature, it's remote location and lack of food service options is it's worst feature.", "Date": "February 2, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, FL", "Title": "\u201cNothing but problems\u201d", "Author": "SweetFirefly", "ReviewID": "UR1546156", "Content": "I booked my stay at Animal Kingdom Lodge through Expedia after reading the (mostly) excellent reviews here.

The clerk advised me to call the desk in 30 minutes to check on my payment. When I called down to the desk, I was told that they couldn't find my payment. I was treated as if I hadn't paid and I was trying to dodge the bill! Thoroughly insulting. Needless to say, they DID find my payment, but not after causing me endless aggravation. As if this wasn't enough when we decided to go to bed and turned down the covers, there were black hairs in both of the sheets. Not a single person in my family even comes close to having black hair. I was disgusted! When I called down to the front desk the manager did not sound very apologetic. She did send someone up to change the bedding. That was the least she could do. I felt I should have been comped something small for all the aggravation, but nothing was offered. Bad customer service! Also be forewarned that the \"Savannah\" these poor animals are forced to live on is too small. The animals barely have any room to roam. I think Disney made it so small so the animals would stay close enough so people could stare at them. I found the whole situation sad. That these majestic animals should have to live in such a small place isn't right. I do not recommend a room with a view. Save your money. The lobby was beautiful. The decor of the hotel is awe inspiring. Unfortunately the beauty of the lobby did not make up for the negative experience. We also ate at Boma. If you aren't into spicy, strange food, skip it. It wasn't worth the money. I love all types of ethnic food, so I decided to try this restaurant. The food wasn't good. Even the hummus didn't taste good. How can you mess that up?

The kids loved the pool and the bunk beds. The room was a bit small for a \"Deluxe\" hotel, but this was workable since we spent most of our time at the parks and pool. My first impression unfortunately skewed my view for the rest of my stay. We arrived at 5:45 on Friday and it took over 50 minutes to check in. We had included my sons friend on our trip at the last minute and the clerk was incapable of figuring out what to do. She would disappear into the back for 5 to 10 minute stretches, repeatedly leaving us standing and waiting. All we wanted to accomplish was to add one 12 year old to the room bill and purchase one park hopper ticket for the length of our stay. 6:30 rolls around and she is still missing. My husband was waiting at the reception counter when I stepped over to the posted restaurant menus to decide where to feed 4 starving and tired travelers. While I stepped away, leaving our suitcases stacked by the sofa area and out of the way, two bell employees walked over to our luggage and started to throw, (and I mean throw) our luggage into the corner! I walked quickly back over and said, wait, we were checking in, and one cast member snapped, We cant have luggage sitting unattended in the lobby. Then they both stalked off. That was it for me. I couldnt even see the beauty of the lodge or feel the excitement from the kids at finally being at DisneyWorld! By morning I had relaxed and chalked it up to our one bad experience but it continued from there. The kids went down to The Mara for breakfast and after ordering were told. \"We don't have any more table numbers. Go wait over there.\" The kids waited 20 minutes before I came down and asked where their food was. It took another 10 minutes to get anyone to help. They had forgotten the kids and just left them standing without giving them a receipt for the food they had ordered and paid for. Not too cool in my book. Finally we get to leave for the theme parks! Guess what? Our Park Hopper tickets wouldnt get us in to any parks. Fault of the hotel claimed the guest relations cast member at each park. You need another room key/pass. I have to mention that most of the people who helped us at each park and hotel seemed tired and slightly hostile. They seemed to almost blame us for all the problems that were occurring, but grudgingly gave us one day passes to get in. The hotel cast members then spent another 20 minutes each morning in the back trying to figure out what was going on with our Park Hopper tickets without any success thought out our entire stay at Animal Kingdom. All and all, we wasted many hours just trying to get things right with these people. 4 days later, I was relieved to check out and move our stay to Caribbean Beach Resort. It was much better. They did an excellent job in all areas. They were polite and helpful at check in and no screw ups with the Park Hoppers. Housekeeping at all three resorts we visited was excellent. The staff in that department was friendly and hard working without fail. Vero Beach was relaxing and really fun for the kids. The pool d.j. was great! I was planning another vacation at a Disney resort in a year or so, but now I have the understanding that Deluxe doesnt always mean great service and choose my resort accordingly.

We only ate at two restaurants while we were at the hotel, the Boma and the Mara. The Boma is a buffet style restaurant and the Mara is more of a mini-mart type place.

He returned 20 minutes later with a cup of milk and threw the bill on the table hard and said have a nice day and no, he didnt mean it. $40 bucks for breakfast and a psycho for a waiter, well, at least the food was good. We also ate at the Mara, which is akin to a 7-11 with even higher prices. The service there was just about as bad as the Boma, the cashier was so busy trying to hit on the female customers that we literally waited 15 minutes in line trying to pay, when we got to the cashier, he too had an attitude and grabbed my credit card with even more attitude after we asked him to please move the line along, we ended up reporting him to a manager. All in all, the hotel is overpriced for the service you receive, if you like animals and are willing to fork over the extra 200 to 300 a night to look at a giraffe from your balcony then go right ahead. If Disneys customer service keeps going down the same path, people will not return.", "Date": "June 29, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1107036", "Content": "Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge is one of my favorite Disney resorts! Not only does this place have rooms with a view, it also has a huge pool that is open 24 hours a day, great food, a babysitting place, workout center, playground, and so much more! Our family loved the resort! The lobby at the Animal Kingdom Lodge was the most spectacular lobby I have ever seen! I would reccomend this resort to anyone and everyone!

The room was decorated in rather dark colors, but we quickly adjusted and grew to love the rich woods. I hardly left the balcony - we were on the Arusha savannah and always had a variety of animals within eyesight, as well as birds. Three giraffes became frequent visitors of the trees below our room.We ate at all three of the dining choices here - Jiko was excellent with a fabulous wine list, Boma offered a great variety of exotic food choices for a reasonable price (and some of the wines too!), and the Mara had surprisingly interesting (and tasty) food for a food court. The pool was large and never really seemed crowded, though I imagine it would during spring break or a holiday weekend. Overall, a beautiful resort that transcends its theme park surroundings and becomes a destination in and of itself!", "Date": "June 9, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34515-d189076-Reviews-Disney_s_Animal_Kingdom_Lodge-Orlando_Florida.html", "Price": "$305 - $492*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2901 Osceola Parkway</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">PO Box 10000</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Orlando</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32830</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "189076", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/05/6b/056b10420351f07a9e479653980125de1large.jpg"}}
