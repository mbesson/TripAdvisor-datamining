{"Reviews": [{"Content": "This is really cool!! A converted monastry this hotel only claims to be 3 star and that is a fair and honest claim. The staff are charming and helpfull. The whole ambience of the place is cool (in this instance I mean cool in it's real sense) and simple. OK the breakfast isn't great but the bar opens in the evening and it is great to sit out facing the courtyard.Big Big plus a private secure carpark FREE in Florence!!Downside?? Well the shower was so small I had to wash my feet in the bidet!!!", "Date": "Aug 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR848336510", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Toni Brian"}, {"Content": "Nice rooms, great locale Hotel was in a great location, rooms are cozy and immaculate, bathrooms were very nice.

However, the Santa Croce hotel was the most expensive we paid in all of Italy and not worth the money. The hotel was nice and plenty big enough for my mother, sister and myself. The bathroom was clean but the shower was extremely small. When we booked the hotel they told us they had AC and in fact they did not. This was frustrating because it was very hot. They did have a ceiling fan that was helpful but not cool enough. The location was perfect, plenty close to all of the popular tourist spots. The management was nice and helpful. The breakfast was included (roll and OJ) and they even delivered it to our room, I think because they were remodeling. Overall it was average and I would only stay there again if all other hotels were booked (which is what happened).", "Date": "Jul 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR424355392", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u8120 stato un weekend da fiaba: mi...   showReview(17638291, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR625560014", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Solo la colazione un po...   showReview(17240622, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR713249654", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Famille avec 2 pr\u8305-ados de 10...   showReview(16731186, 'full');", "Date": "May 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR337136188", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ottima posizione e personale...   showReview(16726928, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR664819344", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "No me gust\u8d38 que el suelo...   showReview(16725146, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR314760015", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel ideale per trascorrerci...   showReview(14078462, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR902250217", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L'hotel \u732b piuttosto piccolo ma...   showReview(12752596, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR483999065", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "EL HOTEL SE ENCUENTRA MUY BIEN...   showReview(12649034, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR684946226", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "La situaci\u8d38n del hotel es...   showReview(11329223, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR534261595", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "La stanza \u732b molto piccola e nel...   showReview(11329222, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR472687833", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Stanza piccolissima (non si...   showReview(11329224, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR411559081", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "El hotel esta muy bien situado...   showReview(11329225, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR158632953", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d570280-r8349906-Santa_Croce-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "570280", "Price": "$146"}}
