I was so glad I was staying here rather than in the big name hotels downtown where my colleagues stayed. It only took about 10 minutes to walk to the convention centre in the mornings, and when I came back I was in a great location in old Montreal for restaurants and just wandering around. I loved my week-long stay at this small boutique hotel. It combined a great location in old Montreal, an extremely comfortable and quiet room, funky decor and outstanding friendly service. Impressive features included the good continental breakfast (included) with fruit, cereals, croissants, breads and real coffee, an extremely comfortable bed, great shower and fast free wireless internet. I really liked the espresso coffee bar in the lobby staffed 24 hours a day. The staff were wonderfully helpfut and experts at suggesting the right restaurants to fit your preferences - I was really happy with all the restaurants they suggested ranging from solo dinners to groups of friends. They also looked after me very well with ice packs, carrying trays upstairs for me etc when I sprained my knee after slipping on the cobblestones. I will certainly stay here on any future visits to Montreal, for work or leisure.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "CanadianTravelCat", "ReviewID": "UR128019898", "Content": "This hotel is such a gem!

The hotel is owned by the same people that own Place D'Armes, another favorite of ours. The bathroom wasn't as luxurious but the room felt really comfortable, more like a small apartment. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. If they didn't have the info you needed they immediately checked the Internet and provided what you needed. We opted for the breakfast and it was perfect. Croissants, jam, fresh fruit, yogurt, coffee....what more could you ask for? The croissants are from a boulangerie on the south shore that imports butter from Belgium. We were only there for a night but were advised that we also had use of a nearby gym if needed. We did hear voices in the hall early in the morning but it and it was only conversational.

Apart from a little neighbourly noise next door during one of our nights there (not necessarily an indication that the walls aren't sound-proofed enough), we slept soundly. The showers were large and offered several massaging jets which was a bonus. The water pressure was decent but not strong in the sink, but that proved a minor hiccup. We don't require a gym or business centre so simply having solid Wi-Fi, a flat-screen TV and an iPod doc proved enough creature comforts for us. Especially since we don't have cable at home. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Having fresh pastry and strong coffee sent to our door in the mornings didn't hurt either. A real treat.

We based our decision on the reviews from Tripadvisor and quickly realized why the hotel was so highly rated. We arrived at Le Petit Hotel on Friday night and the check-in process was a breeze. From the onset, the staff at the desk were incredibly welcoming, consistent with all of the reviews that we had read. The hotel offers valet parking at a rate of $25/night, which I found reasonable so as not to worry about it for the weekend. We were situated on the 3rd floor, in room 302, at the back of the building. The room itself was remarkable. We opted for the medium room, which offered us more than enough space for the couple of days we were in Montreal. The bathroom was big for a boutique hotel with an awesome shower and great Aveda products. The room itself was gorgeous. The walls were comprised of exposed brick and the floors were hardwood. There was a sizable desk and a wonderfully stylish (and comfortable) chair in the corner for reading. There were double windows, which opened in full, allowing the crisp winter air to fill the room. I must make this next point clear: Believe the hype about the bed, it was really, really comfortable. I don't know that I've ever slept in a more comfortable bed. Lastly, there was an ipod dock/stereo, which I found to be a great feature. Your stay will come with a complimentary breakfast, which was excellent. Croissants, chocolate croissants, homemade breads, fruit, cereals, and wonderful coffee-drinks were all options each morning. In past experiences in Montreal, as is the case in most major cities, the staff of hotels and other establishments come off as a bit pretentious. This is not the case at Le Petit Hotel. The staff was not only helpful, but welcoming. They answered all of our questions and quickly new what we would enjoy doing in the city based on our interests. The great thing about the staff is that they weren't suit and tie type folks; this group was young, cool, and obviously up on what was happening in the city. A great group... The location of the hotel was pretty perfect as well. While we didn't spend much time down in the old-port area, the neighborhood had plenty of nice things to look at (the architecture mainly) and gave way to easy access to the Metro. The only knock I would give this hotel is that the walls seemed a bit thin. On our first night, our neighbors left their room with their ipod on. As my wife and I tried to fall asleep, we were kept awake by the sounds of the awful musical tastes of our neighbors. However, when I called the desk, they were extremely helpful and very understanding. They responded to my request immediately and remedied the situation. I guess you really cant ask for more when a situation like this comes up. All in all, I think that Le Petit Hotel is more than worthy of all the Tripadvisor hype. The hotel is small, stylish, warm, and inviting.

From the moment we walked through their door, way before check in, after an early flight, Jennifer and everyone else working the front desk throughout our stay was kind, helpful, efficient and polite. Maybe it was the fact that the lobby doubles as an espresso bar? Maybe it was the upgrade to the larger room at no extra charge? (more on that in a moment.) Whatever the reason, my wife and I were instantly comfortable upon first contact with Le Petite Hotel. As to that \"upgrade\". I had read a number of reviews on Trip Advisor warning against getting a room that fronts the street due to noise late at night when bars and restaurant's close. While I had kept that in the back of my mind on my virtual 'to do' list, I never got around to requesting a quieter room and when Jennifer presented us with our free upgrade I instantly calculated the hotel was full, too many people had requested quiet rooms and we were the schmo's getting moved to the front. While all of that is probably the reason for our upgrade, we also happen to live in New York City and the noise we hear from our window everyday would drown out a thousand Rue St. Paul Streets. As it turned out, there was a bit of noise for a brief period around 11pm, but it was transient and did not effect my ability to sleep better for two nights in a row than I have for months in my own bed. We loved the decor of the room. Real stone and brick. The energy efficient lighting takes a few moments to get to full power, but once there we had plenty of light. The bathroom was well done with a light beige textured wall tile and porcelain \"wood style\" flooring. The glass sink was nice to look at but the more you use it, the more you realize it's not the kind of thing you'd want in your own home. What you would want in your home is the shower hardware featuring dual body jets stretching from waist to chest level. When set just right, you get the shower spray from above and either four mists or four jets -- your choice -- in any combo you desire. That in and of itself was a mini vacation inside our two day mini vacation. Breakfast in the morning was also great. They make a terrific Cafe Latte, smaller than you might get at a specialty shop, but well made. And their assortment of croissants, cereals, yogurts and fruit was more than enough for us. Brewed coffee and juice are also available, but be sure to ask your server for the juice as it is not sitting out on the breakfast bar. The staff was also helpful to us and all when it came time to plan dinner or find a show to see or simply get directions to the other parts of town. And that is our takeaway from this visit. Because as terrific as Le Petite Hotel is and as quaint as the streets of Old Montreal are, that area has clearly become nothing more than a tourist trap of very expensive restaurants, art and antique shops and souvenir stores. The real Montreal, as we found out, is one Metro Day pass and any subway stop you choose to take, away. Stay at Le Petite Hotel. But get out of Old Town as early and often as you can.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yarmouth Port, Massachusetts, United States", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to come back!\u201d", "Author": "Susan B", "ReviewID": "UR120580986", "Content": "All the rave reviews are true.

The location was prime - right in Old Montreal, on a cute street with a bunch of restaurants and boutiques. The hotel was a tiny bit hard to find, but only because we were looking for a sign and there wasn't one - just the name of the hotel on the windows. The staff took our car for valet, and kept it for the whole four-day stay. The lobby, cafe and eating-area are small, but stylish and well-decorated. I could easily see someone choosing to sit with a book or a laptop there (although we didn't because we had lots of sights to see!). The room was very nice. We were on the fourth floor in a \"medium\" room, which was fairly spacious for two people with lots of closet room, a desk, a comfy chair, two night stands and a king-sized bed. Our window was facing the wall of the adjacent building, so not much of a view, but it meant that we had a very quiet stay with no noise or light problems. The bathroom was a little cramped, but it was no problem for us and the amenities were nice, including the Aveda bath products and the shower with all sorts of strange options. The mini-bar is limited, but reasonably priced. It was a very clean hotel on the whole, and the maid service tidied up the room daily, replaced the towels and set the iHome music player/alarm clock to a soft trance music. The room, even on the fourth floor, had very good (and free!) wifi service. The continental breakfast was a nice start to the day, and it's sad that more hotels these days don't offer it. The options were limited, but the quality was very good. Plain and chocolate croissants, fresh breads for toasting, cereal, yogurt, fruit and coffee/tea. The staff would also come around and offer to get you orange juice or a fresh latte. Not a stuff-yourself breakfast, but perfect to keep you going until lunchtime. The service was, in a word, excellent. The staff was always pleasant and prompt with any requests, and personable while also being professional. Check-in and check-out were both fast, as was the valet. The provided us with maps, directions, called us a taxi, and gave excellent restaurant recommendations and made reservations. They remembered who we were and asked us specific questions about how our day had been and whether we liked the restaurants, etc. It was a nice benefit to being in a smallish hotel. If (when?)

Although some services (spa, exercise facilities, etc) are not available on site. Having stayed in locales where water pressure is an issue, rest assured that this is not the case at Le Petit Hotel. Found in the heart of vieux (old) Montreal, Le Petit has it all: access to the Metro (about 5-6 blocks away), restaurants, shops, galleries, culture (Cirque de Soleil is a 5 minute walk), sights, history, nightlife. No, the establishment is not perfect, but neither are you shelling out multiple hundreds of dollars per night for the experience. On the issue of nightlife, mentioned by other reviewers, one has to realize that you are staying in the midst of a large, cosmopolitan city in an area that is attractive to both tourists and locals alike. While party-goers do favour the area on weekends, most everyone seems to be wanting, and having, a good time. Club or lounge guests seem to be there seeking a fun, social atmosphere, not to exclusively cause grief to visitors. All manner of people are out and about on the streets at night: teenagers, parents with kids, grandparents, etc. We stayed in a room on the 4th floor at the rear of the building and had no trouble sleeping - to be honest a second floor room fronting on rue St-Paul would be noisier. The service provided was exceptional (special thanks to Alexandre, Andre & Wesley) as the staff are interested in what you have been doing, what you are looking for and how they can make your stay better.

If you want a 5-star where you are waited on hand and foot, by all means reserve one and pay $350-500+ per night.

Within seconds she had drawn me a trail to a few local restaurants as well as an area with great shopping. We then went to our room where the Bell Hop showed us all the amenities, as well as the beautiful bouquet of flowers my husband had arranged to have waiting in the room for me for Valentines Day. By email with the concierge, Joelle, he had planned to have them waiting for me along with a card written in French. Joelle (as well as the rest of the staff) were outstanding. They made constant restaurant reservations that were outstanding EVERY single time. They even took care of our Valentine's Day reservation a few weeks in advance, recommending a restaurant that was kid friendly so we could take our toddler with us to celebrate the day. They even brought us coffee and a tray of croissants to our room about a half an hour after we checked in. And as an option, they will bring you breakfast \"in bed\" which means they bring up a mini continental breakfast to you. The coffee assortment is to die for and everything was really delicious. Any email we sent them prior to the trip was responded to promptly and always with a, \"Yes, we can totally do that for you. It would be our pleasure.\" The warmth and hospitality of this hotel has me daydreaming about a trip back to Montreal almost daily. It's like a large bed and breakfast. They make everyone feel like they are VIP. The only small thing was how warm our room was. And it was easily remedied by opening the window. We slept like babies in the most comfortable bed I've honestly ever slept in. Even more comfortable than my own. Speaking of beds, they knew we had a little one with us so made sure we stayed in a room that had a separate area with a futon and made it up with a child sized robe on the bed for her. How could we not feel completely cared for? The housekeeping was incredible as well. It was immaculate in our room. I find it shameful people have rated this place down to 11th place.

We went to celebrate a very special anniversary and everyone at Le Petit made our stay so memorable. We were welcomed at the front desk so warmly, even though it was a very busy time of day. Our room was not quite ready(we did show up early) and we were offered a cold drink or coffee. Do not ever pass up their offer of coffee here! The blend is perfect and we are very serious coffee drinkers. Once our room was ready, we were told we had been upgraded to a large room. A nice surprise! We were on the fourth floor in a large room, facing Rue St. Paul. The room was modern and cozy. The furniture was unique in design and color and the brick/stone walls added to the ambiance. We later learned just how comfortable the bed and pillows were...heavenly! And the bathroom was small but nicely laid out and the shower was incredible. Through the entire weekend, every request we made, every question we asked was taken care of with a cheerful attitude. If someone did not know about something, they got back to us quickly with an answer. It was as though we were the only guests...and the hotel was booked solid! When we asked for dining ideas, for lunch or dinner, we were given several to choose from each day. And their recommendations were always on the mark. When we finally chose the restaurant(L' Epicier...not to be missed!) for our anniversary dinner, they made sure we had a taxi ready at the door. Breakfast is included here and is not to be missed. The croissants alone would be worth coming to Montreal! There is also a lovely fruit salad, cereals, yogurt, delicious breads for toasting, homemade jams and marmalades. And of course, their wonderful coffee, and you can choose a specialty coffee drink at breakfast...a cafe latte, espresso, etc. And anytime, day or night, they are more than happy to bring coffee to your room. We cannot stress enough just how wonderful the service was at this lovely hotel. And even though this is a trendy place and may seem to cater to a younger crowd, we as a middle-aged couple, never felt out of place. We felt welcomed and catered to at all times. We do not speak a word of French and that also was never a problem here. The staff, even when very busy, always had time for a chat or to assist us with information. We would like to thank Joelle, Ann, Alexander, Phillipe and Juan for all they did for us! And we need to mention just what an incredible job the housekeepers do...the room was spotless each day. From reading other reviews of the same weekend that we stayed here, we need to address the noise issue. We are very light sleepers and do not like our sleep disturbed. We did hear the partiers on Saturday night. It was annoying to be awakened, but that being said, if you stay in a hotel in a large city, noise can always be a problem. The solution? Never travel without earplugs. We have travelled the world over for many years and noise can be an issue anywhere. Travel prepared and you will sleep.

I informed them in advance (when booking) that we'd be celebrating our honeymoon and once I'd booked, I emailed them looking for a restaurant recommendation but never heard back - fair enough. I saw how busy the front desk staff is! When we arrived, there was a gentleman in the lobby complaining that his room had not been cleaned despite the fact he'd been gone all day. It was after 5pm, and the cleaning staff appeared to have gone home for the day. These things happen, I guess. The room was as beautiful as shown on their website. Beautiful stone wall, fantastic shower, comfy bed, great aveda products. Bliss. However, all those comforts don't mean anything when you can't sleep a wink. Between 11pm and 3am, the noise was loud, but a pillow over our heads meant we could survive it (how romantic on your honeymoon!) By 3am, however, as people spilled out of the bars, the noise was absolutely unbearable. People were shrieking at the top of their lungs. Groups of drunken men were singing as loud as they could. And it lasted until well after 4am. By the time we finally got to sleep, we were awoken by the street sweeper (!) going by just after 7am (on a Sunday!) We learned, however that the street sweeper seems to go by at that same time every day. Or at least it went by on Monday morning at pretty much the exact same time. And Sunday night was also a party night, if a little quieter than the previous night. So all in all, it was a gorgeous looking hotel. The staff tried hard to make our stay enjoyable, but couldn't quite pull it all together (they were rather harried most of the time). Nor did they ever even acknowledge the honeymooner status. A simple \"congratulations\" would have sufficed considering I saw the email exchange I'd had with the hotel printed out with our reservation. The breakfast croissants were delicious. But nothing can make up for not sleeping. It basically meant we holed up in our room to try to catch up sleep during the day, but as another person mentioned, the lack of soundproofing meant that not only did we hear the unbearable noise outside at night but we also heard the people upstairs moving about, the cleaning staff, people going in and out of their rooms and the maintenance staff (?) making repairs or some terrible scraping noises. And honestly, I am not a princess, I've lived in downtown Montreal before and would expect sirens and some celebratory noises, but this was unbearable.

My room there was facing a major road with a lot of truck traffic noise that bothered me, so I decided to cut short my stay and switch to Le Petit Hotel, which was on a smaller and I had hoped quieter side street. Unfortunately, I jumped from the frying pan into the fire. Just down the street from Le Petit Hotel is a bar called Santos that seems to be a bit too much of a hip happening place. There is loud base music from the bar itself and also noise from all of the people who hang out in the street to smoke (maybe banning smoking in bars wasn't such a good idea after all). And because Montreal bars close at 3 AM, this noise goes on past that. It is 3:20 AM as I write this and I am still hearing noise from the street. In addition, these people seem to feel the need to play loud music from their cars, honk their horns, and accidentally set off their car alarms after the bar has closed. Why don't they just go home? The hotel decor is nice, the croissants at breakfast are to die for, and the staff tries really hard, but the #1 job of a hotel is to provide a place to sleep in relative peace. While these activities are not their fault, they need to take legal action along with all the people who live in this area to get this bar shut down. If they don't, their business will suffer. After reading all the rave reviews (#2 hotel in Montreal), I was looking forward to staying here. Now, after this experience, I will never come back again.

I liked the iPod dock (though the sound quality wasn't that great), the full-sized ironing board/iron and the powerful hair dryer. The mini-bar was well stocked.

The rooms are of a good size, not too small, and well appointed with a comfortable, big bed and modern furniture and fittings which contrast nicely with the brick walls. Small, but nicely decorated bathroom with a large, very nice shower. Breakfast was excellent - all food items were of the best quality and there was a great selection of fresh fruit (4 kinds of fresh berries, pineapple, melon, kiwifruit), yoghurt, good bread, bagels, excellent croissants (best we had in Canada), homemade muffins, jams and butter. The only downside was that the (very noisy) dishwasher was in the breakfast area and the staff systematically put it on whilst we were having breakfast which was very irritating. Given that the restaurant is still under construction, presumably this problem will be solved once the restaurant is functional, as we assume that breakfast would then be served there. A few minor hiccups: Toiletries were not replaced on the second day and the wooden floor was sticky from a recent treatment which was noted by the staff but unfortunately not resolved. The room lacked of a stand for a suitcase - which was supplied immediately when we asked for it. A kettle in the room would have been a nice addition, as well as folder with information on the hotel and the city. Overall, the \"Petit Hotel\" is a beautiful little hotel with a lot of potential.

The staff were efficient and very friendly obtaining for us taxis and a dinner booking and generally were very helpful.

Our room was on the 4th floor and faced St-Paul, which can get loud on summer nights, but once the windows were closed, we heard nothing and slept without interruption. Finally, the staff were great. Valet parking was fast and cheap by comparison to other hotels. And the front desk staff were impeccably professional, thoughtful, and accommodating.

For example, in hotels of this class/daily rate, it is the norm to have a coffee maker in the room. FYI, there is none, not in the room, not in the lobby, nowhere. They told me in the evening that room service would be available starting at 6:30 am. In the morning, it is \"oh no, we don't even have a coffee maker.\" With plenty of false apologies, their only solution was for me to go to another hotel to buy it. An apology would be acceptable if something wast temporarily not working, but I was lied to and the lack of a cofee-maker after being open for at least a month is by DESIGN. They are in-conveniencing their guest intentionally. They put enough money into renovating this place, why not spent the $100 on a coffee maker in the lobby at least or do like every other hotel and have a maker in the room, duh?

It was one of the most delightful hotel experiences I've had in my years of traveling. My boyfriend and I stayed for 5 days after it had only been open for about two weeks. Customer service was exceptional in every way. Warmth, welcome, and generosity abound. It is well staffed and every staff member was like a concierge. Each went the extra mile when it came to making recommendations based on our unique interests/requests, providing directions, printing information for us, helping with our baggage and helping us with our car, showing genuine interest in how our day had gone, etc. We hated to leave and wanted to take everyone home with us! Patrick, the manager was fun and friendly while still being very professional, and Joell, Valerie, and Anthony were exceptional. Anthony sent an extensive e-mail with lots of things to do and websites for more information. There were others whose names I don't recall, including a lovely young woman who looked like Audrey Hepburn. The rooms are immaculate, with bamboo floors, big screen TV on the wall, and the most wonderful bedding! You wont' want to get out of bed. There are little amenities like an IPod radio bedside with different nature sounds to fall asleep to, a shower with an option for full body shower jets for an all over shower massage, and a safe in every room for no extra charge. Because their cafe was not completed while we were there, they sent us a minute walk down the street to their sister hotel Nelligan for a complimentary breakfast which was very good. If you do decide to stay there and aren't big on climbing stairs, make sure their elevator is up and running. They were working on it while we were there.
