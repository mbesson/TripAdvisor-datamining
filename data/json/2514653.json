Great location. Had tickets to a play and it was a 10 min walk. Yes the hotel rooms are VERY small but also very CLEAN and new and had what you needed. There were 6 rooms per floor and we did not have any trouble with waiting for elevators. I really have only good things to say. I travel for a living and go overseas on average of 5 times a month. The room was not that much smaller than the room I have in London. It is just a room for sleeping in and I have to say the beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was your typical express. I would stay here again as the location was great and the price was really good for NYC. The bigger chains were more than double (with no breakfast). I am a club member and really have good luck with Holiday Inn Express as a whole. If you are looking for clean, good location and a parking discount at a garage don't look any further.

The good things about the hotel were: - Good central location in Midtown - Cheap ($160 per night) - Free wifi - Free breakfast that tasted OK - Room clean and comfortable - Good shower The bad things about the hotel were: - Room was small. Somewhere to sleep and shower, but nothing more. - Often noisy inside the hotel. The walls are very thin and so noise travels into your room. In particular there is an ice making machine in the corridor outside the lifts that whirs away night and day. - Often noisy outside the hotel. There is a loud bar opposite that plays music relatively late. And there is some kind of car valet business that rings an infuriating bell that sounds like a burglar alarm every time they move a car downstairs. This goes off at intervals all day and was very irritating. My friend who is a New Yorker tells me I should have asked for a room higher up the building (I was on 5th floor) to avoid the outdoor noise. Maybe that is a good tip for next time. - Wifi painfully slow, almost like a pre-broadband dial up speed. OK for checking emails but don't expect more of it. - Lots of repair work to the breakfast area was going on that didn't seem to be getting completed in a hurry. In summary, this is a good tourist hotel if you want to see Manhattan for a few days, and I would stay again for that purpose.

The room was basic, and quite small, but comfortable, with easily operatable heating and air-con (however it was hard to avoid making it too hot or too cold without a bit of fiddling around). The showerroom facilities were fair, with the usual amenities of soap and shower gel, as was the tea and filter coffee tray, and the tv. Outside of the room, however, the hotel failed to maintain its quality. The reception staff were frequently disinterested, and the room safes advertised were not available for any of the full fortnight we were there, despite placement on a waiting list for the key at the beginning of our stay. Unfortunately, they still held by their policy of non-liability for theft of personal belongings not kept in the safe. This would not usually concern me too much, had it not been for the receptionist initially giving me a room key for an occupied room, where I walked in and immediately saw personal belongings and cash on the table. Security in the hotel seems very lax, especially as one guest i got talking to said the same thing had happened when they checked in. The breakfasts were mediocre, in a fairly cramped space, with a small self-service selection of lorne saussage, low quality cheese omlette, various iced buns and pancakes. There was no continental or healthy option apart from a mushy (perhaps canned) fruit salad. After hearing about the referbishments going on in the lobby area, all I can hope is that they are extending the kitchen area to accommodate a better quality of dining experience. However those hopes are fleeting. For the location, I would reccommend this hotel. As long as you intend to eat elsewhere, i would suggest considering it if you could get a reduced price for room-only.

That's why I stay here along with the location which is convenient but this is a no service hotel. Ask for anything in this hotel and the response is what you want something from us? I am a member of the chain's loyalty club but that gets you nothing at this hotel. Absolutely nothing. Maybe a bottle of water if you ask where's my check in gift from the club. The club is etitled to late check out ... well not at this hotel. The response is always oh we are so busy, maybe we will give you an extra 30 minutes or if you are really lucky 1 hour. Nothing more. You point out the club and their response is like \"so?\" Almost always when you arrive before 3 pm rooms are never ready yet in the morning the mains start banging around in halls before 8 am and they do anything they can to get you out of the rooms ASAP. The elevators are a disaster in the mornings especially. They have two to serve 25 floors and they take forever to come. If you have an appointment to make make sure you leave 15 minutes for the elevators to get down to street level. Can't comment what the new lobyy will be like but the breakfast area has been tiny in size overstuffed with tables and really hard to get the free breakfast the promise. Sometimes the eggs are like rocks and they always taste (if they taste) like reconsisuted egg substitue. The idea of the breakfast is nice but the space is too small and the food very medicore at best. The price at this hotel also varies wildly. Shop around because this place takes any opportunity it can to jack up the price and if you end up paying $300 you are going to be really disappointed in this place. Generally once they jump the price above about $100 or $150 a night I skip this place and go on to others in the neighborhood.

Jetlag meant we were in the breakfast area at about 6am when it opened! But even when we went down later there was somewhere to sit and plenty of food. The breakfast was basic, but substantial! Everyday there were differences. A mixture of warm food (American sausages, omelettes etc) and then cakes and pastries, and also cereals and milk filled us up adequately! There was always a member of staff on hand to clear up and always receptionists at the desk to talk to. The computers were useful, for online booking and tea and coffee making in the reception with takeaway cups were great to warm you up on the walk out into the snow! In terms of the location, this place was fantastic! Literally, five minutes walk from Times Square & Central Park. Literally, 2 minutes from The Empire State & Rockefeller Centre! Not a very long taxi journey down to Wall Street, Ground Zero & the ferry port for Liberty & Ellis Island. And in terms of shops and other attractions it was honestly really close. There were restaurants literally nextdoor and opposite the hotel, meaning it was easy to eat out somewhere close, or somewhere to get takeaway and take back to your room. The Chinese Buffet nextdoor was great, and the Pizza we took away from the place opposite was amazing! ;) Overall, a great hotel with competitive, but reasonable rates that can provide everything you need for a busy stay in New York!

In our case, the hotel location made it well worth its value.

We tend to visit the city by walking to or around areas and are back in the room around 10 or 11 pm. 1) Location: just blocks from Grand Central Station, Times Square, Bryant Park & Rockefeller Center = subway EASILY accessible (we've only cabbed twice). Lots of little markets and restaraunts for that last bottle of water or snack late at night on the way back in. 1/2 block off of 5th Ave. If you like to walk, most of the major tourist attractions are walkable: Empire State Building, Central Park are about 1-mile, MOMA is about 3/4 mile, the Met is about 1-1/2 and the Guggenheim is about 2. Around the corner on 6th Ave. is really lovely at Christmas. 2) Accomodations: rooms are very cozy (translate small), but some more so than others (we've always stayed in rooms with King beds). Some have tubs, some do not. Always clean and no bed-bug experiences. Coffee maker in-room. Wireless service excellent & consistent. Some rooms don't have full length mirrors. 3) General: pretty decent coffee 24/7 (decaf & regular) plus tea and hot chocolate packets. Breakfast is the typical HIE buffet. Enough to get you through the morning plus free, hot and edible in NYC is a rare thing. Our rooms have always been very quiet--even close to the elevator. However, I admit I would not want the room described by the person who said he was across from the desk (more litterally--down the short hallway). That one would be VERY noisy due to the lobby. I've never seen anyone leaving that room as a guest. Elevators seem slow to me. On the upper levels, I can punch the button, wait, go back to my room for forgotten item then back out and still catch it. There are only five (?) rooms on most floors and fewer on the two or so that have ice-machines. Public computers are VERY public--right in front of the elevators on the lower level (i.e. NO privacy). 4) Service: Staff is generally very good and very friendly. Meeting room requests (extra-towels, etc) has been inconsistent--sometimes they are very quick, sometimes I give up and go down to the desk. Front desk was exceptional the first few trips. They've been at least as good or better than most the last couple of trips. It's a small place, so expect to share the elevators with the service staff.

It was very close to the Rockefeller Center, St Patrick's Cathedral, and Times Square, so its a great tourist spot. I was also very pleased with the complimentary breakfast (not continental), since the more expensive hotels don't even have this particular service. Lastly I was impressed with the cleanliness and the amenities of the rooms. However there are some things that need improvement. First off, the hotel room was pretty small (got the standard), the second smallest hotel I've stayed in. I don't mind though, I've stayed in smaller hotels, but don't expect any room for any activities other than sleeping and reading the newspaper. I suspect it's because real estate is expensive in NY. Another thing was that their TV was not hi-def. It had HBO, sure, but it's very blurry, most likely due to cable issues. Their pay-per-view was also not working, so that was disappointing. Lastly, there is minimal soundproofing between walls. I can hear someone else's conversation right outside my door. Thankfully it wasn't too late at night, but it's a potentially bad situation. Overall though, I think the good things outweigh the bad. Great value considering its location and I really wanted to stay longer at this hotel.

It took the three staff at reception 1.5hrs to figure out how to reinstate my booking (while I sat in reception, tired after a long flight - it was 3.30am in the timezone I'd arrived from) because they wouldn't let me into the room until they had reinstated the booking. Into the room. Wet patches on the floor. I don't know why and don't want to. The room looked onto the air vent in middle of building (dark area of rubble) with a third of a curtain in the window. Room was located next to the lift and people were talking outside my door as they came and went all night. The wall that my bed headboard was up against must have been chipboard. The other side of it was where the hotel staff rammed trolleys all through the night. Every night. It felt like my headboard was violently knocked by this every few minutes. In the morning it took the hotel staff 40 minutes to locate an iron for me. (Which meant I was late for a meeting). I had some laundry and dry cleaning done, which looked ok. However, on the day of an extremely important meeting, I put on a pair of trousers (which had just been dry cleaned). I noticed the zip was a little stiff, but managed to do them up. During the meeting I went to the bathroom - and when I got there discovered the zip was completely stuck. I had back to back meetings scheduled, so I had to rush back to the hotel and convince a lady hotel staff member that, yes, I did really want to be cut out of the trousers NOW so I could get back to the office (in a skirt) ASAP. Other comments: - The electricity is only very low voltage. My laptop, phone etc took a long time to charge and my hairdryer only functioned at half strength. - The staff were friendly but did not seem to have the experience / knowledge / skills to solve any of the challenges that came up during my stay. When I checked out, the cost of the laundry was charged to my credit card but was not included on my receipt (which means I now can't claim it as a work expense). The Holiday Inn Express does not provide an email address and the phone has been ringing out when I tried to call, so I'm unsure whether there is now any way to request the receipt.

Free breakfast plus free internet: both Ethernet & WiFi with decent download speed. A very clean and spacious stone tiled and counter bathroom is wonderful. The flat screen TV didn't work; as I was their for one night, engineering coming by in the morning, didn't help me. Rooms are tight; in order to keep the rates low (make their rent through volume), which also allows for a designed hotel to provide for long jaunts outside with minimal time in the room for activities like sleeping, and hygiene. Friendly front desk staff is trained to always ask if you would like a wake-up call. Nice touch for a limited frills property. After observing the clerk scribe correctly both the time and room number, my call never happened. I did verify a working phone and the staff called me at 11a.m. to learn of my check-out plans. For the price you pay, you can't blame them, as they need to keep the property maintenance on schedule, or costs get too high. If you want to use a fitness center, as the desk for a discounted day pass to the nearby sports club--great facility. Now here's the egregious part. I became quite ill from food poisoning (outside of the hotel) the morning before I left--an hour after the missed wake-up call. I seriously could not leave the room and did not till 4p.m. Long story short, my conclusion is that they have a history of client\u00e8le squatting rooms--claiming to be sick, so they can stay in the room past check-out. Sadly, that was not my case. Even the request for extra bathroom supplies didn't alarm them. So with a full 100% occupancy looming that evening, they took the heavy hand and sent security down to force me from my room and gave me five minutes to vacate the room or they would pack it for me. They also threatened to charge me for all the delays (earlier in the day); this seemed odd to me, but made sense afterwards (squatting deterrent). When I refused to leave in five minutes because I was dehydrated and couldn't pack all my items in that short of time, I was told that I would be arrested if I didn't leave. I am serious. I know my rights and refused, telling them I would leave at 4pm which I did. To their credit, Security stopped by at 4pm to check the room. They then realized that I was telling the truth and swiftly told the front desk to not charge me for the delays. But, no apology was offered from either the hotel, or the manager present during the conversation with security. (Two hours later I took a cab to ER--better now). I am truly sorry that people try to take advantage of their rate by lying about their health to extend the stay for free, but they also have to train their staff for exception management. Bottom line: if you don't have any problems, you will enjoy the place; don't expect to stay in the rooms much, and get out to enjoy the city; if you have a need for a late check-out, this is not the place. If you don't care about service, you will enjoy it. Other than breakfast and Internet service, they are quite a no-frills outfit--which they advertise. N.B. My room rating and service are based upon my experience and that certain items didn't work and for the thin wall that allowed me to hear my neighbor just twice overnight. Others with fully operational rooms, will probably give higher rates. My friends were disgusted with how I was treated while ill, so I would probably not recommend the property to them.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGREAT! just what we needed\u201d", "Author": "kevin186470", "ReviewID": "UR64750306", "Content": ".i had read some of the reviews before we went over & we were greatly surprised how good everything was from the bedroom to the friendly staff.We will not thing twice of booking this hotel again when we return.Kevin De Largy Bangor N.Ireland", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - great location, very clean, very affordable!\u201d", "Author": "aspiring_traveller5", "ReviewID": "UR63110663", "Content": "I went on a trip with 3 girlfriends and stayed at the Holiday Inn Express on 5th ave.

Check-in was pleasant and efficient . The room and bathroom were very small but clean and functional. There was a free standard HI Express breakfast which is a bonus in this expensive city. The only practical deficiency is that there wasn't a room safe. (I am sensitive to this because on a recent stay at a HI in Paris I used the room safe for my important documents but neglected to put my mp3 player in the safe and it was stolen from my bag.) It is difficult to assess value for money because I don't have much experience of NY. Another thing that makes it difficult is that the room rates seem to vary a lot with time: when I made the booking a long time in advance of my trip, I found that the room rate was $280 dollars+taxes (online at HI website) but just before travelling I looked again and the room rate had dropped to $180 dollars presumably because of the recession. It didn't matter to me because in the end I had decided to pay with my Holiday Inn Priority Club points but when I return to NY I will have to give this aspect of things some consideration. Why am I not more enthusiastic about this hotel? Well, sometimes when one is on holiday one likes a bit of charm/style in the hotel where one is staying - this is completely missing from this hotel. I found the lobby/breakfast area crammed and rather scruffy.

After a few days at a small budget hotel in the uppper midtwon east side, I decide to spend the 2nd part of my NYC trip near the Time Square area so I can be closer to the theaters and all kinds of actions. Hotels in the NYC Theater District are generally priced higher and this one is no exception, but I got a fantastic deal - \"stay 2 get 1 free\" so the price was unbeatable! Hotel premise is located on W47 in betwee 5th & 6th (Ave. of America). This is a great spot in town and convenient to everything, including Time Square - only two short blocks away but without the hustlig bustlig of tourists coming ups and downs the street. Lots of eateries around the area and if you crave for shopping, 5th Avenue is only less than half a block around the corner. This hotel is not big - only 4 to 5 rooms each floor throughout the entire building so there is no fancy facilitiies like gym or swimming pool on premise. Hotel reception/breakfast area is cramped too. It's definitely a property designed for business travelers or tourists who won't spend much time inside the hotel. However, rooms are in decent size by New York standard (I had a room with two doube beds), cozy and nicely furnished: pretty much what you can expect from a typical H.I. brand hotel. An armorie with a LCD TV adds a bit nice touch. Bathroom is clean, spacious and is equppied with all amenities on the daily basis. The beds are incredibly comfortable. There is a little bit noise issue but really minor. Hotel price also includes free in-room internet acess, free daily breakfast and all day free coffee and tea. For cities as expensive as NYCs, these are absolutely big pluses for travelers. My hotel package included daily pizza delivered to my room but never got one. No big deal.

I had never been to NYC and had no idea about where to stay. I booked this hotel based on the reviews from this website. I was looking for something affordable and clean. This hotel did not disappoint; the rooms we stayed in were EXTREMELY clean. The hotel is located about half a block off 5th Ave; Times Square is about 2 blocks to the east. The area we were in felt safe and we were comfortable walking around at night. The hotel is within walking distance of several attractions, including Times Square and all the broadway shows, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Station, St. Patrick's Cathedral, etc. The complimentary full breakfast at the hotel was great. The only problem with the breakfast area was that it was small and tables filled up fast. If you want a place to sit, I would say you would need to be down there before 8 AM. We ended up taking our breakfast up to our room most of the time, but that was not much of an inconvenience for us. The lobby area is small and gets easily congested, but this was not a major problem either. The other reviews about this hotel are correct when they say that the rooms are small; there is not much room to move around. The corner room I stayed in was smaller than one next door that other family members stayed in. However, we were really in our rooms only to sleep, and the small aspect really didn't bother me much. The flat screen TVs are nice and there are LOTS of channels. The free wireless internet access is a huge bonus as well. I guess there is a office workstation area in the hotel but I never went there. The front desk staff was very nice and they were helpful. They quickly got us a cab the morning we left. Just an FYI, the cab they got for us was not a yellow cab and was instead a private car service, which was a little more expensive. But this was better than trying to hail a cab on a main avenue in the pouring rain at 5AM. If you are looking for a hotel with nostalgia, I would look for a different place to stay.

For the past few years, we've been returning to the Marriott Times Square--good location and we've always been very pleased with their rooms. They have always been very clean and roomy and the bathrooms pass my test. However, this year, the rates have gone through the roof and we decided it was time to try somewhere else. The reviews of the Holiday Inn Express on 5th on this site led us to stay there. I was a bit apprehensive going in, as I thought surely, no one had the bathroom standards I do. Well, I must say, it was a very pleasant experience. Yes, rooms are small--but there was a very comfortable king-sized bed there, as well as a desk area and stuffed chair. We were a bit stretched for hang-up space in the armoire, but we managed. The bathroom counter space was a little wanting, but the room itself was very nice and clean. The bathtub looked brand-new and the floor was sparkling. Best of all, the towels felt as if they had a little fabric softener in them. There was a hot breakfast buffet every day--no, it wasn't fabulous, but it was a nice added \"extra\" considering we were paying $100/day less than most of the other hotel options with no breakfast. They also provided free wi-fi, as well as a computer & printer in their basement for e-mails and printing out boarding passes. Be warned: there is NO ambiance in this hotel. If you're looking for a picturesque setting, it's not here. But for a couple of weary tourists, it was wonderful to come back to a nice clean room and comfortable bed each night. We stayed 6 nights. It wasn't far from the subways and was convenient to the theater. Our one and only complaint: we'd asked the Front Desk to call for a taxi the morning we left for home. Up pulled an unmarked \"taxi\". With everything we'd heard about not using them, we questioned the guy at the desk. He looked at the car and driver, then at us and assured us it was a legitimate taxi service. So away we went. However, it was not until we were loaded and on our way, that the driver told us the charges were more than a regular yellow taxi (about $20 more). I put the blame on us for not questioning him before we got into the cab, but I also feel the guy at their Front Desk should've been held accountable--he knew what he was doing and that it wasn't a regular yellow cab he'd called.

We only had 3 days to tour around New York and so really needed a hotel centrally located to Times Sq and the other tourist spots but one which didn't cost an arm and a leg! We payed slightly over $1000 for the three nights and to sum it all up - it was worth the money. Great Location: Just a 5-7 min walk to Times Sq., which is where most of the tour busses operate from to get you to the Empire state building, Battery Park (ferries to Statue of Liberty depart from here) and all the other spots. Walking distance to Macy's and the Empire State building (but we took a taxi because it was raining!) There are several places to eat next to the hotel - an Indian Vegetarian restaurant next door, a burgur bar 2 doors away and a sandwich bar/grocery store infront of the hotel. Just note that most of these places close at around 9.30 pm - which I think (coming from London) is very early! The room: The rooms are small - but not tiny. Me and my mom had 7 peices of (medium to large) luggage between us and we still had place to move around in the room - and think about it you aren't going to spend a lot of time in the room anyway being in New York. The bed was very comfortable and there was a choice of two soft pillows and 2 firm pillows. We had a room with one double bed - I like to go for 2 twins but the hotel was going to charge me extra. The room also has a lap top 'table' with a cushion stuck on the bottom so you can work on your laptop in bed - GREAT! The bathroom was mainly marble decorated - nice fluffy towels, little hand and face towels too. A tub with a shower. Breakfast and the Lobby: Breakfast with several hot options in a tarriff like this one was great. Loved the scrambled eggs and bacon. Loved the muffins and crossaints. They also provide breads, juices, cereal, boiled eggs, yoghurts and the famous cinnamon rolls (which I found too sweet and too greasy) The only downside is the lobby - which also is the breakfast area - its too small and gets overcrowded.

We had a wonderful experience there and would be more than happy to return. I should say first that this is not the right hotel for everyone, so I will explain the drawbacks. In my opinion, they are too minor to matter. The rooms are small--no larger than a good sized bedroom in a private home. The shower is even tinier. There is no fitness room. Guests can use a gym around the corner, but it costs $15. And, as other reviews have mentioned, there is virtually no lobby. But the Holiday Inn Express is great on the important things. For starters, it is absolutely clean. If you know New York City hotels, that's not always the case in this price range. And the staff was helpful and friendly. In New York, that's not always the case at ANY price range. ;-) Breakfast is included, and it is real food. There are Items like eggs, sausage, and french toast along with the typical cereal/toast/juice/coffee. (I do wish they had better bagels. After all, this is New York.) A free computer and printer is available for guest use. Most of all, there is the location, which simply could not be improved. It is about mid-way between Grand Central Station (3 blocks south) and Times Square (2 blocks west). It is far enough from Times Square to be out of the noise and congestion, but it is literally less than a 5 minute walk to Broadway shows. Fifth Avenue is steps away, so the shops are also very close. If your idea of a good New York hotel means a uniformed doorman, concierge services, and a grand lobby like you see in old movies, this Holiday Inn Express is not for you.

The drape did not cover more then 1/4 of the window. That was rather strange. The other room did not have a window so that was not a problem. Breakfast was good. We were down at 8:00 am and did not have trouble finding a table. It did fill up rather quickly after we were seated. There is a deli almost next door that offered a tasty and inexpensive lunch.

This hotel was located steps away from many of the attractions our family went to the city to see: Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, Fifth Avenue, Broadway shows, and convenient to subway transportation to other venues on our \"must-do\" list! Also, there are several quick service food options within steps of the hotel that we were very pleased with including Cafe Manhattan, Milk & Honey (great bagels!), and Cranberry Deli (cheesecake!), to name a few. Also, there were a couple of Duane Reade pharmacies located around the corners from the hotel (on 5th and 6th Avenues) for medicine and convenience store type items. We also felt very safe walking in this neighborhood after dark--we're from a small town, so that was important to us! We were a party of four (myself, spouse, and two boys), so as others have stated the room was a bit cramped. Just enough room for two beds and a small bathroom. However, the well-appointed room was spotless with plenty of towels and an airconditioner that really cooled the room. We had no issues with noise whatsoever, and the elevators were usually very prompt. The breakfast offered downstairs was always well stocked as long as you arrived before 10 a.m., and we managed to find a table each morning. There seemed to be hundreds of channels (including premium channels) on the big, flat screen television. As far as service goes, we didn't have any major problems with the staff. However, two mornings we did not receive our requested wake-up call. Luckily, our backup alarms came through. The desk clerk offered us a car service to the airport the night before our departure. The driver arrived on time and gave us excellent service to LaGuardia for $35 plus toll (we added a tip as well). Apart from the hotel, I'd like to recommend the NY Pass. We purchased a three-day pass online before our trip. The pass entitled us to entry/discounts at over 40 places in the city including several museums, Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Ferry, Empire State Building, NBC Studio Tour, and Madame Toussouds to name a few. We also got a $10 credit per person each day at Planet Hollywood (food or merchandise). I know we more than recouped our expense for the pass. I know there are other passes that are offered, but I can say that this one met our family's needs. Also, Carmine's near Times Square serves great, family-style Italian at a very reasonable price.

Breakfast was typical HI fare, cinammon rolls, fruit, cereal and pastries, bread and juices, and it was complimentary. There was tea, coffee and hot chocolate available in the lobby 24/7. I found all the staff very pleasant and helpful, and the few times i asked for something they were prompt to deal with it.

Internet service and lots of attraction leaflets on LL which came in useful. There was no in room safe but a safety deposit box was available at reception, which we used. The hotel was situated in a very central location and i always felt very safe returning to the hotel after dark. I don't think the 2* rating is justified, i would rate it at least 3*.

You don't go to NY to sit in and admire your room, swim in a pool, or run on a treadmill, you can do that at home, so why pay extra for a hotel which has these things??? At $180 per night, it was by far the cheapest rate I could find and it included breakfast, a bargain in NY where room prices are sky high. Clean, comfortable, excellent rates, central, customer service and free breakfast, book it now before everyone else finds out about it. If you're British like me and used to being ripped off for anything with a designer label on it then definitely Don't miss a trip to Woodbury Common Shopping Outlet (www.premiumoutlets.com). Take a bus from Port Authority (1hr, $36) to shoppers paradise, 220 designer outlets selling discounted clothing, take your suitcase and your credit card you won't believe your eyes and you won't ever want to buy things back here in the UK.

Tip: if you forgot to pack toothbrush & paste, the hotel will supply it for you. Just ask. The best part of the hotel was the staff itself. I have never met a more cordial and pleasant front desk (Shaniqwa) who was more than willing to help with directions and answer all questions. The front desk always acknowledged us when we walked past. Even the cleaning staff made a point to say hi in the hallways or elevator. Tip: If you need a ride straight to the airport, the front desk will arrange for a car to get you there. The car is not part of the hotel, so for a whopping $45, you can get straight to the airport without the hassle of hailing your own taxi to taking the dreaded bus/subways. Our driver came 10 minutes early and got us there in no time. Cons: There is no on site laundry as the website claims. But there is a laundromat 2 blocks away. Other than that.

I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "December 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cHotel Is Ok - Good Location - Price Issue\u201d", "Author": "cabezonmike", "ReviewID": "UR6363653", "Content": "My wife and I were blessed with the opportunity to get into the mid-town area of the city for a xmas weekend to see some shows, tree, etc. We could not find a hotel in the mid-town area that wasn't booked and the remaining available hotel choices under $500/night were very limited since we could not book many months in advance. So we chose this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. LOCATION The hotel is located on 45th street between 5th and 6th avenue. This was an excellent location for us since we wanted to do all the things in that area - i.e. Rockefeller, Broadway, central park, shopping on 5th. The walks to any of these places were not bad even in cold temps. There are a number of stores and restaurants on 45th and restaurant row up on 50-51st is not far at all. ROOM We had a King size bed room. The room is small but all of NY is small from what you read - but it's very small. We faced an alley so street noise was not a problem. But we had an orange security light from the alley shining in the window all night - they only offer shears on the windows so we had to jimmy-rig a solution to block that out. The room itself was very clean - the bathroom was clean as well. The room had a small LCD TV in the room \u2013 no pay per view family movies for those on extended stays. It also had a dresser with closet for a several hanging articles. Room was ok for our 2 day stay. SECURITY AND AMENITIES The property seemed safe as there were people walking in the area at all times of the night due to its location. The staff seemed nice and we had no problems checking in. The hotel offers free internet and breakfast in the morning - some bagels, toast, juice, coffee. PARKING The only thing that we did not like is there is no parking on-site IF driving. The hotel will tell you to park a block away in a 'Central Parking System' parking lot on 46th between 5th and 6th which they will voucher for you at $35/day. You park and then walk around the block to the hotel. If you are driving into the city during December as we did, and getting into the city between the hours of 2-9pm - best of luck. Traffic is horrible in that area so please plan your route to the hotel carefully - you may want to verify directions if you are using or relying on a GPS - you need to know where you can and cannot make a right or left since some avenues prohibit you from turning down them until 6pm or because of the season. So if driving and paying 300-500/night depending on season - you will park your own car and walk - the hotel does not feel bad for charging those rates and not having a better parking service - this maybe a problem for some, maybe not for others - just hope this helps if making your decisions. You can always drop your party off in front of the hotel before parking but with all the trucks on that street at certain times and no pull-in opening in front of the hotel - it's up to you to find a space - we just parked and walked from the garage. CONCLUSION All in all - the hotel is a mini-version of your regular Holiday Inn Express chain. If you're coming in December - you will pay Waldorf rates for a room here but don't expect any special services or anything more than a good but 2star hotel.", "Date": "December 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Sorrentosarah", "ReviewID": "UR6121996", "Content": "Great Central Location, Friendly Staff, Rooms Small but for the time you spend in it with so much going on around you it was just the job.

Almost on 5th Avenue. A 5 minute walk to Times Square, Rockefeller, Radio City, Grand Central and Chrysler. 10/15 minutes walk to Empire State, Central Park, Bloomingdales & Tiffanys. It was on a safe street and felt OK even walking around at night. Hotel staff were always friendly and helpful. Despite having a room only on the 3rd floor and at the front of the hotel it was very quiet and restful. Rooms are fairly small but perfectly adequate for the amount of time anyone spends sitting in your room when visiting NY ! Everything in the room is easily usable and with room to walk around (and even use an ironing board). The whole hotel is exceptionally clean. Breakfast is an added bonus - self service buffet so you can eat as much as you like. Tea & Coffee is also on-tap all day (& night) in the reception area.
