This is not a 4-star hotel. I say this not because this is an older hotel with small rooms, I like hotels with charm and character. But this one definitely needs some upgrading. Street side you are not going to get much sleep with busy traffic and no double glass to keep the noise out. Ask for inside rooms if you're staying here. The shower in the bath is old so dont expect generous amounts of water, although the water that comes out is warm. There was no safe to keep my valuables (I was in 212) but reception was nice to keep a bag for me. Wifi is 10 euro for a day and 5 euro for every next day. The system kicked me out however every time my ipad went to black so I had to reenter the code dozens of times. Breakfast room is impressive but breakfast selection is limited, on the upside they have very good fresh croissants. Finally, on the positive side, staff is helpful and speaks quite good English. If you're looking for places to eat, dont turn left towards fontana di trevi, you will find tourist places only. Go to the roundabout and follow the narrow street in front (via panisperna), walk to the Via di Serpenti and turn right, lots of nice shops and restaurants in this area. I had dinner at a trattoria at Via Leonina. The hotel also recommends Restaurant Petrucci, on the roundabout turn left Via 24 Maggio and then its in the first alley on the left: Via della Cordonata.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgrade, Serbia", "Title": "\u201calmost good, almost exelent\u201d", "Author": "kiropraktor", "ReviewID": "UR127283420", "Content": "To start with, it is on a very good location-close to everything.

Night time when we arrived so wern't really aware of where we were until the morning, and what a great surprise. 5 min walk from the Forum and Colloseum (well we do walk fast), and 10 minute walk from just about everywhere else. Absolutely perfect situation. The hotel itself looks very impressive on first arriving and the room was spotlessly clean with clean towels each day, however the room we were in overlooked a very spooky disused hotel with old air conditioning units and a dodgy smell so we didn't open the window, in fact we didn't look out as it was so hideous. Shower was brilliant, but the bath to stand in was the width of my foot so if mobility problems then could be tricky. Very small bathroom and couldn't open the door fully because the towel rail and bidet were behind it so if bigger than a size 14 you probably wouldn't squeeze in. However, it was clean and enough towels. we did have a small 'ant' problem but the staff sorted that out quickly. The room wasn't for relaxing, no tea, coffee etc and no view (as mentioned earlier) so consequently after 12 hours walking we didn't want to go back for a rest so we ended up sitting in cafes or on benches until bed time, this was actually a bit of a pain, but we managed. The TV was also a problem, we couldnt work it out, asked the staff who came and helped, but then it was all in Italian !!! too much bother to get him back so we sat staring at the walls for a while until we fell asleep. No noise from our room but thats because we were facing the air conditioning units !!!!. Breakfast was fine, usual continental fayre, nice coffee, nice bread and cheeses. Overall the hotel was OK but very dated and shabby with a strange smell. . Only met 3 staff who were a little brusque but we wern't there to be friendly and saw no other guests apart from 1, we actually thought the hotel was a bit spooky.

Turn right as you leave the hotel and follow the road around, and you will find yourself amongst the hustle of the streets of Rome, with bars & restaurants aplenty! We managed to pack a lot into 2 days, but its simply too much for just one weekend! The hotel itself is very Grand in the inside and the rooms are well decorated (obviously I can only comment on our standard room). The reception staff were very helpfull and spoke good English. The shower was hot and powerful, with a bath (should you find the time). Tv had satelite (but didnt use it). Breakfast is conntinental and smelt great but.... we didnt take advantage!

If looking for a hotel in Rome, acknowledge that the buildings are very old, and in some cases may not have the best veiws as the city wasnt built that way!

Yes, there was traffic noise, but remember the hotel is in the centre of a very busy city! Certainly we were not bothered by the traffic - just a background hum with the window closed - if anything it added to the atmosphere of being in a vibrant modern city, with ancient ruins. That is modern Rome. Redecoration? Well yes, the outside facade could do with a fresh coat of paint, mostly due to traffic grime I suspect, but pretty well every building in a modern city centre has this problem.

A person cannot fit in there with their luggage. We had to send our luggage up separately and run up the stairs to meet the elevator to get our luggage. The room was the size of a closet.

We checked out and went to the Capo d'Africa hotel which we loved.", "Date": "February 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Battersea, London but from Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTop marks for the Trai!\u201d", "Author": "Calm-Identity", "ReviewID": "UR3014047", "Content": "Just came back from a mid winter's break in Rome (Jan 2005) and spent a wonderful weekend at the Hotel Traiano. The Hotel Traiano is right in the heart of Rome with Via Nazionale at the top of the hill (nice shopping street), Piazza Venezia, Trajan's Column, The Colosseo, Roman Forum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and Via del Corso (another nice shopping street). It took us about 20 minutes to walk from Termini Station to the Traiano but we could have taken a shorter time, if we weren't distracted by all the shops on Via Nazionale =) Vatican City and other sites of Rome are well catered for by the Buses that run in front of the hotel or do what we did and just walk it and enjoy the stroll on via Vittoria Emanuelle II. It took us about 45 - 50 minutes to walk from the Traiano. The hotel itself is elegantly decorated with a hint of art deco designs on the hotel room doors and the bathrooms. We did have a room facing via Novembre (the main street outside the hotel) and yes you do hear the traffic outside but that can be easily fixed by closing the shutters and drawing the blinds. The reception and hotel staff were all very professional, friendly and courteous which made our stay at the Hotel Traiano even more enjoyable. Top marks for the Trai!!", "Date": "January 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cBe warned!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2596443", "Content": "I chose this hotel on the internet for it's location, 4 star rating and promise of a full English Breakfast. Sadly little of this was true except location. It is situated on a main road and the facade goes round three corners. The breakfast was cold buffet breakfast, not full English but more to the point was the condition of the Hotel. Having stayed in many 4 star hotels in the Uk, Europe and Australia I have come to expect a minimum standard. Sadly this Hotel should be no more than 3 star verging down to 2! There is no real lobby to speak of and only a minimum waiting area. The bar is the size of two cars but the biggest letdown is the decor. This Hotel looks like it has not been redecorated for at least 15-20 years. Fittings do not reflect a 4 star rating nor do staff levels. In the dining room there was only one staff to deal with all clients. Very poor, and the equipment in the dining room was also very old. My biggest gripe is the cost. I paid 760 euros to stay for 4 nights in september 2004 and when I saw some of the Hotels in the Via Natzionale that were charging similar amounts it made my heart bleed. Not a good Hotel at all.", "Date": "September 23, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Traiano", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d202581-Reviews-Hotel_Traiano-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$66 - $325*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via IV Novembre, 154</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "202581", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d4/73/d473b7d069598d540822f95c6987694b4large.jpg"}}
