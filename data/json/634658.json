After a few minutes, the clerk appeared and checked us in. The room itself was okay, with slightly older furnishings then other Homewood suites. The living room couch was uncomfortable and there was an aluminum \"box\" situated in front of the couch vs. a table. We found a piece of candy on the bedroom floor and long dark hair on the comforter in the closet. Housekeeping delivered a fresh comforter upon request. The biggest issue was we were in a non-smoking room and awoke one morning to the strong smell of cigarette smoke. It seemed to be coming from the bathroom vent. Thankfully we were checking out that morning. When we were leaving in the morning, once again there were no front desk agents to advise of our issues. Subsequently, a letter to customer service was sent detailing the issues. On the plus side, the towels in the room were very soft and the breakfast was good.

When I stepped on the elevator, I was a little apprehensive because it was pretty dingy and the carpet was stained and dirty. But once I opened the door to my room, I was instantly relieved. The room was modern and spotlessly clean. I stayed in a king studio suite so the bedroom and living area were all in one big room. There is a kitchenette as you walk in the door and a large bathroom/vanity area off the bedroom. The bed was extremely comfy and the a/c worked like a dream. I also loved having a ceiling fan over the bed just like at home. I had a few minor complaints, mostly to do with the kitchen area. It would be nice if the hotel at least included dish soap and paper towels. Soap for the dishwasher is provided. The cleaning staff would run the dishwasher every day even if the only items in it were a couple of plates and a glass. This seems wasteful. I agree with a previous reviewer that an icemaker would be nice but I just filled up the bin from the ice machine down the hall and that worked just fine. The one thing that bothered me most, however, was the lack of decent sized trash cans in the room. If a kitchenette is provided then it's assumed guests will be cooking. A trash can bigger than 12 inches would be nice. The location of this hotel is convenient, right off the interstate and within short distance of many restaurants. I did not partake of the free breakfast and dinner. The front desk staff were extremely friendly, especially the younger guy who worked evenings.

The kitchens in Homewoods are usually well-equipped, but this one had a very limited kitchen. There was no skillet and only one very small microwave pan. There were no pots that could be used on the stove. No kitchen soap. No ice maker in the frig. Another place where some changes could be made are in the pool/hot tub area. The Homewood has a very nice pool area, but we never made use of it because the hot tub was always full of little children. At one point they had three plastic chairs floating in it.

We booked the Homewood Suites because I knew it was like an apartment with a separate bedroom and sitting room plus a full kitchen because I knew we wouldn't be able to eat out after the surgery. But we ended up not needing the kitchen because this hotel provided COMPLIMENTARY breakfast AND dinner (called the manager's reception which is only Mon-Fri). I can't tell you how great it was just to go downstairs to fix a plate for my son while my husband watched over him. And the food was GREAT! For breakfast....name something, they had it. (Try the blueberry scones!) Dinner that night was lasagna, garlic bread and veggies. Salad had plenty of extras and a variety of dressings. They had fresh lemonade....and free beer and wine. It was incredible. What a value! The cost of the room is what you'd pay for any decent hotel with complimentary breakfast so to get two really decent meals and very nice rooms with great beds....well you're not going to get better than this. My husband travels alot for business and has a bad back...so is extremely picky. He was very happy with this hotel. The couch and chair in the sitting room isn't the greatest but the beds are very good, high quality. The rest of the furnishings are beautiful....bathroom is huge, water is hot, lighting and internet are great. A/C runs quiet. Every member of the staff we ran into were friendly and helpful. We especially appreciated the front desk letting us check in early....we had just flown in and were tired. The drive to the airport from this hotel is not bad either because the hotel is right off the freeway exit. Of course you'd never know it while you're inside the hotel because it's so quiet. There was construction going on on 465 S so it slowed us down so it took us about 1/2 hour. But I wouldn't do the drive in rush hour. When we left the hospital to go to the Homewood Suites (which is just a couple miles away from it) it was 5 pm and the traffic was horrendous on that freeway. Also you are across the parking lot from Cracker Barrel which always has great food. Considering the stress of the trip (worrying about my son and his pain), this was a GREAT experience. It was as close you could be to being home....a really nice home!", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat Indy Stopover - Lots of Room and Great Service\u201d", "Author": "Travel_Reviewer20", "ReviewID": "UR36369165", "Content": "Traveling through Indiana, and had a morning flight out of IND, so picked this particular property to stay the night. It was - while not really close to the airport - on the way to the airport, and based on the hotel's website, only about 15 - 20 minutes away, all freeway. Plus the midweek rate was pretty good - $98, and that includes breakfast and dinner (only M - Th for dinner). The hotel itself was in pretty good condition - it's right on the corner of the beltway (465) and another busy street, but it was behind another hotel property and the Cracker Barrel next door, so it seemed relatively quiet. Definitely no noise issues. It seemed fairly new, not sure when it was built, but the rooms, hallways, common areas, etc. showed no signs of wear, and things were kept relatively clean throughout the property. One exception was the dining area - it wasn't \"dirty\" per se, but could have used a bit more attention during the busy eating times - dinner and breakfast. I think they keep it staffed fairly tightly - one or two people running it all, and they did a fantastic job at keeping the food and drink areas well stocked, rotated, and replenished. The table cleanliness is just a nit, didn't detract from the mealtime at all. The breakfast spread was great - plenty of hot and cold items, much much more than typical continental type breakfast spreads. Also nice is the \"manager's reception\" on M - Th evenings - it's really dinner, but they just have one choice...it's not a buffet. The night I was there, they had hot dogs, macaroni/cheese, and salad, plus free wine/beer if you want. Limited selection notwithstanding, it's a really nice feature - especially if you ever travel with a family. The room was great - typical to Homewood Suites properties, had the bedroom, bathroom, living area, and kitchen with oven, full refrigerator, sink, etc. That's really nice if you are staying for one night or a long time. You can get food at the grocery store, and store it for cooking later. That was really nice, and they have a dishwasher to use, plus the plates and silverware you would need. That's also a great feature. They have the standard hotel fitness center and pool/hot tub areas. The fitness center was pretty small - one treadmill, one bike, one stairstepper, and some free weights. The indoor pool/hot tub area was pretty big - a lot of seating area. Maybe could have made the fitness room a bit bigger, but it definitely served its purpose. I didn't use the business center, but it was the standard one, looked like it had everything you'd need. Something nice was that the hotel had free internet - it's good to see that all properties are moving this way; it used to be just the Hampton Inns that had the free internet, now it seems like most Hilton properties do. The area surrounding the hotel was ok - fairly busy, but consequently there were a ton of restaurants, shopping, grocery, Walgreen's, etc. So I would rate the location as decent for that reason. I'll definitely be back if in the area under similar circumstances (flying out of IND), or if I have meetings in the city. The rate was the clincher - better than most other properties of similar size.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cHigh end experience for great value\u201d", "Author": "MickyDay", "ReviewID": "UR29965239", "Content": "Stayed here with 3 friends.
