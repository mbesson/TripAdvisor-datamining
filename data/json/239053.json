I discovered the \u201cHostal Buenos Aires\u201d by chance thanks to Best Western hotel Arosa, where I had originally reserved four days in June 2011. Thanks to a long travel experience, when I arrived to Hotel Arosa on Monday June 13, 2011, I asked to see the room before opening my skinny wallet, as I do everywhere except in well known palaces, where I never go... And I was right once more because I ran away as soon as I opened the door of the closet for which I would have paid over $100 a day without breakfast, and which was supposed to be \u201cthe best single room in the hotel\u201d! I had taken the precaution to send a letter explaining that I was going to celebrate my birthday in Madrid and that I would hate to spend ten days in a London style closet, but apparently that was totally useless! If I had dealt with a fish eater employee who would have upgraded me to a double room, I would have spent four of my ten days in Spain in that hotel. But, apparently, the guy at the front desk was not clever enough to do so for free and he preferred to see me walk away. Since the cancellation policy was an honest 4 pm on the day of arrival and it was only one pm, I immediately called Best Western's toll free number in Spain (900 99 39 00) and canceled my reservation. If I had reserved in one of those indelicate places where they want you to cancel one or even two days before arrival (which I always refuse because every time one of my flights has been canceled it has always happened at the very last minute, never two days before departure!), I would have lost my money. Fortunately, a long experience makes me travel light with only a carry on and a briefcase housing my electronics, except when I go to France because of the gifts for my sons. So I didn\u2019t hesitate to walk down the Gran Via towards Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, where I knew there were many \u201cHostales\u201d from my previous trips to Madrid since 1963. A Spanish \u201cHostal\u201d is half way between a \u201cbed and breakfast\u201d and a real hotel. Very often the only difference is that a hotel occupies the whole building, while the \u201chostal\u201d only occupies one part of it: usually one or two floors, sometimes only half of one floor. But most of them have rooms with a private bath, although they rarely serve breakfast. This is the case of \u201cHostal Buenos Aires\u201d, on Gran Via 61, two short blocks from Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, where you may take the subway to go to Barajas international airport for a couple of Euros if you buy a card good for ten trips during a calendar year for 10.30 \u20ac. I got air conditioned room 101 next to the reception (therefore, noisy every time a Cro-Magnon arrives at three in the morning screaming like Tarzan calling Chita\u2026) with a private marble bath of honest size for 40.50 \u20ac (around $60, far less than the $100 without breakfast at Arosa\u2019s closet!) I returned Friday and Saturday but I had to pay 50.50 \u20ac because hotels are more expensive in Madrid during the weekend, which is still excellent. This room has two army size beds that you can join or separate, as you wish, with a small desk but way too high because of the radiator underneath. So unless you can write standing, like the great Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, it won\u2019t do you any good except to lay your PDA and other small items. It has a door over the Gran Via that you can open and a narrow window towards Plaza de Espa\u00f1a. This is the only room with that extra window. Both have double glass to attenuate the noise, which works well enough for normal traffic clamor but not when a crowd of teenagers screamed at midnight while waiting in line to enter the \u201cMuseo del Jam\u00f3n\u201d across the street and have dinner. Yes, dinner at midnight, because in Madrid they don\u2019t serve lunch before 1 p.m. and I ate several times at 4 pm. I even had an excellent three course lunch at 5 pm (which is exceptional) the first day at \u201cEl Cellier\u201d on Plaza de Espa\u00f1a # 6 on the second floor, for only 9.50 \u20ac (less than $14) including a small bottle of drinkable wine! Dinner is therefore served very late! Unless you go to Mc Donald\u2019s a few blocks up, going to Plaza Callao on the other side of the street\u2026 There is also a Starbucks close to that fast food and another one two short blocks from the hostal, right across Plaza de Espa\u00f1a. Many restaurants offer a three course set menu for lunch between 9 and 12 Euros Monday to Friday, including half a bottle of wine, or a beer, or a Coke. The cheapest I found was a Cuban restaurant called \u201cCuando sal\u00ed de Cuba\u201d on Calle de la Ternera number 4, a couple of blocks from Plaza Callao, going down to Plaza Santo Domingo on pedestrian Calle Preciados, half way on your left. I had a 3 course honorable Cuban lunch with wine for only 8 \u20ac. Yes, eight Euros, which is around $12 US as of June 2011 with wine and dessert. Since this hotel is centrally located, you may walk everywhere: to Plaza Callao, just a few blocks away, to the Palacio Real, also a few blocks away in another direction, etc. I walked all the way from train station Atocha along the Prado, then the Gran Via back to the hotel. Another day, I walked from Parque del Retiro back to \u201cHostal Buenos Aires\u201d. And don\u2019t miss the Egyptian TEMPLO DE DEBOD, a few blocks from this hotel behind Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, in a park from which you will have a nice view of the Palacio Real and the Casa de Campo. Although going to Madrid since 1963, I discovered this in 2011. When I left Spain ten days later, I checked out of \u201cHostal Buenos Aires\u201d at 6 a.m., took the subway line 10 at Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, changed at \u201cNuevos Ministerios\u201d where I took line 8 to the airport and 45 minutes after I left my hotel I was at Barajas International. In short, with its INDIVIDUAL AIR CONDITIONED rooms with private bath, this is an outstanding value for money in Madrid, where I saw several places charging fifty Euros (sixty during the weekend) for a closet without private bathroom and without AC! efrin_knight@yahoo.fr", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cOUTSTANDING VALUE FOR MONEY\u201d", "Author": "Efrin_Knight", "ReviewID": "UR116658718", "Content": "If you are looking for an AIR CONDITIONED room of decent size overlooking the \u201cGran V\u00eda\u201d in Madrid for less than fifty Euros, seek no more: this is the place!
